some states of the federation which the party seems to be ignoring which if not resolved may torpedo its ambition to retain power at the centre in the next elections\n\nALL is not well in the All Progressives Congress, APC. The party which presides over the affairs of Nigeria appears to be sitting atop of gunpowder waiting for explosion if care is not taken. Already, there are indications that the APC leaders cannot speak with one voice, while the recent conventions held in some states have also shown that the party may be heading for serious crisis.\n\nFormer Vice-President Atiku Abubakar on Tuesday, August 1, gave a hint of what may tear the party into shreds when he rebuked the APC, the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and other parties for the lack of internal democracy. Abubakar accused the parties of refusing over the years to hold meetings of their vital organs and those meant for the selection of the leadership of the parties.\n\nAt the second annual conference of the Inter-party Advisory Council with the theme, \"Inter Party Democracy: A Recipe for Sustainable Democracy in Nigeria\" in Abuja, on Tuesday, he said: \"A political party that constricts the freedom of its members cannot really offer freedom to the citizens of the nation. Democracy is not just an idea; it is a cultural practice.\n\n\"For a number of years now, we have had political parties, even governing ones, which hardly hold meetings of their important organs, including those meant for the democratic selection of their leadership, or even constitute institutions prescribed in their constitution. In the absence of those meetings and elections, their existing leadership, often under the direction of the executive at the state or federal level, fills the void. That's not party building but party bullying. And it's certainly not a way to democratise parties and aggregate their members' opinions, interests and aspirations.\"\n\nAbubakar's message was no doubt a subtle indictment on the APC which has so far failed to hold its convention since coming to office in 2015. In fact, the issue of the party convention now looks contentious. There appears to be no agreement on when it would hold.\n\nRecently, two APC governors disagreed publicly on what is causing the delay in holding the party convention. Contrary to the position of Governor Abdulhaziz Yari of Zamfara State, who is the chairman of Nigeria's Governor's Forum, NGF, Governor Rochas Okorocha of Imo State, who is also the chairman of APC governors forum, has said that the delay in holding the APC national convention has nothing to do with the absence of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nYari had earlier told journalists in a joint press conference with Bolaji Abdullahi, the APC spokesman, on Wednesday, July 19, that the absence of President Buhari had stalled the organising of the convention. Yari was quoted as saying: \"We have been on this matter of convention but you know that the president is the leader of this party. One, before getting to the convention, there is some kind of process, the National Working Committee, NWC, must agree on the time and at the same time we have to adopt what the report submitted by the National Working Committee to the larger NEC members which the president must be in attendance as a leader of the party and you know the situation of our president.\"\n\nHowever, responding to questions by journalists after the APC governor's forum meeting with the Acting President on Thursday, July 20, Okorocha said: \"The convention not taking place has nothing to do with the absence of the president or the acting president.\n\n\"We are just putting our house in order and making sure things are in the right form before we kick off.\n\n\"We discussed a lot of issues on how to move the party forward, how to strengthen the party and how to make sure our party remains victorious in all elections. Very soon we will have a convention. That is part of the things we are discussing,\" Okorocha said.\n\nThe APC bi-annual convention earlier scheduled for April was postponed indefinitely while state congress took place on July 29, across the 36 states of the federation.\n\nThe state congress was, indeed, a revelation as crisis erupted among the party faithful. It, perhaps, accentuated the problems within the party and showed how deep-rooted the party crisis is real is.\n\nIn the Kano State branch of the party, the major problem there was caused by the political rivalry and muscle flexing between Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, incumbent governor and Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, his erstwhile godfather and predecessor. Both Ganduje and Kwankwaso, now a senator, have been on at each others' jugular almost since the inception of the current administration in the state.\n\nThe crisis is taking its toll on governance as almost all the policies and projects of the previous administration have been abandoned apparently in the attempt to erase the footprints of two-term government of Kwankwaso from the state's political landscape. Besides, the two are creating tense atmosphere in the state preparatory to the 2019 general elections, when the two giants are expected to slug it out for the control of the soul of Kano State.\n\nThe Saturday, July 29, nationwide mini congress of the APC provided an opportunity for the two feuding politicians to demonstrate their strength in their determination not only to control the soul of the party in Kano but also to exhibit their influences within and outside the state. After the congress, Abdullahi Abbas was declared as the chairman of the party to ignite fresh tussle between the Ganduje and Kwankwaso camps. Abbas, a former political adviser and strong associate of Ganduje, was returned unopposed along 14 others as new party leadership at a the delegates congress held at the Indoor Sports Hall of Sani Abacha Stadium.\n\nWith the election, Ganduje probably thought that he had successfully taken full possession of the entire party structure and control of the APC machinery in Kano. Besides, shortly before the election, the congress unanimously passed a vote of no confidence on the Kwankwaso's party structure under the leadership of Umar Haruna Doguwa after which a motion was moved for its impeachment. The congress removed Kwankwaso's loyalists through voice vote paving way for Ganduje's associates. Expectedly, members of the Kwankwasiyya movement, an umbrella of Kwankwaso's supporters and loyalists, were conspicuously absent at the congress, an indication that they had boycotted the event.\n\nBut Mohammad Nadu Yahaya, chairman of the congress screening committee, claimed his committee had opened ample and equal opportunities to all the APC members in the state to contest the 15 vacant posts. He denied insinuation that the aspirants who contested and were returned unopposed were agents of a particular camp who were imposed by the state machinery.\n\nSimilarly Nwafor Orizu, leader of the APC supervisory delegates from the National Headquarters, told journalists that the congress was specifically designed to fill the vacant seats in the state following the demise of some executive members. On why the Kwankwasiyya group shunned the congress, Abdulsalam Aminu, a leader of the movement, insisted that the congress was illegal and unconstitutional and that the whole process was done in error.\n\nAccording to Aminu, Umar Haruna Doguwa-led leadership remains the only recognised and duly constituted APC leadership in Kano.\n\nIn his words, he asked: \"For your information, Umar Haruna Doguwa is the party chairman in Kano and duly so at the APC headquarters. Let me draw your attention to what happened recently, the acting president of Nigeria Professor Yemi Osibajo invited all APC Chairmen in Nigeria for a meeting at the Aso Rock. It was Umar Haruna Doguwa that represented Kano APC. He was duly recognised and accorded all the respect and honour on behalf of Kano. What else do they want?\"\n\nAmid the controversy, the NWC of the APC issued a statement denying recognition of the newly constituted APC leadership in Kano State in apparent disregard for the position of Ganduje.\n\nIn a statement signed by Bolaji Abdullahi, the party's national publicity secretary, the NWC insisted that the Umar Haruna Doguwa leadership remained the recognised and authentic one for Kano State. The statement said: \"The attention of the National Working Committee, NWC, of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has been drawn to some media reports that the Chairman of Kano State APC chapter, Umar Haruna Doguwa has been removed from office. We wish to state that in respect of Kano, no such decision has been taken by the NWC.\n\n\"Although, we are aware of issues in the Kano State chapter, efforts to find lasting solutions to the problem are ongoing. In view of this, the status quo is maintained until the ongoing process is completed. Party members, stakeholders, leaders and indeed the general public are advised to disregard the false reports.\"\n\nFollowing the rejection of his loyalists, Ganduje reportedly rushed to Abuja, to verify and authenticate what prompted the NWC to issue such counter statement that debunked the new party structure.\n\nWhile the intervention of the NWC appeared to be on the side of Kwankwaso and his loyalists, political analysts are of the view that the development could have wider implications for the party in Kano State.\n\nThe lingering crisis in the Kaduna chapter of APC took a different dimension on Sunday, July 30, when Othman Suleiman Hunkuyi, a senator and Shehu Sani, also a senator, and other prominent members of the party narrowly escaped being lynched by armed thugs who invaded the secretariat of the Nigerian Union of Journalists, NUJ, in Kaduna. But, a cameraman with Liberty Radio and TV station, a private station, who was not so lucky, sustained serious injured while the camera was destroyed.\n\nSani, Hunkuyi and other top members of the APC faction in the state were at the NUJ Press Centre to address a press conference on the outcome of the recent election of delegates to the APC National Convention when hundreds of armed thugs alleged to be loyal to Uba Sani, special adviser to Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State, on Politics, invaded the premises and unleashed terror on the politicians and journalists.\n\nThe press conference was being addressed by APC Akida, led by Hunkuyi, who represents Kaduna North senatorial district and Sani, representing Kaduna Central Senatorial District, as well as some serving members of House of Representatives.\n\nHunkuyi, who addressed the conference, alleged that the there was no election of delegates to the National Convention of the APC, adding that the names of those who emerged as delegates were written by an official of the state government. \"The list of the delegates was not known to us. The list was fake, so we wrote two petitions to the National Secretariat of the APC and the zonal office to buttress our grievances. We hope the national body would look into our complaints and fix another date.\"\n\nBefore the press conference by Hunkuyi and his group, the leadership of the party had also addressed journalists at its secretariat, insisting that the delegate elections followed due process and that it was free, credible and fair.\n\nBut Salisu Tanko Wusono, the state publicity secretary of the party, said the delegate election was attended by all the party officials from ward level to the state level. He said five officials from the national secretariat of the APC were on hand to supervise the state election, arguing that \"we acted within the party's guidelines as no party member was sidelined.\"\n\nHowever, in a swift reaction, Governor el-Rufai condemned the mob action and promised that nobody would be allowed to stifle freedom of expression in the state. He also directed that security agencies should investigate and take necessary action against the hoodlums.\n\nNevertheless, the crisis in Kaduna State has been largely seen as a tussle for the control of the soul of the party and the state. As it is no longer news that both the governor and Sani have been acting like cat and mouse since the beginning of the el-Rufai administration in the state. The rivalry between them has polarised the APC in the state. Analysts believe the face-off between the two APC chieftains is a fall out of the crisis engendered by the 2015 governorship primary. Both El-Rufai and Sani had governorship ambitions, but Sani was pressurised to step down for the incumbent governor against his will. Since el-Rufai took over the reins of power, Sani has been critical of his administration despite the fact that both of them belong to the same party. Pundits say the crisis has to do with ego.\n\nBesides, analysts believed the current crisis was being fuelled by the winners take-it all policy of el-Rufai. For instance, the governor was alleged to have considered only members of his group for political appointments. They said even party offices that became vacant as a result of political appointments were arbitrarily filled by the governor without conducting election as required by the APC constitution. Other stakeholders sidelined are also crying for justice for peace to reign.\n\nSani confirmed the genesis of the crisis. He said: \"I never intended to contest for the Senate; I wanted to contest for the governorship and I opened offices in Zaria, Kaduna and Kafanchan, and later there was pressure on me that I should step down. Politicians came to meet me that I should step down and allow el-Rufai to contest, because they said he was the favourite of the president.\n\n\"I pulled back and said I wanted to contest for the Senate, but there was a sitting senator, General Saleh and I had to evict him during the primary election. I told them in black and white that I didn't have money to give any delegate, and if they feel okay with my principles, then let them vote for me, but if my principles are not right for them, let them go and vote for the same person that was occupying the seat. They voted for me and I removed an incumbent senator. So, I didn't contest against a vacuum.\"\n\nThe crisis reached a crescendo when Sani was suspended from the APC in January 2016 by his Tudun Wada ward constituency. The ward executive said it took the action to suspend the senator because he had made statements that allegedly violate the rules of engagement of the party, factionalised the party, and allegedly engaged in anti-party activities by criticising openly the policies of Governor el-Rufai.\n\nAt a point, the APC national secretariat intervened when it quashed the earlier suspension slammed on Sani.\n\nIsa Ibrahim, a party stalwart, said a lot of people were not happy with the governor because of his failure to carry everybody along in the governance of the state. He said: \"The crisis in Kaduna APC is larger than what you can see; it goes beyond el-Rufai and Sani. The truth is that a lot of people are not happy with the governor.\n\n\"The way forward for us in Kaduna APC is reconciliation. What is happening now is not a war but a campaign of violence. It has been difficult to bring the two leaders together for reconciliation because the leadership of the party is being controlled by the governor. But, the stakeholders have drawn the attention of the party leadership to the inherent danger it portends towards 2019. It is time to put our house in order. Those who can call the governor and the senator to order should do it now.\"\n\nAnalysts believed the leadership of the APC at the national level must step in immediately to save the party from a major catastrophe in 2019. They also advised both el-Rufai and Sani to shed the toga of arrogance and impunity by engaging in the rule of the game as outlined in the APC constitution for peace to reign in the party.\n\nThe same could not be said about Kogi State where Governor Yahaya Bello and the state executive of the party, including some senators and other stakeholders have been on war path over the control of the party.\n\nThe crisis rocking the state chapter of the ruling APC took another dimension even as the NWC has jettisoned the recommendations of the Tony Momoh-led committee earlier set up to resolve the crisis. The reconciliation committee set up by the APC national chairman to resolve the crisis had, while submitting its reports, blamed the NWC and skewed political appointments among others as reasons why the crisis degenerated.\n\nIt was gathered that the NWC , at its last meeting on Tuesday, August 8, to deliberate on the report of the Tony Momoh-led fact-finding committee decided to set up another six-man panel to further explore avenues for reconciliation in the simmering conflict in its Kogi State chapter.\n\nIn the meantime, the 300 pages of materials for documentation submitted to John Odigie-Oyegun, national chairman of the APC, by Momoh recommended a win-win for the aggrieved parties in Kogi State APC.\n\nMomoh said: \"APC national headquarters' complicity, all these were areas we broke all the issues into and we discussed them comprehensively and made the recommendations. We met the National Assembly caucus led by Dino Melaye, we met the state assembly, all the members of state assembly and the speaker. We met a state executive committee of the party. We met the Faleke group. We met the governor and his team. Actually, we met with the governor for about three times because the bulk really stops on the governor's desk.\n\n\"Everybody accepts that Yes, he is our governor and chief executive of the state but look at the problems. And we had lots of people coming to testify to what they've said the governor had done and lots of others who are supporters of the governor coming to testify about the good things governor had done.\n\n\"So, we came to the conclusion that the problem in Kogi State is absence of communication, missed communication or even inadequate communication and there was total breakdown of communication.\"\n\nBut whether the proposed reconciliation will be allowed to happen by not allowing the already frail nerves to break is left to be seen, especially with recall hanging on Dino Melaye, a powerful senator from the state.\n\nIn Ekiti State, Opeyemi Bamidele, a chieftain of the APC and governorship aspirant in the state, assured that the crisis in the state's chapter of the party would be resolved to afford the party opportunity of approaching the 2018 governorship election with a well-fortified and united front.\n\nContrary to insinuation that the large number of aspirants may cause rancour in the APC and dim the party's chances, Bamidele viewed the situation as a blessing than a clog depending on how the primary is managed by the NWC.\n\nAddressing journalists in Ado Ekiti, state capital, on Monday, July 31, after being invested as the patron of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria, PSN, Ekiti chapter, Bamidele said the APC's primary won't be won on the basis of emotions but on the antecedents and capabilities of all contestants.\n\nThe situation in Lagos State is a bit different. Scores of leaders and members of the APC in Mushin Local Government and Odi Olowo Local Council Development Area, LCDA, simply took to the streets of Lagos, on Tuesday, July 18, demanding the expulsion of Muiz Banire, SAN, the party's national legal adviser, from the party over series of anti-party activities and embezzlement of campaign funds.\n\nThe protesters led by Femi Martins, a chieftain of the party in the area, said they were constrained to make the demand owing to Banire's several excesses and public utterances which were aimed at causing public disaffection and electoral misfortune against the party, particularly during the then forthcoming local government election in the state.\n\nReading from a protest letter addressed to Governor Akinwunmi Ambode and copied Mudashiru Obasa, speaker of Lagos State House of Assembly, and Henry Ajomale, APC chairman in Lagos, for onward transmission to the national headquarters of APC, Martins said as custodian of the party's constitution, Banire was well aware of the party's provisions for direct, indirect and consensus primaries, but he had played to the gallery and publicly accused the party of imposition without exhausting the internal mechanisms already available within the party.\n\nBanire denied all the allegations and threatened to sue his accusers for defamation of character. In any case, the NWC, in its reaction, said Banire should remain in his post.\n\nThe decision, would no doubt anger Banire's opponents in party which, again, has shown that all is not well.\n\nNevertheless, the APC is also having crisis of confidence in states such as Rivers, Ebonyi, Edo and Enugu.\n\nIn Rivers State, the crisis in the state was said to have been caused by the governorship ambition of Magnus Abe, the senator representing Rivers South East, but opposed by Chibuike Amaechi, minister of transportation and former governor of Rivers State. Party officials alleged that Abe had wanted Amaechi to anoint or support him as the next APC governorship candidate in the state for 2019, but when that did not materialise, he resorted to character assassination of the minister whom, according to them, by his judgement, was opposed to his ambition.\n\nAlthough the rumour making the rounds blamed the rift between both men for the crisis in the state's party, Davies Ibiamu Ikanya, chairman, APC, Rivers State, however, debunked any such claim, saying there was no crisis at all in the party.\n\nWhether true or false, as the saying goes: 'there is no smoke without fire.' In any case, the\n\nstories from the state and many other states seem to suggest that the APC is heading towards a lot of crisis. Factionalisation, realignment of political interests and power struggles have continued to manifest in various states.\n\nThis, apparently, has prompted some analysts to warn the party not to allow things to degenerate. Ben Nnadozie Nnaedozie, a political analyst, said in an interview: \"The APC chairman, Chief John Oyegun, and all the party leaders should not allow the trust Nigerians reposed in them to be taken for granted by unscrupulous elements, and overnight progressives, now threatening to turn party politics on its head.\"\n\nOlusegun Osoba, former governor of Ogun State, on his part, warned the leadership of the APC, especially in the South West that the results of the Ekiti and Osun states elections in 2018, would determine the outcome of the elections in Ogun and Oyo states in 2019.\n\nHe also warned the party not to underestimate the threat of the Governor Ayodele Fayose of Ekiti State, who had vowed that the PDP would trounce the APC in the governorship election holding next year. Osoba, who noted divisions among members of the party, advised them to work in unison and jettison their differences in order to win the coming elections.\n\nBesides, the former governor said that the APC needed to embrace internal democracy and shun all manner of imposition to strengthen its chances in the coming elections. Osoba said some ex-governors that installed 'anointed candidates' became sworn enemies with them months after. \"Don't let us underestimate Fayose. You must fight him. We cannot afford to play with Osun either. Those two states are important. If we can do clear primaries in these two states and APC wins, then whatever happen in Ekiti and Osun must happen in Oyo and Ogun when it gets to our turn to deliver.\n\n\"As a party, we have not zoned the governorship seat. There was nothing like zoning of offices in the past. We give opportunity to anyone to aspire, but we have always used maturity to settle it among us. That is unwritten, it is a convention. It is not the rule and nobody will go against the agreement,\" he said.\n\nJoe Igbokwe, the APC spokesperson in Lagos, however, said in an interview that the complaints by Abubakar and others about lack of internal democracy showed that Odigie-Oyegun and his executive have a lot of work to do and that they should sit up. He said the party would not allow the crisis to explode and disintegrate the party members like what happened in the PDP.\n\nGood talk. But whether the party leaders would be able to mend their fences early enough to avoid the PDP mistakes is a matter of conjectures.", "timeCrawl": "12:24:00", "sim": 0.7843137383460999, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 679, "date": "2017-08-01", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 687}, {"textStart": 2824, "date": "2017-07-19", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2831}, {"textStart": 3541, "date": "2017-07-20", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 3548}, {"imp": true, "freq": 2, "amb": false, "textEnd": 4168, "date": "2017-07-29", "textStart": 4161}, {"textStart": 9517, "date": "2017-07-30", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 9524}, {"textStart": 16554, "date": "2017-08-08", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 16562}, {"textStart": 18808, "date": "2017-07-31", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 18815}, {"textStart": 19263, "date": "2017-07-18", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 19270}, {"date": "2016-01-", "textStart": 14239, "amb": false, "textEnd": 14251}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8611794", "categories": [], "details": {}}

Amori had at various times served as Commissioner for Education and Water Resources in Delta State, among other positions. In this interview, he says the All Progressives Congress (APC) led Federal Government has failed woefully and advises Nigerians to be wise in choosing who leads them come 2019. He also speaks on the politics of his state and defections from the PDP, among other issues.\n\nWhat is your assessment of the state of the nation?\n\nThe nation can be said to be sitting on a keg of gunpowder, waiting to explode. Presently, the nation has a President whose true health condition is being covered up by an alleged cabal controlling the affairs of government. A hungry man they say is an angry man. Majority of Nigerians are hungry and experiencing abject poverty with its attendant consequences. Lawlessness is becoming the order of the day with the All Progressives Congress (APC) led Federal Government not accepting responsibility for the security of lives and property of Nigerians.\n\nThe country as it is today lacks cohesion because of the kind of leadership being given by the APC at the centre. The APC must realise that campaigns are over and should therefore focus on delivering its electioneering promises to Nigerians. What is very disturbing to most Nigerians is that the APC in just two years in office has destroyed the democratic gains of successive PDP administrations.\n\nIf Nigeria should be great again, there has to be true federalism. A situation where few states feed majority of the states that make up the federation called Nigeria would continue to see the country going backward. Most states are not tapping their potentials because of dependence on nation's crude oil earnings.\n\nAre you suggesting that APC has failed Nigerians within two years in office?\n\nTwo years into the APC-led administration, no Nigerian except those outside the shores of the country needs a soothsayer to tell him or her that the administration has failed woefully. Even an unborn child in the mother's womb feels the hardship brought upon Nigerians by the APC government. What the government has resorted to in the past two years is propaganda and blaming the past administration. But they fail to realise that Nigerians are now wiser to tell the difference between a succeeding government and a failing one.\n\nThe situation in the country has gone so bad economically that majority of Nigerians are begging the APC government to return the nation to the state it was before it took over in 2015. Celebrating two years anniversary, the administration cannot boast of any area it has impacted positively on Nigerians. It is so pathetic that one of the spokespersons of President Muhammadu Buhari recently mentioned the rehabilitation of the Abuja Airport runaway, which gets flooded whenever it rains as one of the achievements of the APC-led Federal Government.\n\nToday, the exchange rate of the naira to the dollar, pound and other foreign currencies is outrageously high with the resultant high cost of imported goods and services. Thousands of Nigerians particularly in the private sector have lost their jobs due largely to the retrogressive economic policies of the APC administration. Daily, the costs of even farm produce are on the increase and the government is helpless. On security, we have had incessant and wanton killings and destruction of lives and property all over the country especially in Southern Kaduna and Benue State. The activities of Fulani herdsmen have also claimed many lives in Delta, Cross River and Akwa Ibom States.\n\nWhat about the anti-corruption fight of the administration, which many people say has been yielding fruits. Won't you at least give credit to the administration in that regard?\n\nI can only give credit to the anti-corruption crusade of the administration when the approach is holistic and not selective as it is now. In my assessment, the Buhari government is hiding under the guise of anti-corruption fight to witch-hunt top members of the opposition PDP to weaken the party from providing the needed opposition to check the excesses of the administration. The administration is quick to arrest and detain members of the PDP at the slightest allegation of fraud, while panels or committees are set up to carry out investigations whenever it involves APC members. In making objective assessment of the Buhari anti-corruption fight, it is important to ask how many convictions have the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) recorded in the last two years? Besides, the anti-corruption fight must be fought on all fronts of our national life to achieve the needed result. It will not succeed if it is targeted at perceived political enemies.\n\nIn spite of your misgivings about the APC-led government, many stalwarts of your party have defected to the ruling party in the last two years. How has that affected your party, especially in Delta State?\n\nDelta State is a peculiar PDP State. It is a state where the past governors, their deputies and the incumbent governor and his deputy are all still in the party. The defection of PDP members to APC has been very minimal and insignificant. It is interesting to note that in the last few months some people who defected to the APC have staged a comeback to the PDP. The return of the second civilian governor of the State, Chief James Ibori, has further consolidated the strength of the party in the state.\n\nPresently, the opposition APC in Delta State is voiceless. The party is only known on Facebook and other social media platforms. What is a party without followers? The Delta PDP particularly in Delta Central meets at least every month from one local government area to another. The APC cannot boast of having a gathering of its members at the local government level in Delta State in the past two years. The key players in the APC in the state are former members of PDP who with time will return to the party following ongoing reconciliation efforts by the leadership of the party in the state. At the national level, most of the people defecting from PDP to APC were original members of PDP and are doing so for political patronage or fear of being persecuted.\n\nHow would you assess governance in your state under Governor Ifeanyi Okowa in the last two years?\n\nFirst, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa has over these past two years stabilised the economy of Delta State considering the debt profile of the state when he took over in 2015. At a point, it was almost impossible to pay the salaries of the state's workers. But through prudent management of the state's resources, no worker in the state is being owed salary as we speak.\n\nOkowa's policy of not embarking on a project except when the fund is available to complete it has ensured that projects started by his administration are completed in record time. On infrastructural development, the Governor deserves kudos in roads construction across the state. In the last two years, the administration has awarded 98 roads out of which 20 have been commissioned while about 25 of the roads would be inaugurated soon. The other 53 roads are ongoing at various stages with some at the completion level.\n\nDespite not being able to employ qualified Deltans into the State Civil Service, the Okowa administration has done well in the area of youth empowerment programmes especially through agriculture. The administration has in the last two years through its Youth Agricultural Entrepreneurs Programme (YAGEP) and Skills Training and Entrepreneurship Programme (STEP) trained and equipped over 4,000 youths. In the area of political appointments, the Governor has kept his promise to the three senatorial districts of the state in terms of ensuring even distribution of appointments. He is really a man that keeps to his promise.\n\nFinally, what is your advice to the Federal Government and also Nigerians as a whole towards addressing the current challenges facing the country?\n\nTwo years ago most Nigerians did not appreciate the PDP government at the centre. Today, the difference is clear. I am sure Nigerians have truly experienced the \"change\" they voted for and come 2019, they will be wiser to vote wisely. Meanwhile, beyond party politics, the APC-led government should face squarely the governance of the country. Both the rich and poor are feeling the hardship brought by the administration. They must act fast before the country drifts into anarchy that may warrant another military incursion into the leadership of the nation. This will not portend well for the progress that has been recorded since 1999, when the nation's nascent democracy came into being. Let us not easily forget the words of Obafemi Awolowo in 1983 that, \"the worst civilian rule is better than the best military dictatorship.\"\n\nIt is worthy of mention here that come 2019 when Nigerians will go to the polls again to vote their candidates in the general elections, particularly for the presidential position, they should be very mindful of voting for persons with military background. Comparatively, it is clearly evident today that both the Olusegun Obasanjo civilian rule from 1999 to 2007 and the current one by Muhammadu Buhari have similarities especially in their dictatorial and draconian approaches to governance due largely to their military backgrounds. The administrations of Alhaji Umaru Musa Yar'Adua and Dr. Goodluck Jonathan were different, as remarkable progress was made in advancing the tenets of modern democracy in the country. Nigerians must not lose sight if this.", "timeCrawl": "01:49:00", "sim": 0.6745098233222961, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8861842", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "id": 276, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

the 2019 Presidential ticket in the leading political parties\n\nALTHOUGH 2010 Presidential Election is still about a year and three months away, aspirants for the plum job have commenced preliminary moves to secure their party tickets.\n\nIn the leading opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which is desperate to take power back from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), the preliminary contest has already pitched the party's governors and former ministers. Even the claim by some insiders that the ticket may have been zoned to the North is a source of disagreement as the stakeholders in the region are still struggling over which of the three geo-political zones should produce the candidate.\n\nAside the North, some aspirants from the South are also determined to vie for the ticket. Ekiti State Governor, Ayo Fayose, for example, has continuously made it clear that he is in the 2019 presidential race. Just this week, the governor served notice that he will formally declare his presidential ambition on 1st October.\n\nThe ruling party, APC, is not insulated from the early maneuvering for the plum seat in Abuja. Sources said the interest of some APC members for the position in 2019 may have been informed by the claim in certain quarters that President Muhammadu Buhari, who has been away to London for a prolonged medical treatment, may not seek re-election after the completion of his current term. Given such possibility, analysts have interpreted some moves in APC as calculated schemes to position some top politicians for the position of President or Vice-President if Buhari finally declines or is unable to seek re-election.\n\nActions and body languages of the other political parties also show that they are working towards either fielding candidates or entering into alliances with stronger parties in order to ensure the enthronement of a president they would want in 2019. Will PDP go east or west?\n\nWhile most PDP leaders seem to favour the idea of zoning the 2019 presidential ticket to the North, a strategy which they said will effectively compete with Buhari's candidacy, what is not yet generally accepted by the advocates seems to be whether it should be given to the North-East or North-West where Buhari comes from. Somehow, most of the advocates seem to agree, for now, that North-Central is out of the contest. It remains to be seen if this position will remain so until the conclusion of the party primary election.\n\nThe Nation's investigation shows that the primary reason for the argument to zone the plum office to the North is that it would be politically wise to allow the North to complete eight years uninterrupted tenure before any move to return it to the South. But even within the advocates of this political strategy, there is clear division within the PDP. While some contend that PDP would be more effective in the race if it picks its candidate from the North-West where Buhari comes from, a strategy that will help share the votes from the geo-political zone, others said a smarter move by the leading opposition party would be to pick its candidate from North-East, a northern zone they said has not been given the opportunity to produce Nigerian President. According to this school of thought, this choice will give PDP an edge over APC and other political parties because voters from North-East and indeed all over the country will see equity in the strategy. As Dr. Musa Ismaiya, an academic and political activist from the zone, puts it, \"some of us who are rooting for PDP 2019 presidential candidate from the North-East are of the view that it will afford the North double opportunity: opportunity to conclude the second tenure before going back to the South and opportunity to allow North-East to also produce Nigerian president like the other zones in the North.\" The members advocating for North-West however disagree but insist that only a candidate from the North-West will effectively clip the influence of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the geo-political zone today. Ishiaku Muhamad, a youth leader, who spoke to The Nation in Lagos, explained what he described as the 'only strategy that will bring about the desired change.' According to him, \"PDP's best bet is to elect its presidential candidate from the same geo-political zone as the ruling APC. If President Buhari flies the flag of APC in 2019, PDP's reasonable strategy would be to elect a candidate from the same zone and share the votes. For me, if Buhari recontests in 2019, the only zone he would hope to get a sympathy block vote may be his North-West. It is the only zone that may still vote on sympathy basis because so much has happened since 2015, when the mere song of change moved the electorates. Today, every other zone will cast their votes based on the acceptability of the candidate and the party. So, PDP would be wise to move in and share North-West zone's vote.\"\n\nInsiders told The Nation that they expect this matter would be resolved this year's November at the party's National Convention. Muhamad confirmed this, adding, \"Stakeholders are anxious and waiting for the resolution at the convention. As soon as the matter is resolved, some aspirants, who have not come out to declare interest will come out and the game will become much more focused and interesting.\" But even before the convention, powerful forces within the party are already arm-twisting each other in a bid to pave way for some preferred aspirants. The Nation had earlier reported the power game between some PDP governors and former ministers on the platform of the party. The governors had asked the party leadership to disband the activities of the former Ministers Forum, describing it as \"illegal and extraneous to PDP Constitution.\" We reported that the Former Ministers Forum is not intimidated by the governors as the members have sworn to 'battle' the governors, some of who they accused of eying Vice-Presidential tickets to their preferred aspirants in the North.\n\nThey reminded the governors that it was the ex-ministers that \"sustained the party in its darkest and challenging moment.\"\n\nTo confirm the depth of the rift and the danger it poses on PDP, a source in the forum had told The Nation in the earlier report that: \"We know that some of these governors who want Vice Presidential ticket in 2019 are trying to influence Makarfi's Caretaker Committee to ignore or disband the Forum.\n\n\"We are aware that one of the governors from the South-South has already initiated talks with a serving APC governor to serve as a running mate during the 2019 poll.\n\n\"The party can ignore our Forum at its own peril. Like gamblers, some of these governors were shuttling between Makarfi and Senator Ali Modu Sheriff when our party was in crisis. But this Forum was consistent and it did its best to give strong support to Makarfi. Now, the ambitious governors do not see anything good in the Forum. We are ready for a long drawn battle with them.\"\n\nThe APC' tricky scenario In the APC, the scenario is much more complex as many of the insiders who confided to The Nation said a lot will depend on President Muhammadu Buhari's disposition to the offer in 2019. Since it became known that the president has some health challenges, there has been wild speculation that he may not be able to recontest for the office in 2019. This conjecture has given rise to the allegation that some APC chieftains may have revived their political machinery so as not to be caught unaware if at the last minute Mr. President declines the offer of re-contesting for the office. As a result almost all the leading APC leaders, including leaders from the South, have been named in media reports as likely presidential aspirants in 2019. But there seems to be nothing on the ground to prove that some of the chieftains, especially the chieftains from the South-West, South-East and South-South, named are actually preparing for such positions. The Nation investigation during the week however show that most of the APC leaders in the South are determined to allow the North to serve out its second term before the office would be zoned to the South. According to a source, it seems that even if the president decides not to contest, he may back a candidate from the North. That may leave already named aspirants from the North, like Senate President Bukola Saraki; former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar; Alhaji Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, Nasir El'Rufai, amongst others.\n\nFactors that will likely play up\n\nGiven the high expectations at the inception of the current All Progressives Congress' government of change and the unfortunate economic down-turn that left many citizens miserable in the last two years, campaign for the 2019 Presidential Election is set to be largely issue driven. Most commentators have said electorates will only be interested in the candidate that will bring food on the table and stop the endless agitations and insecurity in the country instead of the traditional sentiments, like ethnicity, that have informed the voting pattern over the years. So, it seems some of the aspirants have realised the need to flag-off their campaigns by talking about issues that will interest today's Nigerians. For example, former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, whose presidential ambition has become common knowledge over the years, has taken up the campaign for restructuring as his take-off point. Considering the passion Nigerians have shown over this issue, especially after the Senate threw out a proposal on it, observers said it may turn out to be one of the major issues that will come to play in the campaign for the office of president in 2019.\n\nIt would be recalled that after the former Vice-President joined the campaign for restructuring of the country, describing it as the only way of resolving some of the major socio-political and economic difficulties of Nigeria, he was initially flayed by many.\n\nResponding to his critics at Nsukka, Enugu State, at a public lecture organised by the Senior Staff Club of the University of Nigeria (UNN), he said he will continue to support the restructuring of the country because the report of the 1995/96 Constitution Drafting Committee was not what was eventually released and foisted on the people of the country in 1999. He explained further that Nigerians accepted the constitution because \"they were desirous of returning the country to democracy, stressing that time has come to review the exercise because Nigeria is not working.\"\n\nHe also said a restructured polity will check the tension and agitations in the country.\n\nClosely linked to the issue of restructuring is issue of national conference or adoption of the last Confab conducted by the PDP government of Dr. Goodluck Jonathan. An insider said its adoption is likely to be one of the campaign promises of some PDP aspirants.\n\nBesides such issues that presently agitate average citizens, another factor that will help define the tone of 2019 presidential campaign will be the candidacy of President Muhammadu Buhari. The point, as Muhamad puts it, is, \"will Buhari contest or will he not? If he contests, it will not only determine the aspirants that will file out but also the texture of the campaigns itself both in APC and in the other political parties. Everyone knows that it is only the uncertainty over his candidacy that is withholding many likely aspirants, especially in APC. He is a major factor that will determine the other likely aspirants and the message that will trend during the campaigns,\" he said.\n\nLikely aspirants that may be thrown up\n\nAs the various political parties perfect their plans for the 2019 presidential race, some top politicians have been identified as likely to throw in their caps. However, while some of them have repeatedly confirmed that they are in the race, others have not, even though they command so much influence that analysts and observers link them to the race. They include but not limited to:\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari\n\nNotwithstanding his current health challenge, President Muhammadu Buhari, who is yet to complete his first term in office, is considered a likely candidate of APC for 2019 race.\n\nWhile some Nigerians have said the President may not contest for the office on account of ill-health, his loyalists and political associates have continued to say he will soon return home, return to his desk and contest in 2019.\n\nJust this Monday, August 7, 2019, there was a report that some of his supporters inaugurated what they described as the South-West office of Buhari Campaign Organisation in Ibadan.\n\nAt the reported inauguration new coordinators for the organisation in the South-West region were named. That same Monday, some Nigerians demonstrated against the president's prolonged absence in a simultaneous exercise that held in Abuja and London, accusing him of leaving the country in a state of uncertainty and demanding his. \"Resume or resign,\" they screamed\n\nOf course, the presidency responded promptly, calling on Nigerians to ignore calls for the president's resignation. Others who supported the presidency recalled recent reports that the president has recovered tremendously.\n\nSo, if the president eventually returns and declares interest to contest the 2019 election, he will be the candidate to beat as his government has, through its anti-corruption crusade retained a large number of supporters who believe he will eventually solve the economic problem that is threatening the popularity of his government. It remains to be seen if he will contest.\n\nAlhaji Atiku Abubakar\n\nThe former Vice-President of Nigeria, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, is one of the few Nigerians almost everybody expects to contest for the presidential ticket in 2019. Although he is still in APC, some insiders allege that he may contest for this seat on another platform if the need arises.\n\nHe is not a pushover in Nigerian politics not only because of his experience and the acknowledged deep pocket but also because he is believed to be one of the few politicians that have managed, over the years to cultivate friends and supporters from across the country. Coming from the North-East, a zone that is contesting to be allowed to produce Nigerian President, observers said he is also likely to have ample support from the zone.\n\nHis major challenge may be the platform he will likely use if he fails to get either APC or PDP platforms. A founding member of PDP, who dumped the party for APC, he is known in the two leading parties but observers said his undoing would be if he is contests on a platform that is not well known and accepted.\n\nBukola Saraki\n\nThe Senate President, Bukola Saraki, is in APC. Unlike most of the other APC leaders who said their ambition will be determined by the President's interest in the ticket, some observers of the political developments in the ruling party said Saraki is one of the politicians that may insist on contesting for the presidential ticket in 2019 on the ticket of APC.\n\nA two-time governor of Kwara State, Saraki enjoys the support and loyalty of many senators, especially PDP senators and other federal lawmakers and has the resources to prosecute the project. It however remains to be seen how far he may go in fulfilling this ambition. His major setback is the running battle he has with the leadership of his party (APC) since he assumed office as the Senate President in circumstances that did not please his party's leadership.\n\nRabiu Musa Kwankwaso\n\nFormer Governor Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, who is now a serving APC senator, representing Kano Central Senatorial District, is not a new person in presidential race in Nigeria. He was a presidential aspirant in the last general election.\n\nEven before his current overt moves, observers have noted that he had continued, over the years, to oil his political network anchored on his popular political slogan, Kwankwasiyya.\n\nJust this week, a bakery in Kano launched Kwankwasiyya bread, a move a medium described as \"an early gesture of goodwill to his presidential aspirations.\"\n\nIt reported that the parent company identified as \"TAOFEEQ\" unveiled the new brand of bread through its ambassadors, Hassana & Hussaina Musa, who are both Kannywood stars.\n\nAccording to the report, \"the bread, which is already in the market, has a red cap photo and kwankwasiyya written on its bag.\" Sources said he still has appreciable followership in Kano, Kaduna and some other states in the North. But being an APC stalwart, it seems his ambition for 2019 is tied to whether or not Buhari will contest.\n\nSule Lamido\n\nEven while the Peoples Democratic Party's leadership crisis lasted, Sule Lamido, a PDP founding member, was one of the party's leaders who remained firm that he would contest 2019 on the party's ticket. He somehow made the declaration for his presidential ambition since last year when he said if offered a ticket come 2019, he would be glad to offer himself. By May, while the leadership crisis was yet to be resolved; the former Foreign Affairs Minister and former Governor of Jigawa State hosted state chairmen of the party, where he reportedly told them of his resolve to offer himself for the office of president on the party's ticket.\n\nNow that the Supreme Court has resolved the PDP's leadership crisis, an insider said his interest for the plum office is still intact.\n\nAhmed Makarfi\n\nAs the man who won the prolonged PDP leadership crisis, observers said the rumoured presidential ambition of Senator Ahmed Makarfi may be more easily realised now than before. A former governor of Kaduna State from 1999 to 2007, who was appointed Chairman of PDP Caretaker Committee at a convention which held in Port-Harcourt, he had an epic leadership battle with former governor of Borno State, Ali Modu Sheriff.\n\nAfter Makarfi's victory at the Supreme Court, analysts said he can position loyalists who would ensure his emergence as the presidential candidate of the party. Coming from the North, the prospect seems favourable, but it remains to be seen how far he would succeed in getting the support of the other stakeholders, especially those who supported Sheriff. Nasir El-Rufai\n\nThe governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, has always been mentioned as one of those likely to run for the presidency in 2019 on the ticket of APC. But insiders in the APC confided that he is one of the hopefuls who may not show any interest if President Muhammadu Buhari is contesting.\n\nBut if it happens that Buhari will not contest, insiders said el-Rufai would be one of the most likely APC members that will contest in 2019. Although an influential politician in the North, it will take a major election to determine his popularity in the South.\n\nAyo Fayose\n\nEkiti State Governor and Chairman of the PDP Governors Forum, Ayodele Fayose, is one southern PDP member that seems to defy the claim that the party has zoned its 2019 Presidential ticket to the North. As far back as February 21, 2017 the governor from the South-West zone made his presidential ambition in 2019 known to all.\n\nAt the peak of the PDP leadership crisis, Fayose openly rejected Sheriff and gave his support to Makarfi, threatening to dump his PDP ticket if Sheriff wins. Now that Makarfi won, Fayose did not hide the fact that he belonged to the winning side. But if it is true that Makarfi has interest in the ticket, the two may soon be on the ring because this week, Fayose said he will officially declare his presidential ambition in October.\n\nFielding questions from journalists at an all-inclusive meeting of the Peoples Democratic Party with other political parties which held at Ibadan Civic Centre, Agodi Gate, Ibadan, Fayose said, \"Most surely. I am in the race. I am declaring on October 1. It is my right to be president of Nigeria as a citizen of this country. I am educated and I have experience in politics. I am vast in public administration.\n\n\"The people want me. I will vie for the presidency under whatever circumstances.", "timeCrawl": "07:40:00", "sim": 0.6627451181411743, "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "freq": 2, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1145, "date": "2017-10-01", "textStart": 1134}, {"date": "2019-08-07", "textStart": 12558, "amb": false, "textEnd": 12572}, {"date": "2017-02-21", "textStart": 19084, "amb": false, "textEnd": 19101}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8886024", "categories": [], "details": {}}

"time": "05:24:00", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "Not a few concerns can explain the All Progressives Congress' diminishing goodwill, writes Olawale Olaleye\n\nThere is an existential debate on the state of the nation. The debate is no longer on whether the staggering goodwill or the messianic perception that brought the All Progressives Congress (APC) to power is fast declining or the obvious inability to hold down its promises; it is one that tends to x-ray some of the factors responsible for the obvious and sudden turn in the tide for the ruling party and in such a short time.\n\nEven niggling too, is the fast vanishing mystique of President Muhammadu Buhari (remember the famous body language theory), whose larger than life image was believed to have consumed a sitting president, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, even though the eventual vote difference at the presidential election didn't attest to the staggering hype that preceded the election.\n\nHowever, in situating what could have or still be wrong to the extent that a party so demonised with allegations of corruption, gross incompetence and being completely anti-people suddenly had a rebound and had been doing very well at each electoral opportunity, despite the leadership crisis that almost tore it apart since it lost power in 2015. Perhaps, some of the factors below could be helpful in trying to locate where and how the APC missed it.\n\nOne thing that was clear from the result of the 2015 elections and some of the developments afterwards is that the election was essentially not between the APC and the PDP; it was one between the former president, Jonathan and the people of Nigeria, albeit the PDP was the willing vehicle that conveyed Jonathan to the losing destination. All that the people wanted was for Jonathan to go, because he was believed, not only to have lost it but unable to show leadership, whilst the political will required to make hard choices was evidently absent. Jonathan was the one Nigerian leader, who was in government but not in power.\n\nThus, this swirling perception then paved the way for the change mantra, which in spite of its seeming inauspiciousness, had its way through for Jonathan's sake. Nothing, however, confirms this position than some of the events that started playing out shortly after the 2015 elections, the results of some of the rerun polls especially. APC seems to be keen more about grabbing power, but not prepared to effectively use the power for the collective good of the people through profound delivery of good governance. It rather wallowed in the tweaked narrative of Jonathan must go and today, the truth of its unpreparedness is self-evident.\n\nIn the lead up to the 2015 general election, there was no debating President Buhari's obvious lack of understanding of the economy. From some of his interviews (both local and international) to speeches delivered at rallies and on the state of the nation, Buhari could not hide the fact that he lacked the intellectual capacity to tame a troubled economy like Nigeria's. Perhaps, it was the reason his handlers and party claimed then that his running mate, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, would be in charge of the economy while Buhari would face corruption and insecurity, his perceived areas of strength.\n\nBut whatever result that arrangement has been able to birth, the economy is still the issue today. It was no surprise too that Professor Wole Soyinka once admonished on the need to convoke an emergency conference on the state of the economy. Although the situation has improved a bit, the economy was for a long time in a very bad shape. Even then, there is still inflation; the deficient foreign exchange policy has done a lot of hurt to manufacturers and small businesses, a majority of which had shut down, resulting in gross loss of jobs and ultimately, exacerbating the poverty level in the country.\n\nFor reasons many people were and still unable to fathom, President Buhari started off his presidency by de-marketing the country and her citizenry before the world. An example that stood out was when the president was in London sometime last year for the global anti-corruption summit, hosted by a former British Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron. The former British PM, while joking with the Queen of England, Elizabeth II, had described Nigeria as a fantastically corrupt nation. This had elicited the rage of many Nigerians both home and abroad and had expected a 'brilliant response' from their leader.\n\nLater on in the day, when asked during a session with Sky News Diplomatic Editor, Dominic Waghorn, the president would rather give credence to the words of Cameron and admitted that Nigeria was corrupt. Buhari, who did not even realise he was giving the country away very cheaply, said he would not demand any apology from Cameron or anyone at that for stating the obvious. Rather, his concern was for them to help with looted funds.\n\nUnsurprisingly though, two years after assuming office and in spite of his many trips abroad soliciting international cooperation and understanding about the stolen funds, not a dime of the looted funds had been repatriated to Nigeria, yet, the image blight sticks like a leach on the country as a sovereign state and on individual Nigerians, many of them going about their legit businesses but had to share of the collective blacklisting as much as bear the indignation of this undeserving stigma, courtesy of the president's apparent indiscretion.\n\nBack to back, the two budgets so far presented by this government were fraught with avoidable mess and needless muscle-flexing between the executive and the legislature. First off, nothing really could explain the fact that the first budget that was presented by President Buhari as a civilian leader was a serious embarrassment to everything that the change mantra sought to represent. It started with reports that the budget was missing and then, two copies of the budget with differing contents in some areas surfaced. It went a notch up the obnoxious following alleged padding of the figures from ministry to ministry and then, the irregularities contained therein.\n\nIt didn't stop there. It was later revealed in the course of the many inquests into the budget that it was no longer going to be zero-based. That was the first budget. And, aside the controversy on the over-bloated and replicated sub-heads, there were issues of unrealistic assumptions in the budget too.\n\nFor instance, the budget was then based on an oil price benchmark of $38 per barrel and a production estimate of 2.2 million barrels per day, coupled with the terrible exchange rate and inflation. Then, the second budget was no better. Apart from coming late, there were allegations of unintended alterations believed to have messed up the estimates of some ministries, causing disaffection between the executive and the legislature.\n\nComing from this experience, which apart from exposing the apparent failure of leadership, also to a very large extent, showed the administration's weakness on matters of the economy and the budgeting process, a shortcoming that was seemingly inexcusable in view of what was and still at stake.\n\nBuhari's Tardiness, Junketing and Health Challenge\n\nPresident Buhari is believed to have since assuming office shown his inability to hold down some of the demands of his office, considerably. First, it took him about five months to submit a list of his prospective team to the National Assembly, changing dates as if he planned to bring onboard people from a different planet. This is aside the fact that he was alleged to have put up the final list without consulting the party leadership, an action responsible for the crisis of mistrust in the party as the place of caucuses had been demystified.\n\nTo compound this was the fact that, before his health situation took its toll, the president did not sit back at home for two months at a stretch without travelling abroad, even when the situation back home kept deteriorating each passing day. From the time he assumed office till the point his health matter manifested, Buhari had travelled to no fewer than 25 countries in the alleged search for bi-lateral relationship and some of the countries, he visited two or three times. Results of these trips, Nigerians are yet to see manifest.\n\nBut his health finally caved in, resulting in his having to be away from his desk for so long. The first time he traveled to London for medical check-up, he spent about 50 days. This second trip is nearing 100 days since he left the shores of the country, although he fulfilled all constitutional demands before travelling.\n\nWhilst there has been anxiety on the state of his health, the information management of his team has shown a rather arrogant government, whose head is treated more like a private citizen as against the public person that he is. And despite the ongoing protest against his long absence from work, protesters have been dispersed with tear gas by the police.\n\nAnother critical factor that may have shaped and still shaping the perception and disposition of Nigerians to the Buhari presidency is the approach to the fight against corruption. The feeling is pervasive that Buhari is prosecuting a selective anti-graft war against carefully identified persons perceived as enemies of his administration and others he is believed to have personal axe to grind with. There is no doubting the fact that the war has opened a lot of can of worms since it was launched, in what could pass as having recorded success. But sadly, it has been more of a distraction and an albatross than posting impressive progress reports, when analysed as a whole.\n\nThe tendency to arrive at this mindset stemmed from the fact that whilst the PDP was in power, it prosecuted its own people more, setting personal examples in the fight against graft from within, even though the degree of rot that was recorded in that era did not justify its efforts in the containment of graft. But despite the petitions and allegations against some persons in the APC, the government has continued to look away as if those allegations do not matter.\n\nAnd where the argument was that the PDP descended on its people because it felt they were corrupt as against what appears the position of the APC, the counter-argument is that the APC is mostly populated by former members of the PDP, and so, what difference does it really make? The other argument is that it was the PDP that was in power for 16 years and so key players at that time are those that would be asked to account for their stewardship. But the APC government, it was expected, could have done more beyond the typical media trial of persons to prove that the fight was not selective and personal in some instances.\n\nDuring one of his early visits to the United States of America shortly after the elections, President Buhari was asked during a session with international journalists how he planned to contain some of the agitations in the Niger Delta region of the country and he glibly said the basis for addressing their needs would be based on the kind of support he received from them. There, he mooted the theory of not according the same attention to people who gave 95 per cent support and those who grudgingly gave five per cent.\n\nThe president was quick to forget that immediately the elections were over and he emerged president, he had become the president of Nigeria and no longer the candidate of the APC or any part of the country. Even if he planned to pay any part of the country back in their own coin, should the president of any country travel that route verbally? Maybe no! Immediately former US President Barack Obama won his re-election in 2012, he forbade that the American people were seen along the blue and the red states demarcation, which is usually the political way of distinguishing states during electoral contest in the US. That, of course, is living true to expectation as a leader of all. But Buhari failed that simple and cheap test and the results of that are some of the agitations going on in some parts of the country.\n\nBoko Haram and the 'Technical Victory' Propaganda\n\nPerhaps, it might be safe to assume that no civilian government in contemporary Nigerian history has dwelt in sheer propaganda as much as the Buhari government and one of the ways it is quick to give itself away is the often contradictory situation report on the Boko Haram insurgency.\n\nOften tagged \"technical victory\", a language many Nigerians are unable to relate or identify with, the government has continued to use propaganda in the fight against insurgency. Whilst government has consistently claimed that there is no Nigerian territory under the grip of the insurgents, and even demonstrated its technical victory over the sect with the presentation of Boko Haram flag recovered in Sambisa Forest to the president, the Senator representing Borno Central, Senator Baba Kaka Garbai, said not too long ago that nearly half of Borno was still under the sect. But with Boko Haram's violent resurgence in recent time, nothing puts more lie to government's crude propaganda.\n\nWhat more, Cameroonian forces months back came to the rescue of Nigeria, when they stormed the territories of Boko Haram, routed them, killed about 167 insurgents and also freed about 300 hostages and towns said to have been under the caliphate of the sect. To many people, that amounted to dishonesty in leadership and might have created a rather damning impression altogether, even though government has not stopped to provide 'alternative facts' in the fight against insurgency.\n\nA certain development that has exposed the character of this government about power and its management is the lack of unity of purpose right in the presidency. Before Buhari embarked on his medical trip, the truth about the division in the presidency had become public knowledge. But more than any other incidences, nothing confirmed this than the controversial nomination of the acting chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mr. Ibrahim Magu, who was discredited twice by the Department of State Services (DSS) in its report, the basis of which he was rejected the two times by the Senate.\n\nNow, pause for a moment and ask: on what grounds would a critical agency of government write a report twice on a nominee of the president to another arm of government and the report would be dismissed by separate interests? Curiously, in all of this, the president did not only stay away from the fray, he acted as if he was helpless, and watched the hawks take over control of the government. That has made the headship of a critical anti-corruption agency to continue to hang in the balance. It is yet again a failure of leadership for which the APC must admit responsibility.\n\nAnother interesting feature of the Buhari administration is that it is notorious for disobeying court orders. And whenever this debate comes up, two people are usually in mind: former National Security Adviser, Sambo Dasuki, and the leader of the Shiite Muslim group, Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, both of whom have been kept in detention for two years running. And whenever government is constrained to speak about this, its comments are always at variance with the principles of rule of law. There is no way the people will not assess the APC on this account and of course, it is part of factors responsible for the party's declining rating.\n\nAlso, the government's failure to exercise caution in certain sensitive cases was generally believed to be responsible for the needless arrest of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, whose arrest is more expedient now than ever, having even flouted practically all his bail conditions. But again, it stands to reason that had the government not picked him up then and detained him for several months, there would not have been a reason for the latest call for his arrest or the messianic posturing he suddenly landed overnight. It is a simple result of the government's incautiousness.\n\nJust another issue that has exposed the hypocrisy of the APC government is its seemingly ambivalent position on the ongoing debate about the restructuring of the country. Before the Buhari presidency came onboard, the party and its members were proponents of restructuring, ostensibly in the interest of peace and unity.\n\nNaturally, therefore, anyone would have expected that upon assuming office, it would be an agenda on the front burner. But now that even people who did not believe in the idea have started coming out to lend their voices to the need for a restructuring of the system, the party and government failed to lead the discourse, thus making it a free for all. Interestingly, when the party was going to save face by setting up a committee to examine the issue, it appointed the Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir el-Rufai, as its chair, a man who had openly dismissed the idea of restructuring and chided its proponents. No wonder the rising number of self determination groups and the growing call for secession. The APC and its government haven't fared well here.\n\nThe crisis and mistrust between the executive and legislature following the inauguration of the leadership of the National Assembly in June of 2015, have portrayed the APC led government in bad light. Although executive/legislative rivalry is largely seen as one of the attributes of any promising democracy the world over, it however becomes dangerous when either of the arms seeks to deliberately undermine the other or prevent it from carrying out its constitutionally stipulated functions. For over a year after the inauguration of the National Assembly leadership, the parliament was a theatre of intrigues between the executive and the legislature. Senate President Bukola Saraki and House of Representatives Speaker Yakubu Dogara won their respective positions against the wish of the party, with the support of PDP legislators - a development which ignited a face-off between the presidency and the lawmakers who insisted on exercising their powers to elect their preferred leaders. Shortly after his emergence as Senate President, Saraki was arraigned before the Code of Conduct Tribunal over assets declaration forms he filed several years ago. As he was facing the Code of Conduct Tribunal, Saraki was dragged, with the Deputy Senate President, Senator Ike Ekweremadu (elected on the platform of PDP), before another court on allegations of forgery of Senate Rules, that enabled them to emerge as presiding officers. While all this lasted, the presidency had little interface with the presiding officers of the Senate while the party did not engage its parliamentary caucus to push its manifesto into legislative agenda. The result was the midterm scorecard of the government which many believed was below average. However, whilst the relationship between the president and leaders of the National Assembly, particularly Senate President Saraki, might have improved significantly, the one between the two institutions is far from being cordial as both continue to flex muscles over their constitutional powers.\n\nAlthough the place of caucuses has featured in a few of the factors aforementioned, it remains one of the biggest challenges confronting the APC. Since the APC came to power in May 2015, the party has been gradually and subtly reduced into irrelevance in the scheme of things, particularly in the area of political appointments. Although attempts were made few times to create an impression that the party was consulted before decisions were made, that had turned out to be mere formality as its input did not shape executive decisions. The absence of strong party caucuses remains a major and in fact, the most critical undoing of this government. Two years after gaining control of power at the centre, the APC has not been able to constitute its Board of Trustees and at the same time still struggling with holding a proper national convention. The outcome of its recent non-elective congresses was a reminder of the ugly past. Too many things are not right with the ruling party, and this is compounded by the fact that in Nigeria as it is in some part of the world, the president or governor is the automatic leader of the party at their respective levels but unfortunately, Buhari has not provided the much needed leadership, hence, the party is avoidably adrift.\n\nWhile the APC is still in search of ways to assert its influence as the ruling party two years after its victory at the poll, what its members and leadership have and which helps to allay temporary fears is that there is a government in place. For now, many believe APC has failed to live up to expectations in many respects and the goodwill that heralded its coming to power has greatly diminished.\n\nAlthough not an impossible issue to fix, the situation may have been further compounded now by the lack of a rally point as a result of the absence of leadership occasioned by the president's long medical vacation. However, how they are able to fix this is not the issue, but how it would not affect the balance of power in the elections of 2019 without making a mess of the entire political and electoral calculus, because with this plethora of gaffes by the ruling party, the future doesn't look any good, either for the party or its government.", "timeCrawl": "05:24:00", "sim": 0.6078431606292725, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2015-05-", "textStart": 19326, "amb": false, "textEnd": 19334}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8875549", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "id": 41, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

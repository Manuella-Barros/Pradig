having learned the lessons from his experiences, both good and bad - never lost heart.\n\nYulo bounced back in style in the Asian Men's Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, in May, capturing the elusive all-around gold and repeating as champion in floor exercise, vault, and parallel bars.\n\nAnd in his second Olympic stint, Yulo made the most out of his opportunities as he reached the final of all-around, floor exercise, and vault.\n\nYulo saved his best in the floor exercise final, netting 15.000 points to dethrone Israel's Artem Dolgopyat (14.966) and become the Philippines' second Olympic champion after weightlifting ace Hidilyn Diaz.\n\n\"This is the experience that will leave a mark in my heart and in the entire Philippines,\" said Yulo.\n\nYulo, who is now coached by Aldrin Casta\u00f1eda, said his victory also belongs to people who have helped him along the way, including Gymnastics Association of the Philippines president Cynthia Carrion.\n\n\"Every place I've been to, every result I've got, there are people who helped me, especially ma'am Cynthia,\" said Yulo. \"She really supported me through the ups and downs.\"\n\nYulo hopes to win one more as he competes in the vault final on Sunday, August 4. -

About 24 hours after ruling the floor exercise final, Yulo conquered the vault competition at the Paris Olympics men's artistics gymnastics, emerging as the first Filipino Olympic multi-gold medalist at the Bercy Arena on Sunday night, Aug. 4 (Manila time).\n\nHis confidence through the roof after delivering the Philippines first gymnastics Olympic medal on Saturday, the 4-foot-11 dynamo unleashed his magic anew to top the vault with an average score of 15.116 points.\n\nThe 24-year-old dazzled with a high-level execution of dragulescu pike in his first vault, just needing a little hop to gain balance after his landing and netting 15.433 points -- 6.000 in difficulty and 9.433 in execution. Fourth to perform in the final, Yulo then executed a kasamatsu double in his second vault, which was not as good as his first vault but still solid for 14.800 points -- 5.600 in difficulty and 9.200 in execution.\n\nAfter each vault, Yulo, as he has been all tournament, threw his fists into the air in high satisfaction of his performance. When the last four performers wound up with lower scores, Yulo was once again in disbelief after pulling off an Olympic feat no other Filipino athlete has done before.\n\nWith Yulo's two-gold haul, the Philippines will finish the Paris Games with at least four medals, the other two being guaranteed bronzes - one each for Nesthy Petecio and Aira Villegas.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nWhen Yulo comes home to the Philippines, he will get more than a hero's welcome -- he stands to receive at least P23 million in incentives from the government and a posh condominium worth P24 million from real estate giant Megaworld.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore winning his second gold, Yulo delivered a dazzling performance that netted him 15.0 points and the gold medal at the Paris Olympics men's gymnastics floor exercise at the Bercy Arena on Saturday evening, August 3 (Manila time).\n\nThe gold was the first medal for the Philippines in Olympic gymnastics.\n\nPresident Ferdinand Marcos Jr. congratulated Yulo on his social media account.\n\n\"We've witnessed history as Carlos Yulo clinched the Philippines' first Gold medal in artistic gymnastics at the Paris 2024 Olympics,\" the President said, adding that he is \"confident that it will not be the last.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Congratulations, Caloy! The entire country stands proud with you!\" he said.\n\nUnder Republic Act 10699, also known as the Sports Benefits and Incentives Act of 2001, Filipino Olympic gold medalists will receive P10 million on top of the Olympic Gold Medal of Valor to be issued by the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC).\n\nSilver medalists will be given P5 million, while bronze medalists will get P2 million.\n\nThe House of Representatives, meanwhile, chipped in a P3 million reward to the gold medalist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Caloy has earned this reward through sheer hard work and unmatched talent. This incentive is a testament to our unwavering support for Filipino athletes who strive for greatness on the global stage,\" Speaker Martin Romualdez said of the cash incentive.\n\nThe House will also give Yulo a congressional medal for his achievement.\n\nMeanwhile, Megaworld on August 2 pledged a fully-furnished two-bedroom residential condominium unit worth P24 million inside the company's 50-hectare McKinley Hill township in Taguig City.\n\nFollowing Yulo's golden medal performance, Megaworld posted on Facebook:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"IT'S A GOLD FOR THE PHILIPPINES! Congratulations Carlos Yulo! Welcome to your McKinley Hill home!\"\n\nThat served as the caption in a graphic congratulating Yulo and the \"fully-furnished 2-bedroom condominium unit in McKinley Hill, valued at P24M\" in the image.\n\nExpect more companies to give whatever they will to Yulo, just like they did with the first Filipino Olympic gold medalist, Hidilyn Diaz, three years ago.\n\nDiaz, Obiena lead celebrations\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe country's first Olympic gold medalist, Hidilyn Diaz, was among the first to congratulate Yulo.\n\nIn an Instagram story, Diaz said there were \"different emotions\" in Yulo's victory and thanked all the Filipino athletes.\n\n\"Para sa iyo, Caloy: Proud ako sa iyo. I-enjoy mo ang bunga ng pinagpaguran mo. At lagi mong ibabalik -- sa Diyos at bayan, dahil lahat ng tagumpay natin ay hindi pansarili. Salamat sa lahat ng maganda at mabuting ginagawa at gagawin mo pa para sa Diyos at bayan (I am so proud of you. Enjoy the fruits of your hard work. And always remember to give back -- to God and country -- because our success is not for ourselves alone. Thank you for all the good things you have done and will continue to do for God and country)!\" she wrote on Facebook.\n\nWhile she will not be in the Olympics as an athlete, Diaz is headed for Paris as an official for the International Weightlifting Federation, as the Olympic events will start on August 7.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, hours after his qualification to the pole vault finals, Ernest John \"EJ\" Obiena also congratulated Yulo on his Instagram story, with a simple \"Yes, sir!\"\n\nPhilippine Olympic Committee president Abraham Tolentino on Facebook congratulated Yulo, accompanied by photos together with the country's newest Olympic champion in the Bercy Arena in Paris.\n\nThe Gymnastics Association of the Philippines (GAP) also called Yulo's gold medal win a \"golden comeback\" from his run in the previous Olympics in Tokyo. GAP President Cynthia Carrion was in Paris to witness Yulo's win.\n\n\"Our country's first gold medal for Men's Artistic Gymnastics was brought home by our Golden Boy, Carlos Yulo!\" GAP wrote on Facebook.\n\nSenators sent their congratulations, too.\n\n\"Caloy overcame various setbacks and challenges, which included a change of coach and moving back to the Philippines from Japan for his training, to get to this moment,\" Sen. Nancy Binay said in a statement.\n\n\"You are a shining example, Caloy, of how we can strive to achieve balance in our lives despite the pursuit of glory,\" Binay said\n\nWITH REPORTS FROM ARIC JOHN SY CUA, CATHERINE VALENTE, REINA C.

In the Southeast Asian Games in Manila, Yulo won two gold medals in team and floor exercise, and five silver medals from the other apparatus: pommel horse, still rings, vault, parallel bars, and horizontal bars.\n\nIn the Tokyo Olympics, Yulo missed the floor exercise finals, but qualified in the vault finals where he fell just short -- 0.017 points short of a bronze medal.\n\nAfter his Tokyo stint, Yulo continued to rake in medals for the Philippines, notable of which are: his World Championships gold medal for vault in 2021, 10 gold medals in three editions of the Asian Championships, and seven gold medals in the Hanoi and Cambodia editions of the Southeast Asian Games.\n\nWhat happened after Tokyo\n\nHowever, things became slightly different after the Tokyo Games.\n\nWhile Yulo tried to excel as well in other apparatuses, a major change happened when he parted ways with former Japanese coach Munehiro Kugimiya. He is now training with Filipino coach Aldrin Casta\u00f1eda.\n\nStill, Yulo said he is grateful to Kugimiya.\n\n\"Siya po talaga 'yung nakakakita ng potential ko. Sobrang thankful po ako sa taong 'yun, sobrang talino. Na-provide niya po lahat ng needs nung nandun ako sa Japan,\" Yulo said in JP Soriano's 24 Oras interview last April.\n\nAside from a coaching change, Yulo previously said he plans to excel in the all-around event.\n\n\"Ang goal ko rin po kasi sa Olympics, maka-individual all-around. Hindi lang floor, hindi lang vault, hindi lang p-bar,\" he said.\n\nIndeed, come Paris, he excelled in the individual all-around as he also qualified for its finals where he finished 12th.\n\nHowever,

Yulo won the floor exercise gold on Saturday and took his second gold after topping the vault on Sunday at the Bercy Arena in Paris.Lionel BONAVENTURE/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE\n\nCarlos Yulo is now a double Olympic gold medalist and a living legend.\n\nA day after ruling the floor exercise in gymnastics for the Philippines' first gold in the Paris Olympics, Yulo added the vault to his vast and growing collection late Sunday at the Bercy Stadium.\n\nYulo propelled his way to a total score of 15.116 and the gold medal, sending the vault's main man Artur Davtyan settling for silver with a score of 14.966.\n\nHarry Hepworth of Great Britain pocketed the bronze with a score of 14.949.\n\nYulo was the fourth to perform in the cast of eight top vaulters and after the first three registered close scores, the 24-year-old Filipino issued a strong statement with a total of 15.116 from his first jump of 15.433 (Ri Se Gwang) and second of 14.880 (Kasamatsu double twist).\n\n\"I just wish that I would be safe (while doing my routine). I was relaxed because I had nothing to lose. This experience was crazy,\" Yulo told the media in Paris following the awarding ceremony.\n\nIt was a landmark win for Yulo, who had lost to the seasoned Davtyan in the vault in the 2022 world championships in Liverpool, England.\n\nThis time, there was no stopping Yulo from getting back at the 31-year-old Davtyan, who was bronze medalist in Tokyo, where Yulo fared miserably.\n\nAs Yulo runs away with his second gold, the riches he stands to receive when he gets back home should make his bank account fatter.\n\nUnder the law, an Olympic gold has a corresponding reward of P10-million. And since Yulo has snatched two, the amount will likely be doubled.\n\nCondos await\n\nEarlier, Megaworld pledged a condominium unit at BGC worth P24 million for every gold won in Paris.\n\nThe House of Representatives also promised to award him P3 million following his first gold, and the amount could hit double after his vault exploit.\n\nGiven that he will be bringing home two gold medals, Yulo should be getting two units from the real estate company.\n\nThe second Yulo gold now makes the country's campaign in Paris as the Philippines' finest ever, even better than the 1-2-1 haul in Tokyo three years ago behind weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz's gold and the two silvers and bronze produced by boxing.\n\nThe current collection of two could go up to as high as five or possibly more in the coming days with boxing sending two in the medal round and athletics pinning its hopes on EJ Obiena.\n\nWorld No. 2 Obiena is still in the thick of the fight after making the final scheduled Tuesday.\n\n\"Answered prayers... We already broke the record in the Olympics,\" said Philippine Olympic Committee president Abraham 'Bambol' Tolentino, who was in attendance during Yulo's epic showing.\n\nSince making its Olympic debut in 1924 in Paris, the Philippines now has logged a total of 3-5-8 (gold-silver-bronze).", "source": {"uri": "tribune.net.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

I'm really grateful to them. I want to say thank you for watching and praying for me throughout the competition.\"\n\nAnd while the six-time world champion has made a lot of history for his country, it still seemed like long odds for the Manila native to be standing on that center podium with gold around his neck.\n\nJust before the 2023 World Championships, Yulo and his longtime coach Munehiro Kugiyama decided to part ways. Since then, Yulo has worked without a coach and instead has bounced around the world to train with some of the best athletes in his sport. When he's not traveling, he's returned to Manila - a move he's credited with making him feel more connected with his Filipino teammates.\n\nBut those teammates were not on the floor with him on Saturday. Instead it was just the 24-year-old, flipping, twisting and soaring above the floor at the Bercy Arena in Paris.\n\nHe hardly put a foot wrong from the start, his powerful strides making him appear to glide across the mat and then his explosive twists and flips made it seem like he was a threat to simply burst through the roof and ascend into the clouds.\n\nIt was a tone-setting performance that the rest of the field simply could not match. But Yulo was still forced to sit as performer after performer took to the floor, trying to knock him off the top of the leaderboard.\n\nBut each failed. His score of 15.000 was enough. And the moment hit him like a ton of bricks.\n\nHugely emotional in the moments after winning, Yulo let out an almighty roar and broke into tears. He pumped his fists and, despite that history-making pedigree, looked completely overwhelmed by what he had just done.\n\nThat didn't change when he took to the podium to receive the first gold medal ever put around a Filipino man's neck.\n\nWith the medal hanging above his chest - it's reportedly very heavy thanks to the piece of the Eiffel Tower that is inlaid in every medal at these Games - Yulo raised his hands above his head in triumph. But his eyes were still full of disbelief, and he looked at his medal like it might be taken away from him at any moment.\n\nOh, and he'll get a house from the government for his achievement.

But boy, were they glorious ones.\n\nThe Filipino dynamo won the floor exercise gold medal in the 2024 Paris Olympics with an upgraded difficulty in his routine and an execution that laid to rest his mistakes from three years ago.\n\n\"I did not hesitate. I just went for it,\" Yulo told journalists after the medal ceremony.\n\nThe 24-year-old star who fumbled right in his first pass and crashed out of the floor exercise medal hunt in the 2021 Tokyo Olympics sealed his moment of glory with a perfect landing that drew roars of approval from the packed Barcy Arena.\n\nYulo's final run in his routine featured a front full into a three-and-a-half twist, which was impressive on its own. But then he stuck the landing so emphatically that he could not help but roar loudly and pump his arms sideways to let everyone know that he did exactly what he set out to do in the final.\n\nThe judges agreed: The two-time world champion, who submitted a 6.600 and was rewarded for his near-flawless execution of that routine, garnering a 15.000 for the gold.\n\n\"I'm so overwhelmed. I'm feeling grateful for having this medal and for God. He protected me, as always,\" said Yulo. \"He gave me the strength to get through this kind of performance and perform this well.\"\n\nHe isn't even done yet.\n\nYulo has a chance of making it two gold medals in the Paris Games when he competes in the vault finals on Sunday. And he might have even better chances there. Yulo fared better in the vault than in the floor exercise during the all-around finale.\n\nArtem Dolgopyat of Israel, the defending floor exercise champion, settled for the silver this time while Great Britain's Jake Jarman rounded out the podium with a bronze. Dolgopyat set the pace with his 14.966 points, giving Yulo a tough act to follow.\n\nBut Yulo was undaunted when he took his turn.\n\nHe opened with a two-and-a-half twist to front double pike. Then, he went into a front double full to front double tuck. He had slight hops at the end of both. But after a full-twisting double, he stuck another landing and it was clear he was in the middle of something special.\n\nThe biggest scare came when Jarman, who topped the floor exercise during the men's all-around final and qualifications, took the floor.\n\nWhile the British gymnast, a friend of Yulo's whose mother is Filipino, executed his routine, Yulo watched with bated breath until it was revealed that Jarman scored 14.933 points.\n\n\"We are a small country. Our [delegation] is not that big. So to be able to win a gold medal is really big for us.\"\n\nYulo became just the second Olympic champion for the Philippines ever. Three years ago, Hidilyn Diaz emboldened an entire nation to chase greatness when she won the weightlifting gold medal in the women's 55kg division.\n\nA day before Diaz's historic, trailblazing triumph, Yulo went from one interview to another, trying to put into words how he missed out on his own shot at glory.\n\nHe couldn't find the right words again Saturday night.\n\n\"I still can't believe I was able to do this,\" he said.\n\nIt was hard to hear him anyway, what with the din of celebration that followed another display of Filipino greatness on the Olympic stage.

Or did I look ugly?\n\nHe looked great from all angles -- he's just clinched that Olympic gold medal that was the fruit of years and years of hard work, hundreds of hours in the gym and traded his teenaged life to being full-time as a gymnast.\n\n\"Everything I went through in training, the hard work and sacrifices, my years in Japan, my Tokyo campaign, they flashed into my mind in that short instance,\" said Yulo, who expressed his gratitude to gymnastics association head Cynthia Carrion-Norton, his parents Mark Andrew and Angelika and his girldfriend, Chloe San Jose, who was with all the

coming up on Sunday at 4 p.m. (11 p.m. in Manila).\n\nHe's also a favorite in the apparatus with his 2022 world championship gold medal.\n\n\"I'll take it [vault] the way in hurdled the floor

For 100 years of fighting for a podium finish, the Philippines only held one Olympic gold, won by weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz in 2020. Until Saturday night on Aug. 3 (PST), Yulo rose to the occasion and doubled the success.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by FIG Gymnastics (@figymnastics)\n\nDubbed the Philippines' \"Golden Boy,\" Yulo became the first Filipino athlete to win two Olympic gold medals in the same year, triumphing in both the floor exercise and vault finals for men's artistic gymnastics with scores of 15.00 and 15.116 respectively. This remarkable feat also made the 24-year-old world champion the first Filipino multi-medalist in Olympic history since the country's debut in 1924.\n\nWith this, both the government and private sectors have promised significant rewards for his historic achievements. However, these incentives were announced before he clinched his second gold in the vault finals.\n\nWill Yulo receive double the rewards for his unprecedented success?\n\nUnder Republic Act 10699, signed in 2015, Filipino athletes who win Olympic medals receive significant cash incentives based on their placements. Gold medalists like \"Caloy\" are awarded P10,000,000, silver medalists receive P5,000,000, and bronze medalists earn P2,000,000.\n\nAlongside the cash incentives, Yulo will also be awarded the Olympic Gold Medal of Valor by the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC). Additionally, the Philippine Olympic Committee has pledged to give him a house and lot, following the precedent set during the Tokyo Olympics three years ago.\n\nThe House of Representatives will also award Yulo P3 million for his gold medal achievement. In recognition of his success, property development company Megaworld has pledged to give him a fully-furnished 2-bedroom condominium unit in McKinley Hill, BGC, worth P24 million. So, will he get two units after the second win?\n\nYulo will enjoy a lifetime supply of various benefits from all restaurant chains of Vikings, free meals at JT's Kalayaan, free food and drinks at all Tipsy Pig Gastropub branches, free bacsilog from BastaMura Bacsilog, free furniture worth P100,000 from Apollo Home Depot and definitely more to come.\n\nCurrently, the Philippines has three Olympic gold medals: two from Carlos Yulo and one from Hidilyn Diaz in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. There are still Filipino athletes in medal contention, such as boxers Nesthy Petecio and Aira Villegas, who are guaranteed an Olympic medal, and world No. 2 EJ Obiena, who is competing in the pole vault finals.\n\nWant stories like this delivered straight to your inbox?

Gymnast Carlos Yulo made history for the Philippines by becoming the first Filipino athlete to win an Olympic medal in gymnastics, per ESPN. Yulo brought home a gold medal for his floor routine in the men's artistic gymnastics floor exercise final in Paris.\n\nYulo tallied 15.000 points in a stunning final performance. He defeated defending champion Artem Dolgopyat of Israel, who finished in a close second. Yulo was overjoyed to win a gold and make history for the Philippines, he said.\n\n\"I'm so overwhelmed. I'm feeling grateful for having this medal and for God. He protected me, as always,\" Yulo said, per The Inquirer. \"He gave me the strength to get through this kind of performance and perform this well.\"\n\nYulo's win is just the second gold medal all-time for an athlete from the Philippines. The other person to win gold is weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz. She took it at Tokyo in 2020 for the Women's 55kg event.\n\nYulo completed his winning performance with a triple-twisting dismount during his final tumbling pass, per the Associated Press. He threw his arms up in triumph, certainly warming the hearts of his country's residents and fans.\n\nTeam USA is also having an Olympics to remember\n\nTeam USA may not have won a gold in that particular event, but the Americans are also having a games to remember. In gymnastics events alone, Team USA is racking up the medals. The Americans also lead the total medal count of any country overall at the Paris games, at time of writing.\n\nThe women's gymnastics team already won a gold medal in the team event. Gymnast Simone Biles is smoking the competition, with one stunning performance after another. Biles won her seventh Olympic gold medal Saturday, after taking the women's vault final.\n\nBiles has a chance to win a few more medals. She is competing Monday in the balance beam and floor exercise finals. Her performances are winning over all sorts of fans, including retired swimmer Michael Phelps. Phelps made the bold but accurate claim that Biles is the greatest gymnast of all-time.\n\nThe Americans are also doing well in several other sports. Team USA basketball plays Puerto Rico Saturday, with a chance to earn the top seed in the final rounds of competition. Swimmer Katie Ledecky became the second American to win 13 Olympic medals, joining Michael Phelps. She accomplished that feat by winning silver in the women's 4\u00d7200-meter freestyle relay.\n\nThe Olympics continue through August 11, so there are sure to be many more memories to come.",

Philippines' heartfelt gifts to Carlos Yulo after double Olympic gold\n\nRebecca Ratcliffe South-east Asia correspondent\n\n5 August 2024 at 6:52 am\n\nFilipino gymnast Carlos Yulo's historic double gold medal win at the Paris Olympics has been celebrated across the Philippines, with businesses showering the athlete in gifts - from cash and a new home, to a lifetime supply of mac and cheese.\n\nFerdinand Marcos, the president, said the Philippines had \"witnessed history\" when Yulo became the first Filipino man to win a gold medal after competing in the artistic gymnastic floor exercise on Saturday. He is only the second Filipino athlete to win an Olympic gold, after weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz in 2020. On Sunday, Yulo soared to the top of the podium again in the vault, thus becoming the first Filipino to win two golds - and at a single Olympics.\n\n\"No words can express how proud we are of you,\" Marcos said. \"Filipinos all over the world stood united, cheering and rooting for you.\"\n\nCarlos was described as a \"sports hero\" and \"national treasure\" by speaker of the lower house, Ferdinand Martin Romualdez. Yulo will be given three million Philippines pesos (\u00a340,500/US$51,890) and a congressional medal, and is due to receive P10m under a law that promises incentives to athletes.\n\nPrivate sector companies, big and small, announced a flurry of gifts, including a fully furnished two-bedroom unit worth P24m in Taguig City, Metro Manila. Yulo was also offered lifetime supplies of free buffets, baked mac and cheese, and chicken inasal, a grilled chicken dish, by various chain restaurants.\n\nA car lights specialist offered him a free set of headlights and fog lights for his vehicle, while a wedding photographer pledged free services to the 24-year-old and another business offered a lifetime supply of phone cases. A Filipino doctor pledged free consultation and endoscopic procedures for Yulo when he turned 45, as well as to any patients in need whom Yulo would like to endorse.\n\nYulo collapsed to the ground in tears when he realised he had secured the gold on Saturday. \"I don't know what to say,\" he said. \"We are a really small country ... So to be able to get a gold medal for us is big for us, huge. I dedicate this to the Filipino people who supported me.\"\n\nYulo has been offered franchises for a coffee and a lemon drink business, and a P10m brand ambassadorship contract for a beauty clinic, according to company announcements on social media.\n\nThose who share the same name as Yulo are also in luck, as celebrations sweep the country. Cafes and restaurants have offered free meals or milkshakes to anyone named Carlos, Caloy (his nickname) or Edriel (his middle name), while a music venue offered free entry over the weekend to anyone whose name began with C.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Yulo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Yulo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cheese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Marcos", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ferdinand Marcos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaroni_and_cheese", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Macaroni and cheese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipinos", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filipinos"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Romualdez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martin Romualdez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidilyn_Diaz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hidilyn Diaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_peso", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philippine peso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lower house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_weightlifting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic weightlifting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Manila", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metro Manila"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taguig", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taguig"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Taguig"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_inasal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicken inasal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buffet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milkshake", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milkshake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lemon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grilling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grilling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coffee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Cheese", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Cheese", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Massive_Multiplayer_Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Massive Multiplayer Online", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Cheese", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Cheese", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_the_guardian_uk_429/88421c5addfe9724d228c58c36f7527f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788543", "eventUri": "eng-9788543", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

I dedicate this to the Filipino people also who supported me.\"\n\nMr. Yulo opened with a tumbling pass that featured a high-flying 2-1/2 double piked front somersault and rounded off the dynamic display with an astonishing 3-1/2 twisting forward somersault.\n\nWhen he stuck his final landing, he punched the air with both fists, let out a huge roar and then saluted the hollering crowd that had leapt to their feet to applaud the virtuoso performance.\n\nHe scored 15.000 points, edging out Tokyo champion Artem Dolgopyat of Israel by just 0.034 of a point.\n\nTop qualifier Jake Jarman of Britain settled for third, just 0.067 of a point adrift of the gold medal spot after committing small landing errors on his tumbles.\n\nWhen the final score flashed on the big screen at Bercy Arena, Mr. Yulo, overcome with emotion, covered his face with his hands as he broke down in tears and collapsed to the ground.\n\nFilipino athletes at the Paris Games have been promised a fully furnished, two-bedroom condominium in Taguig City if they win a gold medal.\n\nMr. Yulo said he was grateful for the reward, but that it was secondary to the world title he had just won.\n\n\"It's just a bonus for me. And this is what really matters,\" he said, clutching the medal around his neck.\n\n\"My hard work and the people who really helped me. I know my success is also their success... I'm happy that I won gold. And I also won a house,\" he said, laughing.\n\nMr. Yulo, who trained for seven years in Japan due to a lack of opportunity back home, said he hoped his historic win would open the door for children in the Philippines to take up the sport.", "source": {"uri": "bworldonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessWorld"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Yulo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Yulo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidilyn_Diaz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hidilyn Diaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_weightlifting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic weightlifting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Jarman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake Jarman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artem_Dolgopyat", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artem Dolgopyat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipinos", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filipinos"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accor_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accor Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taguig", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taguig"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Taguig"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Massive_Multiplayer_Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Massive Multiplayer Online", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://www.bworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Carlos-Yulo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788543", "eventUri": "eng-9788543", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

I always say experience, experience and there's no problem there, but this is the one that will leave a mark in my heart and the whole Philippines,\" Yulo told One Sports after the awarding ceremonies where the country's national anthem blared loud and proud.\n\n\"This isn't the perfect competition, but this is the perfect moment for me.\"\n\nThe 24-year-old from Leveriza, Manila, was a curious onlooker during national team practices at nearby Rizal Memorial Sports Complex, and he needed a push from his grandfather, Rodrigo Frisco, who saw a spritely 7-year-old acrobatically throwing himself into the air at a playground back home.\n\nIt was Frisco who brought him for formal training to the Gymnastics Association of the Philippines (GAP) training facility a very short time later.\n\nYulo's baptism of fire came in local tournaments a year later before participating in his first Palarong Pambansa in 2009 held in Tacloban City, Leyte, where he was part of the triumphant gold-winning National Capital Region team in boys' artistic gymnastics.\n\nHe netted his first medal -- a silver -- in the floor exercise, but wound up fifth in the all-around event, prompting the skinny 9-year-old kid to train harder for the next Palarong Pambansa.\n\nWith the full support of his parents Mark Andrew and Angelica Yulo and continuous training at the GAP facility, Yulo captured the gold medal in the individual all-around and floor exercise during the 2010 Palarong Pambansa in Tarlac City where he also claimed a bronze in the vault.\n\nYulo just kept on getting better each year, finally winning the vault as well as the floor exercise and all-around in the 2011 edition of the Palarong Pambansa in Dapitan, Zamboanga del Norte.\n\nHe followed it up by dominating the Philippine National Games in the same year with golds in the floor exercise, rings and parallel bars.\n\nMove to Japan\n\nStockpiling medals in succeeding Palaro editions, Yulo was ready to take on a bigger challenge in the international level. With coach Aldrin Casta\u00f1eda guiding him, he seized gold medals in the floor exercise and parallel bars in the 2014 Asean School Games.\n\nWhen Yulo participated in the International Junior Competition in Yokohama, Japan, in 2015, his bronze performance in the vault behind Youth Olympic medalists Giarnni Regini-Moran and Yue Ma attracted attention, earning him a scholarship from the International Gymnastics Federation.\n\nWith serious financial backing from the Philippine Sports Commission and the MVP Sports Foundation, Yulo made his move to Japan in 2016 where he was coached by Munehiro Kugimiya, which came with the blessings of the GAP headed by Cynthia Carrion.\n\nThe Japan Olympic Association offered Yulo to train in Japan where he eventually graduated in 2022 with an associate degree in literature at Teikyo University in Itabashi, Tokyo.\n\nIn the 2018 Melbourne World Cup, the Filipino dynamo achieved his first podium performance on a global stage, claiming a bronze medal in the vault.\n\nHe followed it up with a silver in the same event in the Baku World Cup and added another silver in the floor exercise of the Doha World Cup, earning Yulo three medals in the worlds in a span of a month.\n\nInspiration to siblings\n\nThe World Championship in Doha, Qatar, that same year put Yulo level with the world's best after snaring a bronze medal in the floor exercise.\n\nBut it was Yulo's victory in the same discipline in the 2019 World Championships in Stuttgart, Germany that finally installed him as a global force in the sport.\n\nFrom thereon, winning medals for Yulo has turned into an anticipated occasion for the Philippines, especially in the Southeast Asian Games beginning in 2019 in Manila as well his annual stints in the Asian championships.\n\nAt this point, Yulo inspired his younger siblings Karl Jahrel Eldrew and Elaiza to pick up gymnastics. Joriel, his older sister, was a performer of the National University Pep Squad.\n\nParis gold\n\nYulo eventually became a two-time world champion after bagging the gold medal in the vault in the 2021 World Championships in Kitakyushu, Japan, where he also landed a silver in the parallel bars.\n\nBut Yulo's initial journey to the Olympics in Tokyo back in 2021 didn't end well, missing the final in most of his events, except for the vault where he ended up fourth.\n\nOver the next three years, Yulo continued to frolic on the Asian medal stands. He claimed a silver in the vault and a bronze in the floor exercise during the 2022 World Championships in Liverpool, England.\n\nHounded by issues about his split with Kugimiya last year and setting up camp in Manila, Yulo simply brushed the controversy aside and made the Paris Olympics gold a top priority with a sense of urgency.", "source": {"uri": "sports.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news",

Philippines' heartfelt gifts to Carlos Yulo after double Olympic gold", "body": "Pledges of pesos, property and pasta after 'Caloy' makes history for his country with floor exercise and vault victories in artistic gymnastics\n\nFilipino gymnast Carlos Yulo's historic double gold medal win at the Paris Olympics has been celebrated across the Philippines, with businesses showering the athlete in gifts - from cash and a new home, to a lifetime supply of mac and cheese.\n\nFerdinand Marcos, the president, said the Philippines had \"witnessed history\" when Yulo became the first Filipino man to win a gold medal after competing in the artistic gymnastic floor exercise on Saturday. He is only the second Filipino athlete to win an Olympic gold, after weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz in 2020. On Sunday, Yulo soared to the top of the podium again in the vault, thus becoming the first Filipino to win two golds - and at a single Olympics.\n\n\"No words can express how proud we are of you,\" Marcos said. \"Filipinos all over the world stood united, cheering and rooting for you.\"\n\nCarlos was described as a \"sports hero\" and \"national treasure\" by speaker of the lower house, Ferdinand Martin Romualdez. Yulo will be given three million Philippines pesos (\u00a340,500/US$51,890) and a congressional medal, and is due to receive P10m under a law that promises incentives to athletes.\n\nPrivate sector companies, big and small, announced a flurry of gifts, including a fully furnished two-bedroom unit worth P24m in Taguig City, Metro Manila. Yulo was also offered lifetime supplies of free buffets, baked mac and cheese, and chicken inasal, a grilled chicken dish, by various chain restaurants.\n\nA car lights specialist offered him a free set of headlights and fog lights for his vehicle, while a wedding photographer pledged free services to the 24-year-old and another business offered a lifetime supply of phone cases. A Filipino doctor pledged free consultation and endoscopic procedures for Yulo when he turned 45, as well as to any patients in need whom Yulo would like to endorse.\n\nYulo collapsed to the ground in tears when he realised he had secured the gold on Saturday. \"I don't know what to say,\" he said. \"We are a really small country ... So to be able to get a gold medal for us is big for us, huge. I dedicate this to the Filipino people who supported me.\"\n\nYulo has been offered franchises for a coffee and a lemon drink business, and a P10m brand ambassadorship contract for a beauty clinic, according to company announcements on social media.\n\nThose who share the same name as Yulo are also in luck, as celebrations sweep the country. Cafes and restaurants have offered free meals or milkshakes to anyone named Carlos, Caloy (his nickname) or Edriel (his middle name), while a music venue offered free entry over the weekend to anyone

ELLIS/agence france-presse\n\nCarlos Yulo used to roam the streets of Malate district in Manila just like an ordinary kid looking for fun and excitement.\n\nHe started proper gymnastics training when he was seven years old after being discovered at a local park while doing numerous svelte and suave tumbling acts.\n\nSoon after, Yulo, who bagged the gold medal in floor exercise in the Paris Olympics last Saturday, found himself undergoing training at the Gymnastics Association of the Philippine facility at the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex.\n\nSeventeen years after that seemingly uneventful day in 2007, Yulo is about to face a life that has been totally alien to him.\n\nWhile he has already earned a lot from his fruitful stints all over the world, nothing will compare to what he is bound to receive once he sets foot on local soil soon.\n\nApart from the P10 million cash reward that the government will give him as stated in RA 10699 (National Athletes and Coaches Benefits and Incentives Act), the 24-year-old Yulo is also going to be awarded with a P24-million condominium unit from Megaworld.\n\nEven Philippine Olympic Committee president Abraham \"Bambol\" Tolentino has promised a house and lot in Tagaytay City.\n\nThe City of Manila, whose Mayor Honey Lacuna is setting the stage for a grand welcome for the kid from Malate, is giving Yulo a cash reward and other recognition for his sensational showing that gave the Philippines its second Olympic gold medal after lifter Hidilyn Diaz's first in Tokyo 2021.\n\nThe House of Representatives has also pledged to give a P3-million cash reward.\n\nBuffet restaurant chain Vikings has also declared that Yulo will be given the opportunity to feast on their culinary treats for the rest of his life.\n\nWhether Yulo will receive what Diaz had received during her coronation three years ago remains to be seen.\n\nThe Zamboanga strongwoman reportedly got P60 million in total.\n\nBut Yulo's road to Olympic glory, however, wasn't paved.\n\nWhen he was first given the chance at stardom in Tokyo, he flopped big time and failed to podium after a forgettable stint.\n\nLast year, Yulo was forced to go separate ways with his longtime coach Munehiro Kugiyama, who is widely credited for turning him into a world champion in floor in 2019 in Stuttgart, Germany, and in vault in 2021 in Kitakyushu, Japan.\n\nAfter a heartbreaking campaign in the world championships in Belgium last year, things didn't look rosy at all for Yulo as he battled personal issues as well.\n\nBut he gathered himself and put on a mesmerizing performance by winning the golds in the all-around, floor, vault and parallel bars during the Asian championships last May in Tashkent, Uzbekistan.\n\nThat four-gold haul was a sign that he had finally recovered and was primed for redemption.\n\nAt press time, Yulo was bidding to add the vault gold medal.\n\nA victory should make him even more legendary.\n\nBut regardless of what happens, Yulo belongs on the upper echelon of the Philippines' greatest athletes of all time.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.net.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

all the support they need to succeed [in] the world stage,\" Gatchalian also said, adding that the National Academy of Sports was established precisely \"to hone promising young athletes [so they] can

I'm really grateful to them. I want to say thank you for watching and praying for me throughout the competition.\"\n\nAnd while the six-time world champion has made a lot of history for his country, it still seemed like long odds for the Manila native to be standing on that center podium with gold around his neck.\n\nJust before the 2023 World Championships, Yulo and his longtime coach Munehiro Kugiyama decided to part ways. Since then, Yulo has worked without a coach and instead has bounced around the world to train with some of the best athletes in his sport. When he's not traveling, he's returned to Manila - a move he's credited with making him feel more connected with his Filipino teammates.\n\nBut those teammates were not on the floor with him on Saturday. Instead it was just the 24-year-old, flipping, twisting and soaring above the floor at the Bercy Arena in Paris.\n\nHe hardly put a foot wrong from the start, his powerful strides making him appear to glide across the mat and then his explosive twists and flips made it seem like he was a threat to simply burst through the roof and ascend into the clouds.\n\nIt was a tone-setting performance that the rest of the field simply could not match. But Yulo was still forced to sit as performer after performer took to the floor, trying to knock him off the top of the leaderboard.\n\nBut each failed. His score of 15.000 was enough. And the moment hit him like a ton of bricks.\n\nHugely emotional in the moments after winning, Yulo let out an almighty roar and broke into tears. He pumped his fists and, despite that history-making pedigree, looked completely overwhelmed by what he had just done.\n\nThat didn't change when he took to the podium to receive the first gold medal ever put around a Filipino man's neck.\n\nWith the medal hanging above his chest - it's reportedly very heavy thanks to the piece of the Eiffel Tower that is inlaid in every medal at these Games - Yulo raised his hands above his head in triumph. But his eyes were still full of disbelief, and he looked at his medal like it might be taken away from him at any moment.\n\nOh, and he'll get a house from the government for his achievement. Not a bad Saturday.\n\n\"I know that already (that I am going to get a house). But this (pointing at his gold medal) is what really matters to me. My hard work and the people who really helped me.

Look at how you spoil us with your greatness.\n\nAfter being crowned the previous day as floor exercise champion, Yulo put the exclamation point to his intoxicating 2024 Paris Olympics' campaign with yet another flawless routine, this time in the vault, to claim his second gold and put sports-loving Filipinos back home in a state of delirium.\n\nAlready a history maker as the Philippines' first male Olympic champion, and first in his sport, the gymnastics sensation capped off his extraordinary stint with yet another historic victory as he averaged a stellar 15.116 points to secure the top spot in the competition.\n\nYulo's exceptional performance, highlighted by a 15.433-point score on his first vault, solidified his status as the Philippines' newest sporting icon, joining the likes of the country's first Olympic champion Hidilyn Diaz and and eight-division world titlist Manny Pacquiao in the pantheon of all-time greats.\n\nEarlier in the day, President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. congratulated Yulo for his first gold medal.\n\n\"I am confident that it will not be the last,\" the President said.\n\nHours later, His prediction became a reality.\n\nIn a separate post, First Lady Liza Marcos also congratulated Yulo for giving the Philippines' first gold finish in this year's global tournament.\n\n\"Congratulations, Carlos Yulo!\" she said.\n\n\"Got goosebumps as Lupang Hinirang played at the arena!,\" she said.\n\n\"We are so proud of you!\" she said.\n\nHouse Speaker Martin Romualdez said Yulo \"earned this reward through sheer hard work and unmatched talent.\"\n\n\"We celebrate Caloy's outstanding contribution and his role as an inspiration to future generations of athletes. He is not just a champion; he is our sports hero and national treasure whose legacy will inspire countless young Filipinos,\" Romualdez said.\n\nYulo will also be conferred a congressional medal for his exceptional achievement and contribution to Philippine sports.\n\n\"Answered prayers. We already broke the record in the Olympics,\" said Philippine Olympic Committee president Abraham Tolentino of the country's 2 golds in the games, eclipsing the 1 gold-2 silver-1 bronze finish of the delegation in the Tokyo Olympics. Boxing is already assured of two bronze here, too.\n\nArtur Davtyan of Armenia, the Tokyo 2020 silver medallist, remained the runner-up with his 14.966, while Great Britain's Harry Hepworth, just 20 years old in his first Olympiad, bagged the bronze on 14.949.\n\nThe win marked a remarkable redemption story for Yulo, who finished fourth in the same event at the Tokyo games.\n\nLife in the Philippines as an athlete will be totally different now for 24-year-old Yulo, who with his floor exercise gold stands to earn somewhere in the vicinity of P35 million or more (the cash windfall Diaz received for her Olympic gold), including a BGC condo. Now multiply that by two.\n\nMeanwhile, Nesthy Petecio guaranteed herself a second Olympic medal - the color of which will still be determined - after advancing to the semifinals of the women's 57kg division after a dominant 5-0 victory over China's Xu Zichun at the North Paris Arena.\n\nThe 32-year-old Petecio, the Tokyo Olympics silver medalist, secured another unanimous decision win, showcasing her superior boxing skills throughout the match.\n\nHer powerful left hook proved to be a decisive weapon, consistently landing on Xu's head.\n\nWith this victory, Petecio joins an elite group of Filipino athletes who have earned multiple Olympic medals.\n\nNow, with a guaranteed bronze, all eyes are on Petecio as she aims to upgrade her medal color when she takes on Poland's Julia Szeremeta on August 7 at 7:46 p.m.", "source": {"uri": "manilastandard.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manila Standard"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris",

History is made again! Ang galing galing mo!

He went into the competition without high expectations, he had told reporters.\n\n\"I was just hoping to perform well.

Thank you so much for the pride and historic moment!\" wrote an X user.\n\nA century has passed since the Philippines' debut in the Olympics in 1924. Weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz earned the country's first Olympic gold medal in Tokyo three years ago.\n\nPhilippine celebrities and public figures, including president Ferdinand Marcos Jr and First Lady Liza Araneta-Marcos, also congratulated Mr Yulo.\n\n\"No words can express how proud we are of you, Caloy. You have achieved GOLD for the Philippines not once, but twice! Filipinos all over the world stood united, cheering and rooting for you,\" Mr Marcos wrote on Facebook.\n\nThe Philippine government will hand the gymnast 10 million Philippine pesos ($173,300; \u00a3135,400) - a reward promised to any gold medalists - while a real estate firm has promised him a fully furnished two-bedroom unit at McKinley Hill, the largest condominium development in metropolitan Manila.\n\nThe House of Representatives has pledged to give Mr Yulo an additional 6 million pesos in cash incentives, with speaker of the lower house, Ferdinand Martin Romualdez, describing him as a \"sports hero\" and \"national treasure\".\n\nEven medical clinics and universities have rolled out the red carpet for the national hero - a gastroenterologist have offered Mr Yulo free consultations and colonoscopies for life while the University of Mindanao has pledged free university credits.\n\nAlso awaiting him are lifetime supplies of ramen, mac and cheese and grilled chicken offered by various restaurant chains.\n\nMeanwhile, the capital city Manila, where Mr Yulo was born and raised, is preparing a \"hero's welcome\" for him.\n\n\"The grandest welcome will greet him and all our Paris Olympians.

Mabuhay ang mga Atletang Pilipino (Long live Filipino athletes! Thank you so much Carlos Yulo,\" she wrote. \"Mabuhay ka Carlos Yulo at sa buong (Long live Carlos Yulo and the whole) Team Philippines!\"\n\nMeanwhile, broadcast journalist Gretchen Ho recalled how Yulo was \"frustrated over his performance at the Floor Exercise\" at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, saying the athlete allowed his \"nerves get to him.\"\n\n\"By that time, he was already World Champion at his favorite apparatus, the Floor. He let his nerves get to him, and it felt like the biggest sporting stage in the World engulfed the 21-year-old Caloy,\" she said.\n\nIn Paris 2024, Caloy comes back to the Olympic stage, so much more mature, level-headed, and steady. It was apparent when he didn't try to do the triple twisties in the qualifying, opting for a safer routine. Yet, he saved that for his final moment on the Floor,\" she further added.\n\nThe official X page of the newly debuted P-pop group New:ID said Yulo's win inspired them to do well in their journey.\n\n\"Congrats to Carlos Yulo @c_edrielzxs for winning gold and making all Filipinos proud! Your hard work and success inspire us in our journey as a P-Pop group. Let's continue to bring pride to the Philippines together,\" they wrote.\n\nWith his historic gold in the Olympics, Yulo is set to receive rewards amounting to millions of pesos from various government institutions and private organizations, such as a P24-million condominium unit promised by a real estate property, and, P10-million from the Philippine Sports Commission under Republic Act 10699 or the National Athletes and Coaches Benefits and Incentives Act.", "source": {"uri": "entertainment.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hannah_mallorca@entertainment.inquirer.net", "name": "Hannah Mallorca", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Yulo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Yulo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_Ganda", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice Ganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_(magazine)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodi_Sta._Maria", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jodi Sta.

The 24-year-old broke down in tears after matching the achievement of weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz, who won gold at the Covid-delayed 2020 Tokyo Games.\n\n\"I just went for it, I didn't hesitate,\" said Yulo. The former world champion perfectly executed his routine, ending with a sure-footed landing to score 15.000 points. It sealed the first gymnastics Olympic medal ever for the Philippines.\n\nDefending champion and world titleholder Artem Dolgopyat of Zionist entity was pushed into silver with 14.966. \"The past months (in general) were hard. I had some problems with my leg and also the training was difficult,\" said the 27-year-old Dolgopyat.\n\n\"It's a hard time in Israel. I tried to do my best in the competition, to show everyone that Israel is very strong and that we can win medals.\" Britain's Jake Jarman, who had scored highest in qualifying a week ago, achieved 14.933 to take bronze at Bercy Arena.\n\nYulo had warned he was \"shooting for the stars\" in Paris after missing out on the podium in Tokyo. And his acrobatic and technically difficult routine proved a hit, scoring higher than the 14.766 he had garnered in qualifying. \"I'm so overwhelmed. I'm feeling grateful for having this medal and for God. He protected me, as always,\" said Yulo, who has a chance of another medal in the vault final on Sunday.\n\n\"He gave me the strength to get through this kind of performance and perform this well.\" China's Xiao Ruoteng, the Tokyo floor bronze medallist, slumped to last in the eight-man final after hopping out of bounds after his opening jump to finish with 13.933.\n\nXiao had been bidding for gold to add to his silver in the men's team event and bronze in the all-around competition at the Paris Games. -- AFP", "source": {"uri": "kuwaittimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kuwait Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karate at the 2020 Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Yulo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Yulo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidilyn_Diaz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hidilyn Diaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_weightlifting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic weightlifting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Jarman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake Jarman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artem_Dolgopyat", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artem Dolgopyat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_vault", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's vault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accor_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accor Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiao_Ruoteng", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xiao Ruoteng"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Rhythmic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Rhythmic", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Organizations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://kuwaittimes.com/kuwaittimes/uploads/images/2024/08/03/138596.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788543", "eventUri": "eng-9788543", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

And he stayed there on top after all eight finalists were done, the last flash of the scores sparking a rush of emotion for the Filipino champ.\n\nTears were rolling down his face as his rivals were all over him shortly before the awarding ceremony.\n\nFor the second straight Olympics, the Philippine national anthem was played in the greatest sporting show on earth.\n\nYulo ruled his pet event, with a chance to become an Olympic double-gold winner as he's also vying in the vault final Sunday.\n\nIt would have been a brighter golden Saturday for Team Philippines if not for the sorry split decision loss by 57kg boxer Carlo Paalam to an Australian foe over at the Paris North Arena.\n\nAdding to the joy was EJ Obiena overcoming a faulty start and thundering to the pole vault final at the Stade de France.\n\nThe biggest cheers belonged to Yulo, the newest member of a short list of Filipino Olympic medalists, joining fellow gold winner Diaz (also with a silver), silver winners Anthony Villanueva, Onyok Velasco, Nesthy Petecio and Paalam, and bronze holders Teofilo Yldefonso, Simeon Toribio, Jose Villanueva, Miguel White, Leopoldo Serantes, Roel Velasco and Eumir Marcial.\n\nWith Yulo's feat, the Olympic medal streak of the country continued from Diaz' silver feat in 2016 in Rio to the 1-2-1 gold-silver-bronze breakthrough in 2021 in Tokyo and to these Games where Team Philippines is in a good position to even strike harder, punch stronger and soar higher.\n\nEarly Sunday, Aira Villegas will seek a spot in the women's 50kg semifinals for a sure bronze.\n\nPaalam missed the same in a 2-3 loss to Australian Charlie Senior. The Bukidnon bet would have made history as the first Filipino boxer to collect two Olympic medals if not for the shock fall. With two bronzes was swimmer Yldefonso.\n\nYulo, however, quickly soothed the pain and heartaches felt by the Nationals' on Paalam's loss.\n\nA pocket number of Filipinos inside the grand Paris arena by the River Seine and millions watching on television back in the country celebrated with Yulo as he took his place among the best -- a spot in the pantheon of Filipino sporting greats.\n\nBeating other finalists Jake Jarman of Great Britain, Illia Kovtun of Ukraine, Milad Karimi of Kazakhstan, Luke Whitehouse also of Great Britain, and Zhang Boheng of China, Yulo's name will now live in the hearts of Filipinos and in Philippine sports lore for a long, long time.\n\nDolgopyat took the silver while Jarman, a Filipino-British, snared the bronze.", "source": {"uri": "philstar.com",

Under Republic Act 10699, he will receive P10 million and an Olympic Gold Medal of Valor from the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC), along with additional benefits and discounts.\n\nThe House of Representatives, as stated by House appropriations panel chair Ako Bicol Party list Representative Zaldy Co, will grant P3 million.\n\nThe Philippine Olympic Committee has also pledged to provide Yulo with a house and lot, similar to the gesture made to the four Filipino medalists from Tokyo.\n\nAdditionally, Megaworld Corporation will award Yulo a fully furnished 2-bedroom condominium unit valued at P24 million at McKinley Hill in Bonifacio Global City. This follows the company's previous gesture in 2021, when it presented a fully furnished condominium unit worth P14 million to Diaz after her historic weightlifting win.\n\nMeanwhile, Vikings Luxury Buffet has also offered Yulo a lifetime free buffet.\n\nAs of now, various local businesses and restaurants have extended incentives to Yulo, and it is anticipated that he will receive even more support and recognition following his historic achievement at the Olympics for the Philippines.", "source": {"uri": "businessmirror.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessMirror"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Yulo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Yulo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Sports_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philippine Sports Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Representatives_of_the_Philippines", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "House of Representatives of the Philippines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_weightlifting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic weightlifting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ako_Bicol", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ako Bicol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philippine Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonifacio_Global_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bonifacio Global City"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaworld_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Megaworld Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_McKinley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William McKinley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condominium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Condominium"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://businessmirror.com.ph/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AP24216525761632-1160x773.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788543", "eventUri": "eng-9788543", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5529411764705883, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

I want to thank those who watched late at night, for those who prayed for us Philippine athletes.)\n\nYulo made history as the first-ever gymnast to give the Philippines a medal in the Summer Games and emerged as only the second athlete after Hidilyn Diaz to pluck a gold medal at the quadrennial event.\n\nThe 24-year-old bemedalled athlete did so by putting together a stunning 15.000-point outing that allowed him to edge out seven other competitors, which included two fierce athletes in defending gold medalist Artem Dolgopyat of Israel and qualifying round's top performer Jake Jarman of Great Britain.\n\nLooking back, Yulo was just thankful that he decided to continue when the going got tough.\n\nThree years ago, Yulo made his debut in the Tokyo Olympics but failed to step on to the podium.\n\nIn the floor exercise back then, he scored a dismal 13.566 in the qualification round and missed the finals cut despite flourishing in the same event in other international tournaments prior to his Tokyo trip.\n\nHowever, the Malate-born dynamo persevered and three years after, he already has a gold medal hanging around his neck.\n\n\"Sobrang overwhelming po ng experience na 'yun,\" Yulo shared about his gold medal run.\n\n\"Grabe lahat ng paghihirap, 'yung hard work. Sobrang thankful na hindi ako tumigil and grateful din sa Panginoon na binigyan niya ako ng lakas ng loob at pinrotektahan Niya po ako.\"\n\n(That was an overwhelming experience. All those hardships, hard work. I am thankful I did not stop and I'm grateful to God for giving me the strength and protection.)", "source": {"uri": "gmanetwork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GMA Network"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bea_micaller@gmanetwork.com", "name": "Bea Micaller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Yulo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Yulo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artistic gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accor_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accor Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GMA_Network", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GMA Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidilyn_Diaz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hidilyn Diaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philippine Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Jarman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Jarman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_artistic_qualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's artistic qualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artem_Dolgopyat", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artem Dolgopyat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://images.gmanews.tv/webpics/2024/08/YULO_GOLD5_2024_08_03_22_48_17.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788543", "eventUri": "eng-9788543", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2003-08-", "textStart": 84, "textEnd": 93}], "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Carlos Yulo, who already brought honors to the country by bagging World Championship golds and other medals in 2019 and 2021, achieved his dream and won a gold medal in floor exercise last Saturday at the Olympic Games in Paris.\n\nThe 24-year-old Yulo follows in the footsteps of weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz, who in July 2021 at the Summer Games in Tokyo became the first Filipino to win a gold medal since the Philippines joined the Olympics in 1924, which was also held in Paris.\n\nHaving shown the way, Diaz inspired other Filipino athletes to go for the gold. At the Tokyo Games three years ago, Yulo had faltered in his bid for an Olympic gold. Undeterred, he set his sights on Paris. Both Yulo and Diaz have presented similar formulas for the development of Olympians: determination, discipline and rigorous training.\n\nExcellence in sports also requires considerable resources and support to train in a proper environment over a prolonged period, during which an athlete's livelihood or formal schooling may be seriously disrupted. Hidilyn Diaz did not get that kind of support, and her financial struggles even prompted her to publicly seek training sponsorship in 2019. She was tagged by Malaca\u00f1ang as part of a conspiracy to destabilize and oust then president Rodrigo Duterte. But Diaz persisted on her own and trained abroad to propel herself to the top of her game.\n\nEven boxers, who have reaped honors although no Olympic gold so far for the country, typically depend initially on their own resourcefulness in obtaining what they need to advance in their field.\n\nCarlos Yulo's story highlights the importance of starting them young when it comes to athletics. He began honing his gymnastic skills reportedly at age seven, competing for the first time in a tournament when he was just eight years old. Yulo trained in earnest with support from the Gymnastics Association of the Philippines in Manila before moving to Japan in 2016 on a scholarship sponsored by the Japan Olympic Association. Despite the strenuous training, he was able to obtain a degree in literature from Teikyo University.\n\nWith his gold medal, Yulo can expect a P24-million condominium unit and possibly millions more in cash and kind mostly from the private sector. Apart from providing such incentives, the private sector also supports sports development, but athletics can use more resources. From spotting promising talents at an early age and developing their athletic potential, substantial resources and efficient management are needed for sports development. The victories of Hidilyn Diaz and now Carlos Yulo as well as the other medal winners in the Philippine team show that the investment is worth it.", "source": {"uri": "philstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Philstar.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidilyn_Diaz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hidilyn Diaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Yulo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Yulo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipinos", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filipinos"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_weightlifting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic weightlifting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaca\u00f1ang_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malaca\u00f1ang Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigo_Duterte", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rodrigo Duterte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_Association_of_the_Philippines", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics Association of the Philippines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japanese Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines_men's_national_basketball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philippines men's national basketball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Massive_Multiplayer_Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Massive Multiplayer Online", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://media.philstar.com/photos/2023/05/30/editorialdefault-1_2023-05-30_13-49-27.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788543", "eventUri": "eng-9788543", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

And in less than 24 hours, he won his second gold, dominating the men's artistic gymnastics vault on Sunday, August 4.\n\nFilipinos online were quick to congratulate Yulo, including local stars who expressed their elation on social media.\n\nIn a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter), Vice Ganda applauded Yulo for bringing immense honor and pride to the Philippines. The host-comedian also offered the athlete a complimentary access to his comedy club as a special treat.\n\nBroadway star Lea Salonga extended her congratulations via Instagram Story, writing, \"Congratulations! Mabuhay ka!\"\n\nActress Iza Calzado also congratulated Yulo in her Instagram story, sharing that she got emotional after hearing the national anthem being played at the Olympics. \"Watching you perform, win, and receive this honor truly made us proud. Thank you for inspiring us,\" she said.\n\nOn X, Actress Jodi Sta. Maria expressed her gratitude to Yulo for taking home a gold medal for the Philippines.\n\nDescribing Yulo's win as the \"most incredible news to start the week,\" host Bianca Gonzalez said that the athlete will serve as an inspiration to many Filipinos.\n\nBeauty queen Samantha Bernardo called Yulo's win as a \"dream come true.\" \"Please support our Filipino athletes more,\" she added.\n\nAfter congratulating Yulo, actress Agot Isidro asked if it would be possible if athletes competing in gymnastics, boxing, and weightlifting would now get more sponsorship and funding as compared to more popular sports in the country.\n\nDirector Tonet Jadaone also pointed out that it would be better if politicians and brands would start investing more on athletes when they're still training, instead of just giving prizes when delegates win the Olympics.\n\nIn a long post on X, host and athlete Gretchen Ho reflected on Yulo's previous Olympic experience, recalling his frustration with his performance on the floor exercise at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Despite being a world champion in his favored apparatus, Ho noted that Yulo let his nerves affect him. But, she said, the Paris 2024 Olympics marked a turning point for Yulo.\n\nMeanwhile, celebrities such as Anne Curtis, Rocco Nacino, Gabbi Garcia, Liz Uy, Rodjun Cruz, Bela Padilla, Carla Abellana, Inigo Pascual, Kim Rodriguez, and Dimples Romana left congratulatory messages on Instagram.\n\nYulo will receive an upgraded incentive package from Megaworld Corporation, including a fully furnished three-bedroom condo in McKinley Hill valued at 32 million pesos, along with a cash bonus of three million pesos.\n\nHe will also be awarded a 10 million pesos cash prize from the Philippine government, as stipulated by Republic Act 10699, and 3 million pesos from the House of Representatives. Additionally, he will receive a house and lot from the Philippine Olympic Committee, the Gold Medal of Valor from the Philippine Sports Commission, and various other incentives, including an unlimited buffet from Vikings and more. -with additional reports from Kila Orozco/Rappler.com", "source": {"uri": "rappler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rappler"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ysa_abad@rappler.com", "name": "Ysa Abad", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipinos", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Filipinos"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Yulo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Yulo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_Ganda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice Ganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lea_Salonga", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lea Salonga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Broadway theatre"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Bernardo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samantha Bernardo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodi_Sta._Maria", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jodi Sta.

He eventually competed in the Palarong Bansa with the National Capital Region team as a student of Do\u00f1a Aurora Quezon Elementary School. By 12 years old, he was the Palarong Pambansa individual all-around defending champion.\n\nThe Filipino gymnast later qualified for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, and reached the top 10 of the men's individual all-around final. He also became the first Filipino world champion by ruling the men's floor exercise.\n\nAfter Yulo won two Olympic gold medals, social media users raised questions about whether the gymnast would be receiving a second condominium unit from real estate company Megaworld Corporation as an incentive.\n\nMegaworld pledged a fully furnished two-bedroom unit in McKinley Hill valued at P24 million to Yulo after the gymnast obtained his first Olympic gold.\n\nSocial media users also expressed that more athletes should receive better financial support from the government.\n\nDespite the challenges, Yulo made several Filipinos proud and emotional, especially after the country's national anthem \"Lupang Hinirang\" once again played at the Olympics.", "source": {"uri": "rappler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rappler"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Yulo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Yulo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Men's_singles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Badminton at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's singles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_artistic_individual_all-around", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's artistic individual all-around"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_Quezon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aurora Quezon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palarong_Pambansa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palarong Pambansa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaworld_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Megaworld Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Manila", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metro Manila"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipinos", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Filipinos"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupang_Hinirang", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lupang Hinirang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_anthem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National anthem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Modern_Pentathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Modern Pentathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/08/2024-08-04T151647Z_481129062_UP1EK8416FWF2_RTRMADP_3_OLYMPICS-2024-ARTISTICGYMNASTICS-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788543", "eventUri": "eng-9788543", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

The Armenian won silver, while Britain's Harry Hepworth took the bronze at the Bercy Arena.\n\nYulo nailed his opening Dragulescu vault in the tuck position, taking just a small step backwards and was rewarded by the judges with a huge score of 15.433 points. His second vault earned him 14.800, giving him an average of 15.116 and after the event's final results were announced, Yulo put his hands on his head and exhaled in disbelief, bowing in gratitude before the crowd.\n\n\"Winning yesterday took away all of my stress,\" the elated Filipino told reporters.\n\n\"Today I was more chilled and relaxed.

Yulo's near-flawless final run, featuring a front full into a three-and-a-half twist, garnered 15.000 points to win his country's first gymnastics gold.\n\nDefending champion Artem Dolgopyat of Israel settled for the silver this time while Great Britain's Jake Jarman took the bronze.\n\nDolgopyat set the pace with 14.966 points. The unfazed Yulo opened with a two-and-a-half twist to front double pike when his turn came. Then, he went into a front double full to front double tuck.\n\nAfter a full-twisting double, a sure-footed landing made it clear he was the contender to watch. When he stuck his final landing, the double world champion punched the air with both fists, let out a huge roar and then saluted the applauding crowd that had leapt to their feet.\n\nWhen the final score flashed on the big screen at Bercy Arena, the 24-year-old broke down in tears after matching the achievement of weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz, who won the country's first-ever gold at the Covid-delayed 2020 Tokyo Games.\n\n\"I'm so overwhelmed. I'm feeling grateful for having this medal and for God. He protected me, as always,\" said Yulo in disbelief to be the first man to win gold for The Philippines. Yulo, who trained for seven years in Japan due to a lack of opportunities back home, said he hoped his historic win would help the sport grow in his Southeast Asian country.\n\n\"We are a really small country and the portion of athletes is not the same as the US or UK, so to be able to get a gold medal is really big for us,\" the two-time Olympian said after. \"I dedicate this to the Filipinos who supported me. I'm really grateful to them.\"\n\nHe has a chance to earn another medal in the vault final on Sunday.

I remembered all the trials in my life and I thanked God that He never let me down\" said Yulo, his eyes still red due to non-stop crying after winning the gold in the floor exercise - his signature event.\n\nIt was in this event where he first shot into international prominence after winning the gold in the World Championships in 2019 in Stuttgart, Germany\n\nRecalling that brilliance, Yulo produced an eye-popping 15.000 score -- thanks to a 6.6 degree of difficulty and 8.400 in execution.\n\nThe marked improvement in the degree of difficulty - from 6.2 to 6.6 - spelled the difference.\n\nUnlike in the all-around where he ended up 12th among 24 finalists, Yulo performed without hesitation this time around.\n\n\"Actually, I adjusted my score in the qualification for me to qualify safely and because it was really stressful for my body as well as for my mind,\" said Yulo. \"On the final, I just went for it and did not hesitate.\"\n\nBut he admitted having some troubled nights before the big moment, saying: \"I was nervous for two days thinking about my performance.\"\n\nIt was evident in his first landing as he almost wobbled after doing a spectacular routine.\n\nBut as soon he got his rhythm everything went into motion perfectly - smooth like silk.\n\nHis routines - 2.5 twist to front double pike and front double full to double front, triple twist side pass, front layout to full front 2.5 twist - were a joy to watch.\n\nEven those inside the massive arena let out a long and wild applause after he ended his magical performance with a 3.5 twist.\n\nWhat made Yulo's win the more impressive was he dethroned Tokyo Games champion Artem Dolgopyat of Israel, who tallied 14.966, and Fil-British Jake Jarman who produced 14.933.\n\nJarman was picked heavily to rule the event after topping the prelims with a score of 14.966, but it was Yulo who delivered the most enthralling show, what with his aerial artistry.\n\nYulo's gold medal was second by the country in 100 years of participation or three years since weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz reigned supreme in the Covid-delayed 2020 Tokyo Games.\n\nThis could be a life-changing feat for Yulo as financial rewards are expected to come left and right when he goes home.", "source": {"uri": "mb.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manila Bulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickie_Bachmann", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dickie Bachmann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Yulo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Yulo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Tolentino", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abraham Tolentino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Sports_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philippine Sports Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_difficulty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Degree of difficulty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philippine Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Artistic_Gymnastics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Artistic Gymnastics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Jarman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Jarman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karate at the 2020 Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artem_Dolgopyat", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artem Dolgopyat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidilyn_Diaz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hidilyn Diaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_weightlifting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic weightlifting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://images.mb.com.ph/production/AP_24216522662516_d8139e380b.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788543", "eventUri": "eng-9788543", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-03", "textStart": 303, "textEnd": 309}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 589, "textEnd": 595}], "sentiment": 0.6000000000000001, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

When he was young, his grandfather, Rodrigo Frisco, observed how the then seven-year-old Yulo would do cartwheels and tumbles at a local playground, prompting him to bring Carlos to the Gymnastics Association of the Philippines (GAP) facility in Manila.\n\nYulo started competing in 2008 and joined his first Palarong Pambansa in Tacloban the following year -- a multisport event for elementary and high school students across the country. Representing NCR, Yulo was part of the team that won gold, while claiming silver in floor exercise and fifth in individual all-around. Yulo stated later on that these finishes further fueled his desire to train harder.\n\nAnd the rest, they say, is history. Yulo went on to win multiple medals -- from the Palarong Pambansa, to the Philippine National Games and the ASEAN School Games.\n\nYears passed and the demand to intensify his training that would be par to international standard beckons. Japanese coach Munehiro Kugimiya then took Yulo under his wings in 2016, while also accepting a scholarship program in Japan to further bolster his skills.\n\nKugimiya and Yulo made a great pair as the latter notched high honors in multiple apparatuses throughout the years, including in his pet event - vault.\n\nFrom there, Kugimiya honed Yulo to become an elite athlete, making heads turn in the 2018 Doha world championships with a bronze in floor exercise before winning the historic gold in the floor exercise in the 2019 edition in Stuttgart, Germany.\n\nHis feat in Stuttgart also earned him a berth for the Tokyo Olympics -- becoming the first Filipino gymnast to qualify since Ernesto Beren and Norman Henson in the 1968 Mexico edition.\n\nAfter his failed medal bid in the Tokyo Games, Yulo recovered in time to win the 2021 world championship gold in vault and silver in parallel bars. He also won silver in vault and bronze in parallel bars in the 2022 Liverpool edition. In between these, he also collected multiple medals in the Asian Championships, the Southeast Asian Games and the FIG world Cup.\n\nBut their partnership didn't last when Yulo parted ways with Kugimiya in 2023, and continued to train with his new coach Allen Aldrin Casta\u00f1eda, a Cebuano native.\n\nCasta\u00f1eda, GAP chief Cynthia Carrion and her girlfriend Chloe Anjeleigh San Jose escorted Yulo in Paris, giving him morale boosters and a dose of inspiration.\n\nAnd as Yulo, who armed with an even more matured mindset, rewrote the history, surpassing Hidilyn Diaz-Naranjo's golden lift in Tokyo as he will bring home two shiny gold medals -- which has a small portion of the famed Eiffel Tower -- from the glitzy Fashion capital of the world.\n\n\"Kailangan mo talagang aralin 'yong sarili mo, hindi lang basta 'yong gymnastics,\" said Yulo. \"Kailangan maging open ka, flexible ka sa buhay, hindi lang talaga sa sports.\"\n\nYulo made every problem, agony and heartbreak count, so he can be ready for the better days when they come. Indeed. Great things happened for those who wait - while continuing their grind.", "source": {"uri": "mb.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manila Bulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Then had a front double full to front double tuck. He had slight hops at the end of both. But after a full-twisting double layout, he stuck another landing and it was clear he was in the middle of something special.\n\n\"I did not hesitate. I just went for it,\" Yulo told journalists after the medal ceremony.\n\nMegaworld's gift\n\nIn a statement shortly after Yulo's victory, the property giant Megaworld Corp. gave the first glimpse of the windfall that awaits the latest Filipino sports hero upon his return home.\n\n\"As promised, we are giving Carlos Yulo a two-bedroom condo unit in one of our premier residential properties inside McKinley Hill in Taguig that will come furnished with appliances as well as furniture and fixtures, valued at approximately P24 million,'' said Megaworld Corp. president Lourdes Gutierrez-Alfonso.\n\n\"We are excited to welcome Caloy to his new home when he comes back!'' Alfonso said.\n\nYulo's triumph overshadowed an earlier victory by Nesthy Petecio, who smoked hometown bet Amina Zidani to reach the quarterfinals of the women's 57kg boxing event.\n\nAfter pawing gingerly at air in the first round, Petecio turned up the heat in the second, battering the No. 3 seed to score what looked like a knockdown that was counted by the referee.\n\n\"When she got hit with my hook, I really felt my fist hit her plus she got hurt with body shots. She really got hurt with those body shots,\" Petecio told local Olympics broadcaster OneSports after the bout at North Paris Arena.\n\nIn between those victories by Yulo and Petecio, EJ Obiena qualified for the pole vault final but Carlo Paalam was shown the door in the men's 57kg division after losing an ultra-tight quarterfinal duel against Australia's Charlie Senior.\n\nObiena cleared 5.75m in the pole vault preliminaries to join 11 other athletes in the final round.\n\nBoxer bows out\n\nThat 5.75 was the same standard cleared by nine other finalists, including world No. 1 and gold medal favorite Mondo Duplantis, but the Filipino will enter the final as the seventh seed via tiebreak.\n\nPaalam lost a 3-2 split decision to Senior after both fighters started out indecisively in the first round.\n\nPaalam began his attack in the second round to seize control of the match, launching combinations and landing clean shots against the game Senior, who managed to land effective but limited counters.\n\nBoth fighters fought evenly in the third, producing the result that would have been debatable even if the Filipino had won.\n\nPaalam was looking to win a second Olympic medal after finishing with a silver in Tokyo. Instead, he joins fellow eliminated boxers Eumir Marcial and Hergie Bacyadan on the sidelines, leaving the Philippines with two fighters left, Petecio and Aira Villegas.", "source": {"uri":

And he stayed there on top after all eight finalists were done, the last flash of the scores sparking a rush of emotion for the Filipino champ.\n\nTears were rolling down his face as his rivals were all over him shortly before the awarding ceremony.\n\nFor the second straight Olympics, the Philippine national anthem was played in the greatest sporting show on earth.\n\nYulo ruled his pet event with a chance to become an Olympic double-gold winner as he's also vying in the vault final Sunday.\n\nIt would have been a brighter golden Saturday for Team Philippines if not for the sorry split decision loss by 57kg boxer Carlo Paalam to an Australian foe over at the Paris North Arena.\n\nAdding to the joy was EJ Obiena overcoming a faulty start and thundering to the pole vault final at the Stade de France.\n\nThe biggest cheers belonged to Yulo, the newest member of a short list of Filipino Olympic medalists, joining fellow gold winner Diaz (also with a silver), silver winners Anthony Villanueva, Onyok Velasco, Nesthy Petecio and Paalam, and bronze holders Teofilo Yldefonso, Simeon Toribio, Jose Villanueva, Miguel White, Leopoldo Serantes, Roel Velasco and Eumir Marcial.\n\nWith Yulo's feat, the Olympic medal streak of the country continued from Diaz' silver feat in 2016 in Rio to the 1-2-1 gold-silver-bronze breakthrough in 2021 in Tokyo and to these Games where Team Philippines is in a good position to even strike harder, punch stronger and soar higher.\n\nAt night, Aira Villegas was to seek a spot in the women's 50kg semifinals for a sure bronze.\n\nPaalam missed the same in a 2-3 loss to Australian Charlie Senior. The Bukidnon bet would have made history as the first Filipino boxer to collect two Olympic medals if not for the shock fall.

Yulo is the first male and second gold medalist in the country's Summer Olympics history.ANALY LABOR\n\nThe House of Representatives' reward to gymnast Carlos Yulo has swelled to P6 million after he clinched his second gold medal in the men's vault at the 2024 Paris Olympics, just a day after he captured his first mint in the men's floor exercise.\n\nIn an ambush interview on Monday, Speaker Martin Romualdez confirmed that the House would double the initial P3 million cash incentive to Yulo in conformity with the chamber's commitment to reward Filipino Olympic gold medalists P3 million, while P2 million for silver, and P1 million for bronze.\n\n\"We feel that it's important to support and inspire all our athletes and to recognize their achievements. We're very, very proud of our medalists and we look forward to more medals during this Olympics and we're very inspired as [a] nation,\" Romualdez told reporters.\n\nThe 24-year-old Yulo made history by becoming a two-time gold Olympic medalist.\n\nFollowing a flawlessly executed routine in the men's floor exercise, he bagged his first gold on Saturday night (Philippine time), scoring 15.000 points. He outperformed Tokyo 2020 champion Artem Dolgopyat of Israel by merely 0.034 points and Great Britain's Jake Jarman -- a half-blooded Filipino -- who earned 14.933 points.\n\nKeeping the momentum, Yulo then wowed the crowd in Bercy Stadium in a stunning performance late Sunday in the men's vault, scoring 15.166 points, pushing vault's main man Artur Davtyan for the silver with 14.966 points.\n\nIn addition to the P6 million reward from the House, Yulo will also receive additional cash incentives from a fundraising campaign initiated by Romualdez among his colleagues in the chamber.\n\n\"We will continue to support and invest in our sports programs to nurture and develop more world-class athletes like Caloy. His success is a shining example of hope and a source of inspiration for all of us,\" Romualdez remarked.\n\nThe House chief also disclosed that he ordered the concerned committees to initiate discussions on passing a bill that would institutionalize the grant of more financial incentives and other benefits to Filipino Olympic medalists, including lifetime pension when they hit the retirement age of 40.\n\nA day after Yulo's back-to-back monumental victory, the House Committee on Ways and Means approved a consolidated bill providing tax exemptions for donations to national athletes competing in international sports competitions.\n\nPanel chairperson, Albay Rep. Joey Salceda, one of the measure's proponents (House Bill 421), highlighted the hardships and challenges that Filipino athletes, including Yulo, hurdled before reaching the pinnacle of their careers.\n\n\"A 12-year-old Carlos Yulo once gave an interview where he said that his dream was to win a gold medal for the Philippines in the Olympics. It took him more than a decade to reach that goal in the grandest manner possible,\" he said.\n\n\"What that teaches us is that the prize is never won on the day of the competition itself but years before. Hard work, determination, and sheer grit through many years of training wins over talent.\"\n\nAccording to Salceda, the panel-approved bill, which he called the \"Hidilyn Diaz Act\" last Congress, exempts not just the prizes handed out by brands and companies after the win but also exempts donations toward their training one year before the competition.\n\nApart from exempting donations one year prior to the date of the competition, Salceda proposed that donations through the Philippine Sports Commission or the Philippine Olympic Committee be made exempt from tax regardless of time.\n\n\"In fact, I would like to forward to you an additional proposal: that we not just exempt donations towards their training for one year, but to exempt donations from tax for their entire training, provided that such donations are made through the Philippine Olympic Committee or the Philippine Sports Commission,\" the economist-lawmaker said.\n\n\"At the proper time, that can be introduced in the plenary. But let me emphasize this once again: it is mere tokenism, it is mere public relations, to ride the bandwagon when the victory has already been achieved. What we need to incentivize is the investments being made on the athletes who are still working on winning medals for the country.\"", "source": {"uri": "tribune.net.ph", "dataType": "news", "title":

Gymnast Carlos Edriel Yulo delivered two straight Olympic golds. (Yes, you've read that sentence right.)\n\nTwo female boxers, flyweight Aira Villegas and featherweight and Tokyo Olympics silver medalist Nesthy Petecio, got assured bronze medals given their quarterfinal victories, while Yulo was scooping golds for two straight days.\n\nNever in the history of the quadrennial Olympic Games that this underdog Southeast Asian country enjoyed two straight days of winning Olympic gold medals -- of hauling multiple medals -- to outleap itself as a sporting nation.\n\nDifficult routines as gold mines\n\nAugust 3 and 4 did belong to the 24-year-old Yulo, whose 6.600 and 6.000 start-up difficulty scores in the floor exercises and the vault, respectively, led to his homeland's best Olympic Games outing ever.\n\nSince Yulo started winning world-level medals at the 2018 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Doha, Paris 2024 saw Yulo reach his peak -- exactly what former Japanese coach Munehiro Kugiyama predicted some five years ago.\n\nYulo's 15.116 in the vault is his highest score ever in the apparatus, propelled by a 15.433 on his first vault.\n\n\"First vault is amazing,\" said International Gymnast Magazine on its annotation. Yulo did a \"Ri II\" (named after North Korean vaulter Ri Se Gwang), which is \"a piked\" version of the Dragulescu -- a handspring double somersault, with one's legs tucked to a gymnast's chest area, and ending with a half-twist upon landing.\n\nRi II, a front handspring front double-piked somersault with a half twist, was what Yulo did. Upon falling down, Yulo held his piked position \"strongly,\" as the Olympic Games broadcast commentators noticed. His left foot just barely touched the center line in a nice landing.\n\n\"Good form, good height, good landing, just a tiny hop - the score should be big,\" IGM annotated.\n\nNobody came close to Yulo's first vault score, that being the push to just make ensure that he lands nicely in his final vault. The 15.433 is Yulo's best-ever vault.\n\nCome his final vault, Yulo did a Kasumatsu (beginning with a quarter-turned position prior to thumping the vault happening on his right, then he made two twists even if his right knee got slightly bent toward landing).\n\nBut the landing of Yulo, even with a hop \"holds it there, to make sure it is just a single step,\" IGM said.\n\nThe total's 14.800, just enough for his 15.116 average and the second gold medal.\n\nDifficulty in outleaping Olympic nerves\n\nThe first gold's the nail-biter. Given Yulo's 6.600 difficulty start-up score, he started off with a 2 \u00bd twist then a double pike, with just a small hop. Then he made a front double full-to-front double tuck, even if Yulo made a bigger hop.\n\nThe middle part of the routine then saw Yulo do a neat full-twisting double layout stuck, then he upped the ante with a triple twist on the side. The second-to-the-last pass saw Yulo do a full Randi, then got that tiny hop on his left side.\n\nThe final pass was a 3 \u00bd twist and he thudded the floor with his feet straight. \"Argh!,\" Yulo said, raising both clenched fists to the air.\n\n\"We are going to have a new Olympic champion here!\" IGM annotated.\n\n\"Before I came here, this routine wasn't that consistent. In the qualifications, I played it very safely,\" Yulo told International Gymnast Magazine after his performance.\n\n\"Today, I felt I couldn't hold back and hesitate. If I really wanted to win, I needed to give my everything... I really wanted to achieve this.\"\n\nYulo's years of doing that 6.600 floor routine, after the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and the 2021 World Championships, finally hit paydirt.\n\nJust when most Filipinos in the motherland slept given a six-hour time difference, Aira Villegas confronted a raucous hometown crowd and got a sure bronze medal in a 3-2 upset of seventh seed Wassila Lkhadiri of France to end August 3.\n\nNerves came after round two scores were flashed: a judge apiece, and three similar 19-all scores for Villegas and Lkhadiri. When the 3-2 verdict was howled, Villegas jumped twice in the air, then pounded the middle of the ring twice, in relief and in glee.\n\nPetecio gets the ball rolling\n\nNesthy Petecio then started off the August 4 medal haul by dominating Zichun Xu of China, 5-0.\n\nXu upset tournament top seed Irma Testa of Ireland in the round-of-32. But Petecio showed the class of her boxing that won the silver in Tokyo 2020.\n\nAnd the Philippines' Olympic boxing odyssey, currently taken over by women, continues with now 10 medals -- even if there's no gold medal yet.\n\nTo earn silver medals, Villegas must overcome Buse Naz \u00c7akiroglu of Turkey this August 6, while Petecio needs to stop Julia Szeremeta of Poland on August 7.\n\nThe women's flyweight finals are set for August 9, and that of the featherweight class August 10 -- two straight days that Villegas and Petecio hope to make it.\n\nA third straight Philippine Olympic medal day?\n\nIf World No. 2 pole vaulter Ernest John Obiena lands a medal in his final round on August 5 (Paris time), that's another Philippine Olympic first: three straight days of medal hauling, and a fifth Olympic medal.\n\nWhat's a third feat for the Philippines is three straight Olympic Games editions of winning a medal: 1928-1932-1936 being the first one (five bronzes), and 1988-1992-1996 being the second one (a silver and two bronzes, plus a gold and two bronzes in non-counted demonstration sports).\n\nThe nation was in euphoria over weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz's silver medal in Rio de Janeiro 2016 and her dramatic 2020 gold medal feat in Tokyo, with the latter complementing silver medals from Petecio and Carlo Paalam and a bronze medal from Eumir Felix Marcial (all boxers).\n\nThen Paris 2024 came along, the centennial of the Philippines' first Olympic participation.\n\nBut for now, two straight days of medal hauling -- and gold medal scooping by Southeast Asia's best gymnast Yulo -- is the Philippines' greatest memory at the Olympic Games.", "source": {"uri": "philstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Philstar.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Its impact more than amounted to his world title triumphs in 2019 and 2021.\n\nThe intense feeling can compare, perhaps, to the feeling of having finally speared the love of your life.\n\nTo every athlete, nothing beats Olympic glory.\n\nEqually dramatic was when Yulo won his second gold in the vault events the next day, coming after a tension-filled wait for his last four opponents to complete their performances.\n\nPerforming fourth among eight finalists, Yulo took the lead after his two smashing vault executions, both coming in near-flawless fashion.\n\nThere was an anxious moment when the last performer appeared to have nailed the winning act.\n\nBut when the final scores showed Yulo the winner, euphoria erupted in the Filipino's camp, with our ace gymnast embracing his Filipino coach, Aldrin Casta\u00f1eda, amid cheering and hoopla.\n\n\"I'm so happy I made it as I am still in celebration mode after yesterday's win,\" said Yulo in Filipino. \"I haven't almost slept a wink last night.\"\n\nSee?

Today, there's no other who can answer to a call \"Olympic Double-Gold Winner!\"\n\n\"It's just so overwhelming,\" said Mr. Yulo.\n\nBut the nagging question is what makes Mr. Yulo different? What sets him apart from the rest?\n\nIt's not thrown at him exactly in his hours of triumphs as he has always got a ready answer -- enduring trials of life, making the most of his experiences and accepting anything God has to give.\n\n\"I did not give up on the challenges. I am thankful to the Lord that he gave me this experience, this life and this opportunity to play in such big competition,\" said Mr. Yulo after winning his first gold.\n\n\"(I've gone through) lots of experiences that are pretty tough for me, not only in gymnastics but in personal life.

There's also his split with his Japanese coach Munehiro Kugiyama.\n\nAll these that he'd rather not discuss.\n\n\"I'm just grateful to God. I'm grateful I didn't stop and grateful He gave me hope and He gave me people who truly believe and trust me,\" he said, making special mention of his partner Chloe San Jose and her family.\n\n\"I really need to work on my personality not just in gymnastics but on how I view life. I need to work on myself to learn and accept what I can do and trust the process for me and my mental health,\" he added.\n\nRedemption from the Tokyo slip?\n\n\"It's not revenge anymore like in 2022.

Enjoy it,\" beamed Ms. Diaz-Naranjo in the wee hours of Sunday when the Philippines was wide awake after Mr. Yulo secured his place in the books after a couple of misses and heartbreaks.\n\nIt was only two years ago when Ms. Diaz-Naranjo finally shattered the floodgates for the sports-crazed Filipino nation, fueling the drive of local athletes.\n\nIt did not take long for a follow-up on that trail with Mr. Yulo, after a heartbreaking fourth-place finish in Tokyo to miss the podium by 0.017 point, taking care of business in the Philippines' 100-year anniversary of Olympic participation.\n\nIn Paris, even the members of the 22-strong Philippine delegation tuned in, either from the Athletes Village or at the venue proper, to Mr. Yulo's golden leap.\n\n\"Our first Paris Olympics Gold Medal. Congratulations,\" said Mr. Marcial, a bronze medalist in Tokyo but had an early exit in Paris.\n\nFollowing his glory in France that became a trending topic on all social media platforms worldwide, Mr. Yulo became a rockstar with lines of foreigners trying to get a photo opportunity and secure a photograph.\n\nBack home where a truckload of rewards await him, he's a hero for an army of Filipinos, who will rally behind him once more in his quest for a second gold medal in the vault finals.", "source": {"uri": "bworldonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessWorld"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipinos", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filipinos"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_weightlifting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic weightlifting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.bworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Carlos-Yulo-e1722751889641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788543", "eventUri": "eng-9788543", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Francis Tolentino filed Senate Resolution Numbers (SRN) 1102 and 1106. SRN 1102 would hail Yulo for winning the gold medal twice while SRN 1106 would give Yulo the Senate Medal of excellence.\n\n\"Ito ay mahalagang hakbang upang kilalanin at ipagdiwang ang tagumpay ng bansa.

Caloy's win is not just proof of his dedication and greatness, but also of Filipinos' excellence and talent when it comes to the world stage!)\n\nSenate President Pro Tempore Jinggoy Ejercito Estrada filed similar resolutions.\n\n\"Yulo's outstanding achievement at the world's biggest sporting event should be celebrated by the entire nation as it is a testament to the excellent skill and unyielding spirit of the Filipinos. His glorious success is a shining example of what hard work, discipline, perseverance, and commitment to excellence can accomplish,\" Estrada said SRN 1103.\n\nEstablished in 2021, the Senate Medal of Excellence is awarded for Filipinos with exceptional achievements in the following international bodies: Nobel Prize, Pulitzer Prize, the A.M. Turing Award, the Ramon Magsaysay Award and the Olympics.\n\nLast Saturday, senators took to social media to greet Yulo during his first win, and had to greet him the next day when he won again.\n\n\"Our golden boy. Maraming salamat, Carlos Yulo, para sa dangal at saya na binibigay mo para sa Pilipinas! Mabuhay ka!,\" Sen. Risa Hontiveros said when Yulo won his second gold.\n\n(Our golden boy. Many thanks, Carlos Yulo, for the honor and joy that you gave to the Philippines. Mabuhay ka!)\n\nSen. Bong Go posted a video of him watching Yulo get his second win on Facebook.\n\n\"Galing, sabi ko, go, go go for gold! (Excellent! I said go, go go for gold!)\" Go said.\n\nSen. Pia Cayetano also congratulated Yulo.\n\n\"You are a shining example of what hard work and dedication can do! Proud to be your supporter since your training for the 2019 SEA (Southeast Asia) Games,\" Cayetano said.\n\nAccording to the Philippine Sports Commission, three senators pledged financial support for Paris-bound Filipino athletes. Go pledged P30 million, Hontiveros pledged P22 million and Cayetano gave an undisclosed amount of money.\n\nMeanwhile, Filipina boxers Aira Villegas and Nesthy Petecio were both guaranteed at least bronze medals in women's boxing. This marks the first time that the Philippines will bring home multiple medals in consecutive Olympics bouts.\n\nIn the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, the Philippine team brought home four medals (one gold, two silver and one bronze).

The medal round is scheduled early Tuesday (PH time).\n\nYulo capturing the gold made up for boxer Carlo Paalam's farewell from medal contention at Paris North Arena in the nearby city of Villepinte.\n\nPaalam could not sustain a solid first round and fell prey to Australian opponent Charlie Senior in the men's 57-kilogram quarterfinals.\n\nThe bout was tight almost all nine minutes with Paalam showing his accuracy and solid evasion and Senior making good use of his height and reach advantage.\n\nThe verdict, though, was ultimately decided by Irish judge Ben McGarrigle, who gave Round 3 to Senior after scoring it 19-all in the other rounds, sending Paalam home without a medal after a silver in Tokyo.\n\nVillegas enters semis\n\nAira Villegas assured the Philippines of a second medal in the Paris Olympics after stunning host country's Wassila Lkhadiri in a tight women's flyweight boxing quarterfinal battle early Sunday (PH time) at the Paris North Arena in Villepinte.\n\nVillegas exerted enough effort to convince the judges that she was better than Lkhadiri en route to a razor-thin split decision win.\n\nShe earned the nod of three judges (29-28, 29-28, 29-28) while the other two scored for the French (30-27, 29-28).\n\nVillegas said all her matches will be for teammates Carlo Paalam, Eumir Marcial, and Hergie Bacdayan, who are out of medal contention.\n\n\"Inaalay ko rin 'to sa mga kasamahan ko, kina Eumir, Hergie, tapos kay Carlo kanina. Nalungkot ako pero sabi ko kailangan ko siyang gawing motivation para ibawi 'yung kasamahan ko (I dedicate this to Eumir, Hergie, and Carlo. I feel sad for them but I'm using it as my motivation to make up for their losses),\" Villegas told One News.\n\nAssured of at least a bronze hours after Yulo got the Philippines to the medal board with his floor exercise gold, Villegas can upgrade her medal to a sure silver if she beats Turkey's Buse Naz Cakiroglu in the semifinals early Wednesday (PH time) as action shifts to the iconic Roland Garros Stadium in downtown Paris.\n\nUnlike Villegas, Cakiroglu entered the semifinals smoothly with a unanimous decision win over Finland's Pihla Kaivo-Oja.\n\nYulo's gold enabled the Philippines to beat all its Southeast Asian neighbors to the medal table.\n\nIt was the Philippines' first medal in Paris and the first of any color from a gymnast.\n\nA total of 58 nations were already on the medal board as of 3 a.m. Sunday - from leader China's 16-11-9 gold-silver-bronze to a lone bronze apiece by bottom countries Austria, Egypt, Jamaica, Lithuania, Portugal, and Slovakia.\n\nThe Philippines was in the company of Argentina, Ecuador, Slovenia, Serbia and Uganda with a lone medal (gold) to show since the quadrennial Games opened on July 26.\n\nThe United States had climbed to No. 2 with 12-21-20, France to No. 3 with 12-14-15 and Australia dropped to fourth from No. 2 with 12-7-5.\n\nGreat Britain remained fifth at 10-10-12, while Asian nations Republic of Korea (9-7-5) and Japan (8-5-9) occupy sixth and seventh.\n\nHero's welcome\n\nThe City of Manila, meanwhile, is preparing a hero's welcome for the Filipino Paris Olympics gold medalist.\n\nMayor Honey Lacuna said Sunday the city will give a huge welcome for Yulo, an Outstanding Manilan awardee.\n\n\"The City of Manila is already preparing a hero's welcome for Carlos Yulo because we are immensely proud of our Manile\u00f1o from Leveriza, Malate,\" she said in a statement.\n\nThe city government will also award the golden boy financial reward and other recognition.\n\n\"The grandest welcome will greet him and all our Paris Olympians. When we meet him, we will present Carlos Yulo cash incentives, awards, and symbols of the eternal gratitude of the proud Capital City of the Philippines,\" she said.\n\nLast May, the City Council adopted Resolution No. 388, recognizing Yulo and his younger brother, Karl Eldrew, for their victories at the Artistic Gymnastics Asian Championships in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. / PNA", "source": {"uri":

Carlos Edriel Yulo of Philippines reacts after performing in the floor exercise finals.\n\nCarlos Yulo has a chance to achieve what no one has done before in Philippines' Olympic history: bag two gold medals in a single Summer Games appearance.\n\nThe 24-year-old Filipino gymnast, who is probably still on a high following his gold medal run in the floor finals just last night, will attempt to secure another medal when he sees action in the men's vault finals on Sunday at 10:24 p.m. at the Bercy Arena.\n\nA little over 24 hours removed from his breathtaking 15.000-point showing on the floor, Yulo will look to further etch his name in the history as he plunges into the vault finals, which will see him go up against tough competitors.\n\nYulo finished sixth during the qualification round with 14.683 markers, but enough to qualify for the finals alongside seven other gymnasts, which include Filipino-British Jake Jarman.\n\nJarman, who bagged the bronze medal during the floor finale, wound up fifth in the vault preliminaries with 14.699 points while 2023 World Championship vault bronze medalist Nazar Chepurnyi of Ukraine is the top seed with 14.833.\n\nAlso in the fold are Jarman's compatriot Harry Hepworth of Great Britain, 2012 Olympic vault bronze medalist Igor Radivilov of Ukraine, 2021 Olympic vault bronze medalist Artur Davytan of Armenia, 2022 Asian Games vault silver medalist Mahdi Olfati of Iran, and Aurel Benovic of Croatia.\n\nYulo is looking to complete yet another redemption in the vault after falling just short of a podium finish in the previous Summer Games, In Tokyo three years ago, Yulo qualified for the vault finals, but only managed to rack up 14.716 points in the medal round to finish fourth overall.", "source": {"uri":

He went home with the silver with a 14.966 total, getting undone after difficulty of just 5.60 for each vault.\n\nHarry Hepworth, who set the pace early, fell to bronze while his fellow Briton Jake Jarman was bumped off the podium after the Davtyan score was posted.\n\nTeam PH had one gold courtesy of weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz, and two silvers and a bronze from three dogged pugs in Japan during the COVID-delayed edition.\n\nYulo's two victories have now certainly established a new sporting hero for the Philippines, which also toasted the win of Nesthy Petecio in the quarterfinals of the women's 57-kilogram division in boxing over China's Xu Zichun for a sure bronze medal.\n\nAnother female boxer in Aira Villegas is also assured of a bronze, with EJ Obiena, the world's second-ranked

His association with sports betting app Arena Plus, where he serves as a brand ambassador, could also bring additional surprise rewards.\n\nHe is also set to receive cash incentives from the Philippine Olympic Committee and a personal gift of a house and lot in Tagaytay from POC president Bambol Tolentino.\n\nThe scale of Yulo's incentives mirrors the significant rewards received by previous Filipino Olympic champions. Weightlifting star Hidilyn Diaz, for instance, accumulated over P50 million in rewards following her gold medal win at the Tokyo Games in 2021.

Here are the stories for The Manila Times for Monday, August 5, 2024.\n\nToday's episode is brought to you by Wilcon Depot, The Philippines' leading home improvement and construction supplies retailer -- your Trusted Building Partner.\n\nREAD: Yulo gifts PH with 2nd gold\n\nGYMNAST Carlos \"Caloy\" Yulo has cemented his status as the greatest Filipino Olympian. About 24 hours after ruling the floor exercise final, Yulo conquered the vault competition at the Paris Olympics men's artistics gymnastics, emerging as the first Filipino Olympic multi-gold medalist at the Bercy Arena on Sunday night, Aug. 4 (Manila time). His confidence through the roof after delivering the Philippines first gymnastics Olympic medal on Saturday, the 4-foot-11 dynamo unleashed his magic anew to top the vault with an average score of 15.116 points. The 24-year-old dazzled with a high-level execution of dragulescu pike in his first vault, just needing a little hop to gain balance after his landing and netting 15.433 points -- 6.000 in difficulty and 9.433 in execution. Fourth to perform in the final, Yulo then executed a kasamatsu double in his second vault, which was not as good as his first vault but still solid for 14.800 points -- 5.600 in difficulty and 9.200 in execution. After each vault, Yulo, as he has been all tournament, threw his fists into the air in high satisfaction of his performance. When the last four performers wound up with lower scores, Yulo was once again in disbelief after pulling off an Olympic feat no other Filipino athlete has done before. With Yulo's two-gold haul, the Philippines will finish the Paris Games with at least four medals, the other two being guaranteed bronzes - one each for Nesthy Petecio and Aira Villegas. When Yulo comes home to the Philippines, he will get more than a hero's welcome -- he stands to receive at least 23 million pesos in incentives from the government and a posh condominium worth 24 million pesos from real estate giant Megaworld. A day before winning his second gold, Yulo delivered a dazzling performance that netted him 15.0 points and the gold medal at the Paris Olympics men's gymnastics floor exercise at the Bercy Arena on Saturday evening, August 3 (Manila time). The gold was the first medal for the Philippines in Olympic gymnastics.\n\nSPORTS: Obiena vies for medal in Paris Games\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nERNEST John \"EJ\" Obiena of the Philippines shoots for a medal as he competes at the Paris Olympics men's pole vault final at the Stade de France early Tuesday, August 6 (Manila time). The championship round is set at 1 a.m. here in Manila as Obiena tries to become the first Filipino medalist in Olympic athletics in 88 years. Miguel White was the last Filipino to have clinched a medal in Olympic athletics, claiming a bronze in the men's 400-m hurdles at the 1936 Berlin Games. Obiena also looks to follow the lead of gymnast Carlos Yulo who clinched the men's floor exercise gold medal on Saturday night, August 3, and boxer Aira Villegas who secured a bronze medal in the women's 50 kg after her quarterfinal victory early Sunday, August 4.\n\nREAD: Garcia dares critics: Shed parliamentary immunity\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other news, Commission on Elections (Comelec) Chairman George Erwin Garcia has challenged his critics to shed their parliamentary immunity by putting their allegations under oath. Sagip party-list Rep. Rodante Marcoleta and former Caloocan City representative Edgar Erice claimed that a Comelec official they did not name has 49 offshore accounts in 18 banks where supposed bribe money amounting to almost 1 billion pesos was deposited. They also alleged that the same official owned accounts in six local banks. Last week, Marcoleta named Garcia as the owner of two accounts in a New York bank where he claimed they were able to have deposited $100 each in two separate offshore accounts in the name of the Comelec chief.\n\nREAD: PCSO chief sues vlogger in US court\n\nPHILIPPINE Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) General Manager Melquiades Robles has filed defamation and invasion of privacy charges against vlogger Claire Contreras, known as \"Maharlika,\" before a United States court. In a press conference on Sunday, Robles said he decided to file the cyber complaints before the Central District Court of California after Contreras allegedly maligned his family in her vlogs. Robles said he and his wife, Sherwil, went to the US late last June to sue Contreras to \"stop her from continuously harassing and maligning\" them through her online vlog. Contreras, said to be a US citizen, has been dubbed as the \"queen of fake news\" by many social media users because of her criticisms against the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and other government officials. Robles said that for almost a year now, he and his family have been subjected by Contreras \"to an almost daily barrage of vicious, unjustifiable and blatantly false attacks through her YouTube channel called 'Boldyak' TV.\"\n\nREAD: 'Govt spends nearly P500M for VP security'\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHE government has spent nearly 500 million pesos for Vice President Sara Duterte's 433 security details, Presidential Adviser on Poverty Alleviation Larry Gadon said Sunday. He claimed that the vice president has maintained 433 security personnel for the past two years, each earning an estimated salary of 50,000 pesos monthly. Gadon also cited online data showing that the Office of the Vice President (OVP) spent 55 million pesos from 2022 to 2024 on special duty allowances for military and uniformed personnel. The presidential anti-poverty adviser told The Manila Times that he would have kept quiet on this issue if not for the \"ridiculous exaggeration of some people like Sen. Ronald 'Bato' de la Rosa calling on private citizen groups to augment the security of VP Sara as if there is a constant, imminent grave threat and danger to her life.\"\n\nBUSINESS: Growth likely higher in Q2\n\nOver to business, healthy domestic demand and increased government spending likely boosted economic growth in the second quarter, analysts said, while inflation could have breached the target last month due to higher energy and food costs. Consumer price growth figures for July will be released by the Philippine Statistics Authority on Tuesday, to be followed by preliminary gross domestic product (GDP) growth data for the April to June period on Thursday. Both indicators will be considered by monetary authorities when they meet next week to discuss whether to start cutting key interest rates. The median GDP growth estimate is 6.0 percent for the April to June period, an improvement from the first quarter's 5.7 percent and within the government's downwardly revised 6.0- to 7.0-percent target for this year. Inflation, meanwhile, is expected to have risen to 4.1 percent in July from 3.7 percent a month earlier.\n\nREAD: Opinion and editorial\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRigoberto Tiglao, Fr.

We hope his success will inspire the next generation of Filipino athletes to pursue their dreams with the same passion and determination,\" said chicken wholesaler Bounty Fresh executive Patricia Cheng-Lim.\n\nBounty has been supporting Filipino athletes since 2016 including Tokyo Games bronze medallist and boxer Eumir Marcial and gave Chooks-to-Go roast chicken stores to former Olympians Onyok Velasco and Roel Velasco.\n\nPhilippine Olympic Committee president Bambol Tolentino is also rewarding the the winners in Paris Olympics with a house and lot like what he did for Diaz and 2020 Tokyo Olympics silver medalists Nesthy Petecio and Carlo Paalam, and bronze medalist Eumir Marcial.\n\nYulo may also get a \"Senate Medal of Excellence\" as filed by Senate Majority Leader Francis Tolentino on Aug 5.\n\nLifetime benefits await Yulo with restaurants like Vikings and Tipsy Pig extending free meals.\n\nMore is expected to pour in the coming days for Yulo, who stands alone in the country's history, with other brands like Milo, which has been supporting grassroots sports in the country, posting a heartfelt message about the gymnast's greatness.\n\nWhen Tokyo 2020 weightlifting champion Hidilyn Diaz ended the 97-year gold medal drought of the Philippines, she received over 50 million in incentives including several houses and lots, condo units, lifetime of free flights, gasoline, and other products.\n\nAside from monetary incentives, Yulo is also set for a hero's welcome in his hometown in Manila.\n\nThe remaining Filipino athletes including semi-finalists Nesthy Petecio and Aira Villegas and pole vault finalist EJ Obiena also have a chance to receive a cash incentive depending on their rankings.\n\nCoaches of the medallists will also receive a cash incentive as long as they have trained the athlete for more than six months.

It was a mockery of the Christian faith, they protested, condemning the presentation that included drag queens and a transgender model.\n\nWell, who doesn't like a redemption story -- how a young David can avenge their faith for all the world to witness?\n\nAfter raising hell over the Last Supper controversy, many Filipino Catholics hailed one of their own -- 24-year-old gymnast Carlos Yulo -- who won two gold medals over the weekend. He was the first double-gold medalist from Asia's biggest predominantly Catholic country, where more than 85 million people, or nearly 79% of the population, belong to the Catholic Church.\n\nThey pointed out how Yulo prayed before the Olympic games, made the sign of the cross, and attributed his victory to Divine Providence, declaring it was \"all God.\" In an interview with ABS-CBN News, Yulo said, \"God is really great, I'm so blessed by Him, and I'm well-protected and guided.\"\n\nThe famous National Shrine of Saint Padre Pio in Santo Tomas, Batangas, called Yulo a \"champion in God's heart.\"\n\nYulo, whom the shrine described as a \"proud Catholic,\" is \"an example of a faithful servant who always returns his glory to God.\" They said, \"May all of us continue to glorify God in all our battles in life.\"\n\nThe Facebook page Servant Chronicles, which has 302,000 followers, declared in a tribute to Yulo, \"To god be all the glory!\"\n\nThe page Millennial Catholics, which has 229,000 followers, said blessings abound for people like Yulo who know how to thank God. They also reposted a video of Yulo holding his second gold medal and pointing to the heavens: \"All God, all God. All God, all Him.\"\n\nThe Secular Male Institute of the Two Hearts of Jesus and Mary quoted the book of the Prophet Isaiah (60:22): \"When the time is right, I, the Lord, will make it happen.\"\n\nIndividual users, in public Facebook posts, also celebrated Yulo's victory while recalling the controversial Olympic skit.\n\nRyan Borja Capitulo said he \"was ready to forget about the Paris 2024 Olympics due to its numerous controversies,\" but the sign of the cross made by Yulo \"changed all that.\" He said, \"Thank you, Caloy, for giving honor to God and our Catholic faith on the Olympic stage! Thank you for giving honor to the Philippines! We are proud of you!\"\n\nWema Mojar praised Yulo's victory \"despite how woke and pagan\" the Olympics can be. \"All by the grace of God!\"\n\nCharles Legaspi also pointed out how Yulo made the sign of the cross. He said that in the face of \"the circus and controversy\" during the 2024 Olympics, \"it is truly refreshing to see a man who gratefully reveres the Lord winning the gold.\"\n\nIncidentally, the Philippines' first Olympic gold medalist, Hidilyn Diaz, is also known for her deep Catholic faith. She is remembered for wearing the Miraculous Medal of the Blessed Virgin Mary alongside her gold Olympic medal during the 2021 awarding ceremony.", "source": {"uri": "rappler.com", "dataType": "news",

The 24-year-old athlete's emotional victory at the Bercy Arena marked a significant milestone for the Philippines, securing only the second Olympic gold in the country's history.\n\nYulo's triumphant performance on Saturday resonated deeply as he tearfully celebrated his achievement, mirroring the elation felt across his nation. His flawless routine culminated in a confident landing, earning him a commendable score of 15.000 points and securing the Philippines' first-ever gymnastics Olympic medal.\n\nThe victory was particularly poignant as Yulo's gold medal mirrored the success of weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz, who had triumphed at the delayed 2020 Tokyo Games. Yulo's dedication and unwavering focus were evident as he executed his routine with precision and grace, surpassing his qualifying score with a remarkable display of athleticism.\n\nIn a competitive field that included defending champion Artem Dolgopyat of Israel and Britain's Jake Jarman, Yulo's performance shone brightly, capturing the hearts of spectators and judges alike. Dolgopyat, who clinched the silver medal, acknowledged the challenges he had faced in preparation, emphasizing the resilience and determination required to excel at the highest level of competition.\n\nAs Yulo basked in the glory of his gold medal win, he expressed gratitude for the support he had received and credited his faith for guiding him through his remarkable performance.", "source": {"uri": "dimsumdaily.hk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dimsum Daily"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dimsumdaily_hong_kong@dimsumdaily.hk", "name": "Dimsumdaily Hong Kong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Yulo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Yulo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artistic gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karate at the 2020 Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidilyn_Diaz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hidilyn Diaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_weightlifting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic weightlifting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Jarman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Jarman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artem_Dolgopyat", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artem Dolgopyat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://cdn.dimsumdaily.hk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/04100555/Carlos-Yulo-1-1.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788543", "eventUri": "eng-9788543", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.780392156862745, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

Sherwin Gatchalian said this historic win \"brings a special moment of pride for our country and proves that the Olympic gold is no longer elusive for Filipino athletes.\"\n\nBut according to Gatchalian, this should not stop here, leaving a huge task for Filipinos as a nation.\n\n\"Our task as a nation is to ensure that future generations of athletes have all the support they need to succeed the world stage. This is why we created the National Academy of Sports where promising young athletes will be honed to achieve their full potential,\" he said.\n\nREAD: Carlos Yulo's Olympic gold medal haul caps decade of struggle\n\nSen. Nancy Binay, meanwhile, considered Yulo as an example that \"we can strive to achieve balance in our lives despite the pursuit of glory.\"\n\n\"[H]indi kailangan isakripisyo ang pamilya at kaligayahan, na sa katotohanan ay makatutulong ang mga ito upang bigyan tayo ng kapanatagan, lakas, at tibay ng loob para harapin ang pinakamatinding hamon na hinaharap natin,\" she said.\n\n(There is no need to sacrifice family and happiness, which in fact can help give us comfort, strength, and courage to face the greatest challenges we face.)\n\n\"We all await your victorious return, and we will be sure to welcome you with all the warmth and pride that we can muster,\" she added.\n\nFor Sen. Lito Lapid, Yulo is a golden boy. He likewise deemed the Filipino gymnast as an \"inspiration for our nation thirsty for heroism.\"\n\n\"Taas noo nating ipagmalaki sa buong mundo ang talento ng mga Pilipino,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "sports.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inquirer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipinos", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Filipinos"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Tolentino", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Francis Tolentino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_the_Philippines", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Senate of the Philippines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Yulo", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Yulo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_Floor_Leader_of_the_Senate_of_the_Philippines", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Majority Floor Leader of the Senate of the Philippines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Artistic_Gymnastics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Artistic Gymnastics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upper house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lito_Lapid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lito Lapid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Binay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Binay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win_Gatchalian", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Win Gatchalian"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Rhythmic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Rhythmic", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Organizations", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://sports.inquirer.net/files/2024/08/000_36AA4RJ-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788543", "eventUri": "eng-9788543", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

The Greatest. With two gold medals, Carlos \"Caloy\" Yulo can be the King and Greatest Filipino athlete at the same time.\n\n\"What Caloy did for Philippine sports happened only once in a hundred years,\" said an ecstatic Philippine Olympic Committee (POC) president Abraham \"Bambol\" Tolentino. \"He will be on top of the conversation as the Philippines' greatest athlete.\"\n\nParis 2024 marked the 100th year anniversary of Philippines Olympic participation which, interestingly, was also in Paris 1924 with swimmer David Nepomuceno as the country's sole representative.\n\nHidilyn Diaz-Naranjo broke the gold medal drought with her victory in weightlifting in Tokyo 2020, but missed Paris because the women's 55 kgs is not in the Olympic program this time.\n\nYulo was a first-timer in Tokyo and failed to impact. Three years later, he did twice over and he couldn't forget that July 27 evening in 2021 at the Tokyo Olympic Village when he felt and touched every millimeter of Diaz-Naranjo's gold medal, even its lanyard.\n\n\"I won't forget that moment, when I was with Ate Hidilyn at the village and requested her to allow me to feel her gold medal,\" Yulo said. \"That stuck in my heart and mind and I told myself 'someday, it will be my turn, someday it will be me with a gold medal.\"\n\nExactly 1,104 days after Diaz-Naranjo triumphed at the Tokyo Dome, Yulo won the floor exercise for his first gold medal. After another sleepless night, he won his second in vault.\n\n\"Prayers answered,\" Tolentino said.\n\n\"God loves Caloy, Gods loves us all,\" said Cynthia Carrion-Norton, president of the Gymnastics Association of the Philippines.\n\n\"I'm very grateful to God, He gave me this one, He made me strong and healthy for these gold medals,\" Yulo said.\n\nWith Yulo's golds -- plus the guaranteed bronze medals of Nesthy Petecio and Aira Villegas which could be gold medals, too, if they win two more times in boxing -- the Philippines already overachieved from the Tokyo yield of one gold and the two silvers from Petecio and Carlo Paalam and bronze from Eumir Felix Marcial in boxing.\n\nThe Philippines shared 21st place in the medals table -- pending the two boxing medals -- with Azerbaijan and Serbia, the first time to see the country close to the top of the tally board.\n\nThe Philippines also is the best-placed Southeast Asian country with Malaysia and Indonesia having clinched a bronze medal each and Thailand and Singapore still to hit the tally board.\n\nSeventy of the 204 participating countries at Paris 2024 are on the board, including the Individual Neutral Athletes (Russia and Belarus), have at least a bronze medal nine days into the Olympics that closes on Monday.\n\n\"It was destiny shaped by everyone's efforts,\" Philippine Sports Commission chairman Richard Bachmann said Monday. \"We thank everyone's support as the nation celebrates these milestones.\"\n\nVillegas, meanwhile, goes for the gold medal bout when she fights Turkey's Buse Naz Cakiroglu at 10:18 p.m. on Tuesday (4:18 a.m. Wednesday in Manila), while Petecio aims for the same goal against Poland's Julia Szeremeta at 9:46 p.m. Wednesday (3:46 a.m. Thursday in Manila).", "source": {"uri":

Growing up in a country where basketball and boxing take the lead in Philippine sports, Yulo showed his great passion in pursuing to become a world-class gymnast.\n\nJust like in his recent win, Yulo showcased that athleticism, power, and artistry know no gender.

And when the athlete bagged his second gold, her home in Abu Dhabi erupted in cheers, with her mum jumping while holding a huge Philippine flag in their living room.\n\n\"Seeing Carlos win two gold medals made me want to train harder, work harder,\" Niegas told Khaleej Times.\n\nWithin just 24 hours, Yulo went from making history as the first Filipino gymnast to win in the Olympics to breaking his own record with another gold medal. His first gold was for the floor exercise final and the other was for the vault at the Paris Olympics.\n\nNiegas, a Filipino-Iraqi Year 9 student, is also a gymnast who has been winning tournaments around the world. Just last month, she won a gold medal for the UAE in an international competition in Egypt.\n\nThe next time she takes the floor, though, the rhythmic gymnast will be bearing the Philippine flag. Niegas has just joined the Philippine national team early this year, opening up new opportunities for her to enter bigger competitions that could eventually lead her to the Olympics.\n\nShe hasn't met Yulo yet but when she does, she said she would immediately ask him the big question: \"How did you do it?\"\n\nWatching from Dubai, another young Filipina gymnast was also cheering for Yulo.\n\nGabrielle Anne Opida Ramos, also 13, was holding her breath as she watched the Olympian do his routine.\n\n\"My stress level was through the roof because of how intense and close the scores of the other athletes were,\" Ramos told Khaleej Times.\n\n\"When I saw Carlos Yulo score 15.116, I was so happy and proud to see an amazing team player representing the Philippines. As a rhythmic gymnast, I would feel as joyful as he did seeing his hard work paying off,\" she said.\n\nRamos, an incoming Grade 9 student in Dubai, has loved gymnastics since she was 3 years old. She first learnt ballet and eventually moved to gymnastics.

Swimmer Teofilo Yldefonso, boxer Jose Villanueva and high jumper Simeon Toribio won a bronze each in the 1932 Los Angeles Games.\n\nThe Philippines also won a medal for the third consecutive Olympics, a period that began with Diaz's silver finish in Rio in 2016, marking the third time that the Philippines has done it in the cycle.\n\nFirst streak\n\nThe first was from the period of the 1928 Amsterdam, 1932 Los Angeles and 1936 Berlin Olympics with a combined haul of five bronzes. Yldefonso was the country's first medalist during the 1928 edition while Miguel White placed third in the men's 400-meter hurdles in 1936.\n\nIt was the boxers who achieved the similar feat in the 1988 Seoul, 1992 Barcelona and 1996 Atlanta Games. Leopoldo Serantes and Roel Velasco claimed bronze medals in 1988 and 1992, respectively.\n\nMansueto \"Onyok\" Velasco came close to a gold in 1996, settling for a silver after his highly disputed loss in the final to Bulgaria's Daniel Petrov.\n\nThe last three Olympics have seen the Philippines secure a total of seven medals, including the pending one from Villegas.\n\nAnd there could possibly be more before the conclusion of the Paris Olympics, with Yulo slated to take another crack in men's vault and Petecio in the quarterfinals of her women's featherweight class, both at press time, and EJ Obiena in men's pole vault.\n\nSeven is a remarkable haul considering that the Philippines had a total of nine between its Olympic debut in 1924 until 2016, which probably changes the old trend of being satisfied with seeing a Filipino athlete get one medal at a single Olympics, regardless of color outside of gold.

Diaz-Naranjo's gold medal performance in weightlifting in the Tokyo Games three years ago.\n\nThe House of Representatives will give Mr. Yulo P3 million for winning the gold medal in the Paris Games, Speaker and Leyte Rep. Ferdinand Martin G. Romualdez said.\n\nHe has also started a fundraising campaign among congressmen to give the gymnast an additional cash prize. -- Kenneth Christiane L.

Chloe, originally a fan of Yulo, initiated contact through a direct message on X (formerly Twitter), which blossomed into a significant emotional cornerstone for the athlete.\n\nTheir story began with a simple message from Chloe in April 2020, expressing admiration for Yulo's career. The casual interaction quickly escalated into a deep connection, underpinned by mutual respect and support. Despite geographical distances - Chloe studying in Melbourne and Yulo training in Japan - their relationship endured through digital communication, illustrating the modern dynamic of long-distance relationships.\n\nChloe's unwavering support was evident as she travelled to various competitions, including the Southeast Asian Games in Vietnam and the FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Cup series in Qatar. Her presence at these events not only provided moral support but also reinforced Yulo's psychological resilience, a crucial element in sports where mental fortitude is as essential as physical prowess.\n\nTheir interactions, often shared on social media, reveal a genuine partnership, with Yulo publicly acknowledging Chloe's sacrifices and support. This modern love story, thriving amid the pressures of competitive sport and personal sacrifice, not only humanises the Olympic experience but also exemplifies the profound impact of emotional support in achieving sporting excellence.", "source": {"uri": "dimsumdaily.hk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dimsum Daily"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dimsumdaily_hong_kong@dimsumdaily.hk", "name": "Dimsumdaily Hong Kong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Yulo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Yulo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Floor (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Jose, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Jose, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_Gymnastics_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artistic Gymnastics World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_resilience", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychological resilience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Modern_Pentathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Modern Pentathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://cdn.dimsumdaily.hk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/05114936/Carlos-and-gf.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788543", "eventUri": "eng-9788543", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-04-", "textStart": 666, "textEnd": 676}], "sentiment": 0.5294117647058822, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

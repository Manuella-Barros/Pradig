Each cabana is to feature two pub tables and two 42-inch TVs.\n\nThe cost per cabana was not released, but is considered a Williams Education Fund donation.\n\nMore information on cabana suites is available at KU's premium tickets website or by calling (785) 864-7757.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T05:08:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.8196078538894653, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3370949", "time": "05:08:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3370949", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "187023", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "190817", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302546", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "score": 2}, {"id": "302552", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "score": 5}, {"id": "303240", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Rain"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain", "score": 4}, {"id": "303573", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "score": 2}, {"id": "305436", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "score": 3}, {"id": "305661", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "score": 3}, {"id": "310129", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "End zone"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_zone", "score": 2}, {"id": "310570", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Weather forecasting"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting", "score": 4}, {"id": "310749", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "score": 2}, {"id": "312085", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(American_and_Canadian_football)#Defensive_tackle", "score": 3}, {"id": "312738", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "score": 2}, {"id": "313677", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pub"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub", "score": 1}, {"id": "314734", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "University of Kansas"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Kansas", "score": 5}, {"id": "316364", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Look and feel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look_and_feel", "score": 3}, {"id": "321917", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Director of football"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_football", "score": 3}, {"id": "325487", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "score": 4}, {"id": "331809", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Kauffman Stadium"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kauffman_Stadium", "score": 2}, {"id": "354885", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cabana (structure)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabana_(structure)", "score": 2}, {"id": "360421", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ceremonial first pitch"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceremonial_first_pitch", "score": 2}, {"id": "477561", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Kansas Jayhawks football"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_Jayhawks_football", "score": 5}, {"id": "597554", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Standing-room only"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing-room_only", "score": 2}, {"id": "1273065", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "David Beaty (American football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Beaty_(American_football)", "score": 3}], "image": "http://worldonline.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/croppedphotos/2017/03/21/Bender2_crop_t800.jpg?90232451fbcadccc64a17de7521d859a8f88077d", "timeCrawl": "05:08:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Notebook: Jayhawks practice at Chiefs' facility", "originalArticle": null}

And, of course, we want you to support women's basketball and volleyball and one other sport that I'm kind of biased (about) so I hope you bring your butts to all the basketball games, too.... We can't be great unless everybody gets on board.\"\n\nBefore passing the mic, Self shared with the new students his favorite of KU's many traditions.\n\n\"This is about as cool a place as there is when it comes to traditions,\" said Self before revealing that the Rock Chalk chant at the end of KU victories was his favorite. \"You know why it's the best tradition don't you? Because that means we just kicked somebody's (butt).\"\n\nThat line drew wild applause from the crowd and set Self up for his big finale.\n\n\"I wish you nothing but the best,\" he said. \"If I could go back and change places with you I promise I'd do it in a heartbeat.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T04:05:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6980392336845398, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3370949", "time": "04:05:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3370949", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "187023", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "195392", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "195623", "label": {"eng": "Tulsa"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa,_Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tulsa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "207040", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302552", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "score": 3}, {"id": "302606", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sport"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport", "score": 3}, {"id": "304129", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "score": 4}, {"id": "305813", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Coach (sport)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(sport)", "score": 4}, {"id": "308655", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Volleyball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball", "score": 2}, {"id": "311203", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Adolf Hitler"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler", "score": 2}, {"id": "314734", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "University of Kansas"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Kansas", "score": 4}, {"id": "328776", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Women's basketball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_basketball", "score": 2}, {"id": "428150", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bill Self"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Self", "score": 3}, {"id": "494847", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_Jayhawks_men's_basketball", "score": 3}, {"id": "1273065", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "David Beaty (American football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Beaty_(American_football)", "score": 3}, {"id": "1274003", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Athletics (physical culture)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_(physical_culture)", "score": 2}, {"id": "1293246", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Brandon Schneider"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Schneider", "score": 2}], "image": "http://worldonline.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/croppedphotos/2016/04/19/espn_gameday142_t800.jpg?90232451fbcadccc64a17de7521d859a8f88077d", "timeCrawl": "04:05:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Self lauds KU's culture at annual Traditions Night", "originalArticle": null}

Self related of his first question to a Jayhawk newbie.\n\n\"He said, 'I don't know, countless (times).'\n\n\"I told him, 'Ten times. During the course of the season we'll practice 150 times or whatever it is, maybe 100 times.' I said, 'How hard were the (pre-Italy) practices?' He said, 'Gosh, the hardest thing I've ever done.'\n\n\"The veterans said to that, 'What do you mean? We haven't even had a practice yet. This is like pick-up ball,''' Self exclaimed in speaking to ESPN radio's Seth Greenberg on Wednesday's \"Courtside with Greenberg and Dakich Show.\"\n\nWhile Self conceded the 10 practices were not nearly as difficult as regular-season workouts, they did serve a purpose.\n\n\"Nuts and bolts ... yes we got some stuff in,\" Self said.\n\n\"I think it was valuable as far as playing with others and sharing it. I think little things like that to kind of get the young guys' attention on what we expect and the culture (at KU) are very positive. I think it was a positive trip,\" he added of a trip in which KU won four exhibition games by lopsided scores.\n\nSelf fielded a July phone call from former KU forwards Marcus and Markieff Morris, who were preparing to coach \"Team FOE\" against \"Jim Boeheim's Army\" in the $2 million winner-take-all \"The Basketball Tournament.\"\n\n\"They actually did, believer it or not, call me,\" Self said of the NBA players. \"They said, 'Coach, tell us again how we beat a 2-3 zone.' They were playing Boeheim's Boys (who play zone).\n\n\"We went over a couple things, simple things,\" Self added. \"From what I was told the first 30 minutes they executed. The last 10 minutes they fell apart. That's what zones do sometimes, get you standing and thinking.\"\n\nTeam FOE, which included former Jayhawks Elijah Johnson, Tyshawn Taylor and Mario Little, blew a 25-point lead and fell to Boeheim's Army, 72-67, in a tourney quarterfinal game shown on ESPN.\n\n\"Those guys (twins) are fun to be around. It's good to see some of our ex-guys do well in that tournament,\" Self said.\n\nKU has been accorded a No. 1 seed in the Midwest Regional of the 2018 NCAA Tournament in August bracketology projections by ESPN's Joe Lunardi released Thursday.\n\nKU is projected to play Idaho or Lamar in the first round in March in Wichita with the winner meeting the winner of the Oregon-Florida State game in a second-round contest. Other No. 1 seeds were projected to be Duke, Arizona and Kentucky.\n\nWichita State was given a No. 3 seed in the South Regional, while Missouri was a No. 11 in the East. Kansas State did not receive a bid in Lunardi's projections.\n\nUCLA has offered a scholarship to Devon Dotson, a 6-1 senior point guard from Providence Day High School in Charlotte, N.C., Rivals.com reported on Thursday. Dotson -- the No. 33-ranked player in the recruiting class of 2018 according to Rivals.com -- will visit KU on Aug. 25-27. He has a list of KU, Florida, Maryland, Miami, Ohio State, USC and UCLA. Dotson averaged 24.4 points, 6.8 rebounds and 5.1 assists a game his junior year in high school.\n\nNoah Locke, a 6-foot-2 senior point guard from McDonogh High School in Owings Mills, Md., has eliminated Kansas from his list of schools. Locke, the No. 75-ranked player in the recruiting Class of 2018 according to Rivals.com, will visit Ohio State, Providence, Xavier, Michigan and Florida, his mother told Zagsblog.com. Others eliminated were Virginia and Maryland. He averaged 18.2 points and 1.6 assists per game in 16 games this past AAU season for Team Melo.\n\nDavid Duke, a 6-4 senior point guard from Cushing Academy in Ashburnham, Mass., who is ranked No. 46 in the Class of 2018, announced on Twitter that he has a final five of Villanova, Florida, Indiana, Providence and Virginia Tech.

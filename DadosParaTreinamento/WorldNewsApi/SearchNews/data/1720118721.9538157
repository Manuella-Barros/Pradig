Earlier this year, the Pitch Perfect actor came forward with allegations about the Borat star, whom she claimed mistreated her on the set of 2016 comedy film Grimsby. Weeks before Isla Fisher announced she was divorcing Cohen after 13 years of marriage, Wilson branded Cohen a \u201cmassive a**hole\u201d and accused him of trying to \u201cbully\u201d her into silence over a contentious chapter in her memoir, The memoir, titled Rebel Rising, detailed allegations of misconduct on the set of 2016 comedy film Grimsby. In the UK edition of the book, the actor\u2019s biggest claims were redacted, which Cohen\u2019s team declared a victory. Cohen denied all of Wilson\u2019s allegations, with his representatives telling The Independent: \u201cWhile we appreciate the importance of speaking out, these demonstrably false claims are directly contradicted by extensive detailed evidence, including contemporaneous documents, film footage, and eyewitness accounts from those present before, during and after the production of Grimsby.\u201d Now, Australian actor Wilson is reflecting on the furore her memoir created during an appearance on BBC Radio 4 series Desert Island Discs, addressing the alleged misconduct, which she said left her feeling \u201cdegraded\u201d. \u201cThat was the worst professional experience and that was where it crossed the line,\u201d Wilson told host Lauren Laverne of her experience, saying she went public with the allegations \u201cin one way to release the shame that I had sustained in a situation that wasn\u2019t great\u201d. While Wilson said she \u201creported it... at the time\u201d, adding that \u201cnothing really happened\u201d, she said she wishes she had either stood up to Cohen or quit the project altogether. \u201cI stayed in a situation and had things said to me and stuff that I should have left,\u201d she said. \u201cThe me now would be strong enough, but back then I just didn\u2019t have enough self-esteem to leave and I thought I\u2019d be labelled as unprofessional if I left.\u201d Reflecting on the impact of her memoir, Wilson said: \u201cIf it can help a few people out there then it\u2019s worth it.\u201d In May, Wilson addressed the timing of Cohen and Fisher\u2019s divorce announcement, and suggested she was no longer friends with the latter, with whom she starred in 2012 film Bachelorette. The actor said she does not think the couple\u2019s divorce had anything to do with her claims, but she did say the \u201ctiming wasn\u2019t great for\u201d Cohen. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m the reason, but it might have just been his general treatment to women,\u201d she told The Kyle and Jackie O Show on 8 May.", "summary": "<p>\u2018Pitch Perfect\u2019 star has explained why she didn\u2019t quit \u2018Grimsby\u2019 after alleged Cohen misconduct    </p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/rebel-wilson-sacha-baron-cohen-bbc-b2555244.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/02/13/Rebel-Wilson-Sacha-Baron-Cohen.jpg?width=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/YObOI3bO-4VHSaSK0.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:25:43", "author": "Jacob Stolworthy", "authors": ["Jacob Stolworthy"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.441}

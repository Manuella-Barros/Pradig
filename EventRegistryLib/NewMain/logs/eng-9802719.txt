It grossed over $180 million at the worldwide box office from a budget of $70 million, with a sequel planned for an October 9, 2026 release date. It'll be a little over a year until the sequel debuts in theaters, but to help tide fans over, Paramount+ is premiering the 2D-animated series, Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, this Friday, August 9th.\n\nThe voice cast of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is returning including Micah Abbey as Donatello, Shamon Brown Jr. as Michelangelo, Nicolas Cantu as Leonardo, Brady Noon as Raphael and Ayo Edebiri (The Bear) as April O'Neil. In the series, the Turtles are separated from each other and will have to test their resolve to survive against deadly robots.\n\n\"It was a very different recording for Ninja Turtles without all of the Ninja Turtles together, because I'd gotten used to that with the movie,\" Cantu tells Nerd Reactor. \"Honestly in the booth, I was thinking reading your guys' lines, like, 'How would Brady say this? How would [Micah] say this? So having the isolation aspect kind of tie into the story - made me feel better about it, because I was like, 'Okay, it's functioning on a story level.'\"\n\nChristopher L. Yost (Thor: Ragnarok, The Mandalorian, 2013's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) and Alan Wan (Blue Eye Samurai, Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) serve as the showrunners, and both have worked on many Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles projects.\n\n\"There have been many versions of the Turtles before,\" Yost said. \"We've seen many shows, we've seen many comics, we've seen all these things, but you know, a couple things that the movie did differently that kind of set this apart is really to focus on them as teenagers, more or less just normal kids who happen to be turtles and ninjas and all that. And then secondly, it was like, 'How can we challenge these kids like never before? How can we do something that we haven't necessarily seen before?' And we kind of put all that in a blender and came upon this idea of tearing them apart, putting them in the situation, and seeing what they do without their brothers by their side.\"\n\nFrom the studios of the Mutant Mayhem film, the all-new Paramount+ original series Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles explores the adventures of everyone's favorite pizza-loving heroes as they emerge from the sewers onto the streets of NYC. Leo, Raph, Donnie and Mikey are faced with new threats and team up with old allies to survive both teenage life and villains lurking in the shadows of the Big Apple. The series is produced by Nickelodeon Animation and Point Grey Pictures.\n\nTales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is executive produced by Chris Yost (The Mandalorian, Thor: Ragnarok) and Alan Wan (Blue Eye Samurai, Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles [2012 Series]).

However, due to zero publicity during the groundbreaking SAG-AFTRA strike and a lowkey marketing campaign, the movie mostly went under everyone's radar. It also premiered on Paramount+ only a month later, further losing the chance to gain some traction in theaters. That said, the film did manage to create enough noise among fans and critics alike, receiving favorable reviews from all quarters. To keep that critical reception going, Nickelodeon and Paramount are back with a TV series that not only serves as a sequel but also as a litmus test for the reboot's survival.\n\nTales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles reunites audiences with the brothers Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello, and Michelangelo, who happen to be teenagers as well as mutants. The series deals with the aftermath of Mutant Mayhem, with some citizens finding the turtles cool and others a menace. Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Season 1 shares an aesthetic similarity with the movie that showrunners Chris Yost and Alan Wan keep up throughout the episodes. But more than the comic book feel, it is the humanity of the ninja turtles at the center of the tale. The show paints the brotherly love between them beautifully while making the most out of the action, as the half-shells finally meet their match: killer robots!\n\nTales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Season 1 Expands Mutant Mayhem's Universe\n\nMore Characters Bring More Mayhem\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem's Critical Reception\n\nIMDb\n\nLetterboxd\n\nRotten Tomatoes\n\n7.2/10\n\n3.8/5\n\nTomatometer: 95% Audience Score: 90%\n\nRelated\n\nEverything We Know About Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem 2\n\nAfter the incredible success of the first mutant mayhem, fans are patiently awaiting new information for the already-greenlit sequel.\n\nIt is not the first time the Turtles franchise had a series to its name, especially an animated one. But unlike the others, Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Season 1 is a continuation of a movie that has pretty much laid down the blueprint of its world. All the show now has to do is follow it, despite the creative constraints it can bring. Luckily, Mutant Mayhem's ending gives the sewer-dwelling turtles more leeway, which opens up the world above for more storytelling avenues. Unleashing killer robots after the mutants is certainly one way to do it. The first part of the show follows the turtles trying to survive an army of self-repairing, indestructible robots programmed to kill mutants that their creator, the villainous Bishop, calls \"Mechazoids.\" As clich\u00e9d as it sounds, the plot takes an unexpected route when it splits the four brothers and sends them running to four different corners of New York City. This doesn't just add suspense, but also raises an important question: what can the brothers do alone?\n\nWith each turtle set on a diverging path, the story splits into multiple narratives running parallel along the same timeline. One of the pros of episodic storytelling is that each character gets time to grow into their own simply because of the longer runtime. However, the trajectory their lives take also determines each episode's tone. Given that these are a bunch of fun-loving teenagers, it is equal parts thrill and danger. Each brother begins their narration in the same fashion: a terrifying robot keeps relentlessly pursuing them, and only after teaming up with an ally or finding their inner strength are they able to thwart the threat. The turtles are unreliable narrators, who each tell their own version of events to satisfy their egos. This makes a simple plotline all the more intriguing with its Rashomon-esque execution. The stakes are already high, with the robots pushing the protagonists to the corner. It adds to the palpable tension in the build-up to the fight scenes, which is primarily how the story remains high on energy.\n\nWhile action is a constant companion in most episodes, it is not everything. At the heart of the series are the characters' personal journeys, where they try to discover themselves away from their familiarity of their surroundings. To wit, Leonardo is clueless without his brothers, Raphael finds his anger is taking him nowhere, Michelangelo has to get serious for a second, and Donatello fails to recognize his true genius. That said, it is not just the protagonists but also the villains who have a say in the story. Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Season 1 obliges, showing a different side to the events from their perspective as well.\n\nTales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Season 1 Has Characters Going through Highs & Lows\n\nThe Series is a Plot-Driven Tale With a Character-Centric Touch\n\nBishop is a gender-flipped version of Agent John Bishop, who was first introduced in the 2003 cartoon. Agent Bishop is the head of the Earth Protection Force. He is extremely bigoted towards any non-human species. Agent Bishop's exact age and origins are unknown, but he's estimated to be almost 200 years old.\n\nRelated\n\n10 Best-Written TMNT Characters, Ranked\n\nThe Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have always been great characters, but they are only the beginning of what the franchise has to offer.\n\nTales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Season 1 works with preset characters in a preconceived world. This, however, does not mean the show cannot add its own flavor to the characters and help them grow into heroes or, in some cases, villains. Keeping up with Nickelodeon's young demographic and the lighthearted nature of the original movie, the series goes a different route than the Turtles' usual team setup and tests the brothers individually. Leonardo has traditionally played the role of the leader because he is the guy with the plans. But without a team to back him up against an enemy who outsmarts him at every turn, Leo feels lost. That is when he thinks about what his other brothers will do in this situation. Something similar happens with the others as well. Michelangelo, who is bad with responsibilities, has to protect a henchman and also himself. Raphael, who just wants to punch his problems away, has to talk it out with a local gang to get their help. Last but not least, Donatello has to discard his self-doubt and channel his inner beast if he has any chance of survival.\n\nWhile Mutant Mayhem was all about acceptance, the series explores the bond of the brothers. The ninja turtles no longer have to hide when visiting the surface. The people of New York already accepted them, with some citizens even calling them heroes. Comfortable with their new status and complacent to danger, the turtle brothers greatly underestimate the foe before them and pay the price. Each episode focuses on a character, giving them all the space to figure out their way out on their own. Leonardo learns to think of the robot's weaknesses like Donatello, who, in turn, tries to think like Raphael. Raphael himself takes Michelangelo's advice about talking it out rather than using his fist, as the latter learns to think seriously for once. There is a fan theory regarding how each turtle's weapons reflect their opposite self. And, in a way, the show does something similar with much more panache and effectiveness. Meanwhile, the original voice cast from the movie returns to voice the lead characters, which makes the show not only authentic but also wholesome.\n\nRegarding meeting their true selves, the villainous Bishop wears her emotions on her sleeves. The one thing she wants in the whole wide world is to destroy mutants, specifically the brothers in half-shells. Bishop's origin story is clich\u00e9d, as many such villainous beginnings already overused the trope of a dead family member many a time. Despite this, her motivations and tenacity make her a memorable villain whose hypocrisy of being a bigoted mutant hater goes against everything from a scientific standpoint. It also makes Bishop one of the turtles' most dangerous enemies, and that is what the show uses to create suspense.\n\nMutant Mayhem Inspires Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' Animation\n\nStudio Titmouse Takes an Unconventional Approach\n\nClose\n\nTop 5 TMNT Movies, According to Rotten Tomatoes\n\nTitle\n\nRotten Tomatoes Score\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\n\nTomatometer: 95% Audience Score: 90%\n\nBatman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\n\nTomatometer: 100% Audience Score: 89%\n\nRise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Movie\n\nTomatometer: 79% Audience Score: 94%\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990)\n\nTomatometer: 42% Audience Score: 81%\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows\n\nTomatometer: 38% Audience Score: 47%\n\nRelated\n\nHow TMNT: Mutant Mayhem Sets Up a Sequel and TV Series\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem leaves many integral threads hanging to shape the sequel and the Paramount+ television series.\n\nTales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Season 1 tries its best to copy the comic book style used in Mutant Mayhem. However, it abandons the amalgamation of 3D and 2D animation to, instead, zero in on traditional animation styles and techniques. It does so while still keeping the character art as close to the movie as possible. Coupled with the voices, the mannerisms, round eyes, and general awkwardness, the series' animation style does a good job of making the ninja turtles look and act like any actual teenager. The show took great care in bringing out the turtles' teenage sides, which was lost in the Michael Bay era of the franchise.\n\nEvery frame from Titmouse looks like a panel straight from the turtles comic book. With the character movements' low framerate and the onomatopoeia going off with every explosion in the background, Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is arguably the turtles' most literal and comics-accurate adaptation yet. The actual magic of the animation comes from the lighting. There are gristly hatch lines all around the atmosphere, and the bright colors help the many details in the frames stand out against the grimy backgrounds. The robots get the most out of the lighting as the only non-organic beings on the show whose subtle movements and shifts in color tones show their emotions, even if it's mostly just anger.\n\nTales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Season 1 is surprisingly deep, with narratives that reflect the world as it is now. From angry people finding love and support in unconventional pets to hurt people hating others for no reason, the ninja turtles come across the denizens of New York and spread acceptance, albeit with some tough love and martial arts masterclass. The show highlights all the good things about Mutant Mayhem, proving why it was such a sweetheart to critics. But more importantly, Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Season 1 also gives the franchise a solid foundation to stand on, as it can only climb up from here.\n\nTales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Season 1 streaming soon on Paramount+\n\nTales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\n\n9\n\n10\n\nY-7\n\nAnimation\n\nAction\n\nAdventure\n\nA spin-off of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is an animated action-adventure series that sees the titular heroic turtles strike out on their own in an all-new storyline penned for television.

The dialogue is speedy, the references are current, and the stories are pretty complex. Take the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles; the 2023 film Mutant Mayhem blows away the Turtles' original 1980s TV series, which was pretty sophisticated and revolutionary for the time. Now there is a new Paramount+ series follow-up to that film.\n\nOpening Shot: \"TWO MONTHS AGO...\" We see the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles appear on a Manhattan street, saving the crowd from a monster. We also see what looks like screenshots of the turtles, with \"Target Acquired\" flashing on the screen.\n\nThe Gist: The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles -- Donatello (Micah Abbey), Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu) and Raphael (Brady Noon) -- are enjoying being hailed as heroes, and Leo draws their adventures in a comic book he calls Tales Of The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\n\nIn the story Leo creates, he and his brothers are invited by their friend April O'Neil (Ayo Edebiri) to a costume party. But before they can show up, a number of mutant alerts pop up on their phones. Leo thinks that this will just be a five-minute distraction before they show up to the party. But then we cut to them being attacked by robots and separated.\n\nWe then follow Leo as he battles a particularly ferocious robot, he worries about where his brothers might be and if they're OK. He eventually manages to find April, who helps him out as much as she can, but for the most part is there to let him know he is strong enough to defeat the robot on his own. In the meantime, a villain named Bishop (Alanna Ubach) is out to kill as many mutants as she can.\n\nWhat Shows Will It Remind You Of? Tales Of The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a continuation of the 2023 film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, which had Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg amongst its producers. Chris Yost and Alan Wan are the showrunners for the series.\n\nOur Take: The idea behind Tales Of The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is that the series will have arcs, with Leo's comic book being the device that ties them together. In the first arc, Bishop manages to separate the brothers, and each of them have to figure out how to battle whatever is out to destroy them on their own, without their brothers' help. It's an interesting way to start the series, given the fact that having the four brothers together is what people have liked about the show since the 1980s.\n\nOf course, having them separate highlights each of their strengths. Leo is a leader. Donnie is smart as a tack and good with technology. Raph is the strongest. And Mikey is speedy and agile, plus the loosest and most fun-loving of the brothers. We wonder if they're all going to rope April into the battle, or if we'll see them get help from other people in their world to help them out.\n\nThe hallmark of the Turtles has always been their casualness and love of pizza. But this new generation of Turtles is more pop-culture aware and jokes more like people do in life, like when one of the brothers goofs on Donatello for looking up party etiquette on Wikipedia.\n\nThere are lots of guest voices playing mutants and enemies, including Pete Davidson, Jillian Bell, Timothy Olyphant, Danny Trejo, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Rose Byrne and Post Malone. Seeing their characters interacting with the Turtles during the show's other arcs should be fun.\n\nWhat Age Group Is This For?: There's some mild violence, so we think the show is for kids 7 and up..\n\nParting Shot: Bishop looks at her bank of screens and shows what kind of peril the other three brothers are in.\n\nSleeper Star: Ayo Edeberi's speedy delivery fits in the show's style perfectly, as April is a character who looks out for the boys while fighting her own insecurities.\n\nMost Pilot-y Line: When the party guests see \"Nardo\", they greet him enthusiastically, but one wonders where his brothers are. \"It's like seeing one Jonas.\"\n\nOur Call: STREAM IT. Tales Of The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is definitely fun to watch and is certainly more sophisticated than the Turtles' original animated adventures.\n\nJoel Keller (@joelkeller) writes about food, entertainment, parenting and tech, but he doesn't kid himself: he's a TV junkie.

The show's unique animation style complements the quirky tone and the return of the central cast, showcasing the potential and longevity of the TMNT franchise. With engaging storylines, the charismatic voice acting of the cast, including Nicolas Cantu as Leonardo, promises exciting adventures and unforgettable moments.\n\nTales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is the perfect follow-up to 2023's TMNT: Mutant Mayhem, and while they both share a similar cast, the spinoff show welcomes some new additions. Despite the TMNT franchise being popular for decades, it hasn't always had the best cinematic showings, but Mutant Mayhem's success proved the quirky, animated style was the best way forward for the series. As a result, the central cast returned for Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which continued the protagonists' adventures in the form of two separate mini-stories, fighting against Bishop and the East River Three.\n\nDespite Tales of the TMNT having a different animation style, the show is just as charming and hilarious as Mutant Mayhem. The spinoff series takes place just two months after the events of the 2023 film, proving this depiction of the turtles has a lot of potential and longevity. Although the majority of the main cast reprised their roles for this fun project, not everyone returned, and there were also some new additions. The introduction of new characters also allowed for some huge names to join the franchise, many of who delivered a fantastic performance.\n\nPicture\n\nName\n\nCharacter\n\nNicolas Cantu\n\nLeonardo\n\nMicah Abbey\n\nDonatello\n\nBrady Noon\n\nRaphael\n\nShamon Brown Jr.\n\nMichelangelo\n\nAyo Edebiri\n\nApril O'Neil\n\nJames Sie\n\nSplinter\n\nAlanna Ubach\n\nBishop\n\nPete Davidson\n\nRod\n\nChristopher Mintz-Plasse\n\nPigeon Pete\n\nCarlin James\n\nHun\n\nJamila Velazquez\n\nAngel\n\nTimothy Olyphant\n\nGoldfin\n\nJillian Bell\n\nLee the Eel\n\nDanny Trejo\n\nMustang Sally\n\nRose Byrne\n\nLeatherhead\n\nNatasia Demetriou\n\nWingnut\n\nAustin Post/ Post Malone\n\nRay Fillet\n\nNicolas Cantu as Leonardo Date of Birth: September 8, 2003 Close Active Since: 2015\n\nActor: Nicolas Cantu was born in Austin, Texas, and has already made a huge splash in the acting world. Cantu is best known for his role in the Amazing World of Gumball and has made a big name for himself in the voice acting industry, even delving into live-action by joining The Walking Dead franchise. He also amassed a large YouTube following showing his versatility in multiple different fields. Having already played the self-proclaimed leader of the Ninja Turtles in Mutant Mayhem, Cantu is experienced in this central role and proved he can nail Leonardo's conflicted personality.\n\nNotable Movies & TV Shows:\n\nTitle\n\nCharacter\n\nYear\n\nThe Amazing World of Gumball\n\nGumball Watterson\n\n2017-2019\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\n\nLeonardo\n\n2023\n\nThe Walking Dead World Beyond\n\nElton Ortiz\n\n2020-2021\n\nSofia the First\n\nPrince James\n\n2016-2018\n\nDragons Rescue Riders: Heroes of the Sky\n\nDak\n\n2021-2022\n\nCharacter: Leonardo is one of Tales of The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' four main protagonists and acts as the leader of the team. While all four turtles are equal, Leonardo frequently comes up with plans and helps motivate his brothers, but admits he can't function without them. Although each turtle narrates their parts of the story, the plot is introduced through Leonardo's comics, giving him a big role in the series. While he struggles with self-doubt and working on his own, Cantu's character is able to overcome his flaws while also proving just how well the group function together.\n\nRelated These 3 Upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Projects Prove It's A Great Time To Be A TMNT Fan\n\nThe three upcoming TMNT projects set for TV and the big screen highlight how adaptable the franchise has become over the years.\n\nMicah Abbey as Donatello Date of Birth: November 8, 2007 Close Active Since: 2017\n\nActor: While Micah Abbey is relatively new to the acting world, he has still had a number of big performances to his name. He was born in Columbus, Ohio and, moved to Los Angeles at the age of 10, where he began his career. While Abbey's TMNT: Mutant Mayhem role is his biggest so far, he was a regular in Cousins for Life and even made two appearances in Grey's Anatomy, which showcased his early talent.\n\nWith Abbey confirmed to be part of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem 2's cast, the animated franchise will likely give him his big break and create a bright future for the actor.\n\nNotable Movies & TV Shows:\n\nTitle\n\nCharacter\n\nYear\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\n\nDonatello\n\n2023\n\nCousins For Life\n\nLeaf\n\n2018-2019\n\nGrey's Anatomy\n\nFrankie Baner\n\n2017-2018\n\nBunk'd\n\nZachary\n\n2021\n\nCharacter: Donatello is the group's technology expert, who is often teased for being a bit on the nerdy side. Despite this, his understanding of electronics often comes in handy for the team and proves his value time and time again. While he may be the most timid out of the four brothers, he is still an extremely capable fighter and displays his combat capabilities in one of the show's most satisfying scenes. The purple-masked turtle is a highlight in the new spinoff series, and his more reserved nature makes his comedic moments all the more hilarious.\n\nBrady Noon as Raphael Date of Birth: December 30, 2005 Close Active Since: 2010\n\nActor: Born in Forked River, New Jersey, Brady Noon had his breakout role in 2010's Boardwalk Empire. The critically acclaimed drama series ran for five seasons, with Noon appearing in 30 episodes, making an instant impression at a young age. Despite starting his career in a crime series, the actor showed his comedic skills in The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers, showing he could operate in a number of different genres. His previous work set him up perfectly for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, as his role as Raphael balances aggression with humor.\n\nTitle\n\nCharacter\n\nYear\n\nBoardwalk Empire\n\nTommy Darmody\n\n2010-2013\n\nThe Mighty Ducks: Game Changers\n\nEvan Morrow\n\n2021-2022\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\n\nRaphael\n\n2023\n\nGood Boys\n\nThor\n\n2019\n\nCharacter: Raphael is the hothead of the group who would rather fight first and ask questions later. His fiery attitude can often be a burden, but sometimes this also works to his advantage. He is easily the team's most fearless member and going headfirst into every encounter can be inspiring to his brothers, even if it doesn't always prove the most efficient method. Raphael's distinct personality was a massive part of making Mutant Mayhem one of the best TMNT movies ever made, and he provides more of the same in the franchise's spinoff show.\n\nShamon Brown Jr. as Michelangelo Date of Birth: July 17, 2004 Close Active Since: 2018\n\nActor: Shamon Brown Jr. was born in Chicago, Illinois, and had only a handful of acting credits before joining the TMNT series. While his career may still be in its infancy, Brown Jr. has been a pivotal part of The Chi since 2018, a drama series set in south Chicago. He portrayed one of The Chi's fan-favorite characters as Papa won over audiences and helped put the actor on the map. Since then, he has been part of Mutant Mayhem like the rest of his three costars and also appeared in a short called Peppermint Spiral.\n\nNotable Movies & TV Shows:\n\nTitle\n\nCharacter\n\nYear\n\nThe Chi\n\nStanley 'Papa' Jackson\n\n2018-2024\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\n\nMichelangelo\n\n2023\n\nPeppermint Spiral\n\nAngel\n\n2024\n\nCharacter: Michelangelo is the wildcard of the group, having some of the most elaborate and chaotic plans while managing to hold his own in a fight. His likable personality makes him easy to root for, and he shines in Tales of the TMNT by having some of the show's funniest moments. It's impossible to predict what will happen next when Michelangelo is involved, but he is still more level-headed compared to other depictions of the character. His methods may not always be easy to understand, but Michelangelo's crazy ideas often work out, even when least expected.\n\nRelated TMNT Mutant Mayhem 2 Is Breaking A 21-Year Franchise Sequel Record\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is officially getting a second film, that is set to break a 21-year record when it comes to TMNT sequels.\n\nTales Of The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Supporting Cast & Characters\n\nAyo Edebiri as April O'Neil - Ayo Edebiri reprises her role in the new TMNT series after a wonderful outing in Mutant Mayhem. The award-winning actress is best known for her role as Sydney in The Bear, and she was also a part of Inside Out 2's record-breaking box office. April is one of the first human characters to accept the turtles, and she is once again a huge ally to them in the new show, adding plenty of charm, sarcasm, and practicality to help balance out the turtles' more youthful, energetic nature.\n\nJames Sie as Splinter - Taking over from Jackie Chan, the veteran James Sie plays Splinter in Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Splinter doesn't have nearly as big of a role in the spinoff show compared to some of his other outings in the TMNT franchise, but he still comes across as a caring father figure for the protagonists, even when the audience can't understand him.\n\nJames Sie also appeared as Tsoi, a member of the Purple Dragons in 2012's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles show.\n\nAlanna Ubach as Bishop - Agent Bishop is a long-serving antagonist in the TMNT series, but Paramount's show seemingly puts a new spin on the character. Rather than playing a federal agent, Bishop follows her dreams of building robots to help better the world; however, a run-in with some mutants gives her a change of heart. As a result, she becomes a key villain in Tales of the TMNT and creates an army of mechazoids that are hellbent on taking down the lovable heroes.\n\nPete Davidson as Rod - Pete Davidson's Rod matches the turtles' humor perfectly and is easily one of the best additions to the cast. The actor's history in comedy made him a perfect choice for the role and Rod is the sort of goofy character who fits seamlessly into the series. His love for mutants and hatred for any kind of working life makes him an unexpected ally for the protagonists and someone who will hopefully stick around in future projects.\n\nTimothy Olyphant as Goldfin - A new antagonist group is introduced when Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja starts its second story, and Timothy Olyphant's Goldfin leads the villainous trio. Goldfin is the mutant goldfish in charge of the East River Three, a group of aquatic mutants who pose a threat to the turtles. Acquiring a big name like Timothy Olyphant for this role proves that the animated show wanted to continue expanding the fantastic cast that Mutant Mayhem started, and the actor certainly delivers.\n\nJillian Bell as Lee the Eel - Lee the Eel acts as Goldfin's enforcer and helps make the East River Three a force to be reckoned with. Jillian Bell brings her experience to the character, with Lee acting as a large threat to the turtles.\n\nDanny Trejo as Mustang Sally - Danny Trejo has decades' worth of experience, helping Mustang Sally stand out. The antagonist rounds off the East River Three and helps spice up the second part of the show. Given some of the more gritty and violent projects Trejo has been involved in previously, it is a breath of fresh air seeing him involved in such a fun and light-hearted show.\n\nChristopher Mintz-Plasse as Pigeon Pete - Although his voice may be hard to recognize, Christopher Mintz-Plasse offers his acting expertise as the mutant bird, Pigeon Pete. Despite providing some of Superbad's best quotes, Mintz-Plasse doesn't have any voice lines in Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles but still has a large role in the series even though he is predominantly a comic relief character.\n\nRelated TMNT Mutant Mayhem 2 Is Already Avoiding A Huge Sequel Mistake\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem already has a sequel announced, and the second movie can avoid a big problem with its younger cast.\n\nCarlin James as Hun - Hun is one of the main characters introduced as part of the Purple Dragons. While the gang is a frequent enemy in the TMNT franchise, Hun doesn't share the group's aggressive and villainous tendencies, making him one of the Paramount show's most interesting additions.\n\nJamila Velazquez as Angel - Alongside Hun, Angel also resides as part of the Purple Dragons, having a slightly more ruthless side to her. Despite being more cut out for gang life than Hun, Velazquez gives Angel a more balanced personality, meaning she isn't strictly friend or foe.\n\nRose Byrne as Leatherhead - Rose Byrne reprises her role as Leatherhead after playing the crocodile mutant in Mutant Mayhem. Her small role brings some positive vibes to the series and proves she can be a fun TMNT character for years to come.\n\nNatasia Demetriou as Wingnut - Wingnut is another mutant returning from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' 2023 movie, providing a welcome supporting role in the show. Like Leatherhead, she has a small part and plenty of potentia going forward given her previous depictions in the series.\n\nAustin Post AKA Post Malone as Ray Fillet - Post Malone also returned to play his mutant character, Ray Fillet, in Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. While he is best known for his music, Post Malone played a small role in 2024's Road House and also has credits in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and Wrath of Man.\n\nTales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\n\nA spin-off of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is an animated action-adventure series that sees the titular heroic turtles strike out on their own in an all-new storyline penned for television. Voice actors Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu, and Brady Noon will return to reprise their roles as the four turtles.\n\nCast Brady Noon , Nicolas Cantu , Micah Abbey , Shamon Brown Jr. Seasons 1 Franchise(s) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Showrunner Christopher L.

Yi's new power allows her to create a sphere of electricity around her at will though this first instance seems to have been involuntary. The new TMNT team faces challenges in a city on the brink of chaos, with more power-ups surely to come.\n\nWarning: Spoilers for TMNT: The Last Ronin II - Re-Evolution #2 !\n\nIn the future-set world of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, a new generation of Turtles has arisen to carry on the heroic legacy of the original four brothers, with their official debut on the streets of New York only just recently happening on the page. Now, Yi, the hero replacing the tech genius Donatello, has shown off her never-before-seen power, one that allows Yi to command electricity in a way that helps her defend her family.\n\nA member of the new TMNT team alongside Uno, Moja, and Odyn, Yi is a talented ninja and bookworm who has unique perspectives on things that her siblings don't, often muddled by her somewhat naivety and book-smart nature.\n\nIn the second issue of TMNT: The Last Ronin II - Re-Evolution, Yi and the rest of her family take to the streets for the second official time in their budding crime-fighting careers, with Yi debuting a power that allows her to conjure a spherical field of electricity!\n\n13:40 Related SDCC 2024: Legendary Comic Writer Jason Aaron Breaks Down His Teenage Muntant Ninja Turtles Relaunch\n\nJason Aaron discusses the inspiration behind his Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles relaunch and shares his creative process at San Diego Comic-Con.\n\nYi Debuts Her Unique Electricity Power To Save Her Family TMNT: The Last Ronin II - Re-Evolution #2 - 2024 (Tom Waltz & Kevin Eastman, Ben Bishop, Esau Escorza and Isaac Escorza)\n\nDispatched by a reluctant April O'Neil and her daughter Casey Marie to help quell a fight between two of the city's worst gangs, Uno, Moja, Odyn, and Yi jump into the fray equipped with multiple ninja weapons, badass battle masks, and palpable enthusiasm for proving themselves as heroes. Caught under a falling wreck of a police car, Yi raises her hands to the sky as if to catch it from squashing her and her siblings, and in her desperation, conjures up an electric force field that stops the car in its tracks, officially debuting her power on panel.\n\nA power triggered by the stress of a painful death bearing down upon her and her family, Yi creating an electric charge out of thin air is a confounding yet intriguing development, as it's only been hinted that there's more to Yi, her siblings, and their unique mutations than what's been seen thus far. However, it's worth noting that since Yi is the smartest in the group, this power might simply be a homemade piece of gear -- her battle mask in particular looks very tech-like -- something that's left unresolved as Yi's newfound power is the final image of this issue.\n\nYi's New Power Allows Her To Create a Sphere of Electricity Around Her\n\nThough it's possible this electric upgrade could still be tech-based, the more likely reason is that Yi has finally manifested her own unique power similar to how her brother Odyn did after he learned to control his hardening ability earlier in this issue.

Throughout the years, their comic books expanded to movies, TV shows, video games, and toys. Most notably, the animated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ran for nearly a decade and has become a nostalgic staple of the '80s and '90s. Several other movies have featured the four anthropomorphic turtle brothers (Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael), including the trilogy of live-action films in the '90s and the more recent movies Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and its sequel Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows.", "source": {"uri": "screenrant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenRant"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronin_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ronin (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ninja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turtle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMNT_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TMNT (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Comic-Con", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Comic-Con"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_(2018_video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spider-Man (2018 video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-up", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Power-up"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Aaron", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Aaron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genius", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cosplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uno (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Eastman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Eastman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donatello", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donatello"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Bishop", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben Bishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Super_Hero_Squad:_The_Infinity_Gauntlet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Super Hero Squad: The Infinity Gauntlet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles:_Out_of_the_Shadows_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Laird", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peter Laird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letterer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Letterer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDW_Publishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IDW Publishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leonardo da Vinci"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthropomorphism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michelangelo"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Comic_Strips_and_Panels", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Comic Strips and Panels", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/tmnt-s-donatello-and-an-electrified-yi.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802719", "eventUri": "eng-9802719", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

It was a huge hit, tons of fun, and widely beloved by everyone. I know Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was kind of in the works around the time the movie came out, I think it was announced a week before. How did it feel when you got the scripts for this series and you realized you get to keep playing these characters? Do you remember what your reaction was?\n\nMicah Abbey: I was like, 'Let's do this thing!' I love hanging out with these guys, they're all awesome. We just have a good time. We were all excited. We were all texting in the group chat like, 'Let's do this thing.'\n\nNicolas Cantu: Yeah, I was hyped, I can say. Working on the movie with these guys was so fun, and being able to spend more time in this world, playing this character, is just a blessing. I'm really excited for fans to see the show.\n\nBrady Noon: Continuing to be part of such a big franchise is just, obviously, a great opportunity. It gives us -- now after we've seen the impression that everybody had on the first movie, this gives us now some time to go back and change certain things that we wanted to change or correct some certain things. Overall, it was just really, really exciting.\n\nShamon Brown Jr.: Pretty much what everyone is saying, it's just amazing. I feel like sometimes the words are indescribable, at times, honestly. It's definitely awesome to continue the story and keep it going.\n\nSure, definitely. And you guys are so much fun in it, too. I know one of my favorite parts about Mutant Mayhem was seeing the four of you interact together. I know you were recording your lines together and there was a lot of improv. Was it the same for this show? Were you recording together and making up stuff as you go along?\n\nCantu: It was very different for the show because the show kind of highlights the turtles individually. As you'll see, we kind of get split up. You have an episode following Mikey's journey, Donny's, Raph's, and Leo's. We had to record solo because we were flying solo. I still think we had the opportunity to throw in the flare of the characters that everyone loved from the movie, just from an individual standpoint. If anything, I feel like we went crazier being alone in the booths and just firing things off.\n\nI was going to ask you about that, too. For the first four episodes, at least, you guys are kind of all on your own, doing your own thing. We kind of learn some things about the turtles, they have to un-learn some stuff and pick up some new skills. For each of you, what did you learn about your character while you were doing your stand-alone episode?\n\nAbbey: I think we all learned how to act by ourselves and realize how much we really do need our brothers as much as we feel like we're better than one another. We realized how much we rely on each other and how much we really care about each other. I realized that, in the booth, as an actor, myself, how much I rely on these guys. They're just so talented I need these guys in the booth, I need these guys to work off of in order to take things from them and work on my own craft.\n\nCantu: I'd say one thing I learned from Leo -- I'm thinking specifically about one episode, but it's patience. He's dealing with quite a crazy character and I think it really pushes him to his limit. You don't really see Leo get exasperated or angry, so I think seeing him pushed to that limit and seeing how his trust in this other character eventually pays off in the end, I thought it was a very nice lesson.\n\nNoon: I think, a particular episode I can think of, in episode three, which is Raph's episode where he has to pretty much negotiate his way out of a kidnapping. I just thought that was pretty funny. It highlights how Raph is usually the guy to punch his way through an escape and, now, he's sitting here talking, trying to conversate, and get on the level of other people. That's a big step for Raph and I feel like I'm excited for people to see that.\n\nBrown Jr.: I think for Mikey, when doing the first movie, I felt like we all got to depend on each other and we fed off each other's energy so much. For me, coming into this, I felt like I still had that energy from the previous film, but this time I got to know my version of Michaelangelo.

The Avengers might set their biggest box-office records together, but at the end of the day, they're solo stars temporarily sharing space. By contrast, the central appeal of the Friends is that they're, well, friends; split one off from the pack, and you end up with Joey.\n\nParamount+'s Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles seems, at first, like it might have misjudged where its heroes fall on that spectrum. Its first six-episode arc (of a twelve-episode season) largely separates the core four, losing much of the winsome rapport that defined 2023's Mutant Mayhem. But it retains enough of that film's zip to stand as a worthy follow-up -- and eventually circles back toward a deeper understanding of what makes the Turtles tick as a team.\n\nThe series carries over much of Mutant Mayhem's endearing handcrafted vibe -- albeit, understandably, in less elaborate and expensive-looking form. Instead, Tales is rendered in cleaner, simpler lines that dovetail with the show's half-hearted framing device: These adventures are presented as a comic book scribbled by Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), the katana-wielding leader of the gang. (Does this mean the narrative is therefore not canon within this universe? I have no idea, and frankly, I'm not sure the show itself cares; Tales demonstrates limited interest in Marvel-style cross-pollinated world-building. )\n\nLeo's story -- actually created by showrunners Chris Yost and Alan Wan -- apparently picks up right where the movie left off. Having saved New York City, he and his brothers are eager to get back to ordinary teenage activities like high school and house parties. But en route to a big night out, they're ambushed by Bishop (Alanna Ubach), a mysterious villain who's decided that \"for the survival of humanity, all mutants must be destroyed.\" The Turtles are split up in the attack, and each of the first four half-hours follows one as he's pursued by one of Bishop's mechazoids, relentless robots capable of upgrading themselves (some might even say mutating themselves) on the fly.\n\nConsidering that Mutant Mayhem went so far as to have its young cast record together, it's initially disappointing that Tales offers so few opportunities to spotlight their lived-in rapport. But the storyline becomes a way for each Turtle to consider who he is apart from the others, and who he is because of them. Angry Raphael (Brady Noon) might wonder if he's only good for going into \"beast mode,\" only to realize in a moment of crisis that he actually has learned a thing or two from jokester Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.) about disarming his enemies with humor. Each thinks of the others, but as filtered through his own particular lens: Nerdy Donatello (Micah Abbey) imagines a confrontation in the style of a 1990s video game, while Leo's daydreams are stylized as even cruder comic-book doodles.\n\nTales directs a similar playfulness to the world around its young protagonists. Ayo Edebiri's April O'Neil aside, few of the A-list supporting players from the movie return for the first half of the show. (Splinter, the boys' rat father, has been reduced to speaking in \"vermin\" as a way to avoid paying Jackie Chan for a cameo.) But this is still a New York City where Leonardo's self-pity party might get interrupted by a pair of bickering neighbors complaining about the noise, or where Raphael's imprisonment might be overseen by an enormous thug (Carlin James) with the comportment of Embarrassment from Inside Out 2.\n\nAs a TV-Y7 show, Tales only lets itself go so far down dark territory. The action is propulsive and creative, making hilarious use of props like candy bars and squawking chickens, but it's also bloodless; it's mainly robots who get torn limb to limb. And while it might be possible, if you really want to, to read Raphael's time on a poultry farm as a commentary on animal rights, or Bishop's us-or-them rhetoric as an echo of fear-mongering bigots, such issues are handled with a light enough touch that Tales functions better as family-friendly escapism than as a sneaky commentary on serious topics.\n\nWhat the series is sincere about are the joys and frustrations of a family. When the Turtles are finally reunited, the support they show each other feels all the richer because we understand so well what it means to each of them individually. (It's enough to make one hope all the more that the second season sees more of the whole gang working together.) Bishop might not see much to relate to in the Turtles -- \"Regular kids are not green,\" she snarls to her assistant (Pete Davidson). But young or old, anyone who's ever felt constrained by their family's expectations of them, anyone who's called upon a relative's wisdom in a moment of crisis, anyone who gets that family means appreciating each other even as you sometimes annoy each other -- which is to say, pretty much everyone -- will.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

And borrowed as they may be from European art history, when they're cited together, they can only ever refer to one thing: a quartet of teenage mutant ninja turtles. From their start in 1984 as comic-book characters to their animated and live-action forays into TV and film, these four brothers have long operated as an almost impossibly tight-knit unit. And visually, they've been depicted as nearly identical, with only their signature colors and weapons helping to distinguish them.\n\nThat changed drastically with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. Last year's wildly inventive and raucous animated film leaned heavily into further individualizing these four teen turtles. No longer were these radioactive humanoids mere replicas of one another. They were fully-realized characters in their own right. With Tales Of The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Paramount+'s new animated series that follows in its wake, that concept of really delving into each of these iconic characters both as individuals and as complementary parts of their New York City-dwelling crime-fighting family becomes a central concern.\n\nTo be fair, from the very beginning, these sewer-dwelling turtles have boasted slightly different personalities: Leonardo is a straight-laced leader; Donatello is the brains; Raphael is the brawn; and Michelangelo is the clown. But with Mutant Mayhem, those distinctions became part of the film's visual iconography (courtesy of lead character designer Woodrow White) and were further tweaked by the use of shortened nicknames for each of the brothers. Oh, and they were all voiced by actual teenage actors who lent the film a sense of authenticity in its depiction of angsty turtles going through puberty.\n\nRaph (voiced by Brady Noon) may have boasted his signature red bandanna and expertly swung around his pair of sai but in this iteration he's much bigger than his siblings. He's a beefy, bulked-up, punch-ready teen who could play quarterback for a winning high school football team. Nunchuck-loving and orange bandanna-donning Mikey (Shamon Brown Jr.) is lankier here (he's more of a skater boy, in fact), and his toothy grin is made all the more glaring (and inviting) with his braces being front and center. Donnie (Micah Abbey), nerdier than ever (with a phone and headphones always on hand to match his purple accessories and his staff), is smaller and a bit awkward, with his big framed glasses most obviously setting him apart from his brothers. All while Leo (Nicolas Cantu), the erstwhile leader of the group, is lean and well-built, and his blue bandanna and katanas heighten his sense of poise. More to the point, though, Leo is obsessed with writing comic-book stories about the many outlandish adventures he and his brothers stumble upon.\n\nIt's Leo's stories that make up the bulk of the 2D-animated show's promised \"tales.\" As if wanting to hammer home how these four brothers -- all voiced by the same actors in Mayhem -- needed to be fully-rendered characters on their own, almost every episode of Tales Of The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles follows only one turtle at a time. Indeed, their titles all but announce this as the structuring device of the show's freshmen season: \"Leonardo Stands Alone!,\" \"Mikey Does the Right Thing,\" \"Raph Thinks It Through,\" \"Donnie Hangs Tough.\" As a conceit for a television series about a famed group of big-city heroes, this is ballsy stuff, especially since, as those very titles suggest, each tale finds them embracing an aspect of themselves they've more often than not associated with another brother's skillset.\n\nThe first six of this season's 12 episodes all center on an unlikely threat following the events of Mutant Mayhem. And, as if borrowing from one of Twitter's favorite memes (\"Yup, that's me! You're probably wondering how I ended up in this situation.\"), every 22 minute installment of Tales finds our protagonists adrift in the middle of their own lone adventure. Each, as it turns out, is being hunted down by a sentient A.I. robot who's been specifically programmed to destroy them. Scattered as they are all over the city, the turtles have to rely only on themselves and a ragtag group of unwitting allies, which include not just April (Ayo Edibiri) but a mutant pigeon (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and a doofus of a hostage (Pete Davidson), to get the gang back together and truly make the case for why there is strength in numbers.\n\nFinding out precisely how the brothers got separated and how they're going to find their way back together is the fun of these bite-sized tales. But it's also a welcome chance to have Leo, Donnie, Raph, and Mikey become main characters in their own right, able to shoulder an entire episode's worth of action and comedy, thrills and laughs, all by themselves.\n\nThis, in turn, further infuses these stories with their own visual flair. Donnie's memories, for instance, look like video-game 8-bit visuals, speaking to his dorky endeavors but also to the way he sees the world around him. And it's no surprise Leo reshapes them in his mind as comic-book imagery where he reduces his brothers to one-dimensional punchlines. At a moment when he's cool and level-headed in the face of a mysterious threat, he recalls how Mikey just opts to tell a joke (\"Thinking is hard. I don't do it, personally.\"), Raph resorts to violence (\"Let's just punch it!\"), and Donnie refuses to step away from his phone (\"Sorry, gentlemen, I can't engage right now because I'm knee-deep in a new algorithm.\"). The episodes that follow are attempts to upend those cartoonish characterizations and in the process create more fully-fleshed teenage mutant ninja turtles than we've ever seen on the big or small screen.\n\nIs it a bit of a bait and switch given that we're supposed to be watching a show about all four of these ninja turtles? Perhaps. But the show is well aware of that ploy. \"Where are your brothers?\" Leo is asked in the first episode when he arrives by himself at a party. \"It's like seeing one Jonas,\" the partygoer adds, a bit of a meta wink at the audience about how odd it may feel to navigate these tales one turtle at a time.\n\nAs character development, this episode structure is a gamble. Leo's a leader, and Raph is all muscle; Mikey's a wise-cracker, and Donnie's a nerd. But to merely stress the same features that have characterized these turtles for four decades now would make for a rather dull reboot of this much beloved franchise. It's better to force Raph to see the benefit of lobbing jokes at his foes (like Mikey does) when trapped in a Brooklyn chicken warehouse -- and for Mikey to find the value in having a plan (like Leo always does) while surrounded by dangerous animals in the New York City Zoo.", "source": {"uri": "avclub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The A.V.

In Mutant Nation, Tom Waltz, the co-writer of TMNT: The Last Ronin, returns to tell brand-new stories with artist Vincenzo Federici. \"With the mighty Jason Aaron returning the original four turtles to New York in the main ongoing series, TMNT: Mutant Nation gives my fellow TMNT creators and myself the very cool opportunity to explore other fan-favorite characters (both old and new) in the ever-expansive IDW TMNT Universe,\" Waltz said. TMNT: Mutant Nation #1 goes on sale Sept. 18.\n\nRelated\n\nDC's Boy Wonder Proves One of Batman's Oldest Enemies Does Have a Heart\n\nThe Boy Wonder gives one of Batman's worst enemies a glimpse of the closure she has been seeking for nearly forty years.\n\nClose\n\nClose\n\nTEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES: MUTANT NATION #1\n\nWritten by TOM WALTZ & ERIK BURNHAM Art by VINCENZO FEDIRICI & MATEUS SANTOLOUCO Cover A by JAVIER FERNANDEZ Cover B by VINCENZO FEDERICI Cover C by MATEUS SANTOLOUCO Cover D by JIM LAWSON Cover RI by JESSE LONERGAN On sale Sept. 18\n\n\"Starting with the first arc, no stone will be left unturned as we reveal what all our beloved heroes and villains have been up to during the year gap between issues #150 and the new #1...and beyond!\" Waltz continued. \"And I couldn't be more excited and proud to be joined on the first arc by superstar artist Vincenzo Federici and the always amazing Ronda Pattison. I can't wait for our many loyal readers to see what we've all been up to!\"\n\nFederici spoke about providing art for the main story, featuring the Ninja Turtle Raphael. \"My favorite thing about the series is that it is a Raph solo man show and that's very exciting, because I like to draw muscular and angry characters. Moreover, I drew him very little in my previous runs, so I'm very happy about this. I loved working with Tom again; we're a great team together, and I'm very happy with his action scenes. Furthermore, I'm in the same issues with Mateus!! He was and still is such an inspiration for my turtles job! It's a really adrenaline-filled story arc, so people will find it truly incredible. Time to kick some shells!\"\n\nMutant Nation Backup Story Stars Casey Jones\n\nEach arc of Mutant Nation will explore two stories in different parts of the TMNT universe, easily accessible for casual fans and with ties connected to the ongoing series and Nightcrawler. Writer Erik Burnham and artist Mateus Santolouco will present a four-issue bonus backup, set after the events of The Untold Destiny of the Foot Clan and starring Casey Jones.\n\nBurnham spoke about writing the backup story and how it connects to others in the TMNT comics. \"There is so much going on in the TMNT universe, it has so many great characters and stories to tell, and it's always been tough to fit everything into 20 pages a month. I'm psyched Mutant Nation exists to shine a light on those stories and give us all the chance to keep building out this iteration of the mythology. Personally, I'm always glad to get a chance to both expand on the Foot Clan characters and work with Mateus Santolouco, so these first few issues are extra special for me.\"\n\nRelated\n\nPrincess Leia Joins Darth Vader in New First Look\n\nMarvel unveils a first look teasing the father-daughter Dark Side partnership between Darth Vader and Princess Leia in Star Wars: Darth Vader #50.\n\nSantolouco discussed tying Mutant Nation in as a follow-up to Untold Destiny of the Foot Clan, saying: \"There are a couple reasons I'm excited to be on board for Mutant Nation. First, here Erik and I have the opportunity to create a little follow-up of our latest miniseries, Untold Destiny of the Foot Clan, unfolding character-driven motivations and consequences of the events that took place in Untold on an action-packed story. Erik did a great job establishing a frenetic dynamic to the narrative that delivers non-stop punches and kicks without forgetting the character's development, and I'm having a blast turning this into a visual storytelling. Also, it is nice to be a part of the \"glue\" that will tie the former ongoing series to the new TMNT relaunch at IDW, and I'm looking forward to seeing how everything will fit together down the road.\"\n\nTMNT: Mutant Nation #1 goes on sale Sept. 18 from IDW Comics.\n\nSource: IDW", "source": {"uri": "cbr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_fang@cbr.com", "name": "Sam Fang", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mutant (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ninja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turtle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMNT_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TMNT (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_Book_Resources", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comic Book Resources"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R\u014dnin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "R\u014dnin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uncharted"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Aaron", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Aaron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ongoing_series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ongoing series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Casey Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javier_Fern\u00e1ndez_(figure_skater)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Javier Fern\u00e1ndez (figure skater)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Destiny (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoskeleton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exoskeleton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDW_Publishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IDW Publishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_arc", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Story arc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniseries", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miniseries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Leia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princess Leia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darth Vader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Stories", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Stories", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Fan Pages", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Writing_and_Literature", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Writing and Literature", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/tmnt-mutant-nation.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802719", "eventUri": "eng-9802719", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-18", "textStart": 956, "textEnd": 964, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

It adds depth and context to the historical marker and commemorative manhole cover that were installed last year to mark TMNT's point of origin.\n\nWoodman executive director Jonathan Nichols said the museum's mission focuses on art, history, science, and connecting Dover to the rest of the world.\n\n\"So for us it felt like a no-brainer,\" he said.\n\nThe museum partnered with Kevin Eastman Studios over the past year to develop the gallery, which is both informative and participatory, Nichols said.\n\n\"There's artwork, memorabilia, and history of the creation of the Ninja Turtles,\" he said, \"but then there are also interactive elements, like an art library ... and like some video game consoles that people can come in and play, or sit down and read some of the comics.\"\n\nDon't come expecting a replica of the room where the cold-blooded adolescents came to be, Nichols noted.\n\n\"I would say it feels like you're stepping into a comic book,\" he added. \"It's very colorful. It's an homage to the Turtles themselves.\"\n\nTo visit the gallery on its opening day, which runs from 10 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. this Saturday, Aug. 10, you will need to buy a ticket and pick from the available time slots, which the museum said it expects will sell out. There will also be various turtle-related vendors and a free outdoor screening of \"TMNT: Mutant Mayhem,\" at 8 p.m.\n\nIn case you can't make it for opening day, the gallery is selling tickets for time slots from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday as well.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Eastman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Eastman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Laird", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Peter Laird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ninja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Turtle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dover", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dover"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dover"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donatello", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donatello"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raphael"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_franchise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Media franchise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leonardo da Vinci"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michelangelo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Nichols_(Oklahoma_politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Nichols (Oklahoma politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMNT_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TMNT (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commemorative_plaque", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commemorative plaque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turtles", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Turtles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Library"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Visual_Arts/Museum_Stores", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Visual Arts/Museum Stores", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/pbrebjQP0D2FFuB9hI1MLSJNh-w=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/HXVVF6KYNX35HN5ZXZHZB74EXE.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802719", "eventUri": "eng-9802719", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-10", "textStart": 1566, "textEnd": 1573}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

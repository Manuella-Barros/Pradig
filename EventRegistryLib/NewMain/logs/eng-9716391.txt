Given the rush, a few are just paper candidates and didn't campaign.\n\n'Some people began as paper candidates but then did campaign, and one of these - James McMurdock in South Basildon and East Thurrock - ended up winning his seat.'\n\nMark Matlock was one of Reform's 609 candidates on July 4, raking in 4.1% of the vote in Clapham and Brixton Hill, some 100miles from his Cotswolds home.\n\nSuspicions were raised when he failed to appear at the count that night, having posted no photos of himself out on the campaign trail in the weeks prior.\n\nHe hadn't appeared at the hustings, and the Green Party candidate told Byline Times leading up to polling day: 'I haven't seen or heard from the Reform UK candidate.'\n\nShao-Lan Yuen added: 'I've heard suspicions that the image on his leaflets are AI generated.'\n\nMr Matlock claims he did do a leaflet drop in his adopted constituency, saying: 'The election caught us all on the hop and Rishi Sunak knew that.\n\n'But we still managed to fill most of the seats with candidates, even if not all of them lived there, and it all contributed to our vote share.'\n\nHowever, when people took a closer look at his campaign literature, some started to believe he wasn't real at all.\n\nWas Reform's candidate just AI?\n\nHis photo does have something of a 2D quality - soft edges of his face, a blurred hairline, lack of depth from shadows and lighting, and almost flawless skin.\n\nBut Matlock has an alibi.\n\nAt 7.43pm on July 4, he shared a post on X saying: 'Unfortunately I will not be attending the count tonight as I have pneumonia.\n\n'The hospital I visited was closed before it's closing time. I said to the nurse on a buzzer I am struggling to breath and she said call a number. Vote reform this is madness.'\n\nMr Matlock attached a photo to the post - of a 'temporary closure' sign outside the hospital's minor injuries unit, but not of himself.\n\nRichard Tice, a newly elected Reform MP, and leader of the party before Nigel Farage swept him aside, has shared the post to hit back claims Matlock doesn't exist.\n\nTice said: 'All those muppets including The Guardian claiming Mark is not a real person: He was very ill, trying to get into a hospital....\n\n'But lefties don't care, just slander folk claiming real people do not exist. Shameful.'\n\nMatlock has echoed this sentiment himself.\n\nIn another X post, the Reform candidate said: 'The extreme left are attacking me, attacking my party because we stand in the way of them controlling you.\n\n'I am a real person I have real values and this hoax of a witch hunt will be exposed.'\n\nHe's spent several days swaying between revulsion at the accusations, and revelling in the attention, even sharing Scooby Doo and Spartacus memes.\n\nBut Mr Matlock is yet to share any other image of himself on X.\n\nThe Guardian reported that Matlock showed the paper 'a copy of the original image', which he reportedly 'changed to make his tie a Reform light blue'.\n\nMatlock said: 'The image is me. Stupidly I had to get it altered to change my tie and suit as I couldn't get to a photographer on time.'\n\nThe original image was not included in The Guardian's report.\n\nPrivate Eye, which looked into the case last week, concluded Matlock's 'campaign image is AI-generated', created due to a lack of photos with him wearing a turquoise tie.\n\nThe magazine confirmed that Matlock said: 'I am a real person.'\n\nByline Times has also reported it has 'confirmed Matlock is a real person', saying: 'He appears to be an antiques dealer originally from Guernsey.'\n\nThe news outlet also highlighted cases of Reform candidates with seemingly zero digital footprint - no photos, no bios, no social media accounts, no sightings on the campaign trail.\n\nAs many as 115 people running for Reform were 'ghost candidates', according to Tortoise, which described them as 'men and women standing at the general election who have no profile picture or biography on the site'.\n\nA Reform spokesperson said: 'These candidates are not ghosts. This is just an issue of institutional capacity, the sheer quantity of work involved in making everything work.'\n\nSome won thousands of votes in their constituencies, despite it being 'almost impossible to find anything about them', as Tortoise, an online news outlet, reported.\n\nOne case of a paper candidate in Glasgow prompted a TikToker to do a multi-party series searching for the Reform election hopeful, even going so far as to visit an address in London with no luck.\n\nAnalysis by Byline Times revealed only 45% of Reform candidates had a published Facebook page.\n\nNearly 100% had an email address, many of which were general local party addresses.\n\nJust 9% had Instagram, 3% had LinkedIn, 8% had TikTok, and 44% had X.\n\nIt's hard to prove a person doesn't exist, and there is no evidence that any of Reform's candidate are not real people.\n\nBut if any of them did turn out to be fake, it would be a serious electoral offence for the Electoral Commission and the police to investigate.\n\nIn order to become an election candidate, you must submit a completed nomination paper, a home address form, your consent to nomination, and authorisation to use a party description and emblem, if standing for a party.\n\nThat's according to the Electoral Commission website, which makes no mention of proof of ID in the nomination process.\n\nGeneral Election nomination papers do not ask for photo ID.", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "danny_rigg@metro.co.uk", "name": "Danny Rigg", "type":

Stupidly I had to get it altered to change my tie and suit as I couldn't get to a photographer on time,\" he told The Guardian.\n\nAppearing on GB News, Mr Matlock said he believed there was \"a massive agenda out to get our party\". On X he claimed the speculation was \"set to destroy our integrity amongst our party\".\n\nAsked if all Reform UK candidates were actually real people, party chairman Richard Tice told the speculation was \"absurd\".\n\n\"These lefties need to stop being so bitter about how well we did. It is called democracy.\"\n\nHe also pointed to a post Mr Matlock made on X explaining that he could not make the election night count as he had to go to hospital - which people online had used to accuse him of being a \"made up candidate\".\n\nMr Tice said: \"The bloke nearly died of pneumonia for heaven's sake and was in hospital and tweeted this on the night.\"\n\nLocal council records suggest that he lives in the South Cotswolds constituency, and some outlets have suggested he may be an antique dealer based in Guernsey. has been unable to confirm this.\n\nHe came fifth in the race for Clapham and Brixton Hill, gaining 1,800 votes compared to the 24,200 secured by Bell Ribeiro-Addy, the incumbent candidate for Labour and winner in the seat.\n\nWhile Mr Matlock is the only Reform UK candidate accused of using AI-generated imagery, several others were accused of being absent from the campaign trail or having limited information about them available online.\n\nRichard Visick, the candidate for Reform UK in Bristol South, is listed on the official nomination forms as living at an address in Gibraltar, around 1,700 miles away from the place where he was standing.\n\nByline Times has also pointed out that limited information is available on Morgan Young, the candidate for South Dorset, and Helen Burns, Glasgow North - both have no social media presence and locals told the publication they were not sighted on the campaign trail.\n\nReform insists every one of its 609 candidates on 4 July were real. The Guardian reports that the party has accepted that some were \"paper candidates\" who did no campaigning and were there to help increase the party's vote share.\n\nIs it illegal to put up a fake candidate in a general election?\n\nTo stand as a candidate in a general election you must be at least 18 years old, British citizens and not hold a job that disqualifies you such as a police officer, civil servant, judge or member of the armed forces.\n\nYou also can't stand if you have been disqualified for other reasons such as bankruptcy, convictions for electoral fraud or because you are in prison.\n\nThe other main requirement is that you are a real person, and have received nomination signatures from 10 voters registered in the constituency where you are standing.\n\nThe nomination papers to stand in a general election must be delivered by hand to the returning officer either by the candidate or their election agent who can act on their behalf.\n\nIt is a criminal offence for someone to knowingly make a false statement on a nomination paper, including by faking nomination signatures or the details of the candidate.\n\nWhat are the rules on using AI-generated images in campaign material?\n\nThere is no specific rule barring candidates from using AI-generated images on their campaign material in a UK election, but they are not allowed to make \"false statements\" about the character or conduct of another candidate.\n\nHowever, Vijay Rangarajan, the Electoral Commission's chief executive, did put out a warning ahead of polling day urging candidates to consider what they were putting in their leaflets and on their social media.\n\nHe said: \"We are calling on campaigners to fulfil their vital role responsibly and think carefully about the material they are producing.\n\n\"Campaigners should consider if the material they are creating could mislead voters - it is their responsibility to make sure it does not.\n\n\"Anyone using generative AI should make that clear to those seeing the material. We will closely monitor the use of AI in this election.\"", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eleanor_langford@inews.co.uk", "name":

We need Reform to show who they are. People need to have faith in the democratic process.\"\n\nA series of candidates listed on the Nigel Farage-led party's election website only show their name and the constituency they stood in, without any information about them, or contact details beyond a generic regional email address.\n\nMany of these people have no visible online presence, and did not appear to do any campaigning. Photographs of the electoral counts for some of the relevant constituencies show that the Reform candidate was the only person not to attend.\n\nUnder electoral rules, the only details that need to be given about the candidate is their full name and the constituency where they live. They must all have an agent, and be nominated by 10 local voters.\n\nWith some of the Reform candidates, it is not clear if they are listed on the electoral register for the area where they are standing - which in a few cases is hundreds of miles from the constituency in question. One person with the same name and location of a candidate denied it was them.\n\nWhile there is no evidence any of the candidates are fake, if that turned out to be true, it would be a serious electoral offence. Reform was keen to win as big a share of the national vote as possible, which is helped by a full slate of candidates. Some of the seemingly invisible candidates won several thousand votes.\n\nA Reform source said: \"All our candidates are categorically real. Given the rush, a few are just paper candidates and didn't campaign. Some people began as paper candidates but then did campaign, and one of these - James McMurdock in South Basildon and East Thurrock - ended up winning his seat.\"\n\nThe Guardian has also learned that one Reform candidate suspected of being fake, in part because his official election photo looked AI-generated, is a real person.\n\nThe suspicions about Mark Matlock, who won 1,758 votes in Clapham and Brixton Hill in south London, were compounded when he did not show for the election count, with sceptics also pointing to an apparent lack of any photographs of him campaigning.\n\nHowever, Matlock insisted that he did exist, and there was a reason for the curious-looking election picture: \"The image is me.

Meet the Reform UK candidate accused of being AI generated", "body": "DOUBT has been raised about several election hopefuls who stood without providing any details about themselves.\n\nReform denies Mark Matlock is an AI-generated candidate after there appeared to be little digital footprint. Here's what we know about him.\n\nMark Matlock, a candidate whose existence was seriously questioned by voters, did not appear at hustings or even the election count.\n\nHis campaign platform included responsible management of human job transitions to AI, as stated on his website.\n\nAlthough he was physically absent, he verified his identity in a phone interview with The Independent, stating, \"I am a real person and that is me in the photo.\"\n\nHe then addressed the rumours about his existence: \"Though I must admit I am enjoying the free publicity and when I feel up to it I will put out a video and prove these rumours that I'm a robot are absolute baloney.\n\n\"I got pneumonia three days before election night. I was exercising, taking vitamins so I could attend, but it was just not viable.\n\n\"On election night I couldn't even stand.\"\n\nHe clarified the authenticity of his campaign photo, which was edited due to logistical challenges: \"The photo of me was taken outside the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.\n\n\"I had the background removed and replaced with the logo and they changed the colour of my tie.\n\n\"The only reason that was done was because we couldn't get a photographer at such short notice - but that is me.\"\n\nRegarding the online conspiracy theories suggesting he wasn't real, Matlock shared his amusement and perspective: \"I just laughed when I saw it. I think it perked me up. I thought 'I need to get back out there!'\n\n\"This is doing more good for me than my campaign - it's fantastic.\"\n\nMatlock also discussed his efforts to participate in hustings, which were unsuccessful: \"I called Lambeth council loads of times to get on hustings but none of them invited me to the hustings.\n\n\"I am so pro-hustings. I care about what I'm running for and invite people to question me but I was never given that opportunity.\n\n\"The Tories and Labour didn't want us there.\"\n\nMatlock, who is from the Cotswolds, blamed the quick turnaround for his lack of presence in the capital.\n\nHe said to the Guardian: \"The election caught us all on the hop and Rishi Sunak knew that.\n\n\"But we still managed to fill most of the seats with candidates, even if not all of them lived there, and it all contributed to our vote share.\"\n\nHe explained his campaign strategy and its challenges, particularly in London where he had been absent at times: \"I was really pleased [with the votes] given the time we had. I was campaigning in Clacton for Nigel to make sure he got his seat.\n\n\"Had the leader not got his seat, it would have made a mockery of our entire party.\n\n\"Given the time we had we couldn't develop a strong team of volunteers to go knocking on doors and leafleting.\n\n\"I was outside the tube station but other days I had to dedicate myself to neighbouring constituencies.\"\n\nMatlock reflected on the overall election results: \"We never truly believed we would ever do as well as we did in London.\n\n\"We got 4 million votes but only five seats. Some of us are smarting but overall we are psyched.\n\n\"We are a new party the election was shoved on us in such a short space of time - it is unbelievable.\"\n\nMark Matlock won 1,758 votes in Clapham and Brixton Hill in south London for Reform UK.\n\nHe is one of 609 candidates put forward by the party.\n\nThe election website managed by Nigel Farage's party only provides the names and constituencies of its candidates, without any additional details or personal contact information, aside from a regional email.\n\nMany of these candidates lack a digital footprint and did not appear in person to campaign.\n\nAt certain electoral counts, it was noted that the Reform candidate was the only one absent.\n\nElectoral regulations stipulate that a candidate's full name and residential constituency are the only required disclosures.\n\nEach candidate must also have an agent and be endorsed by ten local supporters.\n\nFor some Reform candidates, it's unclear whether they are registered voters in the constituencies they aim to represent, with a few residing hundreds of miles away.\n\nThere was an instance where an individual, sharing the name and location of a listed candidate, denied being the candidate.\n\nWhile there's no evidence suggesting any candidates are fictitious, such a scenario would constitute a major electoral violation.\n\nReform's strategy attempts to capture as large a portion of the national vote as possible.\n\nDespite their lack of visibility, some candidates managed to secure several thousand votes.\n\nReform has denied the allegations and said that none of the candidates are AI-generated.\n\nA Reform source said: \"All our candidates are categorically real.\n\n\"Given the rush, a few are just paper candidates and didn't campaign.\n\n\"Some people began as paper candidates but then did campaign, and one of these - James McMurdock in South Basildon and East Thurrock - ended up winning his seat.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "suswati_basu@thesun.co.uk", "name": "Suswati Basu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Matlock", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Matlock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matlock_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matlock (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Husting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Husting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashmolean_Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ashmolean Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pneumonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oxford"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oxford"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clacton_(UK_Parliament_constituency)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clacton (UK Parliament constituency)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambeth", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lambeth"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotswolds", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cotswolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Farage", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nigel Farage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_UK", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reform UK"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_candidate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paper candidate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Basildon_and_East_Thurrock_(UK_Parliament_constituency)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Basildon and East Thurrock (UK Parliament constituency)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_constituencies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom constituencies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brixton_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brixton Hill"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brixton Hill"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clapham", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clapham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Clapham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/file-1.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716391", "eventUri": "eng-9716391", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

We need Reform to show who they are. People need to have faith in the democratic process.\"\n\nQuite why Reform UK was chasing \"vote share\" in a political election that has no party proportional system is a question in itself. However targeting that system got them about 15% of the total vote and the same amount of MPs as the Greens, who largely targeted seats that they could win and who got about 5%. But expecting the people who brought you the economic disaster that is Brexit probably just means that you are expecting far too much rational thinking from them.\n\nOne of the candidates pictured below for instance was questioned about being a AI generated image. You can see why ..\n\nTurned out that he wasn't. It was a real person with a touched up photo:-\n\nThe suspicions about Mark Matlock, who won 1,758 votes in Clapham and Brixton Hill in south London, were compounded when he did not show for the election count, with sceptics also pointing to an apparent lack of any photographs of him campaigning.\n\nHowever, Matlock insisted that he did exist, and there was a reason for the curious-looking election picture: \"The image is me. Stupidly I had to get it altered to change my tie and suit as I couldn't get to a photographer on time.\" He showed the Guardian a copy of the original image, which was changed to make his tie a Reform light blue.\n\nMatlock, who lives in the Cotswolds, said he did undertake a leaflet drop, adding that he understood the rush to get candidates in place: \"The election caught us all on the hop and Rishi Sunak knew that. But we still managed to fill most of the seats with candidates, even if not all of them lived there, and it all contributed to our vote share.\"\n\nThe Clapham and Brixton Hill candidate said he missed the election count because he had pneumonia.\n\nStill leaves me deeply suspicious. I wonder how the Guardian contacted Matlock. In person? Becaus eit is just as easy to fake a 'real' photo and remove AI traces and metadata. Plus the 'vote share' again ! Sounds more like a AI pumping the PR line. Or the \"Taxpayers Union\" or \"Free Speech Union\" here mindlessly pushing their major donor policies with their toy puppets.\n\nThe UK apparently requires a minimal effort to confirm candidates are real.\n\nUnder electoral rules, the only details that need to be given about the candidate is their full name and the constituency where they live. They must all have an agent, and be nominated by 10 local voters.\n\nConsequently the Guardian has had issues tracking down some of the mysterious Reform UK candidates.\n\nIt is even less tough here - Electoral Commission: \"How to become a candidate at a general election\"\n\nYou have to be nominated by two voters enrolled in the electorate you want to contest. You cannot nominate yourself.

Some people began as paper candidates but then did campaign, and one of these - James McMurdock in South Basildon and East Thurrock - ended up winning his seat.\"", "source": {"uri": "fullfact.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Full Fact"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constituencies_of_the_Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Constituencies of the Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matlock,_Derbyshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matlock, Derbyshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Matlock, Derbyshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_UK", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reform UK"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_United_Kingdom_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2015 United Kingdom general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brixton_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brixton Hill"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brixton Hill"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clapham", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clapham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Clapham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GB_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GB News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_candidate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paper candidate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Basildon_and_East_Thurrock_(UK_Parliament_constituency)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Basildon and East Thurrock (UK Parliament constituency)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://fullfact.org/media/_versions/reform_social_media.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716391", "eventUri": "eng-9716391", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 206, "textEnd": 212}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Hello. I am Mark Matlock. How are you?\n\nI am a real person and that is me in the picture, he confirmed. But I have to admit that I enjoy the free publicity and when I feel like it, I will put out a video to prove that the rumors of me being a robot are complete bullshit.\n\nI got pneumonia three days before Election Day, and I was able to attend by taking vitamins and exercising, but it was just impossible. I couldn't even stand on Election Night.\n\nMy photo was taken outside the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. I removed the background, replaced it with a logo, and changed the color of my tie. The reason for this was that I couldn't find a photographer in a short period of time. But that's me.\n\nThe candidate said the original photograph was taken in Oxford and had the Reform UK logo added and the tie colour changed (Mark Matlock)\n\nThe candidate described his first reaction to online conspiracy theories as hilarious.\n\nI just laughed when I saw that, he said. I think that encouraged me. I thought I should go back out there! This has helped me more than my campaign. It's fantastic.\n\nHis political rivals were quick to raise concerns about Matrox's veracity.\n\nGreen Party candidate Shao-Lan Yuen told Byline Times before the Reform Party MP confirmed who he was: I have never seen or heard of the Reform Party candidate for Clapham and Brixton Hill. He did not campaign. I have heard suspicions that the image on his leaflet was AI-generated.\n\nMatlocks website (Reform UK)\n\nIndependent John Key added that he could not be seen on election night.\n\nHe said, \"I emailed Mark and all the other candidates.\" I've heard back from some of the candidates, but not from Mark. He doesn't live in that district.\n\nBut Mr Matlock insists: I've called Lambeth Council several times to try to get out there and no one has invited me to go out. I'm very much in favour of going out. I care about what I'm running for and I encourage people to ask me questions, but I've never been given that opportunity. The Conservatives and Labour didn't want us there.\n\n\"I was really glad,\" he said of claims he had skipped the campaign in London. [with the votes] Given the time we had, I campaigned in Clacton to get Nigel the seat. If the leader had not won the seat, our whole party would have been a laughing stock.\n\nGiven the time we had, we couldn't build a strong team of volunteers to knock on doors and hand out flyers. I was out of the subway station, but I had to devote other days to surrounding constituencies.\n\nWe really didn't believe we could do as well as we did in London. We got 4 million votes but only got 5 seats. Some of us are angry but overall we are excited. We are a new party and an election was forced upon us in such a short time.

It is a crime to field fake candidates and must be investigated immediately.\"\n\n\"We might be on the verge of a HUGE SCANDAL,\" another account wrote. \"Suspicions have been raised that Reform have fielded election candidates that aren't real people.\"\n\nBut Matlock has now come forward, insisting that his extremely photoshopped-looking visage is in fact real -- at least to some extent.\n\n\"I am a real person and that is me in the photo,\" he told The Independent over the phone. \"Though I must admit I am enjoying the free publicity and when I feel up to it I will put out a video and prove these rumors that I'm a robot are absolute baloney.\"\n\nAdding to the drama, Matlock was unable to show up during the country's election last week. Now he claims he \"got pneumonia three days before election night.\"\n\n\"I was exercising taking vitamins so I could attend but it was just not viable,\" he told The Independent. \"On election night I couldn't even stand.\"\n\nAs for the obviously tinkered-with photo, Matlock said that he had asked Reform UK to make substantial changes to a real photo of him standing outside a museum in Oxford.\n\n\"I had the background removed and replaced with the logo and they changed the color of my tie,\" Matlock told the newspaper. \"The only reason that was done was because we couldn't get a photographer at such short notice -- but that is me.\"\n\nAnd was there some sort of beauty filter that turned his face into something that looks even more fake than what a current AI generator can come up with?\n\nRegardless, the candidate's rushed race to get on the ballot doesn't exactly instill confidence, especially for a party that has already been embroiled in plenty of controversy. Last month, three of its candidates were dropped following reports that they made racist comments, including derogatory statements regarding the IQ of sub-Saharan Africans and that Black people should \"get off [their] lazy arses.\"\n\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage was also a figurehead of the UK's Brexit campaign in 2016, an ill-advised move that has turned out to be incredibly unpopular.\n\nIn last week's elections, Farage's party secured just one percent of seats in parliament, representing 14 percent of voters.\n\nWhile Matlock says he's definitely a flesh-and-blood human, there was another candidate who wasn't shy to reveal he was actually AI.\n\nA bizarre avatar dubbed \"AI Steve\" appeared on the ballot, running to represent constituents in the south of England. He only scored 179 votes, a mere 0.3 percent, losing out to the Green party's Si\u00e2n Berry, who received well over 28,000 votes.\n\nIn short, only one thing seems certain about AI in elections: things are starting to get very, very weird.", "source": {"uri": "futurism.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Futurism"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_UK", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reform UK"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Matlock", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Matlock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matlock_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matlock (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_populism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing populism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_Judaism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reform Judaism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pneumonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oxford"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oxford"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brexit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Si\u00e2n_Berry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Si\u00e2n Berry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sub-Saharan Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Farage", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigel Farage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Photography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wordpress-assets.futurism.com/2024/07/political-candidate-accused-ai-living-human.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716391", "eventUri": "eng-9716391", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

It's Mark Matlock speaking how are you?\"\n\n\"I am a real person and that is me in the photo,\" he confirmed. \"Though I must admit I am enjoying the free publicity and when I feel up to it I will put out a video and prove these rumours that I'm a robot are absolute baloney.\n\n\"I got pneumonia three days before election night I was exercising taking vitamins so I could attend but it was just not viable.

The only reason that was done was because we couldn't get a photographer at such short notice - but that is me.\"\n\nThe candidate explained that his initial reaction to the online conspiracies was amusement.\n\n\"I just laughed when I saw it,\" he said. \"I think it perked me up. I thought 'I need to get back out there!' This is doing more good for me than my campaign - it's fantastic.\"\n\nHis political rivals had been quick to raise concerns about Mr Matlock's authenticity.\n\nGreen party candidate Shao-Lan Yuen told Byline Times before the Reform member confirmed who he was: \"I haven't seen or heard from the Reform UK candidate for Clapham and Brixton Hill constituency. He wasn't at the hustings. I've heard suspicions that the image on his leaflets are AI generated.\"\n\nIndependent Jon Key added there had been \"no sign of him\" on election night.\n\n\"I did email Mark, as well as all the other candidates,\" he said. \"I heard back from a few, but not from Mark...He doesn't live in the constituency.\"\n\nBut Mr Matlock insists: \"I called Lambeth council loads of times to get on hustings but none of them invited me to the hustings. I am so pro-hustings. I care about what I'm running for and invite people to question me but I was never given that opportunity. The Tories and Labour didn't want us there.\"\n\nOn claims he was absent from campaigns in London, he said: \"I was really pleased [with the votes] given the time we had. I was campaigning in Clacton for Nigel to make sure he got his seat. Had the leader not got his seat it would have made a mockery of our entire party.\n\n\"Given the time we had we couldn't develop a strong team of volunteers to go knocking on doors and leafleting.

Candidate responds to claims he's AI", "body": "Related video: Farage set to be 'Trump's link to UK' after Reform victory\n\nThe general election has been and gone and we're seeing a new Labour government in its infancy, but there's one aspect of Thursday's big vote which is now making headlines - and that concerns online discussion about whether a number of candidates who stood for Reform UK are actually real people.\n\nNigel Farage's party - formerly known as the Brexit Party - fielded 609 candidates on 4 July, and in many cases where Labour candidates won or held onto their seat, Reform UK ended up in second place.\n\nHowever, now that the dust has settled on six chaotic weeks of campaigning, social media sleuths and journalists alike are questioning the legitimacy of a number of Reform UK candidates after they didn't show up at declarations, share any pictures of themselves online or have much of a digital presence.\n\nTake Mark Matlock, the party's candidate in the constituency of Clapham and Brixton Hill, whose AI-like photo of himself only fuelled speculation that he isn't a real person:\n\nThe Independent has since verified Matlock does actually exist though, as the candidate - who finished fifth with 1,758 votes in a contest which saw Labour's Bell Ribeiro-Addy keep her seat - told the outlet the image is of him.\n\n\"I got pneumonia three days before election night. I was exercising taking vitamins so I could attend but it was just not viable. On election night I couldn't even stand.\n\n\"The photo of me was taken outside the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. I had the background removed and replaced with the logo and they changed the colour of my tie. The only reason that was done was because we couldn't get a photographer at such short notice - but that is me,\" he said.\n\nHe appeared on GB News as well, criticising \"fake news\" which has come out about his very existence.\n\nBut he's not the only Reform UK candidate who has faced questions over whether they are actually a real person, as in Glasgow South West the party's representative was Morag McRae.\n\nShe finished with 2,236 votes, but didn't appear at the declaration and doesn't appear to have a social media presence:\n\nAnd over on TikTok, stand-up comic Kim Blythe has gone viral for trying to track down Helen Burns, who stood in Glasgow North and picked up 1,655 votes (the full results saw incumbent Alison Thewliss of the Scottish National Party lose her seat to Labour's Martin Rhodes).\n\n\"I'm convinced there's a candidate in my area that does not exist ... I think it's Nigel Farage in a wig,\" she said.\n\nBlythe also penned an email to the local branch of Reform UK which read: \"Helen if you're seeing this hen would love a chat.\"\n\nBut it seems as though she hasn't received a response.\n\nAnd in the latest development, Blythe decided to visit Reform UK's Victoria Street headquarters in London while on a work visit to see if they had any information to share about Ms Burns.\n\n\"It turns out not only are the candidates not real, their office isn't real, because apparently this is a virtual address, which I didn't even know was a thing. No Reform was found here,\" she said.\n\nElsewhere, chairman and former leader of Reform UK, Richard Tice, appeared on ITV's Peston to address the speculation, fuming that the Liberal Democrats have raised questions over the legitimacy of their candidates.\n\nHe told the ITV political editor: \"It's a total, fabricated lie. It is nothing short of defamatory, libellous and utterly outrageous.\n\n\"We proved it to people like them in The Guardian and still they print this utter trash and garbage. I'm steaming mad about it.\n\n\"One of [the candidates] was in hospital at the count with pneumonia - nearly died, for heaven's sake. These people need to get a grip.\"\n\nIt's the latest story to surround Reform UK's election candidates after a number of them were dropped amid accusations of racism - something which also sparked defections to rival parties.", "source": {"uri": "indy100.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "indy100.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_UK", "type":

The candidate, who won 1,758 votes, discovered accusations online that his glossy profile picture was computer-generated.\n\nIn an interview with The Independent, Matlock sought to dispel the rumours, reassuring the public of his authenticity. \"I am a real person and that is me in the photo,\" he affirmed, attributing his absence to severe illness. \"I got pneumonia three days before election night.

Additionally, the edited background of his photo, taken outside the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, further fueled speculation.\n\nDespite initial amusement at the online conspiracies, Matlock is determined to set the record straight. \"I think it perked me up. This is doing more good for me than my campaign,\" he remarked.\n\nPolitical rivals had raised concerns about Matlock's authenticity.

If it were easy for someone like that to get publicity, no one would ever campaign, there wouldn't be a thriving PR industry, and social media companies wouldn't make millions from political advertising.\n\nBut it turns out, to nobody's surprise, that we don't live in a normal world, and all Mark Matlock - Reform UK candidate for Brixton and Clapham Hill - had to do was wait. He has gone from a political nobody to a hero vindicated at the centre of a social media storm, where users were drawn to the possibility of a political scandal where a party they likely detested had allegedly invented fake candidates with the help of Artificial Intelligence. Not only is he very much real; his story has helped identify some of the problems we have countering disinformation in the UK.\n\nAbsent from hustings and the election night itself, suspicions over whether Matlock was in fact an actual person were understandable, and certainly not improved by a candidate image that carries the sort of airbrushing you see teenagers do on photo editing apps. It also has heterochromia - differently coloured eyes - which is fairly rare amongst the general population, but extremely popular amongst AI generated avatars. Those who raised their eyebrows did so because the image appeared to tick all the boxes of manipulation.\n\nThe other point was that Mark Matlock wasn't the only Reform UK candidate who carried an air of mystery. Byline Times reported the day before the election that several of the party's candidates were unphotographed and unaccounted for on social media, and invisible across political media interviews - which included a lack of response to the questions Byline Times themselves sent their way.\n\nMatlock's photograph had been manipulated, but he was a real person. And we knew this before the news explosion this week. Byline Times issued a clarification and in its 5 July issue Private Eye reported that Matlock was accounted for, speaking to him and confirming that the photograph was edited to feature a plain background and change the colour of his tie to Reform's trademark turquoise. AI Headshot Generators have been on the market for at least a year to help people without photographers try and craft LinkedIn friendly profile pictures; this is not the last photograph we are going to see like this.\n\nNone of this stopped the whipping of scepticism on social media. Posts claiming Matlock had been invented by AI were picking up speed despite the reports from Private Eye and clarification from Byline Times. You can tell how much the story has taken hold from Matlock's own X replies.\n\nOn election day itself he was taking time to reply to people's queries, answering: \"I have been campaigning extremely hard, plus I have been helping in other areas. Five days ago I was struck down with pneumonia and haven't been as able to as much as I would like.\" In another, he added \"it was edited for the background and tie colour change only. As darling Rishi only gave us all six weeks to get the election done, photographers were fully booked.\"\n\nBy this week, the tenor had changed. \"Are you just another far-left fake news journalist ? Or are you just another annoying pointless one ?\" he riposted at yet another baseless demand.\n\nAt the time of writing, there is no evidence that candidates are fake - and yet social media posts and news articles are still proliferating, presumably to cash in on search interest.\n\n\"Did Reform UK create a fake general election candidate using AI?\" asked the Evening Standard on Tuesday. \"Reform UK under pressure to prove all its candidates were real people,\" a headline read in The Guardian on Monday.\n\nI feel nauseous about a lot of mis- and disinformation reporting in the UK for this reason. Too often publications promote a conspiracy before debunking it.\n\nThis story ultimately suits Reform, a party that markets itself as renegade and repeatedly unrepresented by mainstream media. Media scrutiny for them is not about being reasonably held accountable; it's an attack. And when most of the \"attacks\" appear to be coming from social media users on a certain political side, it's up to news media to temper, not tamper.\n\nInstead, Matlock and Reform UK have been presented with something to rail against. Matlock has called it an \"agenda\", I would call it an overreaction by the news industry to potential disinformation. A red flag should never stop journalists from investigating something - but it should make us more judicious with how we publish.\n\nInstead of interrogating why the party was so poorly placed to organise, campaign and even photograph candidates, we've given Reform UK and their supporters yet another reason to feel alienated by the media.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byline_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Byline Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_UK", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reform UK"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matlock_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matlock (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Matlock", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mark Matlock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Political journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_Judaism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reform Judaism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Eye", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Private Eye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Husting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Husting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avatar (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Campaign advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brixton", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brixton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brixton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clapham", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clapham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Clapham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whip_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whip (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skepticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skepticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fake news"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Evening_Standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London Evening Standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mainstream media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Community_Video", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Community Video", "wgt": 17}], "image": "https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SEI_211491654.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2495px%2C1411px&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716391", "eventUri": "eng-9716391", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-05", "textStart": 2081, "textEnd": 2087}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Public suspicions were compounded when he did not show for the election count, with sceptics also pointing to an apparent lack of any photographs of him campaigning.\n\nHowever, Mark insisted that he did exist, and there was a reason for the curious-looking election picture, \"The image is me. Stupidly I had to get it altered to change my tie and suit as I couldn't get to a photographer on time.\" He showed the Guardian a copy of the original image, which was changed to make his tie a Reform light blue.\n\nReform insists every one of its 609 candidates on 4th July were real, while accepting that some were in effect 'paper candidates' who did no campaigning and were there simply to help increase the party's vote share.\n\nHowever, a string of candidates listed on the Nigel Farage-led party's election website only show their name and the constituency they stood in, without any information about them, or contact details beyond a generic regional email address.\n\nA Reform source said, \"All our candidates are categorically real. Given the rush, a few are just paper candidates and didn't campaign.\"\n\nAI expert John Kirk, chief strategy officer, ITG said, \"The use of generative AI technology in official photography and election materials can save time and money but can also cause confusion and suspicion if it becomes clear the images are not sourced from traditional photography. This incident is a reminder that AI-powered technology can and will continue to play a crucial role in content creation but must always be used proportionality.\"\n\nTech expert Suid Adeyanju, CEO of RiverSafe said, \"In an election riddled with fraudulent emails, misinformation and deepfakes, the slightest hint of AI-generated imagery being used on official literature will cause controversy and raise questions about the threat the technology poses to democracy.

If I were them, I'd feel flattered", "body": "Are you for real? I am, or at least I think I am, but I'm not sure I can be sure. What if the social media platform formerly known as Twitter says I am computer generated? What if the Guardian newspaper appears to agree? It would be enough to give anyone an existential crisis - especially if their head is still spinning from the general election campaign.\n\nEarlier this week, a Reform UK candidate faced exactly this disconcerting question, when online rumours began circulating that he might not exist. Desperate for more muck on Nigel Farage's party, Left-wing conspiracy theorists put it about that the party was not only riddled with bigots and racists, but also populated by avatars. Warning of a \"HUGE scandal\", a self-styled \"woke socialist and Brexit hating Scouse-Italian\" named \"Dr Bella\" took to X to claim that some of these bots might even have been in a position to win parliamentary seats. What excitement! Someone call the police!\n\nStill languishing on his sick bed after an unfortunately timed bout of pneumonia, Mark Matlock, erstwhile Reform UK candidate for Brixton and Clapham Hill, was disconcerted to find himself at the centre of the ensuing storm. He appears to have been singled out for suspicion on the basis of his candidate photo, in which he has unusually smooth looking skin. Staring straight at the camera, he does look a bit like one of those AI-generated South Korean newsreaders. A failure to show up to his own election count did nothing to stop the scuttlebutt.\n\nAppearing on live television to prove it all nonsense, Matlock did have something to declare, admitting he used a little computer wizardry to touch up his image. Apparently, he Photoshopped the colour of his tie, and airbrushed out the original backdrop. Protesting that he is \"very real\", he explained that the picture was taken outside Oxford's Ashmolean Museum, which wasn't quite the right look for a London constituency. He explained that he couldn't make the count, because he was too sick to stand, which as excuses go, seems pretty solid. Understandably indignant, he dismissed the brouhaha as \"fake news\".\n\nWho set this daft hare running? The usual suspects, of course: the same crowd that spent the general election campaign desperately trying to discredit Reform UK candidates via offence archaeology, dredging up ancient, off-colour comments from the social media seabed. Thanks to the haste with which the party had to fill the slate for 650 seats, and the sorry failure of an expensive vetting company to do its job, the exercise proved very rewarding. Critics of the party found plenty to froth about, including some genuinely ugly sentiments and language. Naturally, they were delighted by the political fallout. The election may be over, but evidently, the sport is too fun to give up.\n\nAnd so the wild controversies continue - and there's always the Grauniad to give it legs. In a confusing report, the Farage-baiting publication claimed Reform UK was \"under pressure\" to prove all its candidates were real, suggesting the absence of photographs, biographies or contact details on some candidate profiles raised doubts over their flesh-and-blood credentials. Demanding Reform UK \"come clean\", an obliging Liberal Democrat source opined that it \"didn't sound right\".\n\nFielding fake candidates in a parliamentary election is, of course, a criminal offence, which is probably why the Guardian report concluded with the following killer acknowledgement: \"There is no evidence that any of the candidates are fake.\" Never let the facts spoil a good headline!\n\nTruly, we are living in a parallel universe.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "isabel_oakeshott@telegraph.co.uk",

Yet it is they who are most prone to seeing conspiracies everywhere and falling for any old nonsense they see online.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats have made the extraordinary allegation that Nigel Farage's Reform UK fielded a number of fake, non-existent candidates. #FBPE Twitter is ablaze with accusations that some of Reform's prospective MPs were actually AI-generated bots. Apparently, because these candidates did not visibly campaign in their local patch, are not active on social media and did not show up to their counts, they therefore do not exist. Which is a bit of a stretch, to put it mildly.\n\nStrikingly, the mainstream media have entertained the harebrained theory, too. A Guardian headline states that Reform is 'under pressure to prove all its candidates were real people', although the article acknowledges that there is 'no evidence' whatsoever that they are not real. ITV's Robert Peston was also Just Asking Questions on his show last night, as he grilled Reform chairman Richard Tice on the fact-free claims about fake candidates.\n\nThe mundane truth is that these were no-hoper 'paper candidates' in unwinnable seats. So of course they were unlikely to be pounding the pavements every day. Still, they were placed on the ballot in order to maximise Reform UK's national vote share. This is standard political practice.\n\nAmong the candidates accused of being fake is Mark Matlock. He won 1,758 votes in Clapham and Brixton Hill in London, but he did not show up to the count on Thursday evening. Last night on GB News, he was forced to protest that he does indeed exist.

I am a real person. All the people who stood for our party are really people.\"\n\nIn a statement to her doubters, she added: \"You may have seen the fake news spread by media outlets over the past few days, claiming I don't exist. I do, indeed very much exist.\"\n\nShe said that she stood for Reform as she believed in Nigel Farage and his vision for the county.\n\n\"I stood for a constituency in Scotland as the country holds a very special place in my heart,\" she explained. \"We have travelled to many areas in Scotland over the past 20 years, and indeed got married in a small hunting lodge near Aviemore in 2019. This was featured in Scottish Wedding Magazine.\n\n\"I believe in Britain, and I believe Britain needs reform.\"\n\nThe search for Mrs Burns began after internet sleuths were unable to find any information about her online or a social media presence linking her to Reform UK.\n\nUsers asked whether Mr Farage's party had a \"random Scottish name generator\" to create fake individuals to put on the ballot paper, an accusation that would have amounted to electoral fraud.\n\nAs they were still unable to locate the candidate, she was given an almost mythical status, with one user saying: \"Helen Burns is the friends we made along the way.\"\n\nScottish comedian Kim Blythe made a series of videos about her search for Mrs Burns, suggesting that she could be \"Nigel in drag\" or the \"masked singer\".\n\nIn a third video, Ms Blythe travelled to London, joking that the trip was a mission to locate the candidate. She filmed herself calling out \"Helen\" in Westminster and went to Reform UK's nearby address, only to discover that it was a \"virtual office\".\n\nEven Mrs Burns' rivals for the Glasgow North seat joined in the hunt.\n\nIris Duane, who stood for the Greens, joked that \"she was in me all along\" when footage emerged of the camera panning to focus on her when Mrs Burns' share of the vote was announced at the Glasgow Emirates Arena.\n\nMs Blythe said that this proved that \"we are all Helen\".\n\nDaniel O'Malley, the Liberal Democrat candidate, used a Spartacus reference and announced: \"I'm Helen Burns\".\n\n\"I would like to address the Helen Burns in the room .... or lack thereof. No she was not at the count or any of the hustings, even the one chaired by John Curtice,\" Mr O'Malley told social media users.\n\n\"Questions need to be asked about the legitimacy of [Reform UK]. This is about trust in our election process.\"\n\nHe neglected to mention the fact that even in the face of her absence he had won fewer votes than Mrs Burns - 1,142 to her 1,655.\n\nMrs Burns, a mother of two and grandma of two, explained: \"A snap election had been called, and Reform, which I have officially represented since the start of the year, had hoped to have a candidate in every single constituency.\n\n\"Some hopeful candidates couldn't stand because there wasn't enough time to get the vetting.\n\n\"Our constituents were really upset in some areas asking why there wasn't a Reform candidate representing them. I was a paper candidate and was given every opportunity to represent my constituency.\n\n\"But I didn't go there, I didn't need to. I have visited Glasgow many times in the past.\"\n\nGawain Towler, a Reform UK spokesman, said that the suggestions that they had fielded fake candidates on the ballot papers, which require both local election agents and 10 nomination signatures, were \"preposterous\".\n\n\"It is as if people have never heard of paper candidates before, this has been a part of the British political system for longer than we have been alive,\" he told The Telegraph.\n\nHe said that because the election was called at such short notice they had very little time to find candidates and even the Tory Party, which called the poll, did not have a full slate.\n\nAfter Rishi Sunak announced the date, Reform \"called round and asked if there was anyone willing to stand as a paper candidate\" and many agreed, he said.\n\n\"Why would we have put up fake candidates? If we wanted fake candidates then we would have put up a full slate, but we didn't,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

The Jenny From The Block songstress shared a photo of Ben from his 2001 action film Pearl Harbor to her Instagram Stories as she praised him on the special day. 'Our hero,' she wrote along with a white heart emoji. 'Happy Father's Day,' she added. The couple, who wed in 2022, have been at the center of split rumors as of late. It all comes at an interesting time as Affleck's mother-of-three ex is currently in a relationship with businessman John Miller, with a source telling DailyMail.com last week that Garner's attempts to 'fix' Affleck and Lopez's marriage 'bothers' Miller. 'He cares deeply for Ben and sympathizes with what he is going through with Jennifer, but that doesn't mean Jen should be the one to fix her ex-husband's issues with his current wife. That makes no sense to anyone,' the source said. 'Jen is such a caring and wonderful woman and mother and there is nothing but a deep friendship and bond between her and Ben.' The insider added, 'John wants nothing more than for Ben to be OK, but it isn't his girlfriend's responsibility to play babysitter to him. That is for Ben to figure out on his own and for his wife to handle. It isn't Jen's responsibility, and he has told her this.' However, another source stated that Miller is opting to 'stay out of' of the marital drama and added, 'Jen can't get away from it because it is everywhere...' On Friday, both Lopez and Affleck were seen arriving separately to their office in Beverly Hills. The massive recreational vehicle appears ready for a family vacation, as it is spacious enough to accommodate Ben's three children with ex Jennifer Garner \u2014 Violet, 18; Finn, 15; and Samuel, 12 \u2014 along with JLo's twins, Max and Emme, 16 Meanwhile, Ben's ex Jennifer is currently in a relationship with businessman John Miller, with a source telling DailyMail.com that her attempts to 'fix' Affleck and Lopez's marriage 'bothers' Miller; seen in April in Beverly Hills Also on Friday, a music industry source exclusively told DailyMail.com that Jennifer is 'over' trying to save her marriage to Ben; seen in November 2023 in LA The outing came amid speculation that the pair \u2014 who tied the knot in July 2022 \u2014 are headed for an 'imminent' divorce amid claims that they are living separately and 'looking for their own homes.' Also on Friday, a music industry source exclusively told DailyMail.com that Jennifer is 'over' trying to save her marriage to Ben. 'Jenny has had enough and she really tried but she can do no more, it's not getting any better, it's worse,' the insider stated. The insider added that the main reason Lopez left Affleck was because he was always 'grumpy and negative' like Oscar The Grouch from Sesame Street. Jennifer is sad about the end of her nuptials but 'is trying to make the best of it by working out, spending time with her twins Max and Emme and making new plans for 2025,' they went on. One of those new plans is resuming her This Is Me... Live tour for the summer of 2025 when she turns 56. She canceled the 2024 tour that was scheduled to kick off in July in order to 'recollect herself.' 'She is excited about going on tour next year when her personal life is on calmer ground and she can connect with her fans. She will take her tribe with her and make the most of it,' said the source. Lopez is also said to be 'shocked' by the bad press she has been getting, which she believes is not fair. 'If people could see what she has really gone through they would be easier on her,' said the source. 'Ben is a great guy but he can be grumpy and a downer. I think the world saw that in photos like when they were at the Grammys last year; he wouldn't smile. If they saw how it really was, they would not attack her,' said the friend of Jennifer. 'He chain smokes and cusses and seems irritated a lot of the time. Great director and actor, but not a lot of laughs with him, you know?' said the source. 'He is a wonderful father though.' Lopez plans on pushing on. 'She is really not used to this kind of bad feedback, but she will get over it. She will march on. 'Ben is a great guy but he can be grumpy and a downer.

'Jennifer is a very smart and strong woman and she will bounce back, she always does!' they added. These days she has been leaning on her close friends, such as stylist Shawn Barton, whose nickname is Beezy. Another source of comfort is her vocal coach Stevie Mackey. In regard to reports that the two could announce their divorce, the source said, 'I think they have wanted to wait until all the kids are out of school and done with school plans and all that before they make their big announcement. They are putting the kids first.' And as far as how Jennifer and Ben are getting along these days, the insider said they are being 'cordial' with each other. Affleck has reportedly been living at a $100k-a-month rental home in Brentwood amidst filming The Accountant 2, while the actress is currently residing at their $60M mansion. However, it was revealed that the pair hired a realtor, Santiago Arana, to sell the lavish abode - which had been purchased last year. A source told TMZ that the two have been 'showing the house for around 2 weeks,' but have yet to secure a buyer. Earlier this week, it was claimed that Jennifer could possibly 'rebound from Ben Affleck with ex-fianc\u00e9 Alex Rodriguez' following a split. Another insider told Entertainment Tonight that Jennifer and Ben have been spending time apart but aren't 'officially separated.' 'Jen and Ben have been living separate lives but have not officially separated yet. At this point, they are just doing their own thing. They went into their relationship very optimistic and thought things could change, but they haven't.' Friends of Affleck have also expressed concern that the Good Will Hunting actor has 'relapsed and is drinking again' amid the rumored marital woes; seen in March 2023 in Austin, Texas 'Jen is touring houses and shopping around for her own home. She has been leaning on her mom, sisters, and kids during this transitional period,' the insider added. 'Ben is sad about it all but focused on his work, being a great dad, and co-parenting well with Jennifer Garner,' they said. 'He has been leaning on Matt Damon and his close circle of guy friends. Matt is always in Ben's corner and is supportive of him.' Friends of Affleck have also expressed concern that the Good Will Hunting actor has 'relapsed and is drinking again' amid the rumored marital woes. One told DailyMail.com, 'I hear that he is drinking. He is full of demons \u2014 a really troubled person,' while another friend stated, 'I have seen him looking glassy eyed and it is a real worry to everyone who cares about him.'

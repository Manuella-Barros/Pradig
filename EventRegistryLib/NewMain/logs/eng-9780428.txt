One man wore a shirt with the slogan: \"Nigel Farage for Prime Minister, Tommy Robinson for Home Secretary\".\n\nConfrontations continued late into the night in Hartlepool, where demonstrators set fire to a police car and pelted officers with missiles, including glass bottles.\n\nCleveland Police have so far made eight arrests, with more expected.\n\nManchester police confronted another demonstration outside the Holiday Inn on Oldham Road before dispersing the crowd after protesters started throwing beer bottles at officers and members of the public.\n\nAccording to the Manchester Evening News, this incident also saw chants of: \"We want our country back\", while a group of men were seen jumping in the path of a bus, smashing its wing mirror and assaulting a passenger.\n\nAldershot appears to have escaped the violence seen in other parts of the country, but a demonstration there was still met by riot police.\n\nThe string of violent incidents follows similar scenes in Southport on Tuesday, where demonstrators attacked police and set cars on fire.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Sir Keir Starmer will meet with senior police leaders in Downing Street to express his full support for their efforts to deal with the violence.\n\nHe is expected to praise their \"bravery\" in dealing with both the incident in Southport and its aftermath, and encourage them to use their powers to \"stop mindless violence in its tracks\".\n\nLord Walney, the Government's independent adviser on political violence, said he hoped the meeting would examine powers to \"refuse and prevent further so-called 'protests' that are being used by far right activists as a vehicle for serious disorder and violence\".\n\nHe said: \"There is a right to protest in the UK but that is not a right to riot.\"\n\nThe meeting comes as a 17-year-old boy has been charged with the murders of the three girls.\n\nAlice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Bebe King, six, were fatally stabbed on Monday when a knifeman entered a Taylor Swift-themed dance class on Hart Street in Southport, Merseyside.\n\nEight other children suffered knife wounds - with five of them in a critical condition - while two adults were also critically injured.\n\nThe 17-year-old has been remanded in custody to appear on Thursday at Liverpool Magistrates' Court.", "source": {"uri":

Five are in a critical condition, as are two women who bravely tried to save the children.\n\nA 17-year-old boy, originally from Cardiff but living in nearby Banks, remains in custody on suspicion of murder and attempted murder.\n\nFalse speculation online that the suspect is an asylum seeker who had travelled to the UK on a boat appeared to fuel the shocking riots outside a mosque in Southport last night.\n\nSouthport locals - including Elsie's mother - have called for the violence to stop after police vans were torched and bricks were hurled in violence that left 53 officers injured.\n\nBut right-wing activists, many carrying cans of Stella Artois, are tonight staging another demonstration in London, with some waving a Union Jack flag banner with the words: 'Enough is enough. Stop the boats.'\n\nLoud chants of 'Oh Tommy Robinson' and 'we want our country back' were also heard as protesters surrounded The Cenotaph, despite police vans trying to protect the war memorial on Whitehall.\n\nHuge scuffles between police and protesters have broken out, with officers detaining a balaclava-clad man and wrestling another off the road onto the pavement.\n\nBeer cans and glass bottles were launched at a line of police in riot gear who have assembled to block Whitehall in front of Downing Street. Other protesters have attempted to kick down a fence and were confronted by riot police.\n\nSome activists were wearing red caps which said 'Make Britain Great Again' - a reference to Donald Trump's 'Make America Great Again' movement.\n\nOthers wore t-shirts calling for English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson to be Home Secretary and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage to be Prime Minister.\n\nMany protesters were draped in England flags as the Enough Is Enough protest got underway shortly after 7pm.\n\nShortly after, the protesters - many of whom were drinking alcohol - began marching towards Parliament Square.\n\nA few hundred protesters chanting 'Rule Britannia', 'save our kids' and 'stop the boats' attempted to leave the pavement opposite Downing Street in defiance of strict Metropolitan Police conditions on the protest.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police has said demonstrators taking part have to stay within a certain area and must leave at 8.30pm.\n\nProtesters forced police to put riot gear on as they threw cans at police outside Downing Street.\n\nThey also threw flares on to the statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square and shouted abuse at nearby pro-Ukrainian demonstrators and police.\n\nMore than a dozen protesters have been detained by police on Whitehall. Officers led many of the men away in handcuffs.\n\nA police helicopter was also seen flying over Downing Street amid the unrest.\n\nThe event was promoted by actor Laurence Fox on X, formerly Twitter, on Tuesday.\n\nSuperintendent Neil Holyoak, who is leading the policing of the protest, said: 'Following the tragic events in Southport, it is understandable the public have strong feelings about this shocking incident - but the subsequent violent, unlawful disorder that unfolded was completely unacceptable and driven by misinformation.\n\n'Everyone has a right to protest and we continue to balance the right to lawful protest with everyone's right to go about their lives without fear or serious disruption - which is why we have put conditions in place and deployed more officers across London.\n\n'We are speaking to the protest organisers as well as local community groups, businesses and religious leaders, in particular the Muslim community who have been impacted by this week's disorder in Southport.\n\n'I urge everyone to exercise their right to protest calmly and within the law.

In London, more than 100 people were arrested after protesters in Whitehall launched beer cans and glass bottles at police and threw flares at the statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square.\n\nDemonstrators wearing England flags and waving banners saying \"enough is enough\" and \"stop the boats\" had congregated outside Downing Street in the wake of the killing of three young girls in a knife attack in Southport, which social media posts had wrongly claimed was carried out by a Muslim asylum seeker who crossed the Channel in a small boat.\n\nThe angry scenes also included loud chants of: \"We want our country back\" and: \"Oh Tommy Robinson\", referring to the right-wing activist. One man wore a shirt with the slogan: \"Nigel Farage for Prime Minister, Tommy Robinson for Home Secretary\".\n\nConfrontations continued late into the night in Hartlepool, where demonstrators set fire to a police car and pelted officers with missiles, including glass bottles. Cleveland Police have so far made eight arrests, with more expected. Police in Greater Manchester confronted another demonstration outside the Holiday Inn on Oldham Road before dispersing the crowd after protesters started throwing beer bottles at officers and members of the public.\n\nAccording to the Manchester Evening News, this incident also saw chants of \"We want our country back\", while a group of men were seen jumping in the path of a bus, smashing its wing mirror and assaulting a passenger. Aldershot appears to have escaped the violence seen in other parts of the country, but a demonstration there was still met by riot police. The string of violent incidents follows similar scenes in Southport on Tuesday, where demonstrators attacked police and set cars on fire.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Sir Keir Starmer will meet with senior police leaders in Downing Street to express his full support for their efforts to deal with the violence. He is expected to praise their \"bravery\" in dealing with both the incident in Southport and its aftermath, and encourage them to use their powers to \"stop mindless violence in its tracks\".\n\nLord Walney, the Government's independent adviser on political violence, said he hoped the meeting would examine powers to \"refuse and prevent further so-called 'protests' that are being used by far right activists as a vehicle for serious disorder and violence.\" He said: \"There is a right to protest in the UK but that is not a right to riot.\"\n\nThe meeting comes as a 17-year-old boy has been charged with the murders of the three girls. Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Bebe King, six, were fatally stabbed on Monday when a knifeman entered a Taylor Swift-themed dance class on Hart Street in Southport, Merseyside. Eight other children suffered knife wounds - with five of them in a critical condition - while two adults were also critically injured. The 17-year-old has been remanded in custody to appear on Thursday at Liverpool Magistrates' Court.", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"},

This incident was exacerbated by people from outside our community who came here determined to cause unrest. I would like to pay tribute to the brave police officers who worked hard to restore order.\n\n\"There is no justification for disorderly behaviour and the scenes do not represent Aldershot and Farnborough. We all support our shared right to peacefully protest, but we will not stand for people coming into our towns determined to stir up trouble and divide our community.\"\n\nIn London, a large protest was staged under the title of Enough is Enough, with arrests made after demonstrators clashed with officers in Whitehall on Wednesday.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said: \"Over 100 people have been arrested for offences including violent disorder, assault on an emergency worker, and breach of protest conditions. Some officers suffered minor injuries.\"\n\nDemonstrators were seen launching beer cans and glass bottles at a line of police in riot gear in front of Downing Street and throwing flares onto the statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square.\n\nThe angry scenes also included loud chants of \"we want our country back\" and \"Oh Tommy Robinson\", referring to the right-wing activist.\n\nCleveland Police also said it had made eight arrests for various offences including public order and affray after violence broke out in Hartlepool on Wednesday, with more arrests expected.\n\nRoad closures have been lifted, but a visible police presence remains in the area, the force said.\n\nChief Superintendent David Sutherland said: \"At this stage we believe the protest is in connection with the incident in Southport earlier this week.\n\n\"Our officers are facing missiles, glass bottles and eggs being thrown at them and have made arrests as they remain in the area to protect the safety of those living in the community.\"\n\nIn Manchester, local councillor John Flanagan took to social media to respond to the violence, labelling those involved in the \"sickening\" incident as \"mindless idiots\".\n\n\"I'd like to condemn these mindless thugs, attacking innocent men who are asylum seekers. They have been there for months and we have not had any issues or problems. They have been in a place of safety,\" the councillor for Newton Heath said.\n\n\"It's sickening to think they are being targeted because of their race or their religion, and I hope this isn't tied with the disgraceful scenes in Southport where a mosque was attacked last night.\n\n\"These idiots are attacking innocent people. My initial reaction is to contact GMP and support them. The whole of the city and reasonable thinking people will be horrified and sickened by these actions. Idiots is too soft of a word - I hope the police use the full force of the law.\n\n\"We cannot allow our country and our city to descend into anarchy, which seems to be being driven by madness on social media.\"\n\nIt comes after violence erupted in Southport on Tuesday following a vigil for three girls killed in a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nPolice officers in Southport suffered serious injuries when bricks, stones and bottles were thrown and cars were set alight during violent protests.\n\nThe disorder near the town's mosque came after false rumours were circulated online about the suspect.\n\nIn an effort to avoid a second night of rioting, Merseyside Police were given extra powers, under S60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, on Wednesday to stop and search people suspected of carrying weapons.\n\nCommunity Inspector Doug Chadwick said the public was \"shocked and disappointed\" by the \"disgraceful\" scenes of rioting and called on the public to come forward with information about what they had seen.\n\nFive people have been arrested over the unrest so far, which saw 53 officers and three police dogs injured.\n\nThe unrest comes as a 17-year-old boy has been charged with the murders of the three girls.\n\nAlice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, were fatally stabbed on Monday when a knifeman entered the dance class on Hart Street in Southport, Merseyside.\n\nEight other children suffered knife wounds - with five of them in critical condition - while two adults were also

This incident was exacerbated by people from outside our community who came here determined to cause unrest. I would like to pay tribute to the brave police officers who worked hard to restore order.\n\n\"There is no justification for disorderly behaviour and the scenes do not represent Aldershot and Farnborough. We all support our shared right to peacefully protest, but we will not stand for people coming into our towns determined to stir up trouble and divide our community.\"\n\nIn London, a large protest was staged under the title of Enough is Enough, with arrests made after demonstrators clashed with officers in Whitehall on Wednesday.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said: \"Over 100 people have been arrested for offences including violent disorder, assault on an emergency worker, and breach of protest conditions. Some officers suffered minor injuries.\"\n\nDemonstrators were seen launching beer cans and glass bottles at a line of police in riot gear in front of Downing Street and throwing flares onto the statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square.\n\nCleveland Police also said it had made eight arrests for various offences including public order and affray after violence broke out in Hartlepool on Wednesday, with more arrests expected.\n\nRoad closures have been lifted, but a visible police presence remains in the area, the force said.\n\nChief Superintendent David Sutherland said: \"At this stage we believe the protest is in connection with the incident in Southport earlier this week.\n\n\"Our officers are facing missiles, glass bottles and eggs being thrown at them and have made arrests as they remain in the area to protect the safety of those living in the community.\"\n\nIn Manchester, local councillor John Flanagan took to social media to respond to the violence, labelling those involved in the \"sickening\" incident as \"mindless idiots\".\n\n\"I'd like to condemn these mindless thugs, attacking innocent men who are asylum seekers. They have been there for months and we have not had any issues or problems. They have been in a place of safety,\" the councillor for Newton Heath said.\n\n\"It's sickening to think they are being targeted because of their race or their religion, and I hope this isn't tied with the disgraceful scenes in Southport where a mosque was attacked last night.\n\n\"We cannot allow our country and our city to descend into anarchy, which seems to be being driven by madness on social media.\"\n\nIt comes after violence erupted in Southport on Tuesday following a vigil for three girls killed in a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nPolice officers in Southport suffered serious injuries when bricks, stones and bottles were thrown and cars were set alight during violent protests.\n\nIn an effort to avoid a second night of rioting, Merseyside Police were given extra powers, under S60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, on Wednesday to stop and search people suspected of carrying weapons.\n\nCommunity Inspector Doug Chadwick said the public was \"shocked and disappointed\" by the \"disgraceful\" scenes of rioting and called on the public to come forward with information about what they had seen.\n\nFive people have been arrested over the unrest so far, which saw 53 officers and three police dogs injured.\n\nThe unrest comes as a 17-year-old boy has been charged with the murders of the three girls.\n\nAlice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, were fatally stabbed on Monday when a knifeman entered the dance class on Hart Street in Southport, Merseyside.\n\nEight other children

Officers were attacked with missiles, glass bottles and eggs, Cleveland police said.\n\nIn Manchester, demonstrators turned out in large numbers outside the Holiday Inn hotel on Oldham Road at around 6pm on Wednesday, the Manchester Evening News reported.\n\nAbout 40 people, which the paper reported included children and men wearing balaclavas, gathered outside the Oldham Road premises in what the paper said \"appeared to be a stand against asylum seekers currently being housed in the hotel\".\n\nIn London, a large protest was staged under the title of Enough is Enough, with arrests made after demonstrators clashed with officers in Whitehall on Wednesday.\n\nThe Metropolitan police said: \"Over 100 people have been arrested for offences including violent disorder, assault on an emergency worker, and breach of protest conditions. Some officers suffered minor injuries.\"\n\nDemonstrators were seen launching beer cans and glass bottles at a line of police in riot gear in front of Downing Street and throwing flares on to the statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square.\n\nThe angry scenes also included loud chants of \"we want our country back\" and \"Oh Tommy Robinson\", referring to a rightwing activist.\n\nCleveland police also said it had made eight arrests for various offences including public order and affray after violence broke out in Hartlepool on Wednesday, with more arrests expected.\n\nCh Supt David Sutherland said: \"At this stage we believe the protest is in connection with the incident in Southport earlier this week.\n\n\"Our officers are facing missiles, glass bottles and eggs being thrown at them and have made arrests as they remain in the area to protect the safety of those living in the community.\"\n\nIn Manchester, local councillor John Flanagan took to social media to respond to the violence, labelling those involved in the \"sickening\" incident as \"mindless idiots\".\n\n\"I'd like to condemn these mindless thugs, attacking innocent men who are asylum seekers. They have been there for months and we have not had any issues or problems. They have been in a place of safety,\" the councillor for Newton Heath said.\n\n\"We cannot allow our country and our city to descend into anarchy, which seems to be being driven by madness on social media.\"\n\nIn Aldershot, local MP Alex Baker took to social media to rebuke violence in her community, stating there was \"no justification for disorderly behaviour and the scenes do not represent Aldershot and Farnborough\".\n\n\"I have visited the scene myself this evening and have been in touch with the chief inspector ... We all support our shared right to peacefully protest, but we will not stand for people coming into our towns determined to stir up trouble and divide our community.\"\n\nViolence erupted in Southport on Tuesday after a vigil for three girls killed in a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nPolice officers in Southport suffered serious injuries when bricks, stones and bottles were thrown and cars were set alight during violent protests. The disorder near the town's mosque came after false rumours were circulated online about the suspect.\n\nFive people have been arrested over the unrest so far, which saw 53 officers and three police dogs injured.\n\nA 17-year-old boy has been charged with the murders of the three girls. Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, were fatally stabbed on Monday when a knifeman entered the dance class on Hart Street in Southport, Merseyside.\n\nEight other children suffered knife wounds - with five of them in critical condition - while two adults were also critically hurt.\n\nThe accused has been remanded in custody to appear on Thursday at

meeting comes as a 17-year-old boy has been charged with the murders of the three girls.\n\nAlice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Bebe King, six, were fatally stabbed on Monday when a knifeman entered a Taylor Swift-themed dance class on Hart Street in Southport, Merseyside.\n\nEight other children suffered knife wounds - with five of them in a critical condition - while two adults were also critically injured.\n\nThe 17-year-old has been remanded in custody to appear on Thursday at Liverpool Magistrates' Court.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

Officers led many of the men away in handcuffs.\n\nA police helicopter was also seen flying over Downing Street amid the unrest.\n\nAround an hour into the protest, activists started trying to break a police line on Whitehall ato access Parliament Square. More bottles and cans were being thrown at police in riot gear who were desperately trying to hold off the protesters.\n\nActivists then attempted to kick down a fence to circumvent a police line on Whitehall. Others ran past police towards Trafalgar Square and police formed a new line outside the Cabinet Office.\n\nThe protest was promoted by actor Laurence Fox on X, formerly Twitter, on Tuesday.\n\nSuperintendent Neil Holyoak, who is leading the policing of the protest, said: 'Following the tragic events in Southport, it is understandable the public have strong feelings about this shocking incident - but the subsequent violent, unlawful disorder that unfolded was completely unacceptable and driven by misinformation.\n\n'Everyone has a right to protest and we continue to balance the right to lawful protest with everyone's right to go about their lives without fear or serious disruption - which is why we have put conditions in place and deployed more officers across London.\n\n'We are speaking to the protest organisers as well as local community groups, businesses and religious leaders, in particular the Muslim community who have been impacted by this week's disorder in Southport.\n\n'I urge everyone to exercise their right to protest calmly and within the law.

Four people were arrested after the riots.\n\nA fifth man was also arrested on Wednesday night. It comes after officers were called to a separate domestic incident.\n\nOfficers recognised the man from footage of the disorder in Southport on Tuesday, where it is thought he sustained a head injury.\n\nHe was taken to hospital where he was reported to have racially abused a fellow patient.\n\nThe 39-year-old man from Southport was arrested on suspicion of violent disorder, threats to kill and a racially aggravated public order offence.\n\nHe was taken into custody to be interviewed and conditionally bailed, the force said.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said: 'Our work to identify all those responsible for the despicable violence and aggression seen on the streets of Southport on Tuesday continues.\n\n'We have been inundated with images and footage from members of the public who were outraged at the destruction carried out.\n\n'The individuals involved in the disorder had no regard for the families and friends of those who so tragically lost their lives, and a community in grief.\n\n'It has been heartening today to see the reaction of the whole community, who have pulled together to clean the streets, rebuild walls and re-glaze broken windows.'\n\nThe mayor of the Liverpool City Region, Steve Rotheram, told Sky News earlier that he does not believe there will be more violence tonight.\n\nBut as well as London, there were scenes of chaos in Hartlepool where thugs were seen throwing objects at riot police and striking their shields.\n\nMissiles were hurled at the police who are braced for attacks with shields after hundreds gathered in the town centre.\n\nOfficers shut off a large section of Murray Street, a busy road full of takeaways and shops.\n\nIt is understood the Salaam Community Centre is under threat and police are working to keep the area safe.\n\nRioters were also filmed shouting racist chants. Many had their faces covered and aggressively clapped their hands and waved their arms in the air during the violence.\n\nA spokesperson for Hartlepool Police said: 'There remains a policing presence in the Murray Street area while officers deal with disorder after responding to a protest - several arrests have already been made.\n\n'The road is still closed and people are advised to avoid the area.'\n\nMP for Hartlepool Jonathan Brash issued a statement which read: 'I'm deeply concerned about the situation that is developing in Hartlepool this evening.\n\n'I will be meeting with police to discuss the response to this incident and would urge calm to allow our emergency services to do their job.\n\n'These events do not represent what Hartlepool is or the values that our people hold. Violence is never the answer.'\n\nOther footage emerged of a group of thugs, some masked, launching glass bottles at riot police and vans. It is understood they were targeting a hotel where migrants are believed to be housed.", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"}, "authors": [],

More info\n\nProtestors are clashing with police in London with crowds heard chanting \"save our kids\" following violent riots in Southport last night.\n\nFlares have been thrown towards the gates of Downing Street during the demonstration as well as at the statue of Winston Churchill.\n\nA few hundred protesters chanting \"Rule Britannia\", \"save our kids\" and \"stop the boats\" attempted to leave the pavement opposite Downing Street in defiance of strict Metropolitan Police conditions on the protest.\n\nShortly after 7pm, the protesters - many of whom were drinking alcohol - began marching towards Parliament Square, some with St George's flags.\n\nThe demonstrators also shouted abuse at nearby pro-Ukrainian demonstrators and police. Loud chants of \"Oh Tommy Robinson\" and \"we want our country back\" were also heard.\n\nPolice detained a man wearing a balaclava near Downing Street. Officers wrestled the man off the road and onto the pavement.\n\nBeer cans and glass bottles are being launched at a line of police in riot gear who have assembled to block Whitehall in front of Downing Street.\n\nMore than a dozen protesters have been detained by police on Whitehall so far.\n\nIt comes after rampant misinformation surrounding the Southport stabbing led an angry mob of suspected EDL members to unleash a night of violence on a residential street close to where a knife attack took place.\n\nMore than 50 police officers attending the scene suffered injuries as protesters gathered outside a local mosque in what Chairman of Merseyside Police Federation Chris McGlade said was a \"sustained and vicious attack\". Rioters threw stones, bottles and bricks at police while members of the crowd were heard shouting \"no more boats\" before a police van was set on fire.\n\nDetectives have meanwhile been granted more time to question the 17-year-old arrested on suspicion of the Southport knife attacks.\n\nMerseyside Police arrested the teenager, who lives in Lancashire but was born in Cardiff, in connection with the attack at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party on Monday during which three girls - Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven - were fatally stabbed.\n\nHe has not been named because of his age, and remains in custody having been arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder. Eight other youngsters suffered knife wounds and five are in a critical condition, alongside two adults who were also critically injured.\n\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign up to our daily newsletter here.", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "press_association@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Press Association", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "gemma_ryder@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Gemma Ryder", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Downing Street"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Winston_Churchill,_Parliament_Square", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Statue of Winston Churchill, Parliament Square"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule,_Britannia!", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rule, Britannia!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehall", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whitehall"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Robinson_(activist)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Robinson (activist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_Square", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament Square"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English Defence League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balaclava_(clothing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balaclava (clothing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riot control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lancashire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lancashire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article33370783.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS340948444.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9780428", "eventUri": "eng-9780428", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

One man wore a shirt with the slogan: 'Nigel Farage for Prime Minister, Tommy Robinson for Home Secretary'.\n\nConfrontations continued late into the night in Hartlepool, where demonstrators set fire to a police car and pelted officers with missiles, including glass bottles.\n\nCleveland Police have so far made eight arrests, with more expected.\n\nManchester police confronted another demonstration outside the Holiday Inn on Oldham Road before dispersing the crowd after protesters started throwing beer bottles at officers and members of the public.\n\nAccording to the Manchester

passenger.\n\nAldershot appears to have escaped the violence seen in other parts of the country, but a demonstration there was still met by riot police.\n\nThe string of violent incidents follows similar scenes in Southport on Tuesday, where demonstrators attacked police and set cars on fire.\n\nIn the meeting this afternoon Sir Keir is expected to praise the 'bravery' of police in dealing with both the incident in Southport and its aftermath, and encourage them to use their powers to 'stop mindless violence in its tracks'.\n\nLord Walney, the Government's independent adviser on political violence, said he hoped the meeting would examine powers to 'refuse and prevent further so-called 'protests' that are being used by far right activists as a vehicle for serious disorder and violence'.\n\nHe said: 'There is a right to protest in the UK but that is not a right to riot.'\n\nThe meeting comes as a 17-year-old boy - who cannot be named for legal reasons - has been charged with the murders of the three girls.\n\nAlice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Bebe King, six, were fatally stabbed on Monday when a knifeman entered a Taylor Swift-themed dance

Demonstrators wearing England flags and waving banners saying \"enough is enough\" and \"stop the boats\" gathered outside Downing Street in the wake of the killing of three young girls in a knife attack in Southport.\n\nRumours swirling online wrongly claimed the attack was carried out by a Muslim asylum seeker who crossed the Channel in a small boat. In an angry scenes, demonstrators chanted, \"We want our country back\", and \"Oh Tommy Robinson\", referring to the far-right activist. One man wore a shirt with the slogan: \"Nigel Farage for Prime Minister, Tommy Robinson for Home Secretary\".\n\nConfrontations continued late into the night in Hartlepool, where demonstrators set fire to a police car and pelted officers with missiles, including glass bottles. Cleveland Police have so far made eight arrests, with more expected.\n\nManchester police confronted another demonstration outside the Holiday Inn on Oldham Road before dispersing the crowd after protesters started throwing beer bottles at officers and members of the public. According to the Manchester Evening News, this incident also saw chants of: \"We want our country back\", while a group of men were seen jumping in the path of a bus, smashing its wing mirror and assaulting a passenger.\n\nAldershot appears to have escaped the violence seen in other parts of the country, but a demonstration there was still met by riot police. The string of violent incidents follows similar scenes in Southport on Tuesday, where demonstrators attacked police and set cars on fire.\n\nToday, the PM will meet with senior police leaders in Downing Street to express his full support for their efforts to deal with the violence. He is expected to praise their \"bravery\" in dealing with both the incident in Southport and its aftermath, and encourage them to use their powers to \"stop mindless violence in its tracks\".\n\nThe meeting comes as a 17-year-old boy has been charged with the murders of the three girls.\n\nAlice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Bebe King, six, were fatally stabbed on Monday when a knifeman entered a Taylor Swift-themed dance class on Hart Street in Southport, Merseyside. Eight other children suffered knife wounds - with five of them in a critical condition - while two adults were also critically injured.\n\nThe 17-year-old has been remanded in custody to appear on Thursday at Liverpool Magistrates' Court.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christopher_mckeon@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Christopher

However, it descended into violence as far-Right protesters clashed with riot police.\n\nCrowds launched flares and bottles towards police shouting chants, including \"England til I die\" and \"we want our country back\". When the protest deadline passed, officers swept in to make dozens of arrests.\n\nMeanwhile in Hartlepool, footage shows lines of riot police forming in the street to face down protesters.\n\nSocial media reports claimed protesters hurled missiles at the police on Murray Street, in the centre of town, as they attempted to make their way towards a Mosque in the area.\n\nThe Northern Echo reported that men in balaclavas were seen hitting police with wooden bats as waves of protesters clashed with officers.\n\nJonathan Brash, Hartlepool MP, said he was \"deeply concerned\" and called for calm as tensions between gathering crowds and officers in riot gear threatened to boil over.\n\nHe posted on X, formerly Twitter: \"I'm deeply concerned about the situation that is developing in Hartlepool this evening.\n\n\"I will be meeting with police to discuss the response to this incident and would urge calm to allow our emergency services to do their job.\n\n\"These events do not represent what Hartlepool is or the values that our people hold. Violence is never the answer.\"\n\nIt comes after a riot erupted on Tuesday evening in which police vans were torched and more than 50 officers injured when a mob gathered outside a mosque in Southport.\n\nProtesters hurled bricks, masonry and fireworks at officers, amid claims that police were not telling the truth about the suspect's background and his motives, with rumours swirling on social media.\n\nThe force have said the suspect, who was born in Cardiff, is from the village of Banks, just outside Southport, following incorrect claims that he was an asylum seeker.\n\nPolice said a name shared on social media in connection with the suspect is \"incorrect\", adding: \"We would urge people not to speculate on details of the incident while the investigation is ongoing.\"\n\nA Hartlepool Police spokesman posted on X, formerly Twitter: \"Officers remain in the Murray Street area while dealing with disorder after responding to a protest - several arrests have already been made.

Those who have left have either done so voluntarily or been arrested.\n\nOfficers are periodically rushing in to detain those who remain one at a time.\n\nA section 35 dispersal order of the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act is also now in place, meaning protesters must now leave the area.\n\n08:58 PM BST\n\nRiot police encircle protesters to make arrests\n\nAnother significant number of arrests are now being made.\n\nAt least 10 protesters are being walked away from the scene.\n\nThe deadline for the protest ending has now passed, meaning those still present are in breach of public order restrictions.\n\nMore riot police are pouring into Whitehall, with protesters scuttling to break out as arrests are made.\n\nThe wall of officers surrounding the protesters is gradually tightening as groups of two or three riot police rush in to seize individuals and take them away.\n\nThe 8.30pm deadline for the protest ending set by police has now been reached.\n\nRiot officers are now moving in and appear poised to divide and trap the protesters, enabling potential arrests.\n\nA large number of protesters have now fled from the scene towards Trafalgar Square after police attempted to trap them behind metal fences.\n\nThe police appear to be attempting to separate the crowd into separate groups.\n\nPolice appeared to erroneously attempt to arrest Martin Daubney, the GB News presenter.\n\nFootage of the incident shows the broadcaster surrounded by police.\n\nMr Daubney was released from his cuffs when he presented ID proving he was a member of the press.\n\nPictured: Protesters wear t-shirts with faces of Southport victims\n\n08:10 PM BST\n\nProtest leaders evade police cordon by hopping a wall\n\nThe protest had quietened down in the last 15 minutes.\n\nA number of influencers present have been filming videos to camera.\n\nBut there has suddenly been a bit of pushing back and forth against barriers.\n\nProtest leaders then escaped the police cordon by jumping over a wall, prompting the detention of three demonstrator.\n\n\"Stay back now,\" officers shouted as they wielded batons.\n\nThe Met Police has made multiple arrests close to the Cenotaph on Whitehall.\n\nVideo livestreamed from the scene shows multiple people being frog marched away from the scene of the protest by officers dressed in riot gear.\n\nIn several instances, protesters appear to have been taken to the floor before handcuffed and led away.\n\nChants of \"Oh Tommy Tommy, Tommy Tommy Tommy Tommy Robinson,\" can be heard echoing down Whitehall.\n\nProtest leaders have left the metal barriers, with police making no attempt to stop them walking over directly in front of the Downing Street security gates.\n\nOther demonstrators are also starting to move around more freely.\n\nPolice were then deployed to push the leaders back away from the Downing Street gates.\n\nProtesters attempt to break out from behind barrier\n\nThe protest -- numbering several hundred people -- has moved again, this time back towards the cordoned off area directly opposite Downing Street where the Met originally planned to restrict them.\n\nProtest leaders pointed to a cardboard placard reading \"we will not be silenced\" in red paint which also featured handprints.\n\nGlass bottles were then thrown, to cheers from the crowd, as protesters tried to break out from behind metal barriers. Riot police were deployed to stop them doing so.\n\n07:28 PM BST\n\nWatch: Protesters push riot police in violent confrontation\n\nSerious violence has just erupted at the protest as demonstrators attempted to push against a line of riot police.\n\nCans of drink were thrown as scuffles broke out between the demonstrators and riot police.\n\n07:24 PM BST\n\nWatch: Crowds light flares outside Downing Street\n\n07:20 PM BST\n\nOfficers attempt to cut off protesters as they march down Whitehall\n\nThe protesters are now marching away from outside Downing Street to the Houses of Parliament.\n\nThey have walked down Whitehall and across the road to the front of Parliament.\n\nChants of \"England til I die\" have resumed, as well as \"we want our country back\".\n\nThis is well outside the restricted area set out by the Met.\n\nOfficers are attempting to encircle the protesters and keep them away from the front of Parliament.\n\nA pro-Ukrainian protest stands silently on Parliament Square as the demonstrators congregate.\n\nTwo pyros have now been thrown towards Downing Street, including one which cleared the security gates.\n\nThe man responsible for throwing the pyro was then restrained on the ground by eight officers and taken away.\n\nThe crowd proceeded to chant \"Oh, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy Tommy Tommy Robinson\".\n\n06:53 PM BST\n\nSouthport 'thugs and hooligans must be held to account', says policing minister\n\nPolicing minister Dame Diana Johnson has said the \"thugs and hooligans\" involved in violence in Southport \"must be held to account for their actions\".\n\nDame Diana wrote on X, formerly Twitter: \"This is shocking to hear from a chief constable that so many of her officers were injured in the line of duty last night.\n\n\"The thugs and hooligans involved must be held to account for their actions on the streets of Southport yesterday.\"\n\nThe Home Office minister had shared a video clip featuring Merseyside Police Chief Constable Serena Kennedy, who told broadcasters that officers who dealt with riots on Tuesday were \"some of the first responders who attended that awful scene on Monday and then were faced with that level of violence\".\n\n06:30 PM BST\n\nMet vows to deal with disorder 'swiftly' at hard-Right Downing Street protest\n\nThe Metropolitan Police has vowed that \"any disorder will be dealt with swiftly\" at a hard-Right protest taking place outside Downing Street in the wake of the murders and subsequent riots in Southport.\n\nConditions imposed under section 14 of the Public Order Act mean demonstrators taking part in the Enough Is Enough rally in central London at 7pm have to stay within the immediate vicinity of the entrance gate and must leave by 8.30pm.\n\nAny protesters who breach the conditions could be arrested.\n\nThe event has been promoted by Tommy Robinson and actor Laurence Fox on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nSupt Neil Holyoak, who is leading the policing of the protest, said: \"I urge everyone to exercise their right to protest calmly and within the law. Any disorder will be dealt with swiftly.\"\n\n05:29 PM BST\n\n'A disgraceful hijacking of our tragedy': How Southport is defying the rioters\n\nAfter a day of horror and a night of chaos, the bright, clear sunshine of a new morning showed the humanity of a seaside town.\n\nIn Southport on Tuesday, just hours after more than 1,000 people had attended an evening vigil to remember the young victims of a deadly knife rampage at a children's dance class on Monday, violence swept into this normally safe, cheerful seaside town. Bus-loads of thugs assaulted police officers, intimidated locals, and damaged homes, businesses and a mosque.\n\nIt was, as local artist Tony Wynne puts it, \"a disgraceful hijacking of our tragedy, and a failed attempt to divide us\". The largely masked rioters, who scarpered in the small hours, their convoys of vehicles witnessed leaving Southport by sickened residents, had left a trail of ruin down the Sussex Road area. Scorch marks on the pavement where flaming wheelie bins landed; garden walls kicked down to free bricks that could be hurled at the police; cars scratched and dented; a mosque's windows smashed.\n\nEnglish Defence League could be proscribed as terror organisation, Angela Rayner suggests\n\nThe English Defence League (EDL) could be proscribed as a terror organisation in the wake of riots in Southport, Angela Rayner has suggested, writes Charles Hymas.\n\nSupporters of the EDL were blamed for the violence on Tuesday night, in which police officers were attacked with rocks and a police van set on fire.\n\nMs Rayner, the Deputy Prime Minister, said: \"We have laws and we have proscribed groups and we do look at that and it is reviewed regularly.\n\n\"So I'm sure that that will be something that the Home Secretary [Yvette Cooper] will be looking at as part of the normal course of what we do and the intelligence that we have.\n\n\"But I think the bigger issue is about taking on the minority of people that have got thuggish behaviour, that actually that's not our British values.\"\n\nSouthport resident raises nearly \u00a31k to support Muslim community\n\nA Southport resident has started a GoFundMe raising nearly \u00a31,000 to help \"restore the safe space\" of Muslims after the local mosque was vandalised during raids in the area on Tuesday.\n\nPhoenix Lawson, 20, said: \"It is the only mosque in Southport. It is the only place they can pray peacefully and it's just been destroyed unfortunately.\"\n\n\"I was informed that three panels of the window of the mosque was destroyed and smashed in, and also the brick wall outside was completely demolished.\n\n\"It's a very unsafe environment for a lot of Muslims now. Friday prayer is two days away and there's been a massive raid outside the mosque. I don't think they're going to want to go there as of now.\"\n\nShe added the stabbing attack at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club on Monday and the riots a day later has been a \"big shock\" for the Southport community.\n\n\"It's scary. Everything is quiet in Southport nothing really goes on here. You don't really care about nighttime or robberies but to have three murders and then massive riots to happen in space in two days is a big shock,\" she said.\n\nMerseyside Police have condemned the \"despicable\" actions of protesters for the \"disrespect\" shown to grieving families and the Southport community.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Jenny Sims said: \"I know the wider community is as shocked as we are about the abhorrent events of last night.\n\n\"We have been overwhelmed with messages of thanks from the community, and I know I speak on behalf of all those officers there last night when I say how grateful we all are for their support.\"\n\nShe added: \"The wanton violence and destruction we saw is the very last thing the people of Southport need having been rocked by the awful events of Monday. The disrespect toward grieving families and the community is despicable, and I want to reassure residents in Southport that we will have a significantly increased police presence in the town in the coming days.\n\n\"We would appeal to anyone who has information or video footage of those involved in this shocking behaviour to come forward so we can identify and arrest those responsible.\"\n\n04:00 PM BST\n\nFour arrested after 50 officers injured by protesters\n\nMerseyside police have made four arrests after 53 officers were injured in clashes with \"despicable\" protesters in Southport last night.\n\nDemonstrators swarmed around Southport's mosque, hurling bottles, bricks and wheelie bins at officers, who huddled behind riot shields in an attempt to diffuse tensions which had boiled over following Monday's stabbing.\n\nOf those wounded, eight were hospitalised with injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and concussion. Three police dogs were also hurt.\n\nThe force has issued an appeal for footage and information after three men were arrested on suspicion of violent disorder. A fourth was arrested on suspicion of affray and possession of a bladed article.\n\nOfficers have been granted enhanced powers to stop and search suspects in the area and to seize items used in acts of anti-social behaviour.\n\nQuestions have been raised about why the identity of the teenager arrested over the Southport stabbings has not been made public.\n\nDetectives have been given more time to question the 17-year-old over the incident and he remains in custody after being detained on suspicion of murder and attempted murder. No charges have been brought.\n\nAt this stage, the boy has not been identified because of his age amid active ongoing criminal proceedings.\n\nThe criminal age of responsibility in England and Wales is 10 years old, meaning children aged between 10 and 17 can be arrested and taken to court if they commit a crime.\n\nThe identity of defendants and witnesses under the age of 18 who are subject to criminal proceedings in youth courts is protected by automatic reporting restrictions under Section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933.\n\nIf a child is charged with an offence and is facing criminal proceedings in adult courts - magistrates' and crown courts - then magistrates and judges have legal powers to grant anonymity to a child defendant, witness or victim under Section 45 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999.\n\nBoth of these laws ban the press from publishing a child defendant's name or any detail which could lead to them being identified while the reporting restrictions remain in place.\n\nThis is why media reports sometimes say they cannot identify a child involved in a criminal court case for legal reasons.\n\n03:12 PM BST\n\nPictured: residents and police repair damage caused by violent Southport protest\n\n02:48 PM BST\n\nThree arrested last night says Merseyside Police Chief Constable\n\nSerena Kennedy, Merseyside Police Chief Constable, said three people were arrested on Tuesday night.\n\nShe said: \"Our priority was to try and keep the communities of Southport safe and also to make sure officers remained safe.\n\n\"Three arrests were made, however more will follow. It's impossible to say (how many will be arrested). It's really early days in the investigation.\"\n\nShe estimated 200 to 300 people were involved.\n\nShe said: \"Initially, there were about 70 people who made their way away from the vigil and were making their way towards the mosque.\n\n\"They suddenly became about 200 in number and then others joined that number.\"\n\n02:43 PM BST\n\nAngela Rayner criticises social media users spreading 'untruths' about Southport stabbing\n\nAngela Rayner has criticised social media users spreading \"untruths\" about the Southport stabbing.\n\nThe Deputy Prime Minister made the remarks after the suspect being held in custody over the deaths of three young girls was falsely identified online as an asylum seeker.\n\nMs Rayner also condemned \"disgraceful\" scenes in Southport on Tuesday night as hundreds of demonstrators clashed with police, throwing bricks, masonry and fireworks at officers.\n\nOfficers' injuries were devastating, says Chief Constable of Merseyside police\n\nSerena Kennedy, Chief Constable of Merseyside, said seeing officers' injuries following the riots in Southport was devastating.\n\nShe said the injuries included broken bones, cuts and concussion, but said none of the officers were in critical condition.\n\nMs Kennedy said: \"Being at Southport police station last night and seeing the officers being brought in from the street with their injuries was just devastating.\"\n\nShe said it was a \"fast-moving investigation and it's progressing well\".\n\n02:19 PM BST\n\nWatch: Merseyside police braced for more demonstrations tonight\n\nSerena Kennedy, Merseyside Chief Constable, said she understood the communities in Southport were \"really worried\" about \"are we going to see this again tonight\".\n\nShe said: \"We are absolutely planning for this evening and for the weekend ahead.\n\n\"We are being really well supported by police forces across the North West to make sure we have got sufficient resources so that we don't see a repeat of last night.\"\n\nAsked about the resources deployed on Tuesday, Ms Kennedy said: \"We were well prepared and had sufficient resources. However, the people who turned up last night were bolstered very quickly and it very quickly escalated and we did have to call on mutual aid.\"\n\nThe chief constable, who was speaking at the scene of the disorder, said 54 officers were injured, including 49 from Merseyside Police and four from Lancashire.\n\n02:18 PM BST\n\nMayor of Liverpool says social media whipped up scenes into frenzy\n\nSteve Rotheram, Metro mayor of Liverpool, said: \"What we saw last night was infiltration by people from all over the country, stirred up by social media and then whipped up into a frenzy whereby they were attacking the very people that everybody earlier in the day was celebrating for being the heroes, for running towards danger.\n\n\"It leaves a very sour taste in the mouth that these people believe they can come here and divide our community.\n\n\"They won't be doing that and the haters won't win out.\"\n\nHe added: \"It's too easy for people with nefarious intent to go online and to say things that aren't factual and then for people to believe those things and really I think anybody who listens or watches anything online should do it with a large dose of salt.\"\n\n02:03 PM BST\n\nJames Cleverly calls for the government to come down 'hard and fast' on rioters\n\nThe Government must come down \"hard and fast\" on rioters and online misinformation following clashes in Southport, James Cleverly has said.\n\nThe shadow home secretary said: \"The violence we have seen in Southport is an insult to the memory of the victims of this heinous attack.\n\n\"These are not protesters fighting injustice, they are thugs fighting the police, tearing up a community that is already trying to process an unimaginable horror. They must be met with the full force of the law.\n\n\"People will understandably want to know how and why something so awful could have happened, but getting the right answers will take time.

I think the community needs that space, it doesn't need violence and disorder, and from what we can tell lots of people who don't even live in Merseyside coming in and trying to stir up trouble.\"\n\nWelcome to our live blog where we will be bringing you the latest updates following the knife attack in Southport on Monday.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cameron_henderson@yahoo.com", "name": "Cameron Henderson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Rayner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angela Rayner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jo Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Robinson_(activist)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Robinson (activist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Fox", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laurence Fox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flare", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "English Defence League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_hooliganism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Football hooliganism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_constable", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief constable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_hijacking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft hijacking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Riot police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehall", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whitehall"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AM_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AM broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Summer_Time", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "British Summer Time"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Bus-loads of thugs assaulted police officers, intimidated locals, and damaged homes, businesses and a mosque.\n\nIt was, as local artist Tony Wynne puts it, \"a disgraceful hijacking of our tragedy, and a failed attempt to divide us\". The largely masked rioters, who scarpered in the small hours, their convoys of vehicles witnessed leaving Southport by sickened residents, had left a trail of ruin down the Sussex Road area. Scorch marks on the pavement where flaming wheelie bins landed; garden walls kicked down to free bricks that could be hurled at the police; cars scratched and dented; a mosque's windows smashed.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n04:38 PM BST\n\nEnglish Defence League could be proscribed as terror organisation, Angela Rayner suggests\n\nThe English Defence League (EDL) could be proscribed as a terror organisation in the wake of riots in Southport, Angela Rayner has suggested, writes Charles Hymas.\n\nSupporters of the EDL were blamed for the violence on Tuesday night, in which police officers were attacked with rocks and a police van set on fire.\n\nMs Rayner, the Deputy Prime Minister, said: \"We have laws and we have proscribed groups and we do look at that and it is reviewed regularly.\n\n\"So I'm sure that that will be something that the Home Secretary [Yvette Cooper] will be looking at as part of the normal course of what we do and the intelligence that we have.\n\n\"But I think the bigger issue is about taking on the minority of people that have got thuggish behaviour, that actually that's not our British values.\"\n\nRead the full report here.\n\n04:30 PM BST\n\nSouthport resident raises nearly \u00a31k to support Muslim community\n\nA Southport resident has started a GoFundMe raising nearly \u00a31,000 to help \"restore the safe space\" of Muslims after the local mosque was vandalised during raids in the area on Tuesday.\n\nPhoenix Lawson, 20, said: \"It is the only mosque in Southport. It is the only place they can pray peacefully and it's just been destroyed unfortunately.\"\n\n\"I was informed that three panels of the window of the mosque was destroyed and smashed in, and also the brick wall outside was completely demolished.\n\n\"It's a very unsafe environment for a lot of Muslims now.

Three police dogs were also hurt.\n\nThe force has issued an appeal for footage and information after three men were arrested on suspicion of violent disorder.

No charges have been brought.\n\nAt this stage, the boy has not been identified because of his age amid active ongoing criminal proceedings.\n\nThe criminal age of responsibility in England and Wales is 10 years old, meaning children aged between 10 and 17 can be arrested and taken to court if they commit a crime.\n\nThe identity of defendants and witnesses under the age of 18 who are subject to criminal proceedings in youth courts is protected by automatic reporting restrictions under Section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933.\n\nIf a child is charged with an offence and is facing criminal proceedings in adult courts - magistrates' and crown courts - then magistrates and judges have legal powers to grant anonymity to a child defendant, witness or victim under Section 45 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999.\n\nBoth of these laws ban the press from publishing a child defendant's name or any detail which could lead to them being identified while the reporting restrictions remain in place.\n\nThis is why media reports sometimes say they cannot identify a child involved in a criminal court case for legal reasons.\n\n03:12 PM BST\n\nPictured: residents and police repair damage caused by violent Southport protest\n\n02:48 PM BST\n\nThree arrested last night says Merseyside Police Chief Constable\n\nSerena Kennedy, Merseyside Police Chief Constable, said three people were arrested on Tuesday night.\n\nShe said: \"Our priority was to try and keep the communities of Southport safe and also to make sure officers remained safe.\n\n\"Three arrests were made, however more will follow.

The idea that anyone would want to respond to it by rioting seems to me to be perverse.\"\n\nDeclining to criticise his GB News colleague Nigel Farage, who leads Reform and questioned whether the truth about the stabbings was being \"withheld\", Sir Jacob said: \"We obviously have to wait and see what all the information is.\n\n\"I think jumping to conclusions on what has happened until one knows is not wise.

We had a vigil with thousands of people paying their respects in a peaceful fashion and just having a space and a place where they can express their emotions.\"\n\nHe added: \"And then within an hour, an hour and a half, we also had this horrific riots. There's no other word to describe it. It was led by people from outside of town. These were thugs who got the train in. These were not people from Southport. They were using the deaths of three little kiddies for their own political purposes and to attack the very same first responders and the very same police who had been on the scene on Monday.\"\n\nMr Hurley added: \"There's no way to describe that other than to say it's utterly reprehensible and we must identify these people and make sure that the full force of the law is down against them.\"\n\n08:06 AM BST\n\nPictured: Aftermath of violent disorder outside mosque in Southport\n\nResidents commence clean-up operation in Southport following riots last night.\n\n08:00 AM BST\n\nCouncillor saw masked men arriving at scene\n\nCouncillor Mike Salmon, who saw the violence happening outside his home on Tuesday, told BBC Radio Merseyside several people arrived at the scene wearing \"masks and balaclavas\".\n\nHe said: \"A few hours ago there were lots of people arriving down my road.

This does not represent our diverse Britain and the people of Southport.\n\n\"The Government must address the increasing rise of violent far-Right extremism targeting Muslim communities.

Alex Baker said a peaceful protest \"descended into intimidating behaviour\" at a hotel in the Hampshire town.\n\n\"This incident was exacerbated by people from outside our community who came here determined to cause unrest,\" she said.\n\n\"We all support our shared right to peacefully protest, but we will not stand for people coming to our towns determined to stir up trouble and divide out community.\"\n\nWednesday's disorder followed unrest near a mosque in Southport on Tuesday night, during which the building was attacked.\n\nMerseyside Police officers were also pelted with bricks and a police van was set on fire.\n\nThe Prime Minister will welcome senior policing leaders to Downing Street on Thursday.\n\nNumber 10 said the meeting serves to \"offer them the government's full backing following multiple high-profile incidents of extreme violence and public disorder on our streets\".\n\n\"[The prime minister] will say that the shocking events in Southport this week serve as a reminder of the bravery of our emergency service workers and the vitally important work they do to keep the public safe,\" it said.\n\n\"While the right to peaceful protest must be protected at all costs, he will be clear that criminals who exploit that right in order to sow hatred and carry out violent acts will face the full force of the law.\"\n\nThe disorder came after Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, were fatally stabbed on Monday while attending a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club in Southport.\n\nEight other children suffered knife wounds - with five of them in a critical condition - while two adults were also critically hurt.\n\nEarly on Thursday morning, a 17-year-old boy was charged by Merseyside Police with three counts of murder and

Simmering rage over the senseless attack exploded into violence again as thugs torched police cars, hurled glass bottles and clashed with officers across London , Hartlepool and Manchester last night. The shocking scenes across the country came just hours before Merseyside Police announced that a 17-year-old boy has been charged with murder following the death of three girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport.\n\nFalse speculation online that the suspect is an asylum seeker who had travelled to the UK on a boat appears to be fuelling the shocking violence which started outside a mosque in Southport on Tuesday and spread across the UK last night. The misinformation is believed to have originated from a Russian-linked fake news website . The suspect, who is from the nearby village of Banks, Lancashire, but was born in Cardiff, Wales, has been charged with the murders of six-year-old Bebe King, seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe and nine-year-old Alice Dasilva Aguiar. The teenager, who cannot be named because he is under 18, has also been charged with ten counts of attempted murder and possession of a bladed article. He has been remanded in custody and will appear at Liverpool Magistrates' Court today.\n\nAs well as the three fatalities, eight other children suffered stab wounds in the bloodbath when an attacker stormed the summer holiday club. Five youngsters are in a critical condition, as are two women who bravely tried to save the children. Southport locals - including Elsie's mother - have called for the violence to stop after police vans were set on fire and bricks were hurled in violence that left 53 officers injured on Tuesday. But her wishes were ignored as angry mobs took to the streets - in other parts of the country - amid mounting anger. Many were filled with anti-migrant rhetoric. The largest demonstration took place in London at an 'Enough is Enough' protest, where 100 thugs were arrested. Activists took to the streets chanting the name of English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson and yelled 'stop the boats'. Riot police were also pelted with glass bottles in Manchester, after protesters targeted a Holiday Inn hotel where migrants are believed to be housed.\n\nThe most chaotic riots, however, were seen in Hartlepool where thugs were seen throwing objects at riot police, striking their shields and setting a police car on fire. A series of pops could be heard from the fire which destroyed the vehicle, before there was a louder bang as the fuel tank went up in flames. Right-wing protesters posed for selfies with the wreck after firefighters put the blaze out. One person was live streaming the chaos when an Asian man was punched by a thug as he tried to walk past in what appeared to be a racially-motivated assault. Missiles including glass bottles and eggs were hurled at the police who were braced for attacks with shields after hundreds gathered in the town centre. Officers shut off a large section of Murray Street, a busy road full of takeaways and shops. It is understood the Salaam Community Centre came under threat and police were working to keep the area safe. Rioters were also filmed shouting racist chants. Many had their faces covered and aggressively clapped their hands and waved their arms in the air during the violence. Cleveland Police said four arrests had been made for various offences including public order and affray and they were taken to custody.\n\nChief Superintendent David Sutherland said: 'We currently have a high policing presence while officers respond to disorder that is taking place in Hartlepool following a protest that began this evening. 'At this stage we believe the protest is in connection with the incident in Southport earlier this week. 'Our officers are facing missiles, glass bottles and eggs being thrown at them and have made arrests as they remain in the area to protect the safety of those living in the community. 'I want to urge members of the public to stay away from the area.' MP for Hartlepool Jonathan Brash issued a statement which read: 'I'm deeply concerned about the situation that is developing in Hartlepool this evening. 'I will be meeting with police to discuss the response to this incident and would urge calm to allow our emergency services to do their job. 'These events do not represent what Hartlepool is or the values that our people hold. Violence is never the answer.' In Manchester, shocking footage emerged of a group of thugs, some masked, throwing bottles at riot police vans and officers. It is understood they were targeting a hotel where migrants are being housed. The most large-scale clashes took place in the capital, however, as riot police were forced to fend off a group of flag-waving thugs on Whitehall.\n\nSome protesters were wearing t-shirts with the faces of the Southport victims on - despite families calling for an end to the violence. Police were forced to put on riot gear after chanting activists threw cans and launched flares outside Downing Street . Around 1,000 right-wing activists descended on Whitehall last night, with some waving a Union Jack flag banner with the words: 'Enough is enough. Stop the boats.' Huge scuffles between police and protesters broke out, with officers wrestling activists to the ground and leading them away in handcuffs after they tried to breach police lines. Loud chants of 'Oh Tommy Robinson ' and 'we want our country back' were also heard as protesters surrounded The Cenotaph, despite police vans trying to protect the war memorial on Whitehall. Beer cans and glass bottles were launched at a line of police in riot gear who had assembled to block Whitehall in front of Downing Street. Other protesters attempted to kick down a fence and were confronted by riot police. Some activists were wearing red caps which said 'Make Britain Great Again' - a reference to Donald Trump's 'Make America Great Again' movement. Others wore t-shirts calling for Tommy Robinson to be Home Secretary and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage to be Prime Minister. Many protesters were draped in England flags as the Enough Is Enough protest got underway shortly after 7pm.\n\nOne with a Union Jack flag wrapped around him was seen mounting a traffic light in front of an army of riot police officers. Shortly after 7pm, the protesters - many of whom were drinking alcohol - began marching towards Parliament Square. A few hundred protesters chanting 'Rule Britannia', 'save our kids' and 'stop the boats' attempted to leave the pavement opposite Downing Street in defiance of strict Metropolitan Police conditions on the protest. The Metropolitan Police said demonstrators taking part had to stay within a certain area and leave at 8.30pm. But many stayed on longer than this. Protesters forced police to put riot gear on as they threw cans at police outside Downing Street. But that didn't stop one protester, who confronted one police officer and lifted up the mask of his helmet with his finger. They also threw flares on to the statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square and shouted abuse at nearby pro-Ukrainian demonstrators and police. A police helicopter was also seen flying over Downing Street amid the unrest. Around an hour into the protest, activists started trying to break a police line on Whitehall to access Parliament Square. More bottles and cans were being thrown at police in riot gear who were desperately trying to hold off the protesters.\n\nActivists then attempted to kick down a fence to circumvent a police line on Whitehall. Others ran past police towards Trafalgar Square and police formed a new line outside the Cabinet Office. The last remaining protesters who were breaching the dispersal order were detained in Whitehall at around 10pm and led away from near The Cenotaph. Whitehall later reopened after protesters had wreaked havoc in the area. A Met Police update said: 'This evening during a planned protest on Whitehall some disorder took place. 'Officers acted to ensure the disorder was contained. 'Over 100 people have been arrested for offences including violent disorder, assault on an emergency worker, and breach of protest conditions. 'Some officers suffered minor injuries.' The protest was promoted by actor Laurence Fox on X, formerly Twitter, on Tuesday. It comes after Jenni Stancombe, the mother of little Elsie who died in the Southport stabbings, pleaded for the violence to end on social media. She said: 'This is the only thing that I will write, but please stop the violence in Southport tonight. 'The police have been nothing but heroic these last 24 hours and they and we don't need this.' Back in Southport, where the grieving community was clearing up the damage from the riots yesterday, a poster was put up which said: 'Leave our town. We don't need this.'\n\nPolice officers from around the country gathered in Southport in preparation of any disturbances, but the seaside town was unscathed after a shocking night of riots 24 hours prior. Police vans, cars and horses were deployed to the town in preparation of any disturbance. Some 53 officers were injured in Tuesday's violence - which police believe was started by supporters of the far-right EDL group. Four people were arrested after the riots. A fifth man was also arrested on Wednesday night. It comes after officers were called to a separate domestic incident. Officers recognised the man from footage of the disorder in Southport on Tuesday, where it is thought he sustained a head injury. He was taken to hospital where he was reported to have racially abused a fellow patient. The 39-year-old man from Southport was arrested on suspicion of violent disorder, threats to kill and a racially aggravated public order offence. He was taken into custody to be interviewed and conditionally bailed, the force said. Assistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said: 'Our work to identify all those responsible for the despicable violence and aggression seen on the streets of Southport on Tuesday continues. 'We have been inundated with images and footage from members of the public who were outraged at the destruction carried out. 'The individuals involved in the disorder had no regard for the families and friends of those who so tragically lost their lives, and a community in grief.\n\n'It has been heartening today to see the reaction of the whole community, who have pulled together to clean the streets, rebuild walls and re-glaze broken windows.' The mayor of the Liverpool City Region, Steve Rotheram, told Sky News earlier that he did not believe violence would break out in Southport for a second night. After riots broke out, Southport locals and builders came together to help repair the mosque walls and clear up. Ibrahim Hussein, the mosque chairman, who was one of eight people trapped inside as rioters hurled missiles at the building, said the community clear up was 'really humbling' and brought tears to his eyes. He said the mosque has been here for 30 years with 'no bother at all', adding: 'We love the community and the community loves us.' Mr Hussein described his ordeal as 'terrifying and horrendous' and said there was no reason to target the mosque. Worshipper Iqbal Ahmed, 32, was also trapped inside. He said rioters were calling the mosque on withheld numbers throughout the night threatening to kill them and their families.\n\nAlong the road, Denise Mace, 51, and her chef husband Graham, 52, had looked on helplessly from upstairs during the riot. 'It was terrifying, absolutely horrendous. We didn't know if they would come into our house,' said Mrs Mace. The Malakar family feared their Asian ethnicity could make them a target. They turned off the lights as the mob knocked down their garden wall to grab bricks. Pensioner May Small, 71, watched as yobs came down her path looking for makeshift missiles. 'I told them to clear off,' she said. 'I would like to kick their [expletive], but you can't, can you?'\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nMore than 100 people have been arrested in London as further protests took place across the country in the wake of the Southport stabbings. Violent outbreaks have taken place across Britain, including violent unrest in Hartlepool, Manchester, and Aldershot.\n\nPolice in Hartlepool were attacked with missiles, glass bottles and eggs, Cleveland Police said. A police car was also set alight during the violence after a large group of people gathered in the Murray Street area of Hartlepool on Wednesday evening.\n\nIn Manchester, demonstrators turned out in large numbers outside the Holiday Inn hotel on Oldham Road at around 6pm, the Manchester Evening News reported. Around 40 people, which the paper reports included children and men wearing balaclavas, gathered outside the Oldham Road premises in what the paper said \"appeared to be a stand against asylum seekers currently being housed in the hotel\".\n\nIn Aldershot, local MP Alex Baker took to social media to rebuke violence in her community, stating that there is \"no justification for disorderly behaviour and the scenes do not represent Aldershot and Farnborough\".\n\n\"I have been liaising with Hampshire Police this evening regarding a significant incident at Potter's International Hotel in Aldershot, where a peaceful protest descended into intimidating behaviour,\" she said in a statement shared on X.\n\n\"I have visited the scene myself this evening and have been in touch with the Chief Inspector. This incident was exacerbated by people from outside our community who came here determined to cause unrest. I would like to pay tribute to the brave police officers who worked hard to restore order.\n\n\"There is no justification for disorderly behaviour and the scenes do not represent Aldershot and Farnborough. We all support our shared right to peacefully protest, but we will not stand for people coming into our towns determined to stir up trouble and divide our community.\"\n\nIn London, a large protest was staged under the title of Enough is Enough, with arrests made after demonstrators clashed with officers in Whitehall on Wednesday. The Metropolitan Police said: \"Over 100 people have been arrested for offences including violent disorder, assault on an emergency worker, and breach of protest conditions. Some officers suffered minor injuries.\"\n\nDemonstrators were seen launching beer cans and glass bottles at a line of police in riot gear in front of Downing Street and throwing flares onto the statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square. The angry scenes also included loud chants of \"we want our country back\" and \"Oh Tommy Robinson\", referring to the right-wing activist.\n\nCleveland Police also said it had made eight arrests for various offences including public order and affray after violence broke out in Hartlepool on Wednesday, with more arrests expected. Road closures have been lifted, but a visible police presence remains in the area, the force said.\n\nChief superintendent David Sutherland said: \"At this stage we believe the protest is in connection with the incident in Southport earlier this week.\n\n\"Our officers are facing missiles, glass bottles and eggs being thrown at them and have made arrests as they remain in the area to protect the safety of those living in the community.\"\n\nIn Manchester, local councillor John Flanagan took to social media to respond to the violence, labelling those involved in the \"sickening\" incident as \"mindless idiots\".\n\n\"I'd like to condemn these mindless thugs, attacking innocent men who are asylum seekers. They have been there for months and we have not had any issues or problems. They have been in a place of safety,\" the councillor for Newton Heath said.\n\n\"It's sickening to think they are being targeted because of their race or their religion, and I hope this isn't tied with the disgraceful scenes in Southport where a mosque was attacked last night.\n\n\"These idiots are attacking innocent people. My initial reaction is to contact GMP and support them. The whole of the city and reasonable thinking people will be horrified and sickened by these actions. Idiots is too soft of a word - I hope the police use the full force of the law.\n\n\"We cannot allow our country and our city to descend into anarchy, which seems to be being driven by madness on social media.\"\n\nIt comes after violence erupted in Southport on Tuesday following a vigil for three girls killed in a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club. Police officers in Southport suffered serious injuries when bricks, stones and bottles were thrown and cars were set alight during violent protests.\n\nThe disorder near the town's mosque came after false rumours were circulated online about the suspect. In an effort to avoid a second night of rioting, Merseyside Police were given extra powers, under S60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, on Wednesday to stop and search people suspected of carrying weapons.\n\nCommunity Inspector Doug Chadwick said the public was \"shocked and disappointed\" by the \"disgraceful\" scenes of rioting and called on the public to come forward with information about what they had seen.\n\nFive people have been arrested over the unrest so far, which saw 53 officers and three police dogs injured. The unrest comes as a 17-year-old boy has been charged with the murders of the three girls.\n\nAlice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, were fatally stabbed on Monday when a knifeman entered the dance class on Hart Street in Southport, Merseyside.\n\nEight other children suffered knife wounds - with five of them in critical condition - while two adults were also critically hurt. The 17-year-old has been remanded in custody to appear on Thursday, August 1, at Liverpool Magistrates Court, Derby Square.", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Bebe King, six, were fatally stabbed on Monday at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class on Hart Street in Southport, Merseyside.\n\nEight other children suffered knife wounds, with five of them in a critical condition. Two adults were also critically injured.\n\nThe accused has been remanded in custody to appear on Thursday at Liverpool magistrates' court.\n\nThe incident sparked violent unrest in London, Hartlepool and Manchester overnight on Wednesday, while a demonstration in Aldershot led to a tense standoff with riot police. Far-right demonstrations were organised after false claims that the attack was carried out by a Muslim asylum seeker who crossed the Channel in a small boat gained traction on social media.\n\nAt the meeting Starmer is expected to praise officers' bravery in dealing with the incident in Southport and its aftermath, and commit to working in partnership with police forces across the UK to stop \"mindless violence\".\n\nIn London, more than 100 people were arrested after protesters in Whitehall launched beer cans and glass bottles at police and threw flares at the statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square.\n\nIn Hartlepool, a police car was set alight after a large group of people gathered in the Murray Street area.

One man wore a shirt with the slogan: \"Nigel Farage for Prime Minister, Tommy Robinson for Home Secretary\".\n\nAldershot appears to have escaped the violence seen in other parts of the country, but a demonstration there was still met by riot police. The local Labour MP, Alex Baker rebuked the violence in her community, stating there was \"no justification for disorderly behaviour and the scenes do not represent Aldershot and Farnborough\".\n\n\"I have visited the scene myself this evening and have been in touch with the chief inspector ... We all support our shared right to peacefully protest but we will not stand for people coming into our towns determined to stir up trouble and divide our community.\"\n\nNigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, was criticised for appearing to give credence to conspiracy theories about the attack. In a video on Tuesday he questioned \"whether the truth is being withheld from us\".\n\nNeil Basu, a former senior Scotland Yard officer who was in charge of counter-terrorism from 2018 to 2021, said there were \"real world consequences\" when public figures failed to \"keep their mouth shut\".\n\n\"Nigel Farage is giving the EDL [English Defence League] succour, undermining the police, creating

Protests were also carried out in London, Hartlepool and Aldershot.\n\nDemonstrators first turned out in large numbers outside the hotel on Oldham Road at around 6pm. A group of around 40 people, including children and young men wearing balaclavas, gathered outside the premises in what appeared to be a stand against asylum seekers currently being housed in the hotel.\n\nREAD NEXT: Protest in Manchester erupts into scenes of violence as man dragged off bus and rocks and bottles pelted at police\n\nProtesters chanted 'we want our country back' and 'shame on you' as the violence then escalated. Riot police were pelted with bottles and a man was dragged off a bus and attacked.\n\nThe chaotic scenes spilled onto the main road with beer bottles pelted at cars. Local Newton Heath councillor John Flanagan slammed those involved in the 'sickening' incident as 'mindless idiots'.\n\nIn a statement issued at around 10.50pm last night, Greater Manchester Police said two males had been arrested. Thankfully, no-one was seriously injured, the force added.\n\nThe statement said: \"#INCIDENT | At around 6pm this evening our officers were called to reports of a demonstration on Oldham Road in Newton Heath. Local patrols supported by specialised units, were deployed and dispersed the group after objects were thrown, towards the police and public.\n\n\"Due to the early intervention from our officers this criminal behaviour thankfully didn't cause any serious injury or damage. Two men aged 18 and 25 were later arrested for violent disorder and assault of an emergency worker and remain in custody at this time for questioning.\n\n\"Enquiries into a further related report of an assault of a bus driver is ongoing at this stage. Anyone with information is asked to call 101 quoting incident 1369 of 31/07/2024.\"\n\nThe protest in Newton Heath was one of a number held across the UK last night in the wake of the Southport stabbings. In London, a large protest was staged under the title of Enough is Enough, with arrests made after demonstrators clashed with officers in Whitehall on Wednesday.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said: \"Over 100 people have been arrested for offences including violent disorder, assault on an emergency worker, and breach of protest conditions. Some officers suffered minor injuries.\"\n\nDemonstrators were seen launching beer cans and glass bottles at a line of police in riot gear in front of Downing Street and throwing flares onto the statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square. The angry scenes also included loud chants of 'we want our country back' and 'Oh Tommy Robinson', referring to the right-wing activist.\n\nPolice in Hartlepool were also attacked with missiles, glass bottles and eggs as a protest took place, Cleveland Police said. A police car was also set alight during the violence after a large group of people gathered in the Murray Street area.\n\nCleveland Police said it had made eight arrests for various offences including public order and affray, with more arrests expected. In Aldershot, local MP Alex Baker took to social media to rebuke violence in her community, stating that there is 'no justification for disorderly behaviour and the scenes do not represent Aldershot and Farnborough'.\n\nThe chaotic scenes across the UK last night followed a large-scale protest in Southport on Tuesday following a vigil for three girls - Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven - who were killed in a knife attack at a holiday club. Police officers in Southport suffered serious injuries when bricks, stones and bottles were thrown and cars were set alight during violent protests.\n\nA 17-year-old boy has since been charged with murder and attempted murder in connection with the stabbings. Eight other children suffered knife wounds - with five of them in a critical condition - while two adults were also critically hurt.\n\nThe boy cannot be named due to his age. He has been remanded in custody to appear in Liverpool Magistrates' Court today (August 1).\n\nThe Prime Minister is set to meet with police chiefs today over the protests and scenes of violence. Sir Keir Starmer will convene senior policing leaders in Downing Street to offer them the government's 'full backing' and to reinforce the need to deal with criminals who 'exploit the right to protest to sow hatred and carry out violent acts', and to work with police forces across the UK to 'stop mindless violence' erupting on streets.\n\nRead more of today's top stories here", "source": {"uri":

This incident was exacerbated by people from outside our community who came here determined to cause unrest. I would like to pay tribute to the brave police officers who worked hard to restore order.\n\n\"There is no justification for disorderly behaviour and the scenes do not represent Aldershot and Farnborough. We all support our shared right to peacefully protest, but we will not stand for people coming into our towns determined to stir up trouble and divide our community.\"\n\nIn London, a large protest was staged under the title of Enough is Enough, with arrests made after demonstrators clashed with officers in Whitehall on Wednesday.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said: \"Over 100 people have been arrested for offences including violent disorder, assault on an emergency worker, and breach of protest conditions. Some officers suffered minor injuries.\"\n\nDemonstrators were seen launching beer cans and glass bottles at a line of police in riot gear in front of Downing Street and throwing flares onto the statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square.\n\nThe angry scenes also included loud chants of \"we want our country back\" and \"Oh Tommy Robinson\", referring to the right-wing activist.\n\nCleveland Police also said it had made four arrests for various offences including public order and affray after violence broke out in Hartlepool on Wednesday.\n\nRoad closures were put in place and the public were warned to stay away.\n\nChief Superintendent David Sutherland said: \"At this stage we believe the protest is in connection with the incident in Southport earlier this week.\n\n\"Our officers are facing missiles, glass bottles and eggs being thrown at them and have made arrests as they remain in the area to protect the safety of those living in the community.\"\n\nIn Manchester, local councillor John Flanagan took to social media to respond to the violence, labelling those involved in the \"sickening\" incident as \"mindless idiots\".\n\n\"I'd like to condemn these mindless thugs, attacking innocent men who are asylum seekers. They have been there for months and we have not had any issues or problems. They have been in a place of safety,\" the councillor for Newton Heath said.\n\n\"It's sickening to think they are being targeted because of their race or their religion, and I hope this isn't tied with the disgraceful scenes in Southport where a mosque was attacked last night.\n\n\"These idiots are attacking innocent people. My initial reaction is to contact GMP and support them. The whole of the city and reasonable thinking people will be horrified and sickened by these actions.

Earlier on Wednesday, detectives were granted more time to question the teenager. The only details released about the suspect are his age, he is from the village of Banks, about five miles from where the stabbings took place, and was born in Cardiff.\n\nThe charge came hours after there were scenes of violent disorder on Wednesday in central London as crowds of protesters marched on Downing Street. Demonstrators threw flares and cans while chanting \"Rule Britannia\", \"save our kids\" and \"stop the boats\", while police were seen wrestling a man off the road and onto the pavement next to the Cenotaph. Others attempted to kick down a fence and were confronted by riot police. More than 100 people were arrested, the Metropolitan police said.\n\nThere was also a protest in Hartlepool, County Durham, which resulted in four people being arrested after police officers had missiles, glass bottles and eggs thrown at them. Late in the night a police vehicle was set alight in the town centre.\n\nSeveral officers suffered minor injuries responding to the disorder, Cleveland police said. Jonathan Brash, the Labour MP for the town, said he was \"deeply concerned\" about the situation and would be meeting with police to discuss their response to the incident.\n\nMr Brash wrote on X: \"These events do not represent what Hartlepool is or the values that our people hold. Violence is never the answer.\"\n\nMore than 50 police officers were injured in far-right riots in Southport on Tuesday night, which broke out as the town reeled from the knife attack that killed three children. Five people have been arrested over the disturbances, police said.\n\nThe mother of Elsie, one of the children who was killed, intervened in a bid to diffuse tensions. \"This is the only thing that I will write, but please, please stop the violence in Southport tonight,\" Jenni Stancombe said.\n\nAlex Goss, assistant chief constable for Merseyside police, said: \"Our work to identify all those responsible for the despicable violence and aggression seen on the streets of Southport on Tuesday continues. -

Earlier on Wednesday, detectives were granted more time to question the teenager. The only details released about the suspect are his age, he is from the village of Banks, about five miles from where the stabbings took place, and was born in Cardiff.\n\nThe charge came hours after there were scenes of violent disorder on Wednesday in central London as crowds of protesters marched on Downing Street. Demonstrators threw flares and cans while chanting \"Rule Britannia\", \"save our kids\" and \"stop the boats\", while police were seen wrestling a man off the road and onto the pavement next to the Cenotaph. Others attempted to kick down a fence and were confronted by riot police. More than 100 people were arrested, the Metropolitan police said.\n\nThere was also a protest in Hartlepool, County Durham, which resulted in four people being arrested after police officers had missiles, glass bottles and eggs thrown at them. Late in the night a police vehicle was set alight in the town centre.\n\nSeveral officers suffered minor injuries responding to the disorder, Cleveland police said. Jonathan Brash, the Labour MP for the town, said he was \"deeply concerned\" about the situation and would be meeting with police to discuss their response to the incident.\n\nBrash wrote on X: \"These events do not represent what Hartlepool is or the values that our people hold. Violence is never the answer.\"\n\nMore than 50 police officers were injured in far-right riots in Southport on Tuesday night, which broke out as the town reeled from the knife attack that killed three children. Five people have been arrested over the disturbances, police said.\n\nThe mother of Elsie, one of the children who was killed, intervened in a bid to diffuse tensions. \"This is the only thing that I will write, but please, please stop the violence in Southport tonight,\" Jenni Stancombe said.\n\n\"The police have been nothing but heroic these last 24 hours and they and we don't need this.\"\n\nAlex Goss, assistant chief constable for Merseyside police, said: \"Our work to identify all those responsible for the despicable violence and aggression seen on the streets of Southport on Tuesday continues.\n\n\"We have been inundated with images and footage from members of the public who were outraged at the destruction carried out. The individuals involved in the disorder had no regard for the families and friends of those who so tragically lost their lives, and a community in grief.\n\n\"It has been heartening today to see the reaction of the whole community, who have pulled together to clean the streets, rebuild walls and re-glaze broken windows.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo

He has been remanded in custody and will appear at Liverpool Magistrates' Court today.\n\nAs well as the three fatalities, eight other children suffered stab wounds in the bloodbath when an attacker stormed the summer holiday club. Five youngsters are in a critical condition, as are two women who bravely tried to save the children.\n\nSouthport locals - including Elsie's mother - have called for the violence to stop after police vans were set on fire and bricks were hurled in violence that left 53 officers injured on Tuesday.\n\nBut her wishes were ignored as angry mobs took to the streets - in other parts of the country - amid mounting anger. Many were filled with anti-migrant rhetoric.\n\nHARTLEPOOL: An angry mob burnt down a police car which was left to perish in the flames\n\nHARTLEPOOL: Rioters break down a fence as violence erupted in Britain for the second night running\n\nHARTLEPOOL: One person was live streaming the chaos when an Asian man was punched by a thug as he tried to walk past in what appeared to be a racially motivated assault\n\nLONDON: Violence erupted on the streets of the capital as flag-waving protesters clashed with police\n\nLONDON: Protesters were seen wearing t-shirts with the faces of the three Southport victims on.

Right-wing protesters posed for selfies with the wreck after firefighters put the blaze out.\n\nOne person was live streaming the chaos when an Asian man was punched by a thug as he tried to walk past in what appeared to be a racially motivated assault.\n\nMissiles including glass bottles and eggs were hurled at the police who were braced for attacks with shields after hundreds gathered in the town centre.\n\nOfficers shut off a large section of Murray Street, a busy road full of takeaways and shops. It is understood the Salaam Community Centre came under threat and police were working to keep the area safe.\n\nRioters were also filmed shouting racist chants. Many had their faces covered and aggressively clapped their hands and waved their arms in the air during the violence.\n\nCleveland Police said four arrests had been made for various offences including public order and affray and they were taken to custody.\n\nChief Superintendent David Sutherland said: 'We currently have a high policing presence while officers respond to disorder that is taking place in Hartlepool following a protest that began this evening.\n\n'At this stage we believe the protest is in connection with the incident in Southport earlier this week.\n\nHARTLEPOOL: Protesters run towards riot police as chaos unfolded on the streets\n\nHARTLEPOOL: Masked thugs stare down riot police as violence engulfed the town\n\nHARTLEPOOL: A police car was torched by protesters as anger mounts over the Southport stabbings\n\nHARTLEPOOL: Firefighters try and put out a blaze which completely destroyed a police vehicle\n\nHARTLEPOOL: Firefighters attempt to put out the blaze as a police car went up in flames\n\nHARTLEPOOL: Crowds gather to watch the clashes between riot police and protesters\n\nHARTLEPOOL: A protester clashes with riot police officers as violence broke out for a second night running\n\nHARTLEPOOL: Riot police officers on the streets with dogs following a violent protest\n\nMANCHESTER: Protesters were seen launching glass bottles at a police van\n\nMANCHESTER: Riot police try to block off protesters, many of whom were masked\n\n'Our officers are facing missiles, glass bottles and eggs being thrown at them and have made arrests as they remain in the area to protect the safety of those living in the community.\n\n'I want to urge members of the public to stay away from the area.'\n\nMP for Hartlepool Jonathan Brash issued a statement which read: 'I'm deeply concerned about the situation that is developing in Hartlepool this evening.\n\n'I will be meeting with police to discuss the response to this incident and would urge calm to allow our emergency services to do their job.\n\n'These events do not represent what Hartlepool is or the values that our people hold. Violence is never the answer.'\n\nIn Manchester, shocking footage emerged of a group of thugs, some masked, throwing bottles at riot police vans and officers. It is understood they were targeting a hotel where migrants are being housed.\n\nThe most large-scale clashes took place in the capital, however, as riot police were forced to fend off a group of flag-waving thugs on Whitehall.\n\nSome protesters were wearing t-shirts with the faces of the Southport victims on - despite families calling for an end to the violence.\n\nPolice were forced to put on riot gear after chanting activists threw cans and launched flares outside Downing Street.\n\nAround 1,000 right-wing activists descended on Whitehall last night, with some waving a Union Jack flag banner with the words: 'Enough is enough. Stop the boats.'\n\nHuge scuffles between police and protesters broke out, with officers wrestling activists to the ground and leading them away in handcuffs after they tried to breach police lines.\n\nLoud chants of 'Oh Tommy Robinson' and 'we want our country back' were also heard as protesters surrounded The Cenotaph, despite police vans trying to protect the war memorial on Whitehall.\n\nLONDON: A furious protester lifts up the mask of a riot policeman's helmet amid growing tensions\n\nLONDON: Protesters hold a Union Jack banner which says: 'Enough is enough.

But many stayed on longer than this.\n\nHARTLEPOOL: There were also clashes in County Durham as police faced rioters\n\nHARTLEPOOL: Arrests were made as violence spilled out onto the streets in Murray Street\n\nLONDON: Police officers detrain a protestor during the 'Enough is Enough' demonstration on Whitehall\n\nLONDON: Another protester is detained on Whitehall as ugly violence broke out for a second night running\n\nLONDON: A protesting thug gets up close and personal with a riot police officer amid the clashes\n\nLONDON: A protester is held back by others as he clashes with a female riot police officer on Whitehall\n\nLONDON: A can of Stella is launched at a riot police officer as ugly scenes break out in Whitehall\n\nLONDON: Police detained several protesters in amongst the chaotic scenes\n\nLONDON: Riot police officers usher protesters away as violence hit the capital on Wednesday night\n\nLONDON: Protesters and riot police officers scuffle as the Met tries to control the ugly scenes\n\nLONDON: Police officers clash with protesters during the 'Enough is Enough' protest in Whitehall\n\nLONDON: Riot police surrounded the protesters in the capital\n\nLONDON: Another protester is detained by police in Whitehall\n\nLONDON: Ugly scenes broke out as more protests took place following the fatal stabbings\n\nLONDON: Protesters try to break through a barrier as riot police wearing helmets try to control the violence\n\nLONDON: There have been more ugly scenes in Britain in the latest riot since a mosque in Southport was targeted last night\n\nLONDON: A protester is knocked to the ground as scuffles break out between police and activists\n\nLONDON: Protesters chant in front of police with Big Ben visible in the background\n\nLONDON: A protester is detained by police during the 'Enough is Enough' protest in Whitehall\n\nLONDON: A placard read 'Stop The Boats' and 'Save Our Children' ahead of the 'Enough is Enough' protest\n\nLONDON: Protesters clash with police officers on Whitehall, with England flags seen in the background\n\nLONDON: Some activists were wearing red caps which said 'Make Britain Great Again' - a reference to Donald Trump's 'Make America Great Again' movement\n\nLONDON: Others wore t-shirts calling for English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson to be Home Secretary and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage to be Prime Minister\n\nLONDON: Some activists were seen carrying cans of Stella Artois as the protest got underway\n\nLONDON: Many protesters were seen draped in England flags as the protest got underway\n\nLONDON: Police vans protecting the Cenotaph on Whitehall amid fears violence could break out\n\nLONDON: Some protesters were seen in England football shirts chanting outside Downing Street\n\nLONDON: A protester wearing a Union Jack t-shirt and holding an England flag on Whitehall\n\nProtesters forced police to put riot gear on as they threw cans at police outside Downing Street.

Others ran past police towards Trafalgar Square and police formed a new line outside the Cabinet Office.\n\nThe last remaining protesters who were breaching the dispersal order were detained in Whitehall at around 10pm and led away from near The Cenotaph.\n\nWhitehall later reopened after protesters had wreaked havoc in the area.\n\nA Met Police update said: 'This evening during a planned protest on Whitehall some disorder took place.\n\n'Officers acted to ensure the disorder was contained.\n\n'Over 100 people have been arrested for offences including violent disorder, assault on an emergency worker, and breach of protest conditions.\n\n'Some officers suffered minor injuries.'\n\nThe protest was promoted by actor Laurence Fox on X, formerly Twitter, on Tuesday.\n\nLONDON: A woman is detained by police officers as people attend the 'Enough is Enough' protest\n\nLONDON: Another woman is pinned to the floor by riot police officers at the protest\n\nLONDON: She was then hauled away by police\n\nLONDON: Another scuffle breaks out as violent scenes went on into the evening in London\n\nLONDON: A protester is pinned to the ground and detained by riot police\n\nLONDON: A group of men started clashing in front of the Wintson Churchill statue\n\nLONDON: A protester is surrounded by riot police in Whitehall\n\nLONDON: Another protester is swiftly dealt with by a group of riot police officers in London\n\nLONDON: People attending the 'Enough is Enough' protest in Parliament Square, London,\n\nLONDON: A man holding a can of beer is led away in handcuffs by riot police\n\nIt comes after Jenni Stancombe, the mother of little Elsie who died in the Southport stabbings, pleaded for the violence to end on social media.\n\nShe said: 'This is the only thing that I will write, but please stop the violence in Southport tonight.\n\n'The police have been nothing but heroic these last 24 hours and they and we don't need this.'\n\nBack in Southport, where the grieving community was clearing up the damage from the riots yesterday, a poster was put up which said: 'Leave our town. We don't need this.'\n\nPolice officers from around the country gathered in Southport in preparation of any disturbances, but the seaside town was unscathed after a shocking night of riots 24 hours prior.\n\nSOUTHPORT: Riot police hold back protesters near a burning police vehicle after disorder broke out on Tuesday night\n\nSOUTHPORT: A police van was set on fire near a mosque in Southport on Tuesday evening as riots broke out\n\nSOUTHPORT: Protesters cheer as they launch bins at riot police vans amid ugly scenes on Tuesday\n\nSOUTHPORT: Police officers from around the country gather in Southport in preparation of any disturbances\n\nSOUTHPORT: There were fears that more violence could break out in Southport\n\nPolice vans, cars and horses were deployed to the town in preparation of any disturbance.\n\nSome 53 officers were injured in Tuesday's violence - which police believe was started by supporters of the far-right EDL group. Four people were arrested after the riots.\n\nA fifth man was also arrested on Wednesday night. It comes after officers were called to a separate domestic incident.\n\nOfficers recognised the man from footage of the disorder in Southport on Tuesday, where it is thought he sustained a head injury.\n\nHe was taken to hospital where he was reported to have racially abused a fellow patient.\n\nThe 39-year-old man from Southport was arrested on suspicion of violent disorder, threats to kill and a racially aggravated public order offence.\n\nHe was taken into custody to be interviewed and conditionally bailed, the force said.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Alex Goss said: 'Our work to identify all those responsible for the despicable violence and aggression seen on the streets of Southport on Tuesday continues.\n\n'We have been inundated with images and footage from members of the public who were outraged at the destruction carried out.\n\n'The individuals involved in the disorder had no regard for the families and friends of those who so tragically lost their lives, and a community in grief.\n\n'It has been heartening today to see the reaction of the whole community, who have pulled together to clean the streets, rebuild walls and re-glaze broken windows.'\n\nThe mayor of the Liverpool City Region, Steve Rotheram, told Sky News earlier that he did not believe violence would break out in Southport for a second night.\n\nAfter riots broke out, Southport locals and builders came together to help repair the mosque walls and clear up.\n\nIbrahim Hussein, the mosque chairman, who was one of eight people trapped inside as rioters hurled missiles at the building, said the community clear up was 'really humbling' and brought tears to his eyes.\n\nHe said the mosque has been here for 30 years with 'no bother at all', adding: 'We love the community and the community loves us.'\n\nMr Hussein described his ordeal as 'terrifying and horrendous' and said there was no reason to target the mosque.\n\nWorshipper Iqbal Ahmed, 32, was also trapped inside. He said rioters were calling the mosque on withheld numbers throughout the night threatening to kill them and their families.\n\nAlong the road, Denise Mace, 51, and her chef husband Graham, 52, had looked on helplessly from upstairs during the riot. 'It was terrifying, absolutely horrendous. We didn't know if they would come into our house,' said Mrs Mace.\n\nThe Malakar family feared their Asian ethnicity could make them a target. They turned off the lights as the mob knocked down their garden wall to grab bricks.\n\nPensioner May Small, 71, watched as yobs came down her path looking for makeshift missiles. 'I told them to clear off,' she said. 'I would like to kick their arse, but you can't, can you?'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

More than 100 people were arrested outside Prime Minister Keir Starmer's official Downing Street residence.\n\nStarmer was to hold an emergency meeting Thursday with police chiefs seeking to quell the unrest.\n\nThe stabbing suspect was remanded in custody during a five-minute appearance at Liverpool magistrate's court. He was to appear at the city's Crown Court later in the day.\n\nThe youth wore a baggy grey tracksuit and black slippers and smiled before he was asked to sit down, according to reporters in the courtroom.\n\nA judge in the Crown Court was to give a further ruling on the youth's detention.\n\nUnrest\n\nThe teenager is accused of murdering Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine.\n\nHe allegedly wounded another eight children and two adults during the frenzied attack that has sparked an outpouring of grief in Southport, a quiet seaside town.\n\nSocial media misinformation about him contributed to violent clashes in Southport on Tuesday night, in which bricks were thrown at a mosque and 53 police officers were injured.\n\nPolice have blamed members of the far-right English Defence League grouping, an Islamophobic organisation founded 15 years ago whose supporters have been linked to football hooliganism.\n\nThe protests spread on Wednesday, including to Downing Street.\n\nProtesters throw bottles at police and shouted, \"We want our country back\" and \"Stop the boats,\" -- the latter a reference to small boats bringing irregular migrants across the Channel.\n\n'Full force of the law'\n\nIn Hartlepool, northeast England, demonstrators set police cars on fire and threw objects at the officers, with police saying eight arrests were made.\n\nHartlepool police said officers faced having \"missiles, glass bottles and eggs being thrown at them, with several suffering minor injuries.\"\n\nAt the meeting with police leaders, Starmer will say the events at Southport \"serve as a reminder of the bravery of our emergency service workers and the vitally important work they do to keep the public safe,\" a statement by the prime minister's office said.\n\nHe will also say that while the right to protest must be protected, \"criminals who exploit that right in order to sow hatred and carry out violent acts will face the full force of the law\".\n\nThe Labour government has vowed to clampdown on crime and antisocial behaviour, with interior minister Yvette Cooper promising policies including ramping up the presence of community police \"in every corner of the country\".\n\nStarmer will tell police leaders \"that they should not hesitate to use their powers to stop mindless violence in its tracks and make sure justice is served,\" the statement said.", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "RFI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type":

This incident was exacerbated by people from outside our community who came here determined to cause unrest. I would like to pay tribute to the brave police officers who worked hard to restore order.\n\n\"There is no justification for disorderly behaviour and the scenes do not represent Aldershot and Farnborough. We all support our shared right to peacefully protest, but we will not stand for people coming into our towns determined to stir up trouble and divide our community.\"\n\nThe contentious protest occurred against a backdrop of national unrest following a tragic knife attack in Southport. But it is unclear if the protest in Hampshire was directly linked.\n\nIn the devastating incident, three young girls - Bebe King, aged six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and nine year old Alice Dasilva Aguiar - lost their lives at a Taylor Swift-themed party in the Merseyside town on Monday.\n\nA teenager is set to face Liverpool City Magistrates' Court on Thursday, facing charges of three counts of murder and 10 counts of attempted murder.\n\nIn a separate event, over 100 individuals were detained during a protest in central London on Wednesday night, which was in response to the Southport killings, as confirmed by the Metropolitan Police.\n\nIn London, a large protest was staged under the title of Enough is Enough, with arrests made after demonstrators clashed with officers in Whitehall on Wednesday. The Metropolitan Police said: \"Over 100 people have been arrested for offences including violent disorder, assault on an emergency worker, and breach of protest conditions. Some officers suffered minor injuries.\"\n\nCleveland Police also said it had made eight arrests for various offences including public order and affray after violence broke out in Hartlepool on Wednesday, with more arrests expected. Road closures have been lifted, but a visible police presence remains in the area, the force said.\n\nChief superintendent David Sutherland said: \"At this stage we believe the protest is in connection with the incident in Southport earlier this week. Our officers are facing missiles, glass bottles and eggs being thrown at them and have made arrests as they remain in the area to protect the safety of those living in the community.\"\n\nIn Manchester, local councillor John Flanagan took to social media to respond to the violence, labelling those involved in the \"sickening\" incident as \"mindless idiots\". \"I'd like to condemn these mindless thugs, attacking innocent men who are asylum seekers.\n\n\"They have been there for months and we have not had any issues or problems. They have been in a place of safety,\" the councillor for Newton Heath said.\n\n\"It's sickening to think they are being targeted because of their race or their religion, and I hope this isn't tied with the disgraceful scenes in Southport where a mosque was attacked last night. These idiots are attacking innocent people. My initial reaction is to contact GMP and support them.\n\n\"The whole of the city and reasonable thinking people will be horrified and sickened by these actions. Idiots is too soft of a word - I hope the police use the full force of the law. We cannot allow our country and our city to descend into anarchy, which seems to be being driven by madness on social media.\"\n\nIt comes after violence erupted in Southport on Tuesday following a vigil for three girls killed in a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club. Police officers in Southport suffered serious injuries when bricks, stones and bottles were thrown and cars were set alight during violent protests.\n\nThe disorder near the town's mosque came after false rumours were circulated online about the suspect. In an effort to avoid a second night of rioting, Merseyside Police were given extra powers, under S60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, on Wednesday to stop and search people suspected of carrying weapons.\n\nCommunity Inspector Doug Chadwick said the public was \"shocked and disappointed\" by the \"disgraceful\" scenes of rioting and called on the public to come forward with information about what they had seen. Five people have been arrested over the unrest so far, which saw 53 officers and three police dogs injured.\n\nThe unrest comes as a 17-year-old boy has been charged with the murders of the three girls. Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, were fatally stabbed on Monday when a knifeman entered the dance class on Hart Street in Southport, Merseyside.\n\nEight other children suffered knife wounds - with five of them in critical condition - while two adults were also critically hurt. The 17-year-old has been remanded in custody to appear on Thursday, August 1, at Liverpool Magistrates Court, Derby Square.\n\nFor more news across Surrey, visit our homepage here.", "source": {"uri":

with the disgraceful scenes in Southport where a mosque was attacked last night.\n\n\"We cannot allow our country and our city to descend into anarchy, which seems to be being driven by madness on social media.\"\n\nIt comes after violence erupted in Southport on Tuesday following a vigil for three girls killed in a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nPolice officers in Southport suffered serious injuries when bricks, stones and bottles were thrown and cars were set alight during violent protests.\n\nIn an effort to avoid a second night of rioting, Merseyside Police were given extra powers, under S60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, on Wednesday to stop and search people suspected of carrying weapons.\n\nCommunity Inspector Doug Chadwick said the public was \"shocked and disappointed\" by the \"disgraceful\" scenes of rioting and called on the public to come forward with information about what they had seen.\n\nFive people have been arrested over the unrest so far, which saw 53 officers and three police dogs injured.\n\nThe unrest comes as a 17-year-old boy has been charged with the murders of the three girls.\n\nAlice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, were fatally stabbed on Monday when a knifeman entered the dance class on Hart Street in Southport, Merseyside.\n\nEight other children suffered knife wounds - with five of them in critical condition - while two adults were also critically hurt.\n\nThe 17-year-old has been remanded in custody to appear on Thursday, August 1, at Liverpool Magistrates Court, Derby Square.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He was to appear at the city's Crown Court later in the day.\n\nThe youth wore a baggy grey tracksuit and black slippers and smiled before he was asked to sit down, according to reporters in the courtroom.\n\nA judge in the Crown Court was to give a further ruling on the youth's detention.\n\n- Unrest -\n\nThe teenager is accused of murdering Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine.\n\nHe allegedly wounded another eight children and two adults during the frenzied attack that has sparked an outpouring of grief in Southport, a quiet seaside

Southport tragedy", "body": "AN inferno ripped through a cop car last night after riots erupted AGAIN in the wake of the Southport tragedy.\n\nBricks were hurled at police who tried to fend off crowds of protestors amid a violent clash in Hartlepool just hours after more than 100 were arrested for similar stand-off at Downing Street.\n\nThe brutality followed the horror that unfolded on Monday at a Merseyside holiday dance class, which left three innocent schoolgirls dead and five more still fighting for their lives.\n\nA boy, 17, was last night charged with the murder of Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe - and 10 counts of attempted murder.\n\nHe will appear at Liverpool City Magistrates' Court today.\n\nBut ahead of the alleged killer being charged, protestors spilled onto the streets of Hartlepool.\n\nHorror footage showed the violent clash at its peak - with cops in riot suits battling to hold the masses at bay.\n\nBricks and bottles were lobbed at the police, as they fought to push the crowds back.\n\nIn another shocking clip a blaze could be seen tearing through a cop car - the second that has been set alight in two days.\n\nA massive bang was heard as its fuel tank went up in flames, eventually leaving the car a charred shell.\n\nSnaps then showed fire crews battling to extinguish the blaze.\n\nCleveland Police confirmed that four people had been arrested for various offences including public order and affray.\n\nSeveral officers suffered injuries after missiles were launched by yobs amid the chaos.\n\nChief Superintendent David Sutherland said on Wednesday night: \"We currently have a high policing presence while officers respond to disorder that is taking place in Hartlepool following a protest that began this evening.\n\n\"At this stage we believe the protest is in connection with the incident in Southport earlier this week.\n\n\"Our officers are facing missiles, glass bottles and eggs being thrown at them and have made arrests as they remain in the area to protect the safety of those living in the community.\n\n\"I want to urge members of the public to stay away from the area.\"\n\nIt came just hours after riots broke out outside Downing Street - seeing flares and bricks hurled near the gates of the Prime Minister's residence.\n\nOne hundred people were arrested with a number of protesters detained as police drove them into Trafalgar Square.\n\nSeveral men were wrestled to the floor and handcuffed as cops managed to slowly get a handle on the situation.\n\nTuesday's riots in Southport saw protesters try and attack a mosque with police vehicles set ablaze.\n\nCops suffered serious injuries when bricks, stones and bottles were thrown in chaotic scenes.\n\nMerseyside Police said more than 50 officers were injured amid the disorder.\n\nThe night prior, riots broke out in Southport.\n\nSpeculation about the alleged attacker's identity circulated online, seeing the tension that already existed after Monday's horrific attack explode.\n\nDespite social media claims, cops stressed that the suspect was born in Cardiff.\n\nThe mum of Elsie Stancombe - one of three victims so far from the attack - had condemned the violence and urged protesters to stop after the riots in her town.\n\nIn a message widely shared online, Jenni Stancombe said: \"This is the only thing that I will write, but please stop the violence in Southport tonight.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jane_matthews@thesun.co.uk", "name":

However, it descended into violence as far-Right protesters clashed with riot police.\n\nCrowds launched flares and bottles towards police while chanting songs including \"England til I die\" and \"we want our country back\". When the protest deadline passed, officers swept in to make dozens of arrests.\n\nElsewhere in Hartlepool, footage shows lines of riot police forming in the street to face down protesters.\n\nSocial media reports claimed protesters hurled missiles at the police on Murray street in the centre of town as they attempted to make their way towards a Mosque in the area.\n\nThe Northern Echo reported that men in balaclavas were seen hitting police with wooden bats as waves of protesters clashed with officers.\n\nHartlepool MP Jonathan Brash said he was \"deeply concerned\" and called for calm as tensions between gathering crowds and officers in riot gear threatened to boil over.\n\nHe posted on X, formerly Twitter: \"I'm deeply concerned about the situation that is developing in Hartlepool this evening.\n\n\"I will be meeting with police to discuss the response to this incident and would urge calm to allow our emergency services to do their job.\n\n\"These events do not represent what Hartlepool is or the values that our people hold.

We'll be back tomorrow to bring you any further updates as they emerge.\n\nKey moments from today:\n\nAs darkness descends on Whitehall, 10 arrests were made.\n\nHowever, a further five protesters were permitted to disperse without being reprimanded.\n\nAll of the remaining protesters are to be arrested, a senior police source on the ground has told The Telegraph.\n\nThere are approximately 80 men and women remaining on Whitehall.\n\nThey are surrounded by police, who the source said plan to arrest them all.\n\nOfficers believe they have had sufficient notice to disperse.\n\nThe arrests are likely to take some time because of the need to get enough vehicles to the scene to take them all away.\n\nPolice officers from around the country have gathered in Southport this evening in preparation for any unrest after riots broke out on Tuesday night.\n\nElsewhere in Hartlepool, footage shows lines of riot police forming in the street to face down protesters.\n\nPolice have now cleared a large area where protesters had been congregating and separated them into smaller groups.\n\nApproximately one hundred protesters remain, down from a peak of several hundred. Those who have left have either done so voluntarily or been arrested.\n\nOfficers are periodically rushing in to detain those who remain one at a time.\n\nA section 35 dispersal order of the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act is also now in place, meaning protesters must now leave the area.\n\nAnother significant number of arrests are now being made.\n\nAt least 10 protesters are being walked away from the scene.\n\nThe deadline for the protest ending has now passed, meaning those still present are in breach of public order restrictions.\n\nMore riot police are pouring into Whitehall, with protesters scuttling to break out as arrests are made.\n\nThe wall of officers surrounding the protesters is gradually tightening as groups of two or three riot police rush in to seize individuals and take them away.\n\nThe 8.30pm deadline for the protest ending set by police has now been reached.\n\nRiot officers are now moving in and appear poised to divide and trap the protesters, enabling potential arrests.\n\nA large number of protesters have now fled from the scene towards Trafalgar Square after police attempted to trap them behind metal fences.\n\nThe police appear to be attempting to separate the crowd into separate groups.\n\nA police helicopter is now flying overhead.\n\nPolice appeared to erroneously attempt to arrest Martin Daubney, the GB News presenter.\n\nFootage of the incident shows the broadcaster surrounded by police.\n\nMr Daubney was released from his cuffs when he presented ID proving he was a member of the press.\n\nThe Met Police has been approached for comment.\n\nThe protest had quietened down in the last 15 minutes.\n\nA number of influencers present have been filming videos to camera.\n\nBut there has suddenly been a bit of pushing back and forth against barriers.\n\nProtest leaders then escaped the police cordon by jumping over a wall, prompting the detention of three demonstrator.\n\n\"Stay back now,\" officers shouted as they wielded batons.\n\nThe Met Police has made multiple arrests close to the Cenotaph on Whitehall.\n\nVideo livestreamed from the scene shows multiple people being frog marched away from the scene of the protest by officers dressed in riot gear.\n\nIn several instances, protesters appear to have been taken to the floor before handcuffed and led away.\n\nChants of \"Oh Tommy Tommy, Tommy Tommy Tommy Tommy Robinson,\" can be heard echoing down Whitehall.\n\nProtest leaders have left the metal barriers, with police making no attempt to stop them walking over directly in front of the Downing Street security gates.\n\nOther demonstrators are also starting to move around more freely.\n\nPolice were then deployed to push the leaders back away from the Downing Street gates.\n\n\"Save our kids,\" the protesters chanted.\n\nThe protest -- numbering several hundred people -- has moved again, this time back towards the cordoned off area directly opposite Downing Street where the Met originally planned to restrict them.\n\nProtest leaders pointed to a cardboard placard reading \"we will not be silenced\" in red paint which also featured handprints.\n\nGlass bottles were then thrown, to cheers from the crowd, as protesters tried to break out from behind metal barriers. Riot police were deployed to stop them doing so.\n\nSerious violence has just erupted at the protest as demonstrators attempted to push against a line of riot police.\n\nCans of drink were thrown as scuffles broke out between the demonstrators and riot police.\n\nThe protesters are now marching away from outside Downing Street to the Houses of Parliament.\n\nThey have walked down Whitehall and across the road to the front of Parliament.\n\nChants of \"England til I die\" have resumed, as well as \"we want our country back\".\n\nThis is well outside the restricted area set out by the Met.\n\nOfficers are attempting to encircle the protesters and keep them away from the front of Parliament.\n\nA pro-Ukrainian protest stands silently on Parliament Square as the demonstrators congregate.\n\nTwo pyros have now been thrown towards Downing Street, including one which cleared the security gates.\n\nThe man responsible for throwing the pyro was then restrained on the ground by eight officers and taken away.\n\nThe crowd proceeded to chant \"Oh, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy Tommy Tommy Robinson\".\n\nPolicing minister Dame Diana Johnson has said the \"thugs and hooligans\" involved in violence in Southport \"must be held to account for their actions\".\n\nDame Diana wrote on X, formerly Twitter: \"This is shocking to hear from a chief constable that so many of her officers were injured in the line of duty last night.\n\n\"The thugs and hooligans involved must be held to account for their actions on the streets of Southport yesterday.\"\n\nThe Home Office minister had shared a video clip featuring Merseyside Police Chief Constable Serena Kennedy, who told broadcasters that officers who dealt with riots on Tuesday were \"some of the first responders who attended that awful scene on Monday and then were faced with that level of violence\".\n\nThe Metropolitan Police has vowed that \"any disorder will be dealt with swiftly\" at a hard-Right protest taking place outside Downing Street in the wake of the murders and subsequent riots in Southport.\n\nConditions imposed under section 14 of the Public Order Act mean demonstrators taking part in the Enough Is Enough rally in central London at 7pm have to stay within the immediate vicinity of the entrance gate and must leave by 8.30pm.\n\nAny protesters who breach the conditions could be arrested.\n\nThe event has been promoted by Tommy Robinson and actor Laurence Fox on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nSupt Neil Holyoak, who is leading the policing of the protest, said: \"I urge everyone to exercise their right to protest calmly and within the law. Any disorder will be dealt with swiftly.\"\n\nAfter a day of horror and a night of chaos, the bright, clear sunshine of a new morning showed the humanity of a seaside town.\n\nIn Southport on Tuesday, just hours after more than 1,000 people had attended an evening vigil to remember the young victims of a deadly knife rampage at a children's dance class on Monday, violence swept into this normally safe, cheerful seaside town. Bus-loads of thugs assaulted police officers, intimidated locals, and damaged homes, businesses and a mosque.\n\nIt was, as local artist Tony Wynne puts it, \"a disgraceful hijacking of our tragedy, and a failed attempt to divide us\". The largely masked rioters, who scarpered in the small hours, their convoys of vehicles witnessed leaving Southport by sickened residents, had left a trail of ruin down the Sussex Road area. Scorch marks on the pavement where flaming wheelie bins landed; garden walls kicked down to free bricks that could be hurled at the police; cars scratched and dented; a mosque's windows smashed.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nThe English Defence League (EDL) could be proscribed as a terror organisation in the wake of riots in Southport, Angela Rayner has suggested, writes Charles Hymas.\n\nSupporters of the EDL were blamed for the violence on Tuesday night, in which police officers were attacked with rocks and a police van set on fire.\n\nMs Rayner, the Deputy Prime Minister, said: \"We have laws and we have proscribed groups and we do look at that and it is reviewed regularly.\n\n\"So I'm sure that that will be something that the Home Secretary [Yvette Cooper] will be looking at as part of the normal course of what we do and the intelligence that we have.\n\n\"But I think the bigger issue is about taking on the minority of people that have got thuggish behaviour, that actually that's not our British values.\"\n\nRead the full report here.\n\nA Southport resident has started a GoFundMe raising nearly \u00a31,000 to help \"restore the safe space\" of Muslims after the local mosque was vandalised during raids in the area on Tuesday.\n\nPhoenix Lawson, 20, said: \"It is the only mosque in Southport. It is the only place they can pray peacefully and it's just been destroyed unfortunately.\"\n\n\"I was informed that three panels of the window of the mosque was destroyed and smashed in, and also the brick wall outside was completely demolished.\n\n\"It's a very unsafe environment for a lot of Muslims now. Friday prayer is two days away and there's been a massive raid outside the mosque. I don't think they're going to want to go there as of now.\"\n\nShe added the stabbing attack at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club on Monday and the riots a day later has been a \"big shock\" for the Southport community.\n\n\"It's scary. Everything is quiet in Southport nothing really goes on here. You don't really care about nighttime or robberies but to have three murders and then massive riots to happen in space in two days is a big shock,\" she said.\n\nMerseyside Police have condemned the \"despicable\" actions of protesters for the \"disrespect\" shown to grieving families and the Southport community.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Jenny Sims said: \"I know the wider community is as shocked as we are about the abhorrent events of last night.\n\n\"We have been overwhelmed with messages of thanks from the community, and I know I speak on behalf of all those officers there last night when I say how grateful we all are for their support.\"\n\nShe added: \"The wanton violence and destruction we saw is the very last thing the people of Southport need having been rocked by the awful events of Monday. The disrespect toward grieving families and the community is despicable, and I want to reassure residents in Southport that we will have a significantly increased police presence in the town in the coming days.\n\n\"We would appeal to anyone who has information or video footage of those involved in this shocking behaviour to come forward so we can identify and arrest those responsible.\"\n\nMerseyside police have made four arrests after 53 officers were injured in clashes with \"despicable\" protesters in Southport last night.\n\nDemonstrators swarmed around Southport's mosque, hurling bottles, bricks and wheelie bins at officers, who huddled behind riot shields in an attempt to diffuse tensions which had boiled over following Monday's stabbing.\n\nOf those wounded, eight were hospitalised with injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and concussion. Three police dogs were also hurt.\n\nThe force has issued an appeal for footage and information after three men were arrested on suspicion of violent disorder. A fourth was arrested on suspicion of affray and possession of a bladed article.\n\nOfficers have been granted enhanced powers to stop and search suspects in the area and to seize items used in acts of anti-social behaviour.\n\nQuestions have been raised about why the identity of the teenager arrested over the Southport stabbings has not been made public.\n\nDetectives have been given more time to question the 17-year-old over the incident and he remains in custody after being detained on suspicion of murder and attempted murder. No charges have been brought.\n\nAt this stage, the boy has not been identified because of his age amid active ongoing criminal proceedings.\n\nThe criminal age of responsibility in England and Wales is 10 years old, meaning children aged between 10 and 17 can be arrested and taken to court if they commit a crime.\n\nThe identity of defendants and witnesses under the age of 18 who are subject to criminal proceedings in youth courts is protected by automatic reporting restrictions under Section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933.\n\nIf a child is charged with an offence and is facing criminal proceedings in adult courts - magistrates' and crown courts - then magistrates and judges have legal powers to grant anonymity to a child defendant, witness or victim under Section 45 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999.\n\nBoth of these laws ban the press from publishing a child defendant's name or any detail which could lead to them being identified while the reporting restrictions remain in place.\n\nThis is why media reports sometimes say they cannot identify a child involved in a criminal court case for legal reasons.\n\nSerena Kennedy, Merseyside Police Chief Constable, said three people were arrested on Tuesday night.\n\nShe said: \"Our priority was to try and keep the communities of Southport safe and also to make sure officers remained safe.\n\n\"Three arrests were made, however more will follow. It's impossible to say (how many will be arrested). It's really early days in the investigation.\"\n\nShe estimated 200 to 300 people were involved.\n\nShe said: \"Initially, there were about 70 people who made their way away from the vigil and were making their way towards the mosque.\n\n\"They suddenly became about 200 in number and then others joined that number.\"\n\nAngela Rayner has criticised social media users spreading \"untruths\" about the Southport stabbing.\n\nThe Deputy Prime Minister made the remarks after the suspect being held in custody over the deaths of three young girls was falsely identified online as an asylum seeker.\n\nMs Rayner also condemned \"disgraceful\" scenes in Southport on Tuesday night as hundreds of demonstrators clashed with police, throwing bricks, masonry and fireworks at officers.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nSerena Kennedy, Chief Constable of Merseyside, said seeing officers' injuries following the riots in Southport was devastating.\n\nShe said the injuries included broken bones, cuts and concussion, but said none of the officers were in critical condition.\n\nMs Kennedy said: \"Being at Southport police station last night and seeing the officers being brought in from the street with their injuries was just devastating.\"\n\nShe said it was a \"fast-moving investigation and it's progressing well\".\n\nSerena Kennedy, Merseyside Chief Constable, said she understood the communities in Southport were \"really worried\" about \"are we going to see this again tonight\".\n\nShe said: \"We are absolutely planning for this evening and for the weekend ahead.\n\n\"We are being really well supported by police forces across the North West to make sure we have got sufficient resources so that we don't see a repeat of last night.\"\n\nAsked about the resources deployed on Tuesday, Ms Kennedy said: \"We were well prepared and had sufficient resources. However, the people who turned up last night were bolstered very quickly and it very quickly escalated and we did have to call on mutual aid.\"\n\nThe chief constable, who was speaking at the scene of the disorder, said 54 officers were injured, including 49 from Merseyside Police and four from Lancashire.\n\nSteve Rotheram, Metro mayor of Liverpool, said: \"What we saw last night was infiltration by people from all over the country, stirred up by social media and then whipped up into a frenzy whereby they were attacking the very people that everybody earlier in the day was celebrating for being the heroes, for running towards danger.\n\n\"It leaves a very sour taste in the mouth that these people believe they can come here and divide our community.\n\n\"They won't be doing that and the haters won't win out.\"\n\nHe added: \"It's too easy for people with nefarious intent to go online and to say things that aren't factual and then for people to believe those things and really I think anybody who listens or watches anything online should do it with a large dose of salt.\"\n\nThe Government must come down \"hard and fast\" on rioters and online misinformation following clashes in Southport, James Cleverly has said.\n\nThe shadow home secretary said: \"The violence we have seen in Southport is an insult to the memory of the victims of this heinous attack.\n\n\"These are not protesters fighting injustice, they are thugs fighting the police, tearing up a community that is already trying to process an unimaginable horror. They must be met with the full force of the law.\n\n\"People will understandably want to know how and why something so awful could have happened, but getting the right answers will take time. While we give the police space and time to do their job, we must have no truck with those spreading disinformation and fuelling conspiracy.\n\n\"The police, the Home Secretary and the Government must come down on this hard and fast.\n\n\"As home secretary I took a clear and firm stance on protesters and civil disorder, and went to America to ensure the tech companies properly understood that the UK government expected them to step up to stop the spread of disinformation. They must do so now. We all have a duty to honour truth, respect our police, and check before we share.\"\n\nNigel Farage should not \"stir up these fake news online\" about the reasons behind the Southport knife attack, Angela Rayner has said.\n\nThe Deputy Prime Minister told LBC Radio that, as an MP, Mr Farage has \"a level of responsibility\", \"and it's not to stoke up what conspiracy theories or what you think might have happened\".\n\n\"There's a responsibility to say the police are doing a difficult job, local authorities, all of the services that are on the ground.\n\n\"We have a responsibility to hold the community together and say let's get the facts, and then let's look at what the actual solutions are and what we can do about the horrific situation that we find ourselves in, not to stir up these fake news online.\"\n\nMs Rayner added that it is \"really painful\" for people caught up in the trauma to \"see online that what's happened to them is somehow been debated\".\n\nConor Stringer, Senior Reporter, speaks outside the mosque which was at the centre of a violent riot in Southport last night.\n\nA group of around 100 members of the community are repairing damage to the local mosque following a riot in Southport.\n\nA number of tradesmen have reportedly given their time and resources for free, while a glazing company has also offered free window repairs.\n\nOn The Spot News reports that one of the volunteers said: \"We're fixing the damage that these scumbags did.\"\n\nIbrahim Hussein, the Southport mosque chairman, said: \"I would like to thank the police very, very, very much indeed.\n\n\"I'm very sorry for the casualties that the police took. They took a very bad beating. I would love to make it better but there's nothing I can do about it.\"\n\n\"But I would like to thank them for their support because at one point we thought they (the rioters) were coming in and they were going to burn the place down.\"\n\nMr Hussein said the mosque was open and added: \"I will pray for the whole of Southport, I will pray for the victims of the awful attack on Monday, I will pray for the police and I will pray for the whole community to stay as beautiful as it has always been.\"\n\nHe said the Muslim community still felt vulnerable, adding he had seen messages the day before indicating something was going to happen.\n\nDetectives have been granted more time to question the 17-year-old arrested on suspicion of the knife attack in Southport.\n\nThe teenager, who has not been named because of his age, remains in custody having been arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder following a knife attack in which three young girls were killed.\n\nAlice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Bebe King, six were fatally stabbed in Southport on Monday while attending a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nEight other children suffered knife wounds and five are in a critical condition, alongside two adults who were also critically injured.\n\nAfter the first 48 hours, police can apply for permission from magistrates to hold a suspect for up to a total of 96 hours without charge.\n\nIbrahim Hussein, Southport mosque chairman, said he was trapped in the building with about eight others as the riot erupted in Southport on Tuesday.\n\nHe said he only escaped at about midnight with a police guard. Mr Hussein told reporters on Wednesday: \"It was terrifying. It was absolutely, awful, horrendous.\n\n\"We couldn't understand this viciousness that was going on, and even the police were taking a hammering from this lot.\"\n\nAsked if he thought the far-Right had hijacked his town, Mr Hussein said: \"Naturally. This is a beautiful town.\n\n\"We've lived here 30 years, no bother at all. We love this community. The community loves us. We don't have any issues.\"\n\nHe added of the disorder on Tuesday night: \"I'm feeling drained. Where did that come from and why and what has this got to do with us?\"\n\nA card signed from the local police which was left among floral tributes in Southport read: \"Keep dancing, keep smiling, beautiful angels. In our thoughts. Local policing team.\"\n\nFarnborough Road School has paid tribute to their former student Elsie Dot Stancombe near the scene in Southport. A message from the school read:\n\nHumza Yousaf, Scotland's former first minister, has called for the English Defence League (EDL) to be proscribed under terrorism laws following the riot in Southport.\n\nMerseyside Police said they believe the group, which threw bricks at a mosque in the seaside town following a knife attack which killed three girls on Monday, was made up of EDL supporters.\n\nIn a letter to Yvette Cooper, the Home Secretary, Mr Yousaf claimed \"Britain has a far-Right problem\", urging her to use anti-terrorism powers to make membership of the group illegal.\n\n\"It is time we took on the English Defence League and the evil ideology that drives them,\" he wrote.\n\n\"One of the immediate steps, in your gift as Home Secretary, is to proscribe the English Defence League, and their proxies, under the Terrorism Act 2000.\"\n\nHe added that such action would not provide an \"overnight fix\", but would demonstrate the Government's intention to be \"proactive in tackling far-Right violence and terror that has been allowed to run rampant in the streets of the UK for far too long\".\n\nThe Green Party has condemned the rioting by \"fascist thugs\" in Southport.\n\nAmanda Onwuemene, the party's spokesperson for policing and domestic safety, said: \"The far-Right is using disinformation around the horrific murders of children in Southport to do what it always does: spread hatred and fear.\n\n\"The attacks on a mosque and police by fascist thugs yesterday are an appalling violation of a community that has already suffered a devastating blow.\n\n\"The Green Party condemns this violence and stands in solidarity with the people of Southport against those who seek to divide it.\"\n\nA mob of hundreds of people in Southport used the \"death of three little kiddies\" for their \"own political purposes\", the MP for the Merseyside town has said.\n\nPatrick Hurley accused \"beered-up thugs\" of disrespecting the families of three girls, aged six, seven and nine, who were killed in a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club on Monday.\n\nAround 200 protesters clashed with police in Southport on Tuesday night, damaging cars in a mosque car park and hurling bricks, fireworks and masonry at police officers.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nA mother and child lay floral tributes for the victims of the knife attack in Southport.\n\nThe mother of a victim in the Southport stabbing has condemned violence that broke out at a protest last night.\n\nA mob gathered outside a mosque on Tuesday following a knife attack on children attending a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club where three young girls were killed, with demonstrators throwing bricks, masonry and fireworks at officers.\n\nJenni Stancombe, the mother of seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe, who died on Monday, appealed on social media for the violence to end. She said: \"The police have been nothing but heroic these last 24 hours and they and we don't need this.\" Ms Stancombe added: \"This is the only thing that I will write, but please stop the violence in Southport tonight.\"\n\nA 17-year-old youth from the village of Banks, five miles away from Southport was arrested on Monday afternoon on suspicion of murder and attempted murder and remains in police custody. The violence broke out amid claims that the police were not telling the truth about the suspect's background and his motives, with rumours swirling on social media.\n\nEarlier, a vigil was held to remember the three girls who were killed with six-year-old Bebe King and nine-year-old Alice Dasilva Aguiar also named as victims.\n\nViolent protests broke out in Southport last night as hundreds of demonstrators clashed with police following a knife attack on children attending a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nSmoke billowed from the scene after a police van was set on fire and a number of officers were injured.\n\nAngela Rayner has criticised social media users for spreading \"untruths\" online over the Southport knife attack after riots broke out in the town overnight.\n\nRiots erupted outside a mosque on Tuesday after three young girls were killed while attending a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nPatrick Hurley, the MP for Southport, blamed misinformation on social media for violent scenes in which demonstrators threw bricks, masonry and fireworks at officers in his constituency.\n\nThe suspect in the attack had previously been falsely identified online as an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK in a small boat, while unsubstantiated claims circulated that he was on an MI6 watch-list.\n\nSpeaking on ITV's This Morning Ms Rayner said: \"I think there's been a couple of instances recently where, especially particularly online, where theories and things are whipped up, whereas actually it turns out to be not true or not the full picture.\"\n\nShe added: \"Speculation and some of the untruths that have been put around social media, not only create tensions and fear in the community, but it's disrespectful to families who maybe want those answers that haven't got those answers.\"\n\nShe added that it is \"really unhelpful for the police\" and \"my plea is that we all need to step back and just wait and then that information will come but allow the police to do their work\".\n\nJess Phillips has accused Nigel Farage of \"grifting\" in a row over his response to the Southport killings.\n\nThe Reform leader claimed in a social media video that important questions about the deadly knife attack on children at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club remained unanswered. Mr Farage speculated whether the \"truth is being withheld\" about the killing of three girls aged six, seven and nine, following social media rumours.\n\nMs Phillips, a minister at the Home Office, accused Mr Farage of acting in bad faith after he missed a statement by Yvette Cooper, the Home Secretary, in the Commons on Tuesday.\n\nIn a post on X, formerly Twitter, Ms Phillips said: \"Nigel Farage could yesterday have had the questions, he claims are unanswered, answered, if he had bothered to turn up to Parliament and ask them during the statement on the incidents in Southport. He didn't turn up, he grifted instead.\"\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nLocal business owners have said riots are the \"opposite of what Southport is about\" as they deliver free coffee to those cleaning up after the riots.\n\nGavin Williams, 37 and James Kennedy, 37, owners of Cove coffee shop, arrived at the mosque giving out free coffee.\n\n\"The Cove is all about wellness and community, it's the least we could do,\" said Mr Williams.\n\n\"It's horrendous, absolutely horrendous. It's just not what the community is about at all, it's the opposite of what Southport is about.\n\n\"It was just harrowing to see that mum put that post out calling for calm. To feel the need to do that when she's grieving, it's just horrendous.\"\n\nJenni Stancombe, the mother of seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe, who died on Monday, appealed on social media for the violence to end.\n\nAn injured police officer is seen with blood on his face after a riot broke out in Southport on Tuesday.\n\nNigel Farage said \"it's perfectly reasonable to ask what is happening to law and order\" in response to criticism from Brendan Cox.\n\nThe husband of murdered MP Jo Cox told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the Reform UK leader \"whipped up\" rioters in Southport in a social media video.\n\nMr Farage said in response: \"[That's an] absolutely disgraceful comment, [I did] nothing of the kind.\n\n\"I merely expressed a sense of sadness and concern that is being felt by absolutely everybody I know - what the hell is going on? It started off the week before in Kent, when a Lieutenant Colonel in full military uniform is stabbed in the street and I was told that Kent Police wanted to play the incident down. I got that on the highest level.\n\n\"So I think it's quite legitimate to ask questions as to what the hell is going on.\n\n\"And then of course we had Southend at the same time with machete gangs fighting in the streets... I think it's perfectly reasonable to ask what is happening to law and order in our country. And who are the perpetrators? Why? Very legitimate questions I was asking, and to conflate that with EDL or anybody else, frankly, it's desperate stuff.\"\n\nAsked about Mr Cox saying he is \"nothing better than Tommy Robinson in a suit\", the Clacton MP added: \"The comment is beneath contempt.\"\n\nBrendan Cox, the husband of murdered MP Jo Cox, said: \"The fact that Nigel Farage whipped up that crowd, whipped up that sentiment, I think should make us all reconsider in what basket we put him.\n\n\"For me, it puts him on the wrong side of the line, not a credible politician, but someone willing to use awful events and hatred and undermine the community, the communities in which we live.\"\n\nBrendan Cox, the husband of murdered MP Jo Cox, has said Nigel Farage is \"nothing better than Tommy Robinson in a suit\" after his comments about the Southport stabbings.\n\nIn a social media video, Mr Farage said: \"I obviously join everybody in my horror at what has happened. I know the Prime Minister went to lay flowers and was heckled, and it shows you how unhappy the public are with the state of law and order in our country.\n\n\"I have to say there are one or two questions. Was this guy being monitored by the security services? Some reports say he was, others less sure.\n\n\"The police say it's a non-terror incident, just as they said the stabbing of an Army Lieutenant Colonel in uniform on the streets of Kent the other day was a non-terror incident.\n\n\"I just wonder whether the truth is being withheld from us. I don't know the answer to that, but I think it is a fair and legitimate question.\"\n\nReacting to the comments, Mr Cox told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"It's right out of the Trump playbook, and in my view it makes Nigel Farage nothing better than a Tommy Robinson in a suit.\n\n\"It is beyond the pale to use a moment like this to spread your narrative and to spread your hatred, and we saw the results on Southport's streets last night.\"\n\nTobias Ellwood, the former MP, has accused Nigel Farage of deliberately enflaming tensions after the Southport stabbings.\n\nReplying to the Reform UK leader's video commenting on the attack, which was posted on X, formerly Twitter, he wrote: \"I lost my brother to terrorism.\n\n\"To ramp up hatred online by claiming the Southport attack was terrorist related (culminating in riots, a mosque damaged and 27 police injured) is not just reprehensible but needs addressing. Otherwise it will happen again.\n\n\"Disgusted how a sitting MP deliberately enflames tensions without any justification.\n\n\"Farage should delete this tweet.\"\n\nA shopkeeper whose store was targeted by looters described the riot in Southport as a \"war scene\".\n\nChanaka Balasuriya, 47, said protesters stole around \u00a310,000 worth of cigarettes and alcohol. He said it was \"terrible\" to helplessly watch thieves break into his shop on CCTV, which he has owned for four years.\n\nMr Balasuriya said: \"I called 999 and asked for help. They said they would try their best to come and help. It took 10-12 minutes for them to break the glass.\n\n\"They came as a group. They tried quite hard and then the glass broke. Then they tried to break the shutters. Then I saw my cardboard bin, it was set on fire. I called 999 again and said 'listen, there's a lady upstairs, please come and help'.\n\n\"Unfortunately my kids were lolling as well, they were screaming and crying. This is my everything. It was like a war scene last night.\"\n\nSir Andy Marsh, College of Policing Chief Constable, has paid tribute to the victims of the Southport attack and called the subsequent riots \"disgusting\". He said:\n\nA man was hit in the privates by a brick which was thrown toward police officers during riots in Southport.\n\nDozens of residents turned up outside Southport mosque with brushes and shovels to help with the clean-up operation on Wednesday morning.\n\nNorman Wallis, chief executive of Southport Pleasureland, who was helping at the junction of Sussex Road and St Luke's Road, said it was partly in response to a social media plea he put out after witnessing the violence on Tuesday evening.\n\nMr Wallis said: \"There are hundreds of people who have responded, and we've ended up with lots of people down here today, all from the local community and helping with the fantastic clean-up.\"\n\nHe added: \"It's horrendous what those hooligans have done last night. It was like a war scene. People from out of town just causing absolute mayhem.\n\n\"People in hoods climbing up lampposts, throwing bricks, they set a police car on fire. But none of those people were the people of Southport. The people of Southport are the ones here today cleaning the mess up.\n\n\"Those people from out of town - they came in in buses and cars and had change of clothes. They just started to riot and do this.\"\n\nDozens of police have been injured in violent clashes after a mob of protesters gathered outside a mosque in Southport, hurling bricks, masonry and fireworks at officers.\n\nFootage of the protest posted on social media showed a police van engulfed in flames, as demonstrators attacked officers who hurdled together with riot shields.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nLuis Montenegro, the Portuguese prime minister, has sent his condolences to the families of victims in the Southport attack.\n\nMr Montenegro said: \"It is with deep sadness that I received the news on the attack that took place yesterday in Southport in the United Kingdom, for which I have no words to describe.\n\n\"On my behalf and that of the Portuguese government I express heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims and to the British government and people.\"\n\nA spokesman for the Madeiran regional government said in a statement yesterday: \"It was with great sadness that the Regional Government of Madeira learned of the death of nine-year-old Alice Aguiar, the daughter of Madeirans, following the attack on a dance centre in Southport, UK.\n\n\"The Regional Government, through the Regional Directorate for Communities and External Cooperation (DRCCE), sends a heartfelt hug to the parents and its deepest condolences to the bereaved family.\"\n\nAlice Aguiar's heartbroken parents are \"not speaking, only crying\" after the stabbing in Southport on Monday, according to relatives.\n\nGraca Freitas, the child's aunt whose brother David is Alice's father, said: \"We're constantly calling and David picks up.\n\n\"But he only cries, he doesn't talk. It's the same with his wife.\"\n\nAdmitting she still hadn't come to terms with what had happened, Ms Freitas told a local paper in her native Madeira where Alice's parents migrated to the UK from: \"I found out about the scale of the tragedy on Monday from the TV.\n\n\"But I only found out about Alice yesterday morning.\n\n\"I began to cry uncontrollably. I'm in agony.\"\n\nLast night a vigil was held to remember the three girls who were killed in Southport on Monday.\n\nSix year-old Bebe King, seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe and nine-year-old Alice Dasilva Aguiar were stabbed to death while attending a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nSir Jacob Rees-Mogg said the Prime Minister \"got the tone absolutely right\" in his response to the Southport attacks.\n\nThe former Conservative MP, who lost his seat at the general election, told Times Radio the unrest on Tuesday night was a \"perverse\" response to the tragedy.\n\n\"I actually think the Prime Minister got the tone absolutely right yesterday talking about just how upsetting this is,\" Sir Jacob said.\n\n\"He spoke as a father and anyone as a father just mourns so deeply when you see those pictures of those three little children who were just so brutally murdered. The idea that anyone would want to respond to it by rioting seems to me to be perverse.\"\n\nDeclining to criticise his GB News colleague Nigel Farage, who leads Reform and questioned whether the truth about the stabbings was being \"withheld\", Sir Jacob said: \"We obviously have to wait and see what all the information is.\n\n\"I think jumping to conclusions on what has happened until one knows is not wise. I'm not going to jump to conclusions. This is just the most awful tragedy and this is a time for mourning the dead and mourning the victims.\"\n\nViolence flared in Southport last night when hundreds of demonstrators, believed to be supporters of the English Defence League, hurled bricks at police after converging on a mosque and smashing its windows.\n\nIt comes after false information spread online about the alleged identity of a 17-year-old arrested for stabbing three children to death at a dance class in the town.\n\nFootage shows a residential road in the aftermath of riots in Southport.\n\nA mob gathered outside a mosque on Tuesday following a knife attack on children attending a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club where three young girls were killed, with demonstrators throwing bricks, masonry and fireworks at officers.\n\nPolice officers should be going home, not to hospital, the Chair of Merseyside Police Federation has said.\n\nChris McGlade, Chair of Merseyside Police Federation, said: \"The very same courageous officers who are themselves trying to come to terms with what has happened in Southport this week came under a sustained and vicious attack last night.\n\n\"It is utterly disgusting that more than 50 police officers were injured. Brave colleagues have been left with fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and concussion.\n\n\"I utterly condemn the actions of these mindless and violent thugs - and they will be brought to justice for their actions.\n\n\"Police officers are not robots. We are mothers and fathers. Sons and daughters. Husbands, wives and partners.\n\n\"We should be going home at the end of our shifts. Not to hospital.\"\n\nPatrick Hurley, the MP for Southport, said police intelligence suggested the \"vast majority\" of those responsible for violence last night were \"from out of town\".\n\nIn an interview with Times Radio, the new Labour MP condemned the violence targeted against police as 39 officers were injured and 27 taken to hospital.\n\n\"The issue is that the police they were attacking last night, the police vans they were attacking, they were the very same first responders and the very same emergency services that had gone through possibly the most traumatic day of their entire lives the day before when they had to deal with the immediate aftermath of the little girls being killed.\"\n\nResponding to Sir Keir Starmer being heckled when he visited to pay his respects, he said: \"There's not a single thing that the Prime Minister, that Keir Starmer, has done in the last three weeks where he's been in the role that has led to the stabbings that we saw on Monday.\n\n\"There's not a single thing that a person in a position of authority has done that anyone can justify being called 'liars' and 'traitors' and all of these things on social media. This is a swirling morass on social media of lies and propaganda and people being given the platform to say the most vile of things in the most vile of circumstances.\"\n\nThe MP for Southport has blamed misinformation on social media for violent scenes in the town last night, saying fake news about the killing of three girls had a \"real world impact\".\n\nRussian state media were among those falsely identifying the suspect as an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat last year.\n\nAsked why violent protests broke out, Patrick Hurley told Times Radio: \"Precisely because of the propaganda and the lies that were being spread around on social media from within minutes of the news breaking on Monday afternoon.\n\n\"We'd had all sorts of lies being spread and misinformation being spread about the alleged perpetrator and some people with the best of intentions, then they try to rebut this they tried to argue back, but all that happens is you're just amplifying people's false messaging.\n\n\"And what we saw then 24 hours from Monday afternoon to yesterday afternoon, this misinformation doesn't just exist on people's internet browsers and on people's phones, it has real world impact.\n\n\"The real impact of that was we had hundreds of people descending on the town, descending on Southport, intent on causing trouble, either because they believe what they have written, or they are bad faith factors who wrote it in the first place intent on causing community division.\"\n\nMatthew Pennycook, a housing minister, labelled violent scenes in Southport overnight \"absolutely appalling\" and \"completely despicable\".\n\nThe Labour frontbencher told Sky News: \"We have had 22 officers now injured, seen reports of vehicles belonging to members of the public set on fire, bricks and fireworks thrown at a mosque.\n\n\"I think it is absolutely appalling if I am honest.\n\n\"The community in Southport is reeling from the horrific events two days ago. From what I can see they are trying to come together to support each other, to care for the families of the loved ones who have been killed and to have their space for them to process the trauma, to grieve, overshadowed by this violence and disorder I think is completely despicable.\"\n\nA Labour MP has called the rioters outside a mosque in Southport \"utterly reprehensible\".\n\nPatrick Hurley, the Labour MP for Southport, told BBC Radio 4 Today Programme: \"The town is reeling. You can imagine that yesterday was a very emotional day for so many people in Southport. We had a vigil with thousands of people paying their respects in a peaceful fashion and just having a space and a place where they can express their emotions.\"\n\nHe added: \"And then within an hour, an hour and a half, we also had this horrific riots. There's no other word to describe it. It was led by people from outside of town. These were thugs who got the train in. These were not people from Southport. They were using the deaths of three little kiddies for their own political purposes and to attack the very same first responders and the very same police who had been on the scene on Monday.\"\n\nMr Hurley added: \"There's no way to describe that other than to say it's utterly reprehensible and we must identify these people and make sure that the full force of the law is down against them.\"\n\nResidents commence clean-up operation in Southport following riots last night.\n\nCouncillor Mike Salmon, who saw the violence happening outside his home on Tuesday, told BBC Radio Merseyside several people arrived at the scene wearing \"masks and balaclavas\".\n\nHe said: \"A few hours ago there were lots of people arriving down my road. Many of them were wearing masks and balaclavas. They were all walking down the road and congregating on the corners. Within minutes I heard a loud bang, I think someone had thrown a brick at the mosque.\n\nHe added: \"And then they charged at the police. I was really really worried for the police, they needed more support.\"\n\nThe Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) says it will \"stand firm\" against \"forces of hatred and division\" in the wake of a riot outside a Southport mosque.\n\nThe MCB paid tribute to the three young girls killed in Southport on Monday, before condemning \"shocking scenes of far-Right rioters running amok outside a mosque\".\n\nIt said Islamaphobic backlash began with a false rumour on the internet which was then stoked by misinformation from a Russian news site, which wrongfully associated the crime with Muslims.\n\nZara Mohammed, the MCB secretary-general, said: \"At a time of great tragedy, loss, and mourning, we must stand firm against the cynical forces of hatred and division. This does not represent our diverse Britain and the people of Southport.\n\n\"The Government must address the increasing rise of violent far-Right extremism targeting Muslim communities. More must be done to tackle Islamophobia and offer reassurance at this time.\"\n\nShe added: \"We commend the authorities for their swift action, and our prayers are with the mosque, the families of the victims of yesterday's attack, and the local community.\"\n\nA Labour frontbencher has condemned the \"absolutely appalling\" violence in Southport last night.\n\nA mob gathered outside a mosque and hurled bricks, masonry and fireworks at police officers, with 39 officers injured and 27 taken to hospital.\n\nMatthew Pennycock, the housing minister, told Times Radio: \"The people of Southport are obviously reeling from the horror that was inflicted upon them two days ago, they're doing their best to pull together, to have the process the space they need.\n\n\"To have that overshadowed by the violence and disorder is sickening... They should feel the full force of the law.\"\n\nAsked what message he would send to those minded to take part in further violence, Mr Pennycock said: \"Well, not to do it, to give the community the space to grieve, to process the trauma they've experienced. I think the community needs that space, it doesn't need violence and disorder, and from what we can tell lots of people who don't even live in Merseyside coming in and trying to stir up trouble.\"\n\nWelcome to our live blog where we will be bringing you the latest updates following the knife attack in Southport on Monday.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Rayner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angela Rayner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Robinson_(activist)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Robinson (activist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Fox", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laurence Fox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "English Defence League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Museum of Art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_constable", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief constable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Riot police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehall", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whitehall"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

This incident was exacerbated by people from outside our community who came here determined to cause unrest. I would like to pay tribute to the brave police officers who worked hard to restore order.\n\n\"There is no justification for disorderly behaviour and the scenes do not represent Aldershot and Farnborough. We all support our shared right to peacefully protest, but we will not stand for people coming into our towns determined to stir up trouble and divide our community.\"\n\nIn London, a large protest was staged under the title of Enough is Enough, with arrests made after demonstrators clashed with officers in Whitehall on Wednesday.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said: \"Over 100 people have been arrested for offences including violent disorder, assault on an emergency worker, and breach of protest conditions. Some officers suffered minor injuries.\"\n\nDemonstrators were seen launching beer cans and glass bottles at a line of police in riot gear in front of Downing Street and throwing flares onto the statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square.\n\nThe angry scenes also included loud chants of \"we want our country back\" and \"Oh Tommy Robinson\", referring to the right-wing activist.\n\nCleveland Police also said it had made four arrests for various offences including public order and affray after violence broke out in Hartlepool on Wednesday.\n\nRoad closures were put in place and the public were warned to stay away.\n\nChief Superintendent David Sutherland said: \"At this stage we believe the protest is in connection with the incident in Southport earlier this week.\n\n\"Our officers are facing missiles, glass bottles and eggs being thrown at them and have made arrests as they remain in the area to protect the safety of those living in the community.\"\n\nIn Manchester, local councillor John Flanagan took to social media to respond to the violence, labelling those involved in the \"sickening\" incident as \"mindless idiots\".\n\n\"I'd like to condemn these mindless thugs, attacking innocent men who are asylum seekers. They have been there for months and we have not had any issues or problems. They have been in a place of safety,\" the councillor for Newton Heath said.\n\n\"It's sickening to think they are being targeted because of their race or their religion, and I hope this isn't tied with the disgraceful scenes in Southport where a mosque was attacked last night.\n\n\"These idiots are attacking innocent people. My initial reaction is to contact GMP and support them. The whole of the city and reasonable thinking people will be horrified and sickened by these actions. Idiots is too soft of a word - I hope the police use the full force of the law.\n\n\"We cannot allow our country and our city to descend into anarchy, which seems to be being driven by madness on social media.\"\n\nIt comes after violence erupted in Southport on Tuesday following a vigil for three girls killed in a knife attack at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club.\n\nPolice officers in Southport suffered serious injuries when bricks, stones and bottles were thrown and cars were set alight during violent protests.\n\nThe disorder near the town's mosque came after false rumours were circulated online about the suspect.\n\nIn an effort to avoid a second night of rioting, Merseyside Police were given extra powers, under S60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, on Wednesday to stop and search people suspected of carrying weapons.\n\nCommunity Inspector Doug Chadwick said the public was \"shocked and disappointed\" by the \"disgraceful\" scenes of rioting and called on the public to come forward with information about what they had seen.\n\nFive people have been arrested over the unrest so far, which saw 53 officers and three police dogs injured.\n\nThe unrest comes as a 17-year-old boy has been charged with the murders of the three girls.\n\nAlice Dasilva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, were fatally stabbed on Monday when a knifeman entered the dance class on Hart Street in Southport, Merseyside.\n\nEight other children suffered knife wounds - with five of them in critical condition - while two adults were also critically hurt.\n\nThe 17-year-old has been remanded in custody to appear on Thursday, August 1, at Liverpool Magistrates Court, Derby Square.", "source": {"uri": "warringtonguardian.co.uk",

The \"outside agitators\" had used the shock fatal stabbings of six-year-old Bebe King, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and nine-year-old Alice Dasilva Aguiar to push an anti-migrant agenda.\n\nOfficials have since confirmed they were driven by online misinformation, with false details about the British-born 17-year-old arrested and now charged by police circulating on social media. But the action hasn't stopped, with thousands of right-wing protesters having ignited the chaos once again in London, Hartlepool,mi and Manchester on Wednesday.\n\nPictures have captured the second night in a row during which rioters set fire to a police vehicle, with a car seen ablaze in Hartlepool, where protesters had started gathering from 6pm. Rioters in the Durham port town were seen lobbing missiles, including bottles and eggs, at officers attempting to keep the peace.\n\nSeveral officers were, again, injured in the line of duty, and fire engines raced to the scene to extinguish the flames emanating from the burnt-out police vehicle. Officers arrested eight people, and a spokesperson confirmed they believed the protests were \"in connection with the incident in Southport\", with the service expecting further arrests \"in the coming days\".\n\nThe chaos was repeated further south in Aldershot and Manchester, where police reported disorder and intimidating. Officers arrested two men for violent disorder and assaulting an emergency worker, with Greater Manchester police saying protesters were dispersed in the Newton Heath area.\n\nA spokesperson for the service said \"objects were thrown\" towards the police and general public, and Aldershot MP Alex Baker said one peaceful protest in his constituency descended into a similar mess. She said there was \"intimidating behaviour\" at a hotel, which was \"exacerbated by people from outside our community who came here determined to cause unrest\".\n\nShe added: \"There is no justification for disorderly behaviour and these scenes do not represent Aldershot and Farnborough. We all support our right to peacefully protest but we will not stand for people coming to our towns determined to stir up trouble and divide our community.\"\n\nProtests also got out of hand in London, which had already seen its fair share of far-right agitation just a few days earlier over the weekend. The Metropolitan Police said 100 people were arrested after officers clashed with protesters near Downing Street in Whitehall, with demonstrators seen launching flares towards the building's gates.\n\nOne observer branded the thugs \"mindless idiots\" as fighting broke out in a post on Threads. She said: \"The mindless idiots are now fighting the police outside of Downing Street.\" Another added: \"I saw a guy on YouTube videoing it had said 'The patriots are here\"' They are not patriots they are racists.\" Some of the protesters yelled \"stop the boats\" and \"save our kids\" as pictures showed people being tackled to the ground and smoke billowing through the city centre.\n\nThe Met said in a statement that it had placed conditions on the protests, but these were breached, with arrests made covering a range of offences. They included violent disorder, assault on an emergency worker and breach of protest conditions. Like other services, the Met added that officers had suffered \"minor injuries\".", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri":

In Hartlepool, eight people were arrested for various offenses. Protesters set fire to a police car and threw glass bottles and eggs at officers, resulting in some minor injuries.\n\nIn Aldershot, MP Alex Baker condemned the violence in her community, stating that \"there is no excuse for disorder\" and that such scenes \"do not represent Aldershot and Farnborough.\"\n\nThe chaos in London, Hartlepool, and Aldershot last night comes a day after 53 police

He cannot be named for legal reasons as he is under 18 and will appear at Liverpool City Magistrates Court on Thursday.\n\n\"Whilst these charges are a significant milestone within this investigation, this remains very much a live investigation and we continue to work with our partners from Lancashire Police and Counter Terrorism Policing North West (CTPNW),\" said Merseyside Police Chief Constable Serena Kennedy.\n\nThree children - six-year-old Bebe King, seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe and nine-year-old Alice Dasilva Aguiar - died as a result of the attack at The Hart Space community centre.\n\nA \"Taylor Swift Yoga and Dance Workshop\" aimed at primary school children was taking place at the time of the attack in the seaside town north of the city of Liverpool.

He faces three murder charges, 10 counts of attempted murder and another for possession of a knife.\n\nHe has been remanded in custody and will appear at Liverpool Magistrates Court today.\n\nMerseyside chief constable Serena Kennedy said: \"Whilst these charges are a significant milestone within this investigation, this remains very much a live investigation and we continue to work with our partners from Lancashire Police and Counter Terrorism Policing North West.\"\n\nDowning Street said Starmer would offer the government's full backing to police leaders following incidents of \"extreme violence and public disorder\" on the streets.\n\nHe will also emphasise the government's commitment to ensuring that anyone carrying out violent acts, and sowing hatred should face the \"full force of the law\".\n\nThere were also major disturbances in the north eastern town of Hartlepool on Wednesday night where police carrying riot shields were confronted by large crowds of protesters hurling projectiles.\n\nPolice forces across the UK are braced for further far right protests in the days to come.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehall", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whitehall"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downing Street"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Channel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English Channel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lancashire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lancashire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_shield", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riot shield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire_Constabulary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lancashire Constabulary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_constable", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief constable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_Magistrates'_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool Magistrates' Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John F.

The teenager also faces 10 counts of attempted murder after the horrific knife attack at the children's dance class in Southport on Monday.\n\nInvestigations continue: Chief Constable Serena Kennedy said in a midnight press conference that the charges are a \"significant milestone\" but that it remains \"very much a live investigation.\" The suspect will appear at Liverpool Magistrates' Court today. He cannot be named for legal reasons because he is under 18.\n\nTACKLING EXTREMISM: Keir Starmer is calling police chiefs into No. 10 after skirmishes between far-right protesters and police spread to the gates of Downing Street. More than 100 demonstrators were arrested after clashes in Whitehall, while a police car was torched in Hartlepool on a second night of violence, following the rioting in Southport on Tuesday. It could be a major test for the prime minister if the disorder doesn't fizzle out quickly.\n\n**A message from Lloyds Banking Group: At the end of last year, over 100,000 households were homeless and living in temporary accommodation, the highest on record. That's why we've committed to becoming the first UK bank to enter the market to own good quality housing that will be available to house families at risk of homelessness. Find out more.**\n\nKNIGHT AT THE ROUNDTABLE: The prime minister will make clear to senior policing leaders at a \"roundtable\" event this afternoon that thugs exploiting the right to protest to wreak havoc must face the \"full force of the law.\" Starmer is, naturally, expected to give officers his full backing and commit to work in partnership with forces across the U.K., but will urge them not to hesitate to use their powers to halt the violence, which has been whipped up by misinformation.\n\nOn the ground: Flares were hurled at the gates of Downing Street and the statue of Winston Churchill as protesters descended on Westminster in the wake of the Southport stabbings. Playbook's Bethany Dawson was there to witness the chaos. Beer cans and glass bottles rained down on police in riot gear, leaving some with minor injuries.\n\nThe chants: There were frequent cries of \"Oh Tommy, Tommy\" for Tommy Robinson, the English Defence League founder who promoted the demonstration despite being believed to have fled the country amid contempt of court hearings. Shouts of \"we want our country back\" and \"stop the boats\" also rang out.\n\nTommy in a suit: Bethany spotted one of the demonstrators proudly sporting a \"Nigel Farage for Prime Minister and Tommy Robinson for Home Secretary\" T-shirt. The Reform leader probably won't like that, considering he chided Brendan Cox, the husband of murdered MP Jo Cox, as \"beneath contempt\" for describing him as \"Tommy Robinson in a suit.\" Farage was getting criticism from many angles after baselessly questioning whether the truth was being withheld about the Southport attack.\n\nLike from this guy: The Guardian reports that former police counterterrorism chief Neil Basu has accused the MP of \"giving the EDL succor, undermining the police, creating conspiracy theories, and giving a false basis for the attacks on the police.\" Basu asked: \"Has Nigel Farage condemned the violence? Has he condemned the EDL?\" Playbook doesn't know, but they're \"fair and legitimate questions\" for Farage.\n\nApropos of nothing: Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Daniel Greenberg has cautioned MPs to \"choose their language carefully,\" the i's Chloe Chaplain reports. Wise words considering the febrile atmosphere.\n\nFrom the Yard: The Metropolitan Police said more than 100 people were arrested after protest conditions were breached on Whitehall. Allegations included violent disorder and assault on an emergency worker.\n\nMeanwhile in Hartlepool ... Cleveland Police said officers were injured after they were pelted with missiles, glass bottles and eggs, as disorder broke out in the County Durham town. The Northern Echo's Tom Burgess captured footage of scuffles with police earlier in the evening before a police car was torched.\n\nA call for peace: New Hartlepool MP Jonathan Brash said the clashes were \"deeply concerning,\" ahead of meetings with police. \"Violence is never the answer,\" he pleaded.\n\nThe investigation: The BBC linked the violence there to the anger unleashed by the Southport attack. Eight arrests were made, with more expected to follow. Officers will be investigating whether the disorder was linked to the EDL.\n\nAnd in Southport ... the town remains under a Section 60 order giving police enhanced powers to stop and search suspects. Officers are braced for far-right agitators to whip up further violence while the area grieves the deaths of the three girls.\n\nThe bigger picture: Tackling the disorder linked to the far right is an early and urgent problem for Starmer's government -- complicated by the continued rise of the populist, but not quite far-right Nigel Farage -- as POLITICO's Andrew McDonald writes here. \"The big thing that progressives in the U.K. need to be thinking about is how we get back to a point where the vast majority of people feel that mainstream politics serves their interests,\" Harry Quilter-Pinner, executive director at the IPPR, says.\n\nIN POTENTIALLY SUNNIER NEWS ...\n\nA DATE WITH RATES: Keir Starmer could be rewarded for Rishi Sunak's decision to call a summer election by welcoming the first interest rates cut in more than four years. The Bank of England will announce its decision on whether to bring rates down from a 16-year high of 5.25 percent in a statement at midday.\n\nOn a knife edge: Investors were betting that a cut is more likely than not after inflation stabilized at the 2 percent target, though it's by no means certain. Governor Andrew Bailey will hold a press conference at 12.30 p.m. Find a stream here.\n\nSpinning the winnings: Chancellor Rachel Reeves will release a statement regardless of the result. Playbook would be surprised if she didn't give a cheerful interview to broadcasters if rates do end up being cut.\n\nCase for the opposition: Shadow Chancellor Jeremy Hunt's plans were unclear, but you'd expect him to insist in the event of good news that he didn't leave the economy in such a bad state after all. Shame for Sunak and the Tories he didn't hang on in Downing Street long enough to preside over the cheer.\n\nA warning: The new Labour Growth Group pushing Reeves to prioritize infrastructure alongside housing is a pretty Starmerite bunch unlikely to cause much alarm in No. 10. But just how long will that last if they don't get that coveted but elusive surge in growth? \"In six months to a year, that's when things will start getting tasty,\" one of the caucus' MPs tells the i's Kitty Donaldson.\n\nSwiss role: My POLITICO colleagues Antonia Zimmermann and Jon Stone have an interesting piece asking whether post-Brexit Britain could end up like Switzerland -- but without the mountains, cuckoo clocks or fondue. They hear that sector-by-sector mini deals could make the U.K.'s relationship with the EU look something like the one between Brussels and Bern. Read their piece here.\n\nHow to improve things with Brussels: The European Commission has issued eight demands that the U.K. must meet if Starmer is to achieve his ambition for a better post-Brexit relationship with the EU, the Financial Times reports. They include fully implementing existing Brexit agreements on Northern Ireland and protecting the rights of EU citizens living in Britain.\n\nBut what Labour really wants to talk about: The government reckons a slashing of red tape to open up access to a \u00a31.4 billion fund will allow the NHS to hire more than 1,000 more newly qualified family doctors. PA writes it up.\n\nTODAY IN WESTMINSTER\n\nBBC DRAMA: Lisa Nandy will today hold urgent talks with BBC Director General Tim Davie over the scandal surrounding Huw Edwards. The culture secretary will ask what the public broadcaster knew and when, while seeking reassurance that its processes are fit for purpose after the newsreader pleaded guilty to accessing indecent photographs of children.\n\nThe many questions: The admission by the former star broadcaster -- and the BBC's handling of the situation -- makes pretty much all the front pages. Joe Pike reported on Newsnight that the BBC was told Edwards was under suspicion over the offense in November, but the corporation continued to pay the former lead presenter \u00a3200,000 until his resignation in April.\n\nLiving her best life: It was unclear whether the Nandy-Davie talks will be a summoning to DCMS or a phone call, considering the culture secretary will be traveling to Paris to attend the Olympics. She's expected to catch some gymnastics, diving, rowing, swimming and BMX during her stay until Saturday. Nice work, if you can get it.\n\nBADENOCH DAY 2: The Guardian's Pippa Crerar has dropped another Kemi Badenoch scoop, reporting that the Tory leadership contender allegedly asked officials to pay for a holiday flight with taxpayers' money to the U.S. while in government. The Department of Business and Trade was said to have booked her travel to Texas for a family holiday in February last year before the former cabinet minister coughed up the costs herself. There's been no spiky tweet from the shadow housing secretary yet, but her spokesperson referenced the bullying allegations Badenoch firmly denied on Tuesday and added: \"We look forward to having to deny tomorrow that Kemi faked the moon landings.\"\n\nA BUMP IN THE ROAD: Labour's election pledge to fill 1 million more potholes every year has been thrown into doubt due to the chancellor's tightening of the pursestrings, the Sun's Martina Bet reports. This is one for Roads Minister Lilian Greenwood, who happens to be visiting a resurfacing works in Yorkshire. Regional media invited.\n\nFIRST FOR EVERYTHING: City Minister Tulip Siddiq is under investigation for failing to declare her ownership of a London apartment that earns rental income, my Financial Services colleague Hannah Brenton writes. Siddiq, the first minister in the new government to be under investigation, failed to declare the income within the 28-day limit.\n\nROCKY ROAD AHEAD? Former U.S. Ambassador to the U.K. Woody Johnson told the Spectator's James Heale that David Lammy's description of Donald Trump as a \"neo-Nazi-sympathizing sociopath\" won't be forgotten lightly. \"People will remember all those comments,\" he said. Johnson added that Trump has an \"incredible fondness\" for the U.K. \"He doesn't want you to screw it up.\"\n\nTROUBLES COMPENSATION: Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn has extended the backdating period for the troubles permanent disablement payment scheme from Aug. 31 to Aug. 31, 2026, to ensure all of those injured in Troubles-related incidents have time to make a payment application.\n\nHEATING UP: An FOI request by the Liberal Democrats found that a pensioner in the East Midlands waited close to nine and a half hours for an ambulance in last year's heat wave. Data revealed that ambulance response times for heatstroke have increased from 32 minutes since 2018-19 to 59 minutes in 2023-24.\n\nDRINK TO THAT: Exactly one year ago, Jeremy Hunt introduced a 10.1 percent increase in excise duty on Scotch whisky, which the Scotch Whisky Association said added 0.35 percentage points to inflation, creating \u00a32.3 billion in additional interest payments on government borrowing.\n\nIN COURT: Legal arguments will be heard at the Old Bailey in the case of the six Bulgarians who have been accused of spying for Russia -- some background here.\n\nREPORTS OUT TODAY: The IFG recommends Chancellor Rachel Reeves reform the spending review process by defining priorities and broadening the scope of the review ... analysis by the IFS found local housing stocks in England are less than half as responsive to changes in demand as areas in the U.S. and France.\n\nBEYOND THE M25\n\nLEBANON LATEST: Hezbollah confirmed that its top military commander Fouad Shukur was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut. Sky News reported that he was described as the \"right-hand man\" of the militant group's leader Hassan Nasrallah. The IDF blamed Shukur for the attack on Golan Heights which killed 12.\n\nCalls for restraint: An emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council was held last night, where a Lebanese representative described the strike on Beirut as a \"clear violation\" of humanitarian law. Palestinian representative Feda Abdelhady said: \"Do not let Israel drag us to the brink of [an] abyss.\" U.K. Representative Barbara Woodward told the Council the U.K. is \"deeply concerned about escalation\" and \"long-term peace will not be secured by bombs and bullets.\"\n\nHOPES FOR FREEDOM: Russian-British Kremlin critic Vladimir Kara-Murza and other high-profile political prisoners have gone missing in the Russian penal system as speculation mounts that a potentially historic prisoner exchange could be on the cards. My POLITICO colleague Eva Hartog has more.\n\nKYIV'S MAYOR CRITICIZED: Former world heavyweight boxing champion Vitaly Klitschko -- nicknamed Dr. Ironfist -- is one of the most identifiable and laconically affable faces of Ukraine's resistance against Putin, but as Kyiv's mayor he has a bad reputation, my colleague Veronika Melkozerova writes. Many complaints focus on his failure to stop ruthless developers from leveling the city's heritage.\n\nTRUMP MAKES FALSE CLAIMS ABOUT HARRIS' RACE: Donald Trump participated in a controversial live interview at a convention of Black journalists in Chicago and quickly stumbled into racially insensitive remarks about Vice President Kamala Harris, my colleague Eli Stokols writes. Trump said of the likely Democratic presidential nominee: \"She was always of Indian heritage and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago until she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black.\"\n\n9/11 ACCUSED TO PLEAD GUILTY: The U.S. Department of Defense has announced that three of the men accused of plotting the 9/11 attacks have entered into plea agreements, more than 16 years after the prosecution began. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed -- the alleged mastermind of the 2001 attacks -- and two other defendants agreed to plead guilty in exchange for the prosecution agreeing not to seek the death penalty.\n\n**A message from Lloyds Banking Group: Across the UK, record numbers of families are finding themselves at risk of homelessness and living in temporary accommodation. Each year in England, there is an annual shortfall of 100,000 new social homes. That's why we'll become the first UK bank to enter the market to own good quality housing that will be available to house families at risk of homelessness.

Beer cans and glass bottles rained down on police in riot gear, leaving some with minor injuries.\n\nThere were chants of \"Oh Tommy, Tommy\" -- a reference to Tommy Robinson, the founder of the extreme nationalist English Defence League (EDL) group, who promoted the demonstration despite reports that he has fled the U.K. amid contempt of court hearings. Shouts of \"we want our country back\" and \"stop the boats\" also rang out.\n\nStarmer's meeting with senior cops comes after Merseyside police charged a 17-year-old boy from Banks, Lancashire, with the murders of Bebe King, 6, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9. The teenager also faces 10 counts of attempted murder.\n\nChief Constable Serena Kennedy said in a midnight press conference that the charges are a \"significant milestone\" but that it remains \"very much a live investigation.\" The suspect will appear at Liverpool Magistrates' Court on Thursday, but cannot be named for legal reasons because he is under 18.\n\nStarmer, in his meeting with the senior policing leaders this afternoon, is expected to say that far-right groups exploiting the right to protest to wreak havoc must face the \"full force of the law,\" London Playbook reported. He is expected to give officers his full backing and commit to work in partnership with forces across the U.K. but will urge them not to hesitate to use their powers to halt the violence, which has been whipped up by misinformation.\n\nFormer police counterterrorism chief Neil Basu accused newly elected Reform UK MP Nigel Farage of \"giving the EDL succor, undermining the police, creating conspiracy theories, and giving a false basis for the attacks on the police,\" according to the Guardian.\n\nViolence also broke out on Wednesday in the town of Hartlepool, where police officers were injured after they were pelted with bottles and eggs, and a police car was torched.\n\nNew Hartlepool MP Jonathan Brash said the clashes were \"deeply concerning,\" adding: \"Violence is never the answer.\" Eight arrests have been made, with more expected to follow. Officers will be investigating whether the disorder was linked to the EDL.\n\nMeanwhile, Southport remained under a Section 60 order giving police enhanced powers to stop and search suspects, amid fears of further violence.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10_Downing_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "10 Downing Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "English Defence League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winston Churchill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Robinson_(activist)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Robinson (activist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultranationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ultranationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_constable", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief constable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_Magistrates'_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool Magistrates' Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

The next morning, many donned helmets and shields and clashed with counter-protesters before a car drove into the crowd, killing a 32-year-old woman and injuring 19 others.\n\nOn Monday, Texas A&M University canceled plans for a \"White Lives Matter\" rally in September. On Wednesday, the University of Florida denied a request for white nationalist Richard Spencer to rent space on campus for a September event. Spencer and his supporters are promising court challenges.\n\nExpecting more rallies to come, Riseling's group is planning a series of training events to help campus police prepare.\n\n\"If you're sitting on a campus where this hasn't happened, consider this your wake-up call that it might,\" she said.\n\nLast school year, racist flyers popped up on college campuses at a rate that experts called unprecedented. The Anti-Defamation League counted 161 white supremacist \"flyering incidents\" on 110 college campuses between September and June. Oren Segal, director of the group's Center on Extremism, said the culprits can't be dismissed as harmless trolls.\n\n\"You might have a few that don't take it seriously. But those that do, those are the ones we're concerned about,\" Segal said.\n\nMatthew Heimbach, the 26-year-old leader of the white nationalist Traditionalist Worker Party, admits that dropping leaflets on campuses is a cheap way to generate media coverage.\n\n\"A dollar worth of paper, if it triggers the right person, can become $100,000 in media attention,\" he said.\n\nAs a student at Towson University in Maryland, Heimbach made headlines for forming a \"White Student Union\" and scrawling messages like \"white pride\" in chalk on campus sidewalks. His college years are behind him, but Heimbach still views colleges as promising venues to expand his group's ranks. College students are running four of his group's chapters, he said.\n\n\"The entire dynamic has changed,\" Heimbach said. \"I used to be the youngest person at white nationalist meetings by 20 or 30 years.\"\n\nThe Foundation for the Marketplace of Ideas, a self-described \"alt-right\" nonprofit educational group, says it's offering legal assistance to students caught hanging up posters or flyers containing \"hate facts.\" The \"alt-right\" is a fringe movement loosely mixing white nationalism, anti-Semitism and anti-immigration populism.\n\nOne of the foundation's attorneys, Jason Van Dyke, said he represented a student at Southern Methodist University who was accused last year of posting flyers on campus that said, \"Why White Women Shouldn't Date Black Men.\" The student wasn't suspended or expelled, Van Dyke added.\n\n\"Just because speech makes someone uncomfortable or offends somebody does not make it a violation of the student code of conduct,\" he said.\n\nScores of schools publicly denounced the violence in Virginia this week, including some that learned they enroll students who attended the \"Unite the Right\" rally.\n\nThe University of Nevada, Reno, said it stands against bigotry and racism but concluded there's \"no constitutional or legal reason\" to expel Peter Cvjetanovic, a 20-year-old student and school employee who attended the rally, as an online petition demanded.\n\nOther schools, including Washington State University, condemned the rally but didn't specifically address their students who attended it.\n\nCampus leaders say they walk a fine line when trying to combat messages from hate groups. Many strive to protect speech even if it's offensive but also recognize hate speech can make students feel unsafe. Some schools have sought to counter extremist messages with town halls and events promoting diversity. Others try to avoid drawing attention to hate speech.\n\nAfter flyers promoting white supremacy were posted at Purdue University last school year, Purdue President Mitch Daniels refused to dwell on the incident.\n\n\"This is a transparent effort to bait people into overreacting, thereby giving a minuscule fringe group attention it does not deserve, and that we decline to do,\" Daniels said in a statement at the time.\n\nCameron Padgett, a 23-year-old senior at Georgia State University, only dabbled in campus activism before he decided to organize a speaking engagement for Spencer this year. Padgett sued - successfully - for Spencer to speak at Auburn University in April after the school tried to cancel the event.\n\n\"My motivation from the beginning was just free speech,\" he said.\n\nPadgett calls himself an \"identitarian\" - not a white nationalist - and insists \"advocating for the interests of white people\" doesn't make him a racist. Padgett said he hasn't faced harassment for working with Spencer and doesn't fear any.\n\n\"There are a lot of people who just sit behind keyboards,\" he said. \"But what are we doing this for if no one wants to show their face?\"\n\nAt Boston University, Fuentes says he met a few others with similar views - he considers himself a \"white advocate\" - but mostly found political kinship online. He hosts his own YouTube show and is prolific on social media, but when he heard about the \"Unite the Right\" rally, he saw it as a chance to network in the real world.\n\n\"It was going from online to actually physically assembling somewhere,\" he said. \"We shake hands, we look people in the eye. We actually have some solidarity in the movement.\"\n\nSo, along with a friend from Chicago, Fuentes booked a flight and headed to Virginia.\n\nFollow Collin Binkley on Twitter at @cbinkley and

College students are running four of his group's chapters, he said.\n\n\"The entire dynamic has changed,\" Heimbach said. \"I used to be the youngest person at white nationalist meetings by 20 or 30 years.\"\n\nThe Foundation for the Marketplace of Ideas, a self-described \"alt-right\" nonprofit educational group, says it's offering legal assistance to students caught hanging up posters or flyers containing \"hate facts.\" The \"alt-right\" is a fringe movement loosely mixing white nationalism, anti-Semitism and anti-immigration populism.\n\nOne of the foundation's attorneys, Jason Van Dyke, said he represented a student at Southern Methodist University who was accused last year of posting flyers on campus that said, \"Why White Women Shouldn't Date Black Men.\" The student wasn't suspended or expelled, Van Dyke added.\n\n\"Just because speech makes someone uncomfortable or offends somebody does not make it a violation of the student code of conduct,\" he said.\n\nScores of schools publicly denounced the violence in Virginia this week, including some that learned they enroll students who attended the \"Unite the Right\" rally.\n\nThe University of Nevada, Reno, said it stands against bigotry and racism but concluded there's \"no constitutional or legal reason\" to expel Peter Cvjetanovic, a 20-year-old student and school employee who attended the rally, as an online petition demanded.\n\nOther schools, including Washington State University, condemned the rally but didn't specifically address their students who attended it.\n\nCampus leaders say they walk a fine line when trying to combat messages from hate groups. Many strive to protect speech even if it's offensive but also recognize hate speech can make students feel unsafe. Some schools have sought to counter extremist messages with town halls and events promoting diversity. Others try to avoid drawing attention to hate speech.\n\nAfter flyers promoting white supremacy were posted at Purdue University last school year, Purdue President Mitch Daniels refused to dwell on the incident.\n\n\"This is a transparent effort to bait people into overreacting, thereby giving a minuscule fringe group attention it does not deserve, and that we decline to do,\" Daniels said in a statement at the time.\n\nCameron Padgett, a 23-year-old senior at Georgia State University, only dabbled in campus activism before he decided to organize a speaking engagement for Spencer this year. Padgett sued -- successfully -- for Spencer to speak at Auburn University in April after the school tried to cancel the event.\n\n\"My motivation from the beginning was just free speech,\" he said.\n\nPadgett calls himself an \"identitarian\" -- not a white nationalist -- and insists \"advocating for the interests of white people\" doesn't make him a racist. Padgett said he hasn't faced harassment for working with Spencer and doesn't fear any.\n\n\"There are a lot of people who just sit behind keyboards,\" he said. \"But what are we doing this for if no one wants to show their face?\"\n\nAt Boston University, Fuentes says he met a few others with similar views -- he considers himself a \"white advocate\" -- but mostly found political kinship online. He hosts his own YouTube show and is prolific on social media, but when he heard about the \"Unite the Right\" rally, he saw it as a chance to network in the real world.\n\n\"It was going from online to actually physically assembling somewhere,\" he said. \"We shake hands, we look people in the eye. We actually have some solidarity in the movement.\"\n\nSo, along with a friend from Chicago, Fuentes booked a flight and headed to Virginia.", "id": "9887483", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18",

The next morning, many donned helmets and shields and clashed with counter-protesters before a car drove into the crowd, killing a 32-year-old woman and injuring 19 others.\n\nOn Monday, Texas A&M University cancelled plans for a \"White Lives Matter\" rally in September. On Wednesday, the University of Florida denied a request for white nationalist Richard Spencer to rent space on campus for a September event. Spencer and his supporters are promising court challenges.\n\nExpecting more rallies to come, Riseling's group is planning a series of training events to help campus police prepare.\n\n\"If you're sitting on a campus where this hasn't happened, consider this your wake-up call that it might,\" she said.\n\nLast school year, racist flyers popped up on college campuses at a rate that experts called unprecedented. The Anti-Defamation League counted 161 white supremacist \"flyering incidents\" on 110 college campuses between September and June. Oren Segal, director of the group's Center on Extremism, said the culprits can't be dismissed as harmless trolls.\n\n\"You might have a few that don't take it seriously. But those that do, those are the ones we're concerned about,\" Segal said.\n\nMatthew Heimbach, the 26-year-old leader of the white nationalist Traditionalist Worker Party, admits that dropping leaflets on campuses is a cheap way to generate media coverage.\n\n\"A dollar worth of paper, if it triggers the right person, can become $100,000 in media attention,\" he said.\n\nAs a student at Towson University in Maryland, Heimbach made headlines for forming a \"White Student Union\" and scrawling messages like \"white pride\" in chalk on campus sidewalks.

The next morning, many donned helmets and shields and clashed with counter-protesters before a car drove into the crowd, killing a 32-year-old woman and injuring 19 others.\n\nOn Monday, Texas A&M University cancelled plans for a \"White Lives Matter\" rally in September. On Wednesday, the University of Florida denied a request for white nationalist Richard Spencer to rent space on campus for a September event. Spencer and his supporters are promising court challenges.\n\nExpecting more rallies to come, Riseling's group is planning a series of training events to help campus police prepare.\n\n\"If you're sitting on a campus where this hasn't happened, consider this your wake-up call that it might,\" she said.\n\nLast school year, racist flyers popped up on college campuses at a rate that experts called unprecedented. The Anti-Defamation League counted 161 white supremacist \"flyering incidents\" on 110 college campuses between September and June. Oren Segal, director of the group's Center on Extremism, said the culprits can't be dismissed as harmless trolls.\n\n\"You might have a few that don't take it seriously. But those that do, those are the ones we're concerned about,\" Segal said.\n\nMatthew Heimbach, the 26-year-old leader of the white nationalist Traditionalist Worker Party, admits that dropping leaflets on campuses is a cheap way to generate media coverage.\n\n\"A dollar worth of paper, if it triggers the right person, can become $100,000 in media attention,\" he said.\n\nAs a student at Towson University in Maryland, Heimbach made headlines for forming a \"White Student Union\" and scrawling messages like \"white pride\" in chalk on campus sidewalks. His college years are behind him, but Heimbach still views colleges as promising venues to expand his group's ranks. College students are running four of his group's chapters, he said.\n\n\"The entire dynamic has changed,\" Heimbach said. \"I used to be the youngest person at white nationalist meetings by 20 or 30 years.\"\n\nThe Foundation for the Marketplace of Ideas, a self-described \"alt-right\" non-profit educational group, says it's offering legal assistance to students caught hanging up posters or flyers containing \"hate facts.\" The \"alt-right\" is a fringe movement loosely mixing white nationalism, anti-Semitism and anti-immigration populism.\n\nOne of the foundation's attorneys, Jason Van Dyke, said he represented a student at Southern Methodist University who was accused last year of posting flyers on campus that said, \"Why White Women Shouldn't Date Black Men.\" The student wasn't suspended or expelled, Van Dyke added.\n\n\"Just because speech makes someone uncomfortable or offends somebody does not make it a violation of the student code of conduct,\" he said.\n\nScores of schools publicly denounced the violence in Virginia this week, including some that learned they enrol students who attended the \"Unite the Right\" rally.\n\nThe University of Nevada, Reno, said it stands against bigotry and racism but concluded there's \"no constitutional or legal reason\" to expel Peter Cvjetanovic, a 20-year-old student and school employee who attended the rally, as an online petition demanded.\n\nOther schools, including Washington State University, condemned the rally but didn't specifically address their students who attended it.\n\nCampus leaders say they walk a fine line when trying to combat messages from hate groups. Many strive to protect speech even if it's offensive but also recognize hate speech can make students feel unsafe. Some schools have sought to counter extremist messages with town halls and events promoting diversity. Others try to avoid drawing attention to hate speech.\n\nAfter flyers promoting white supremacy were posted at Purdue University last school year, Purdue President Mitch Daniels refused to dwell on the incident.\n\n\"This is a transparent effort to bait people into overreacting, thereby giving a minuscule fringe group attention it does not deserve, and that we decline to do,\" Daniels said in a statement at the time.\n\nCameron Padgett, a 23-year-old senior at Georgia State University, only dabbled in campus activism before he decided to organize a speaking engagement for Spencer this year. Padgett sued -- successfully -- for Spencer to speak at Auburn University in April after the school tried to cancel the event.\n\n\"My motivation from the beginning was just free speech,\" he said.\n\nPadgett calls himself an \"identitarian\" -- not a white nationalist -- and insists \"advocating for the interests of white people\" doesn't make him a racist. Padgett said he hasn't faced harassment for working with Spencer and doesn't fear any.\n\n\"There are a lot of people who just sit behind keyboards,\" he said. \"But what are we doing this for if no one wants to show their face?\"\n\nAt Boston University, Fuentes says he met a few others with similar views -- he considers himself a \"white advocate\" -- but mostly found political kinship online. He hosts his own YouTube show and is prolific on social media, but when he heard about the \"Unite the Right\" rally, he saw it as a chance to network in the real world.\n\n\"It was going from online to actually physically assembling somewhere,\" he said. \"We shake hands, we look people in the eye. We actually have some solidarity in the movement.\"\n\nSo, along with a friend from Chicago, Fuentes booked a flight and headed to Virginia.\n\n___\n\nKunzelman reported from Baton Rouge,

The next morning, many donned helmets and shields and clashed with counter-protesters before a car drove into the crowd, killing a 32-year-old woman and injuring 19 others.\n\nOn Monday, Texas A&M University canceled plans for a \"White Lives Matter\" rally in September. On Wednesday, the University of Florida denied a request for white nationalist Richard Spencer to rent space on campus for a September event. Spencer and his supporters are promising court challenges.\n\nExpecting more rallies to come, Riseling's group is planning a series of training events to help campus police prepare.\n\n\"If you're sitting on a campus where this hasn't happened, consider this your wake-up call that it might,\" she said.\n\nLast school year, racist flyers popped up on college campuses at a rate that experts called unprecedented. The Anti-Defamation League counted 161 white supremacist \"flyering incidents\" on 110 college campuses between September and June. Oren Segal, director of the group's Center on Extremism, said the culprits can't be dismissed as harmless trolls.\n\n\"You might have a few that don't take it seriously. But those that do, those are the ones we're concerned about,\" Segal said.\n\nMatthew Heimbach, the 26-year-old leader of the white nationalist Traditionalist Worker Party, admits that dropping leaflets on campuses is a cheap way to generate media coverage.\n\n\"A dollar worth of paper, if it triggers the right person, can become $100,000 in media attention,\" he said.\n\nAs a student at Towson University in Maryland, Heimbach made headlines for forming a \"White Student Union\" and scrawling messages like \"white pride\" in chalk on campus sidewalks. His college years are behind him, but Heimbach still views colleges as promising venues to expand his group's ranks. College students are running four of his group's chapters, he said.\n\n\"The entire dynamic has changed,\" Heimbach said. \"I used to be the youngest person at white nationalist meetings by 20 or 30 years.\"\n\nThe Foundation for the Marketplace of Ideas, a self-described \"alt-right\" nonprofit educational group, says it's offering legal assistance to students caught hanging up posters or flyers containing \"hate facts.\" The \"alt-right\" is a fringe movement loosely mixing white nationalism, anti-Semitism and anti-immigration populism.\n\nOne of the foundation's attorneys, Jason Van Dyke, said he represented a student at Southern Methodist University who was accused last year of posting flyers on campus that said, \"Why White Women Shouldn't Date Black Men.\" The student wasn't suspended or expelled, Van Dyke added.\n\n\"Just because speech makes someone uncomfortable or offends somebody does not make it a violation of the student code of conduct,\" he said.\n\nScores of schools publicly denounced the violence in Virginia this week, including some that learned they enroll students who attended the \"Unite the Right\" rally.\n\nThe University of Nevada, Reno, said it stands against bigotry and racism but concluded there's \"no constitutional or legal reason\" to expel Peter Cvjetanovic, a 20-year-old student and school employee who attended the rally, as an online petition demanded.\n\nOther schools, including Washington State University, condemned the rally but didn't specifically address their students who attended it.\n\nCampus leaders say they walk a fine line when trying to combat messages from hate groups. Many strive to protect speech even if it's offensive but also recognize hate speech can make students feel unsafe. Some schools have sought to counter extremist messages with town halls and events promoting diversity. Others try to avoid drawing attention to hate speech.\n\nAfter flyers promoting white supremacy were posted at Purdue University last school year, Purdue President Mitch Daniels refused to dwell on the incident.\n\n\"This is a transparent effort to bait people into overreacting, thereby giving a minuscule fringe group attention it does not deserve, and that we decline to do,\" Daniels said in a statement at the time.\n\nCameron Padgett, a 23-year-old senior at Georgia State University, only dabbled in campus activism before he decided to organize a speaking engagement for Spencer this year. Padgett sued - successfully - for Spencer to speak at Auburn University in April after the school tried to cancel the event.\n\n\"My motivation from the beginning was just free speech,\" he said.\n\nPadgett calls himself an \"identitarian\" - not a white nationalist - and insists \"advocating for the interests of white people\" doesn't make him a racist. Padgett said he hasn't faced harassment for working with Spencer and doesn't fear any.\n\n\"There are a lot of people who just sit behind keyboards,\" he said. \"But what are we doing this for if no one wants to show their face?\"\n\nAt Boston University, Fuentes says he met a few others with similar views - he considers himself a \"white advocate\" - but mostly found political kinship online. He hosts his own YouTube show and is prolific on social media, but when he heard about the \"Unite the Right\" rally, he saw it as a chance to network in the real world.\n\n\"It was going from online to actually physically assembling somewhere,\" he said. \"We shake hands, we look people in the eye. We actually have some solidarity in the movement.\"\n\nSo, along with a friend from Chicago, Fuentes booked a flight and headed to Virginia.\n\nFollow Collin Binkley on Twitter at @cbinkley and

College students are running four of his group's chapters, he said.\n\n\"The entire dynamic has changed,\" Heimbach said. \"I used to be the youngest person at white nationalist meetings by 20 or 30 years.\"\n\nThe Foundation for the Marketplace of Ideas, a self-described \"alt-right\" nonprofit educational group, says it's offering legal assistance to students caught hanging up posters or flyers containing \"hate facts.\" The \"alt-right\" is a fringe movement loosely mixing white nationalism, anti-Semitism and anti-immigration populism.\n\nOne of the foundation's attorneys, Jason Van Dyke, said he represented a student at Southern Methodist University who was accused last year of posting flyers on campus that said, \"Why White Women Shouldn't Date Black Men.\" The student wasn't suspended or expelled, Van Dyke added.\n\n\"Just because speech makes someone uncomfortable or offends somebody does not make it a violation of the student code of conduct,\" he said.\n\nScores of schools publicly denounced the violence in Virginia this week, including some that learned they enroll students who attended the \"Unite the Right\" rally.\n\nThe University of Nevada, Reno, said it stands against bigotry and racism but concluded there's \"no constitutional or legal reason\" to expel Peter Cvjetanovic, a 20-year-old student and school employee who attended the rally, as an online petition demanded.\n\nOther schools, including Washington State University, condemned the rally but didn't specifically address their students who attended it.\n\nCampus leaders say they walk a fine line when trying to combat messages from hate groups. Many strive to protect speech even if it's offensive but also recognize hate speech can make students feel unsafe. Some schools have sought to counter extremist messages with town halls and events promoting diversity. Others try to avoid drawing attention to hate speech.\n\nAfter flyers promoting white supremacy were posted at Purdue University last school year, Purdue President Mitch Daniels refused to dwell on the incident.\n\n\"This is a transparent effort to bait people into overreacting, thereby giving a minuscule fringe group attention it does not deserve, and that we decline to do,\" Daniels said in a statement at the time.\n\nCameron Padgett, a 23-year-old senior at Georgia State University, only dabbled in campus activism before he decided to organize a speaking engagement for Spencer this year. Padgett sued - successfully - for Spencer to speak at Auburn University in April after the school tried to cancel the event.\n\n\"My motivation from the beginning was just free speech,\" he said.\n\nPadgett calls himself an \"identitarian\" - not a white nationalist - and insists \"advocating for the interests of white people\" doesn't make him a racist. Padgett said he hasn't faced harassment for working with Spencer and doesn't fear any.\n\n\"There are a lot of people who just sit behind keyboards,\" he said. \"But what are we doing this for if no one wants to show their face?\"\n\nAt Boston University, Fuentes says he met a few others with similar views - he considers himself a \"white advocate\" - but mostly found political kinship online. He hosts his own YouTube show and is prolific on social media, but when he heard about the \"Unite the Right\" rally, he saw it as a chance to network in the real world.\n\n\"It was going from online to actually physically assembling somewhere,\" he said. \"We shake hands, we look people in the eye. We actually have some solidarity in the movement.\"\n\nSo, along with a friend from Chicago, Fuentes booked a flight and headed to Virginia.\n\nFollow Collin Binkley on Twitter at @cbinkley and Michael Kunzelman at @Kunzelman75\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Share your opinions in a Federal News Radio survey.\n\nAt college campuses, far-right extremist groups have found fertile ground to spread their messages and attract new followers.\n\nAnd for many schools, the rally in Virginia served as a warning that these groups will no longer limit their efforts to social media or to flyers furtively posted around campus.\n\n\"It seems like what might have been a little in the shadows has come into full sun, and now it's out there and exposed for everyone to see,\" said Sue Riseling, a former police chief at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who is executive director of the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators.\n\nThe violence in Charlottesville introduced many Americans to a new brand of hate, bred on internet message boards and migrating to the streets with increasing frequency.\n\nOn the eve of Saturday's rally, young white men wearing khakis and white polo shirts marched through the University of Virginia's campus, holding torches as they chanted racist and anti-Semitic slogans. The next morning, many donned helmets and shields and clashed with counter-protesters before a car drove into the crowd, killing a 32-year-old woman and injuring 19 others.\n\nOn Monday, Texas A&M University canceled plans for a \"White Lives Matter\" rally in September. On Wednesday, the University of Florida denied a request for white nationalist Richard Spencer to rent space on campus for a September event. Spencer and his supporters are promising court challenges.\n\nPostal Service may be able to raise price of stamps this fall\n\nExpecting more rallies to come, Riseling's group is planning a series of training events to help campus police prepare.\n\n\"If you're sitting on a campus where this hasn't happened, consider this your wake-up call that it might,\" she said.\n\nLast school year, racist flyers popped up on college campuses at a rate that experts called unprecedented. The Anti-Defamation League counted 161 white supremacist \"flyering incidents\" on 110 college campuses between September and June. Oren Segal, director of the group's Center on Extremism, said the culprits can't be dismissed as harmless trolls.\n\n\"You might have a few that don't take it seriously. But those that do, those are the ones we're concerned about,\" Segal said.\n\nMatthew Heimbach, the 26-year-old leader of the white nationalist Traditionalist Worker Party, admits that dropping leaflets on campuses is a cheap way to generate media coverage.\n\n\"A dollar worth of paper, if it triggers the right person, can become $100,000 in media attention,\" he said.\n\nAs a student at Towson University in Maryland, Heimbach made headlines for forming a \"White Student Union\" and scrawling messages like \"white pride\" in chalk on campus sidewalks.

The next morning, many donned helmets and shields and clashed with counter-protesters before a car drove into the crowd, killing a 32-year-old woman and injuring 19 others.\n\nOn Monday, Texas A&M University cancelled plans for a \"White Lives Matter\" rally in September. On Wednesday, the University of Florida denied a request for white nationalist Richard Spencer to rent space on campus for a September event. Spencer and his supporters are promising court challenges.\n\nExpecting more rallies to come, Riseling's group is planning a series of training events to help campus police prepare.\n\n\"If you're sitting on a campus where this hasn't happened, consider this your wake-up call that it might,\" she said.\n\nLast school year, racist flyers popped up on college campuses at a rate that experts called unprecedented. The Anti-Defamation League counted 161 white supremacist \"flyering incidents\" on 110 college campuses between September and June. Oren Segal, director of the group's Center on Extremism, said the culprits can't be dismissed as harmless trolls.\n\n\"You might have a few that don't take it seriously. But those that do, those are the ones we're concerned about,\" Segal said.\n\nMatthew Heimbach, the 26-year-old leader of the white nationalist Traditionalist Worker Party, admits that dropping leaflets on campuses is a cheap way to generate media coverage.\n\n\"A dollar worth of paper, if it triggers the right person, can become $100,000 in media attention,\" he said.\n\nAs a student at Towson University in Maryland, Heimbach made headlines for forming a \"White Student Union\" and scrawling messages like \"white pride\" in chalk on campus sidewalks. His college years are behind him, but Heimbach still views colleges as promising venues to expand his group's ranks. College students are running four of his group's chapters, he said.\n\n\"The entire dynamic has changed,\" Heimbach said. \"I used to be the youngest person at white nationalist meetings by 20 or 30 years.\"\n\nThe Foundation for the Marketplace of Ideas, a self-described \"alt-right\" nonprofit educational group, says it's offering legal assistance to students caught hanging up posters or flyers containing \"hate facts.\" The \"alt-right\" is a fringe movement loosely mixing white nationalism, anti-Semitism and anti-immigration populism.\n\nOne of the foundation's attorneys, Jason Van Dyke, said he represented a student at Southern Methodist University who was accused last year of posting flyers on campus that said, \"Why White Women Shouldn't Date Black Men.\" The student wasn't suspended or expelled, Van Dyke added.\n\n\"Just because speech makes someone uncomfortable or offends somebody does not make it a violation of the student code of conduct,\" he said.\n\nScores of schools publicly denounced the violence in Virginia this week, including some that learned they enroll students who attended the \"Unite the Right\" rally.\n\nThe University of Nevada, Reno, said it stands against bigotry and racism but concluded there's \"no constitutional or legal reason\" to expel Peter Cvjetanovic, a 20-year-old student and school employee who attended the rally, as an online petition demanded.\n\nOther schools, including Washington State University, condemned the rally but didn't specifically address their students who attended it.\n\nCampus leaders say they walk a fine line when trying to combat messages from hate groups. Many strive to protect speech even if it's offensive but also recognize hate speech can make students feel unsafe. Some schools have sought to counter extremist messages with town halls and events promoting diversity. Others try to avoid drawing attention to hate speech.\n\nAfter flyers promoting white supremacy were posted at Purdue University last school year, Purdue President Mitch Daniels refused to dwell on the incident.\n\n\"This is a transparent effort to bait people into overreacting, thereby giving a minuscule fringe group attention it does not deserve, and that we decline to do,\" Daniels said in a statement at the time.\n\nCameron Padgett, a 23-year-old senior at Georgia State University, only dabbled in campus activism before he decided to organize a speaking engagement for Spencer this year. Padgett sued -- successfully -- for Spencer to speak at Auburn University in April after the school tried to cancel the event.\n\n\"My motivation from the beginning was just free speech,\" he said.\n\nPadgett calls himself an \"identitarian\" -- not a white nationalist -- and insists \"advocating for the interests of white people\" doesn't make him a racist. Padgett said he hasn't faced harassment for working with Spencer and doesn't fear any.\n\n\"There are a lot of people who just sit behind keyboards,\" he said. \"But what are we doing this for if no one wants to show their face?\"\n\nAt Boston University, Fuentes says he met a few others with similar views -- he considers himself a \"white advocate\" -- but mostly found political kinship online. He hosts his own YouTube show and is prolific on social media, but when he heard about the \"Unite the Right\" rally, he saw it as a chance to network in the real world.\n\n\"It was going from online to actually physically assembling somewhere,\" he said. \"We shake hands, we look people in the eye.

The next morning, many donned helmets and shields and clashed with counter-protesters before a car drove into the crowd, killing a 32-year-old woman and injuring 19 others.\n\nOn Monday, Texas A&M University cancelled plans for a \"White Lives Matter\" rally in September. On Wednesday, the University of Florida denied a request for white nationalist Richard Spencer to rent space on campus for a September event. Spencer and his supporters are promising court challenges.\n\nExpecting more rallies to come, Riseling's group is planning a series of training events to help campus police prepare.\n\n\"If you're sitting on a campus where this hasn't happened, consider this your wake-up call that it might,\" she said.\n\nLast school year, racist flyers popped up on college campuses at a rate that experts called unprecedented. The Anti-Defamation League counted 161 white supremacist \"flyering incidents\" on 110 college campuses between September and June. Oren Segal, director of the group's Center on Extremism, said the culprits can't be dismissed as harmless trolls.\n\n\"You might have a few that don't take it seriously. But those that do, those are the ones we're concerned about,\" Segal said.\n\nMatthew Heimbach, the 26-year-old leader of the white nationalist Traditionalist Worker Party, admits that dropping leaflets on campuses is a cheap way to generate media coverage.\n\n\"A dollar worth of paper, if it triggers the right person, can become $100,000 in media attention,\" he said.\n\nAs a student at Towson University in Maryland, Heimbach made headlines for forming a \"White Student Union\" and scrawling messages like \"white pride\" in chalk on campus sidewalks. His college years are behind him, but Heimbach still views colleges as promising venues to expand his group's ranks. College students are running four of his group's chapters, he said.\n\n\"The entire dynamic has changed,\" Heimbach said. \"I used to be the youngest person at white nationalist meetings by 20 or 30 years.\"\n\nThe Foundation for the Marketplace of Ideas, a self-described \"alt-right\" non-profit educational group, says it's offering legal assistance to students caught hanging up posters or flyers containing \"hate facts.\" The \"alt-right\" is a fringe movement loosely mixing white nationalism, anti-Semitism and anti-immigration populism.\n\nOne of the foundation's attorneys, Jason Van Dyke, said he represented a student at Southern Methodist University who was accused last year of posting flyers on campus that said, \"Why White Women Shouldn't Date Black Men.\" The student wasn't suspended or expelled, Van Dyke added.\n\n\"Just because speech makes someone uncomfortable or offends somebody does not make it a violation of the student code of conduct,\" he said.\n\nScores of schools publicly denounced the violence in Virginia this week, including some that learned they enrol students who attended the \"Unite the Right\" rally.\n\nThe University of Nevada, Reno, said it stands against bigotry and racism but concluded there's \"no constitutional or legal reason\" to expel Peter Cvjetanovic, a 20-year-old student and school employee who attended the rally, as an online petition demanded.\n\nOther schools, including Washington State University, condemned the rally but didn't specifically address their students who attended it.\n\nCampus leaders say they walk a fine line when trying to combat messages from hate groups. Many strive to protect speech even if it's offensive but also recognize hate speech can make students feel unsafe. Some schools have sought to counter extremist messages with town halls and events promoting diversity. Others try to avoid drawing attention to hate speech.\n\nAfter flyers promoting white supremacy were posted at Purdue University last school year, Purdue President Mitch Daniels refused to dwell on the incident.\n\n\"This is a transparent effort to bait people into overreacting, thereby giving a minuscule fringe group attention it does not deserve, and that we decline to do,\" Daniels said in a statement at the time.\n\nCameron Padgett, a 23-year-old senior at Georgia State University, only dabbled in campus activism before he decided to organize a speaking engagement for Spencer this year. Padgett sued -- successfully -- for Spencer to speak at Auburn University in April after the school tried to cancel the event.\n\n\"My motivation from the beginning was just free speech,\" he said.\n\nPadgett calls himself an \"identitarian\" -- not a white nationalist -- and insists \"advocating for the interests of white people\" doesn't make him a racist. Padgett said he hasn't faced harassment for working with Spencer and doesn't fear any.\n\n\"There are a lot of people who just sit behind keyboards,\" he said. \"But what are we doing this for if no one wants to show their face?\"\n\nAt Boston University, Fuentes says he met a few others with similar views -- he considers himself a \"white advocate\" -- but mostly found political kinship online. He hosts his own YouTube show and is prolific on social media, but when he heard about the \"Unite the Right\" rally, he saw it as a chance to network in the real world.\n\n\"It was going from online to actually physically assembling somewhere,\" he said. \"We shake hands, we look people in the eye. We actually have some solidarity in the movement.\"\n\nSo, along with a friend from Chicago, Fuentes booked a flight and headed to Virginia.\n\n___\n\nKunzelman reported from Baton Rouge,

Some schools have sought to counter extremist messages with town halls and events promoting diversity. Others try to avoid drawing attention to hate speech.\n\nAfter flyers promoting white supremacy were posted at Purdue University last school year, Purdue President Mitch Daniels refused to dwell on the incident.\n\n\"This is a transparent effort to bait people into overreacting, thereby giving a minuscule fringe group attention it does not deserve, and that we decline to do,\" Daniels said in a statement at the time.\n\nCameron Padgett, a 23-year-old senior at Georgia State University, only dabbled in campus activism before he decided to organize a speaking engagement for Spencer this year. Padgett sued -- successfully -- for Spencer to speak at Auburn University in April after the school tried to cancel the event.\n\n\"My motivation from the beginning was just free speech,\" he said.\n\nPadgett calls himself an \"identitarian\" -- not a white nationalist -- and insists \"advocating for the interests of white people\" doesn't make him a racist. Padgett said he hasn't faced harassment for working with Spencer and doesn't fear any.\n\n\"There are a lot of people who just sit behind keyboards,\" he said. \"But what are we doing this for if no one wants to show their face?\"\n\nAt Boston University, Fuentes says he met a few others with similar views -- he considers himself a \"white advocate\" -- but mostly found political kinship online. He hosts his own YouTube show and is prolific on social media, but when he heard about the \"Unite the Right\" rally, he saw it as a chance to network in the real world.\n\n\"It was going from online to actually physically assembling somewhere,\" he said. \"We shake hands, we look people in the eye. We actually have some solidarity in the movement.\"\n\nSo, along with a friend from Chicago, Fuentes booked a flight and headed to Virginia.", "id": "9852555", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18",

The next morning, many donned helmets and shields and clashed with counter-protesters before a car drove into the crowd, killing a 32-year-old woman and injuring 19 others.\n\nOn Monday, Texas A&M University canceled plans for a \"White Lives Matter\" rally in September. On Wednesday, the University of Florida denied a request for white nationalist Richard Spencer to rent space on campus for a September event. Spencer and his supporters are promising court challenges.\n\nExpecting more rallies to come, Riseling's group is planning a series of training events to help campus police prepare.\n\n\"If you're sitting on a campus where this hasn't happened, consider this your wake-up call that it might,\" she said.\n\n* In Minnesota: Hamline picked to open racial healing center\n\nLast school year, racist flyers popped up on college campuses at a rate that experts called unprecedented. The Anti-Defamation League counted 161 white supremacist \"flyering incidents\" on 110 college campuses between September and June. Oren Segal, director of the group's Center on Extremism, said the culprits can't be dismissed as harmless trolls.\n\n\"You might have a few that don't take it seriously. But those that do, those are the ones we're concerned about,\" Segal said.\n\nMatthew Heimbach, the 26-year-old leader of the white nationalist Traditionalist Worker Party, admits that dropping leaflets on campuses is a cheap way to generate media coverage.\n\n\"A dollar worth of paper, if it triggers the right person, can become $100,000 in media attention,\" he said.\n\nAs a student at Towson University in Maryland, Heimbach made headlines for forming a \"White Student Union\" and scrawling messages like \"white pride\" in chalk on campus sidewalks. His college years are behind him, but Heimbach still views colleges as promising venues to expand his group's ranks. College students are running four of his group's chapters, he said.\n\n\"The entire dynamic has changed,\" Heimbach said. \"I used to be the youngest person at white nationalist meetings by 20 or 30 years.\"\n\nThe Foundation for the Marketplace of Ideas, a self-described \"alt-right\" nonprofit educational group, says it's offering legal assistance to students caught hanging up posters or flyers containing \"hate facts.\" The \"alt-right\" is a fringe movement loosely mixing white nationalism, anti-Semitism and anti-immigration populism.\n\nOne of the foundation's attorneys, Jason Van Dyke, said he represented a student at Southern Methodist University who was accused last year of posting flyers on campus that said, \"Why White Women Shouldn't Date Black Men.\" The student wasn't suspended or expelled, Van Dyke added.\n\n\"Just because speech makes someone uncomfortable or offends somebody does not make it a violation of the student code of conduct,\" he said.\n\nScores of schools publicly denounced the violence in Virginia this week, including some that learned they enroll students who attended the \"Unite the Right\" rally.\n\nThe University of Nevada, Reno, said it stands against bigotry and racism but concluded there's \"no constitutional or legal reason\" to expel Peter Cvjetanovic, a 20-year-old student and school employee who attended the rally, as an online petition demanded.\n\nOther schools, including Washington State University, condemned the rally but didn't specifically address their students who attended it.\n\nCampus leaders say they walk a fine line when trying to combat messages from hate groups. Many strive to protect speech even if it's offensive but also recognize hate speech can make students feel unsafe. Some schools have sought to counter extremist messages with town halls and events promoting diversity. Others try to avoid drawing attention to hate speech.\n\nAfter flyers promoting white supremacy were posted at Purdue University last school year, Purdue President Mitch Daniels refused to dwell on the incident.\n\n* Help MPR News cover racism and acts of aggression against marginalized communities\n\n\"This is a transparent effort to bait people into overreacting, thereby giving a minuscule fringe group attention it does not deserve, and that we decline to do,\" Daniels said in a statement at the time.\n\nCameron Padgett, a 23-year-old senior at Georgia State University, only dabbled in campus activism before he decided to organize a speaking engagement for Spencer this year.

The next morning, many donned helmets and shields and clashed with counter-protesters before a car drove into the crowd, killing a 32-year-old woman and injuring 19 others.\n\nOn Monday, Texas A&M University canceled plans for a \"White Lives Matter\" rally in September. On Wednesday, the University of Florida denied a request for white nationalist Richard Spencer to rent space on campus for a September event. Spencer and his supporters are promising court challenges.\n\nExpecting more rallies to come, Riseling's group is planning a series of training events to help campus police prepare.\n\nRelated Boston grants permit for weekend rally on Common\n\n\"If you're sitting on a campus where this hasn't happened, consider this your wake-up call that it might,\" she said.\n\nLast school year, racist flyers popped up on college campuses at a rate that experts called unprecedented. The Anti-Defamation League counted 161 white supremacist \"flyering incidents\" on 110 college campuses between September and June. Oren Segal, director of the group's Center on Extremism, said the culprits can't be dismissed as harmless trolls.\n\n\"You might have a few that don't take it seriously. But those that do, those are the ones we're concerned about,\" Segal said.\n\nMatthew Heimbach, center, voices his displeasure at the media after a court hearing for James Alex Fields Jr., in front of the court in Charlottesville, Va. A judge has denied bond for Fields, who is accused of plowing his car into a crowd at a white nationalist rally. Associated Press/Steve Helber, File\n\nMatthew Heimbach, the 26-year-old leader of the white nationalist Traditionalist Worker Party, admits that dropping leaflets on campuses is a cheap way to generate media coverage.\n\n\"A dollar worth of paper, if it triggers the right person, can become $100,000 in media attention,\" he said.\n\nAs a student at Towson University in Maryland, Heimbach made headlines for forming a \"White Student Union\" and scrawling messages like \"white pride\" in chalk on campus sidewalks. His college years are behind him, but Heimbach still views colleges as promising venues to expand his group's ranks. College students are running four of his group's chapters, he said.\n\n\"The entire dynamic has changed,\" Heimbach said. \"I used to be the youngest person at white nationalist meetings by 20 or 30 years.\"\n\nThe Foundation for the Marketplace of Ideas, a self-described \"alt-right\" nonprofit educational group, says it's offering legal assistance to students caught hanging up posters or flyers containing \"hate facts.\" The \"alt-right\" is a fringe movement loosely mixing white nationalism, anti-Semitism and anti-immigration populism.\n\nOne of the foundation's attorneys, Jason Van Dyke, said he represented a student at Southern Methodist University who was accused last year of posting flyers on campus that said, \"Why White Women Shouldn't Date Black Men.\" The student wasn't suspended or expelled, Van Dyke added.\n\n\"Just because speech makes someone uncomfortable or offends somebody does not make it a violation of the student code of conduct,\" he said.\n\nScores of schools publicly denounced the violence in Virginia this week, including some that learned they enroll students who attended the \"Unite the Right\" rally.\n\nThe University of Nevada, Reno, said it stands against bigotry and racism but concluded there's \"no constitutional or legal reason\" to expel Peter Cvjetanovic, a 20-year-old student and school employee who attended the rally, as an online petition demanded.\n\nOther schools, including Washington State University, condemned the rally but didn't specifically address their students who attended it.\n\nCampus leaders say they walk a fine line when trying to combat messages from hate groups. Many strive to protect speech even if it's offensive but also recognize hate speech can make students feel unsafe. Some schools have sought to counter extremist messages with town halls and events promoting diversity. Others try to avoid drawing attention to hate speech.\n\nAfter flyers promoting white supremacy were posted at Purdue University last school year, Purdue President Mitch Daniels refused to dwell on the incident.\n\n\"This is a transparent effort to bait people into overreacting, thereby giving a minuscule fringe group attention it does not deserve, and that we decline to do,\" Daniels said in a statement at the time.\n\nCameron Padgett, a 23-year-old senior at Georgia State University, only dabbled in campus activism before he decided to organize a speaking engagement for Spencer this year. Padgett sued - successfully - for Spencer to speak at Auburn University in April after the school tried to cancel the event.\n\n\"My motivation from the beginning was just free speech,\" he said.\n\nPadgett calls himself an \"identitarian\" - not a white nationalist - and insists \"advocating for the interests of white people\" doesn't make him a racist. Padgett said he hasn't faced harassment for working with Spencer and doesn't fear any.\n\n\"There are a lot of people who just sit behind keyboards,\" he said. \"But what are we doing this for if no one wants to show their face?\"\n\nAt Boston University, Fuentes says he met a few others with similar views - he considers himself a \"white advocate\" - but mostly found political kinship online. He hosts his own YouTube show and is prolific on social media, but when he heard about the \"Unite the Right\" rally, he saw it as a chance to network in the real world.\n\n\"It was going from online to actually physically assembling somewhere,\" he said. \"We shake hands, we look people in the eye. We actually have some solidarity in the movement.\"\n\nSo, along with a friend from Chicago, Fuentes booked a flight and headed to Virginia.\n\nShare\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nWant the news vital to Maine?

Associated Press/Teresa Crawford Matthew Heimbach, center, voices his displeasure at the media after a court hearing for James Alex Fields Jr., in front of the court in Charlottesville, Va. A judge has denied bond for Fields, who is accused of plowing his car into a crowd at a white nationalist rally. Associated Press/Steve Helber, File Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192\n\nNow, he's hoping to transfer to Auburn University in Alabama.\n\n\"I'm ready to return to my base, return to my roots, to rally the troops and see what I can do down there,\" Fuentes said in an interview this week.\n\nAt college campuses, far-right extremist groups have found fertile ground to spread their messages and attract new followers.\n\nAnd for many schools, the rally in Virginia served as a warning that these groups will no longer limit their efforts to social media or to flyers furtively posted around campus.\n\n\"It seems like what might have been a little in the shadows has come into full sun, and now it's out there and exposed for everyone to see,\" said Sue Riseling, a former police chief at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who is executive director of the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators.\n\nThe violence in Charlottesville introduced many Americans to a new brand of hate, bred on internet message boards and migrating to the streets with increasing frequency.\n\nOn the eve of Saturday's rally, young white men wearing khakis and white polo shirts marched through the University of Virginia's campus, holding torches as they chanted racist and anti-Semitic slogans. The next morning, many donned helmets and shields and clashed with counter-protesters before a car drove into the crowd, killing a 32-year-old woman and injuring 19 others.\n\nOn Monday, Texas A&M University canceled plans for a \"White Lives Matter\" rally in September. On Wednesday, the University of Florida denied a request for white nationalist Richard Spencer to rent space on campus for a September event. Spencer and his supporters are promising court challenges.\n\nExpecting more rallies to come, Riseling's group is planning a series of training events to help campus police prepare.\n\n\"If you're sitting on a campus where this hasn't happened, consider this your wake-up call that it might,\" she said.\n\nLast school year, racist flyers popped up on college campuses at a rate that experts called unprecedented. The Anti-Defamation League counted 161 white supremacist \"flyering incidents\" on 110 college campuses between September and June. Oren Segal, director of the group's Center on Extremism, said the culprits can't be dismissed as harmless trolls.\n\n\"You might have a few that don't take it seriously. But those that do, those are the ones we're concerned about,\" Segal said.\n\nMatthew Heimbach, the 26-year-old leader of the white nationalist Traditionalist Worker Party, admits that dropping leaflets on campuses is a cheap way to generate media coverage.\n\n\"A dollar worth of paper, if it triggers the right person, can become $100,000 in media attention,\" he said.\n\nAs a student at Towson University in Maryland, Heimbach made headlines for forming a \"White Student Union\" and scrawling messages like \"white pride\" in chalk on campus sidewalks. His college years are behind him, but Heimbach still views colleges as promising venues to expand his group's ranks. College students are running four of his group's chapters, he said.\n\n\"The entire dynamic has changed,\" Heimbach said. \"I used to be the youngest person at white nationalist meetings by 20 or 30 years.\"\n\nThe Foundation for the Marketplace of Ideas, a self-described \"alt-right\" nonprofit educational group, says it's offering legal assistance to students caught hanging up posters or flyers containing \"hate facts.\" The \"alt-right\" is a fringe movement loosely mixing white nationalism, anti-Semitism and anti-immigration populism.\n\nOne of the foundation's attorneys, Jason Van Dyke, said he represented a student at Southern Methodist University who was accused last year of posting flyers on campus that said, \"Why White Women Shouldn't Date Black Men.\" The student wasn't suspended or expelled, Van Dyke added.\n\n\"Just because speech makes someone uncomfortable or offends somebody does not make it a violation of the student code of conduct,\" he said.\n\nScores of schools publicly denounced the violence in Virginia this week, including some that learned they enroll students who attended the \"Unite the Right\" rally.\n\nThe University of Nevada, Reno, said it stands against bigotry and racism but concluded there's \"no constitutional or legal reason\" to expel Peter Cvjetanovic, a 20-year-old student and school employee who attended the rally, as an online petition demanded.\n\nOther schools, including Washington State University, condemned the rally but didn't specifically address their students who attended it.\n\nCampus leaders say they walk a fine line when trying to combat messages from hate groups. Many strive to protect speech even if it's offensive but also recognize hate speech can make students feel unsafe. Some schools have sought to counter extremist messages with town halls and events promoting diversity. Others try to avoid drawing attention to hate speech.\n\nAfter flyers promoting white supremacy were posted at Purdue University last school year, Purdue President Mitch Daniels refused to dwell on the incident.\n\n\"This is a transparent effort to bait people into overreacting, thereby giving a minuscule fringe group attention it does not deserve, and that we decline to do,\" Daniels said in a statement at the time.\n\nCameron Padgett, a 23-year-old senior at Georgia State University, only dabbled in campus activism before he decided to organize a speaking engagement for Spencer this year. Padgett sued - successfully - for Spencer to speak at Auburn University in April after the school tried to cancel the event.\n\n\"My motivation from the beginning was just free speech,\" he said.\n\nPadgett calls himself an \"identitarian\" - not a white nationalist - and insists \"advocating for the interests of white people\" doesn't make him a racist. Padgett said he hasn't faced harassment for working with Spencer and doesn't fear any.\n\n\"There are a lot of people who just sit behind keyboards,\" he said. \"But what are we doing this for if no one wants to show their face?\"\n\nAt Boston University, Fuentes says he met a few others with similar views - he considers himself a \"white advocate\" - but mostly found political kinship online. He hosts his own YouTube show and is prolific on social media, but when he heard about the \"Unite the Right\" rally, he saw it as a chance to network in the real world.\n\n\"It was going from online to actually physically assembling somewhere,\" he said. \"We shake hands, we look people in the eye. We actually have some solidarity in the movement.\"\n\nSo, along with a friend from Chicago, Fuentes booked a flight and headed to Virginia.\n\nShare\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nWant the news vital to Maine?

He said \"anybody who tries to jump the barriers will be stopped by police.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, FSU President Richard Lapidus sent an email to the university's student body letting them know that \"one of our students may be an organizer\" of the rally without mentioning Medlar by name, but also referencing \"another student\" who recently sent him a letter about the Boston rally.\n\nLapidus, in the email, said: \"The university does not have any involvement in the Boston Free Speech event.\n\nBoston Free Speech posted a flier on Facebook describing the upcoming rally as a gathering of the \"New Free Speech Movement,\" the News Service previously reported. The flier encourages President Donald Trump supporters, libertarians, conservatives, traditionalists and \"classic liberals\" to attend Saturday and \"reassert their right to the most basic necessity of civil society.\"\n\nMedlar said he is a libertarian and not a member of the \"real far right.\" He denounced hate groups like neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan, and singled out two groups that have advocated violence -- Identity Europa and Vanguard -- as not being welcome at Saturday's rally.\n\nBoston Mayor Marty Walsh discouraged protesters from converging on the city Saturday, and he and Gov. Charlie Baker, during a press conference Monday, denounced racial violence at the deadly protest in Charlottesville, Va., last weekend.\n\nMedlar is the chapter leader of Young Americans for Liberty at Fitchburg State, according to the group's website, though Lapidus said the university does not have a recognized chapter of that organization.\n\nYoung Americans for Liberty is a nonprofit group focused on libertarian values and free speech that formed at the end of former Texas U.S. Rep. Ron Paul's 2008 presidential campaign. It operates via chapters on college campuses.\n\nAccording to a blog post penned by Medlar in May, the university's Student Government Association voted not to recognize the chapter as a club. The organization's website claims it has chapters at dozens of colleges and universities in the state, including Harvard University, the University of Massachusetts Amherst and Boston University.\n\n\"Fitchburg State University has long been, and will continue to be, a community that values diversity and inclusiveness and understands the richness they bring,\" Lapidus said. \"The institution upholds freedom of expression when free inquiry advances greater understanding among diverse viewpoints.\"\n\nOther university officials in the state who have spoken out following the violence in Charlottesville include UMass President Marty Meehan and UMass Amherst Chancellor Kumble Subbaswamy.", "id": "9697540", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Fitchburg State

The organization's website claims it has chapters at dozens of colleges and universities in the commonwealth including Harvard University, the University of Massachusetts Amherst and Boston University.\n\nOther university officials in the state who have spoken out following the violence in Charlottesville include UMass President Marty Meehan and UMass Amherst Chancellor Kumble

He said he knew of no plans for anyone attending the rally to foment violence but they would defend themselves if attacked.\n\n\"He wanted to avoid that rally from turning into another Charlottesville,\" Cantwell said of the task force member.\n\n\"I told him I don't know who is organizing the Boston rally but that if I found out anybody on the al-right was planning on initiating force against anybody that I would absolutely tell him,\" he said.\n\n\"Every alt-right rally I've been aware of or I've been part of, the people go there prepared to use force to defend themselves if necessary because people attack us,\" he said.\n\nCantwell, who lives in Keene, New Hampshire, said he can't attend the Boston rally because of what he said were outstanding legal issues stemming from violence he was involved in during the Charlottesville rally.\n\n\"I wouldn't go anyway because I can't carry a gun in Boston and people want to hurt me,\" he said.\n\nShare\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nWant the news vital to Maine?

The Boston Parks Department issued a permit to the coalition on Wednesday.\n\nMedlar, a 23-year-old student at Fitchburg State University, described the group as a grassroots collective of young citizens \"concerned about the political violence that has arisen in this country.\"\n\n\"We want to promote good arguments from both the left and right,\" he said. \"We want to promote people getting together around the shared constitutional values that form the basis of our society.\"\n\nMedlar met with the Boston Police Department on Wednesday morning to discuss details for the rally, which has quickly garnered controversy following the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend.\n\nThe group maintained that they are not associated with the event in Charlottesville and that this rally is not intended to promote white supremacy.\n\n\"The point of rally is to promote speaking and listening to each other as an alternative to violence,\" Medlar said. \"We're not trying to spread hate - quite the opposite. We're trying to de-radicalize the fringes.\"\n\nA BPD spokesperson confirmed that officers met with an event organizer on Wednesday, adding that \"the department will be prepared to provide appropriate coverage to ensure for the safety of all.\"\n\nMedlar said that he was told BPD will provide physical barriers to separate protesters from counterprotesters, that the department has an emergency evacuation plan \"if anything goes terribly wrong\" and that officers will be searching bags to ensure that no one brings weapons of any sort.\n\nThat includes sticks and flagpoles, he said, though he added that people can still bring flags.\n\n\"Make no mistake: we do not welcome any hate groups to Boston and we reject their message,\" Mayor Marty Walsh said in a statement. \"This morning, the Boston Free Speech Coalition met with the Boston Police Department to work on a safe pathway forward and agreed to specific stipulations for a rally on Boston Common this Saturday. We have made it clear that we will not tolerate incitements to violence or any threatening behavior. I ask that everyone join me in making Boston a more inclusive, welcoming, love-filled city for all.\"\n\nWhen asked if he knows of any attendees planning on bringing Nazi or Confederate flags, Medlar said \"that is going counter to our message that our group is attempting to promote.\"\n\nMultiple controversial speakers initially listed on a poster promoting the rally have since dropped out of the event. Gavin McInnes, co-founder of Vice Media and founder of a far-right men's organization called Proud Boys, said on his Twitter that he will not be attending.\n\nI am not going to the Boston rally anymore. Mayor revoking permit = \"I want a riot.\" #ProudBoys DISAVOW. pic.twitter.com/36a6Vo4k8z -- Gavin McInnes (@Gavin_McInnes)\n\nAugust 14, 2017\n\nDespite a post from the Boston Free Speech Facebook account saying that Baked Alaska is attending, Medlar said that he is not.\n\n\"I think that one of our people tried to invite Baked Alaska without consulting the rest of us - that was a mistake,\" he said.\n\nStill, Medlar confirmed that other controversial speakers were initially invited, like Augustus Invictus, who attended the Charlottesville rally and reportedly has proclaimed himself a god who kills goats and drinks their blood, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nInvictus is no longer attending, but Joe Biggs, formerly of InfoWars, is still confirmed as a speaker.\n\n\"They were invited in the first place because, in our talks with them, we believe that they believe as strongly in free speech for all Americans as we do,\" Medlar said. \"That's not just a white thing, that's for all races, colors and creeds.\"\n\nMedlar added that even someone \"as controversial as Augustus\" identifies as libertarian.\n\nShiva Ayyadurai, who is running for Senate in Massachusetts as a Republican, challenging Democratic incumbent Elizabeth Warren, will also be speaking at the rally, Medlar said. Ayyadurai confirmed he will be speaking at the event, saying, \"Come to the event, that's the best thing to do. If you come, you'll understand why,\" when asked for the reason behind his appearance.\n\nONLY a REAL INDIAN can defeat THE FAKE INDIAN.

There's no shortage of them.\"\n\n\"We knew that whatever was going to happen, there was going to be relevant issues for us to rally for. Charlottesville completely caught us by surprise,\" he added. \"It threw everything off.\"\n\nThe rally will take place regardless of the controversy that preceded it. Medlar hopes people will be \"pleasantly surprised\" by the event.\n\n\"We hope that we show them we are ideologically opposite of what rumors on the internet have been painting us out to be,\" he said. \"We hope, in coordination with the Boston Police Department and the city of Boston, we will be able to get this done, do it right, cleanly, in an organized fashion, and hope everyone goes home

The 18-year-old student who attended the white nationalist rally in Virginia last weekend says he has withdrawn from college in Boston in part because of death threats. (Photo: Teresa Crawford, AP)\n\nSeveral men who attended the \"Unite the Right\" rallies last weekend in Charlottesville, Va., have found that their participation is affecting their lives. A couple lost their jobs, for example. And student Nicholas J. Fuentes says he will not be returning to Boston University, citing death threats he says he received after attending the rallies.\n\nFuentes says he'll take the fall semester off and plans to attend Auburn University in the spring, according to the Boston Globe.\n\n\"There were several considerations that went into (transferring), but the last straw that crystallized my decision was the fact that I didn't feel safe on campus,\" Fuentes tells USA TODAY College. \"With this recent event in Charlottesville, I got a new batch of (death threats). I had already decided (I was going to leave), but these recent threats confirmed that this was the right call.\"\n\nWhile Fuentes, 18, didn't release any specific threats, he says \"people had been harassing me on Twitter from Boston, telling me to meet me at restaurants down the street from where I lived. It got to a point where I didn't feel safe.\"\n\nFuentes's rose to prominence on campus at BU when he was featured in a video by BU Today, the university's official news source, about his political views.\n\nIn the video, Fuentes explains why he planned to vote for Donald Trump. Sporting his trademark Make America Great Again hat, Fuentes endorses \"the cultural transformation Trump is talking about.\"\n\nFuentes came under some criticism for the video, and he fought back.\n\n2 Notes:\n\n1. If you are a \"Man for Hillary,\" cut off your balls immediately, you've lost your right to them.\n\n2. Multiculturalism is cancer.\n\n-- Nicholas J. Fuentes (@NickJFuentes) October 31, 2016\n\nDisagreement deepened into controversy when conservative news website Campus Reform covered Fuentes coming under fire for his support of then-candidate Trump.\n\nCampus Reform's article included Facebook posts by BU student Ian Fitzgerald criticizing Fuentes. Fitzgerald says he received death threats as a result, and shared with USA TODAY College a screenshot of one such threat.\n\nBut after Fuentes posted on Facebook about his experience in Charlottesville, Campus Reform director Cabot Phillips publicly accused Fuentes of racism in a tweet.\n\nAt least people like @NickJFuentes are no longer being subtle about their hate.\n\nGlad you & your racist buddies had a good time yesterday. pic.twitter.com/DitBzQqlm4\n\n-- Cabot Phillips (@cabot_phillips) August 13, 2017\n\nFuentes isn't having it.\n\n\"This was really a callout to all of the young conservatives in think-tanks and their cushy jobs that aren't really being honest or truthful about what's going on,\" Fuentes says about being criticized by fellow conservatives.\n\nFuentes hosts a daily conservative YouTube talk show called \"America First\" on the Right Side Broadcasting Channel. Shortly before going to Charlottesville, Fuentes said on his show that he \"will be there to rally the troops ... if you see me, don't kill me, please.\"\n\nDespite his participation in the \"Unite the Right\" rally, Fuentes says he does not consider himself a neo-Nazi, white supremacist or member of the so-called \"alt-right.\"\n\n\"It's funny, so many people have been calling me all of these names,\" he says. \"My last name is Fuentes, but at the same time I am a 'white supremacist.' I'm Catholic, too, so they're calling me a Klansman, but the KKK hated Catholics.\"\n\nInstead, Fuentes said he identifies as a \"paleo-conservative,\" or someone who adopts traditional conservative values.\n\n\"I went down to Unite the Right because the majority of people who were there were there to protest mass migration and the removal of Confederate statues,\" Fuentes said.\n\nHe believes the violence at the rally came exclusively from counter-protesters, except for the car attack that killed a counter-protester named Heather Heyer and injured 19 others.\n\n\"It was very chaotic and catastrophic, and I think a lot of that is a result of counter-protesters and the government,\" Fuentes says.\n\nWhen asked if he was guilty by association for marching alongside people with such extremist views, Fuentes said that if so, then such association extends to many others.\n\n\"If I was guilty by association, that would mean that everyone who supported Black Lives Matter is guilty of killing police officers,\" he says. \"I would say that anyone that's ever been to a mosque and has preached radical Islamism is guilty of terrorism.\"\n\n\"There is exactly one picture of a Nazi flag out there, and there was one person holding it,\" Fuentes says, before conceding, \"Well, there were a couple.\" However, he says, \"The majority of the people who were there were in MAGA hats, duck hunting outfits, and were there to express their concern over the removal of Confederate statues.\"\n\nFuentes claims his advocacy calls not for the deaths of minorities, but for immigration reform. He believes that whites, not minorities, are the victims of discrimination.\n\n\"We basically live in a country where if you're white, you are a second-class citizen. If you apply to colleges, you will be discriminated against. If you apply for a job, you will be discriminated against because you are white,\" he says. It's not an activist statement, but an objective observation.\"\n\nMany at BU know him from incendiary social media posts.\n\nWhen rising sophomore Samantha Delgado tangled with Fuentes about his political views over Facebook, she was met with this comment:\n\n(Screenshot provided by Samantha Delgado)\n\nBU students have had strong reactions to the news that Fuentes is leaving the university.\n\n\"He's a white supremacist who masks his racism as 'white advocacy.' I'm ecstatic that he is no longer attending BU and wish him no success in his future endeavors,\" says Jazmyne Jackson, a rising BU senior.\n\n\"If you don't want death threats, you don't fight for the oppression of all people that aren't white men. Nick Fuentes is advocating for the eradication of POC, women, LGBTQ, the disabled, and other minorities, but he's trying to make himself seem like the victim,\" says BU student Seb Tellez.\n\nFuentes does have his supporters at BU.\n\n\"I had the pleasure of having dinner with him once, and I realized just how brilliant he was,\" says Ashley Stuart, a rising sophomore. \"Don't get me wrong -- his views are crazy. But strictly his book smarts were amazing. He could name every single country on the planet.\"\n\nReflecting on leaving BU, Fuentes says he, as a conservative, feels less safe in Boston than liberals do in the South. \"If you go down South and are a liberal, you won't fear for your life.\"\n\nRelated: UNR resists calls to expel student who marched in Charlottesville Kalina Newman is a Boston University student and a USA TODAY digital

We must, I believe, explicitly denounce white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups that make such claims.\"", "id": "9792785", "details": {"liCnt": 60}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Student Who Attended White Supremacist Rally Leaves Boston University", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/nicholas-fuentes-boston-university.jpg?w=720", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "200134", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "209299", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "242094", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Social media"}, "id": "302545", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media"}, {"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Email"}, "id": "302685", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email"}, {"label": {"eng": "Racism"}, "id": "302940", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "Politics"}, "id": "302948", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Violence"}, "id": "302966", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence"}, {"label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}, "id": "303042", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Immigration"}, "id": "303047", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration"}, {"label": {"eng": "White people"}, "id": "303415", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people"}, {"label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}, "id": "303910", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}, "id": "305776", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Morality"}, "id": "309388", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boston University"}, "id": "312166", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_University"}, {"label": {"eng": "Multiculturalism"}, "id": "314165", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiculturalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "The Boston Globe"}, "id": "318590", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Globe"}, {"label": {"eng": "Protest"}, "id": "319773", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protest"}, {"label": {"eng": "White nationalism"}, "id": "394340", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_nationalism"}, {"label": {"eng": "Robert Brown (Scottish botanist from Montrose)"}, "id": "1288917", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Brown_(Scottish_botanist_from_Montrose)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 393, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 705, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1154, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Events", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Events"}], "time": "23:14:00"}

He said no longer felt safe on campus, and will not return for the fall semester.\n\nStill, despite the intensity of the backlash he's received, he has absolutely \"no regrets\" about taking part in the controversial white-nationalist movement.\n\n\"I went to represent this new strain of conservatives, of people in the right wing who are opposed to mass immigration and multiculturalism,\" Fuentes told Fox News on Thursday. \"For a long time, this existed on the fringes. I thought it was a political victory - we exposed the removal of Confederate statues, and this disenfranchised group of white males.\"\n\nA Boston University spokesman confirmed to Fox News that the student had indeed left the school earlier this week and that \"the safety and security of our students is our highest priority.\"\n\nWhile the ideology of the movement, he contended, used to be associated only with older men in America \"like Pat Buchanan and Samuel Francis,\" he believes a significant wave in the younger generation have been captivated by the ideology.\n\n\"We have basically been told our whole lives that white people are racist and evil and should be erased,\" Fuentes explained. \"We have basically been told that it is a crime to be born a white male.\"\n\nThe student, who hails from a suburb of Chicago, is of Mexican lineage and contends that he and almost all other attendees did not go to the rally out of racist motivations, but rather most were like him and consider themselves to be \"preservationists\" staunchly against high levels of immigration.\n\n\"The picture the media keeps using is of one person with a Nazi flag, there were more one thousand there who didn't have Nazi flags,\" Fuentes said. \"The vast majority of people there were regular, decent people. I didn't meet a single violent person. Our side is just preservationist.\"\n\nCHARLOTTESVILLE WHITE NATIONALIST RALLY BLAMED FOR 3 DEATHS, DOZENS OF INJURIES\n\nFuentes noted that the Charlottesville rally had been in the works for about three months, and that people joined the fray not only from all over the U.S., but from Canada and various countries in Europe. But after posting on social media about going to the event - which turned tragic after a driver rammed a car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing a woman - Fuentes' own firestorm began.\n\n\"I suddenly got dozens of messages on Twitter and Facebook telling me to go and kill myself and that if they see me they will beat the sh-- out of me. Stuff of that nature,\" he said. \"At least 10 to 20 of them were death threats.\"\n\nFuentes said Boston University had given him opportunities to express his political views -- and his support of Donald Trump -- leading up to the November presidential election last year.\n\nCHARLOTTESVILLE AND A 'NEW GENERATION OF WHITE SUPREMACISTS'\n\n\"I made a short video presentation about my support for Trump before the election and that caused a major uproar. People wanted to organize a debate between myself and a big Hillary supporter,\" Fuentes recalled. \"We went to the Dean and they gave us an auditorium, a police officer for security detail, they really made it happen.\"\n\nHe is now taking a semester off and then intends to start at Auburn University in Alabama in the spring.\n\n\"It was one of my first picks after high school,\" Fuentes continued, adding that the \"friendly territory\" of the Deep South will enable him to express his opinions freely without jeopardizing his safety.\n\nTRUMP 'ENTIRELY CORRECT' TO BLAME BOTH SIDES FOR CHARLOTTESVILLE VIOLENCE, WHITE HOUSE SAYS\n\nIn addition to studies, he hosts his own YouTube talk show modeled after Trump's key campaign catchphrase \"Make America Great Again,\" and highlighted that he mostly has liberal-leaning friends - but the few who are conservative have experienced widespread backlash from their university peers across the country.\n\n\"Even worse than the threats I have received,\" Fuentes surmised.\n\nAnd even though he stands staunchly by his beliefs and makes no apology about making his mark in Charlottesville, he doesn't plan on attending any such rallies in the near future.\n\n\"Everyone is a little shaken up,\" Fuentes added. \"The political climate has become so intense and so violent and toxic.\"\n\nHollie McKay has been a FoxNews.com staff reporter since 2007.

One threat as seen by IBT read, \"We are going to kill you instead of reasoning with you.\"\n\nThe threats on campus started after Fuentes tweeted, \"Multiculturalism is a cancer,\" as a freshman last year. Fuentes, paradoxically, is of Mexican heritage. His tweets are now all deleted.\n\n\"Multiculturalism means that you don't have a dominant culture in a country. It's really sort of this paradox where... the left believes people should be coming here and should be assimilating, but at the same time they want multiculturalism,\" said Fuentes.\n\nFuentes said that multiculturalism and the lack of a Northern European, Anglo-Saxon, American monoculture will bring the U.S. down\n\nFuentes, who is from a suburb of Chicago, entered into a campus debate last November before the election to argue for Trump. He said the threats continued after the debate. Fuentes, a huge Trump supporter, also has a YouTube talk show named after the president's main policy goal, \"America First.\"\n\nFuentes is against the current U.S. immigration policies, and that's why he was in Charlottesville.\n\n\"I wanted to go there to demonstrate against mass immigration. It's an issue that nobody talks about. It doesn't get any media attention,\" said Fuentes. \"I think the purpose of this rally was two-fold, I mean the slogan of the rally was, 'You will not replace us,' and that refers to the demographic displacement of white people in European and Western countries and also to the cultural genocide of white and European people.\"\n\nHe argued his family immigrated to the U.S. before the 20th century, making comparisons to his family and immigration \"apples and oranges.\" The problem he has with immigration today is the amount of people entering the country. When his family came to the U.S., it was under a stricter immigration policy that allowed immigrants to assimilate more to the U.S., he argued. People in circumstances like his family's should be grandfathered.\n\n\"The people that come from Mexico now don't integrate. They don't learn the language. They don't adopt our values. There's corruption ... like the president said they bring drugs, they bring crime,\" said Fuentes.\n\nFuentes said he is not for a white \"ethno-state,\" but that he is a \"preservationist.\" He wants the U.S. to return to pre-1965 levels of immigration. The Hart-Celler Act of 1965 abolished immigration quotas in the U.S. and opened immigration to more people. Fuentes thinks the country should return to the early 20th century when it was over 80 percent white.\n\nThe Charlottesville rally, dubbed \"Unite the Right,\" Friday and Saturday contained a large contingent of neo-Nazis, Ku Klux Klan and white supremacists. It ended in violence when Heather Heyer, 32, was struck and killed by a car that plowed into a group of counterprotesters. The car was driven by a man with alleged ties to white supremacy.\n\nDespite large chants like, \"Jews will not replace us,\" Fuentes said the number of extremists at the rally has been over hyped. There were at most 10, and that some of the people could be federal agents or people chanting ironically, he claimed. Fuentes condemns neo-Nazis and white supremacist groups, but can see how these groups exist.\n\n\"You know, you push white people on the left for 20-30 years and I don't think anybody should be surprised that you get some pretty ugly strains of white identity,\" said Fuentes. \"How long have white people been discriminated against with affirmative action we've been spoken down to by the media by the president for years and years.\"\n\nFuentes was studying Political Science at Boston University. But after Saturday's rally, he is taking a semester off and will head to Alabama's Auburn University in the spring.\n\nOther universities have seen conservative and alt-right thinkers and speakers meet condemnation and even violence. Alt-right speaker Milo Yiannopoulos was prevented from speaking at the University of California, Berkeley, in January when violence marred the campus. Anne Coulter, a right-wing commentator, was also forced to skip speaking at the University. Protests at Middlebury College in March disrupted author Charles Murray from speaking.\n\nAs summer turns to fall, divisions wrought over the summer and election may come again to roost in dorm rooms and quads.\n\nBoston University and Auburn University did not return requests for comment.", "id": "9778029", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Student Of Mexican Heritage Flees Boston

The guy likes to talk, mostly about how he doesn't want his cause to be lumped in with white supremacists just because they're likely to show up at his event, and can rationalize almost anything, or at least attempt to distance himself from evil. Medlar is on the Common this afternoon, and spitting the following sort of background and nonsense to any hack who is willing to listen:\n\nThough we're not excited to give Medlar and his tiny outfit any more attention, that's pretty much out of our hands at this point. The national media has arrived, and they're already doing everything that you probably hate about the national media. From covering the rally like a horse race -- who's speaking, who's not, who has a permit, who doesn't -- to giving an immature contrarian a far bigger podium than he deserves.\n\nWhile we don't recommend listening to Medlar too much, this video filmed by local filmmaker and artist Rod Webber is worth watching. In the first part (before Webber conducts his own interview), the organizer is speaking with a reporter from Al Jazeera English, and it's actually a decent and revealing chat. At one point, the reporter even gets Medlar to say that he thinks \"creeping Sharia Law\" is \"something to be aware of.\" Soon after, however, all your foulest television news nightmares come true, as a producer sets up Medlar for a classic walking shot, then positions him all over the Common like a model on a fashion shoot.", "id": "9775499", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "WATCH THIS TV NEWS CREW POSE THE FREE SPEECH RALLY ORGANIZER LIKE A MODEL ON A RUNWAY", "image": "https://digboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1-Rod-Webber.png", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "209299", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}, "id": "305969", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Talk radio"}, "id": "306009", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_radio"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sharia"}, "id": "306310", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}, "id": "316063", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Al Jazeera English"}, "id": "352317", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera_English"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boston Common"}, "id": "470390", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Common"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mespilus germanica"}, "id": "509708", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mespilus_germanica"}, {"label": {"eng": "Free Speech Coalition"}, "id": "846527", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Speech_Coalition"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 291, "label": "dmoz/News/Media", "uri": "dmoz/News/Media"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 333, "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 393, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 414, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Speech Technology", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Speech_Technology"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 465, "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 762, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1254, "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Organic", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Organic"}], "time": "20:55:00"}

Police are banning any weapons from the Common, including large sticks, and backpacks will be subject to search.\n\nRally participants and counter-protesters will be separated by barricades, Evans said.\n\n\"We don't want a repeat of what happened in Charlottesville,\" Evans said. \"Boston is too united, we have a city that doesn't tolerate hatred and bigotry and we wanted to make it clear to both groups.\"\n\nWalsh said, \"We're not going to tolerate any bad behavior there.

It is more important than ever that we stand up to Marxism and support our President Donald Trump,\" Chapman posted on Facebook. \"We knew this time was coming. It's time to honor our ancestors. This event is for the Brave. Cowards stay home.\"\n\nChapman spoke at a previous free speech rally at the Common in May, and has been an outspoken supporter online of participants in Charlottesville's \"Unite the Right\" rally.

(AP/Sipa)\n\nA rally by right-wing demonstrators on the famed Boston Common, planned for this Saturday, failed to register on Marty Walsh's radar last week.\n\nThe Boston mayor knew little about Boston Free Speech Coalition, the group that defines itself as \"a coalition of libertarians, progressives, conservatives, and independents\" that seeks to \"peaceably engage in open dialogue about the threats to, and importance of, free speech and civil liberties.\"\n\nBy that definition, it sounds like a tame gathering of First Amendment lovers. But the group -- which has also expressed interest in marching against immigrant sanctuary cities -- invited two white nationalists to address the crowd at its upcoming rally.\n\nAfter last weekend's \"Unite the Right\" event in Charlottesville, Va., in which neo-Nazis and white nationalists clashed violently with anti-racism protesters, leaving one counter-protester dead and more than a dozen people injured, Walsh and city leaders are rushing to make preparations that hopefully keep the same sort of violence from happening in Boston.\n\nThe Boston free speech rally is part of a coordinated nine-city protest against tech giant Google's decision to fire a software engineer after he circulated a controversial 3,300-word memo against diversity. Other protests are planned for this Saturday in Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, New York, Pittsburgh, Seattle, Washington, D.C., and Mountain View, Calif.\n\nAfter the violence in Charlottesville, Boston's Democratic mayor initially vowed to stop the protest altogether.\n\n\"Boston does not welcome you here. Boston does not want you here. Boston rejects your message,\" Walsh told media in front of City Hall on Monday, according to the Boston Globe. \"We are going to do everything we can that this march does not happen or this demonstration does not happen on Saturday.\"\n\nDespite those strong words, the march has been permitted, and Boston is now bracing for both sides to converge on one of the most highly trafficked spots in the city.\n\nThe Boston-based Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice called on the city to release its safety plan.\n\n\"If these back-to-back rallies are any indication, this threat is metastasizing,\" says Ivan Espinoza-Madrigal, executive director of Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice. The proposed rally should not move forward until Boston has a comprehensive public safety plan. We cannot be the next Charlottesville.\"\n\nThe Boston Police Department, however, has offered few details about their preparations.\n\n\"I am not going to give away our game plan,\" says Evans. \"We will have barriers; we will have pedal bikes; we will have plenty of assets to keep them at bay.\"\n\nWalsh and Boston Police Commissioner William B. Evans express confidence that the city and state police can keep the opposing sides of the demonstration separate and therefore minimize violence. Charlottesville police had a similar plan, but protesters did not abide by their rules.\n\nThe lack of details and the lack of time for the city of Boston to prepare for the rally has drawn further criticism from Espinoza-Madrigal. He wants at least portions of the Boston PD's plan released to allay any fears the public might have. There are also worries that Boston's extensive mass transit network will make it easy for any tensions that might occur to spread throughout the city.\n\nThe Boston Free Speech Coalition claims to have no ties to the white nationalist groups in Charlottesville and said their event will not promote racism and hate. But Boston city leaders worry there may be some overlap between the free speech groups and the white nationalists, and that an event like the one planned for Saturday will attract hate groups to the Boston Common.\n\nAt least two of the speakers originally booked for the Boston rally, Gavin McInnes and Augustus Invictus, also spoke in Charlottesville and are regulars at white nationalist events around the country. McInnes was a co-founder of Vice Media and founder of the Proud Boys, an alt-right fraternity. McInnes backed out of the Boston rally, and Invictus was uninvited. However, Joe Biggs, who once worked for Alex Jones' alt-right website InfoWars and promoted the \"Pizzagate\" conspiracy, is reportedly planning to attend.\n\nThe Charlottesville rally was held in response to that city's plan to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. At least 26 cities across the nation have either removed or have plans to remove Confederate memorials. While most of the memorials are clustered in the South, Confederate monuments have been or are planned to be removed in Los Angeles, San Diego and New York City. Lexington, Ky., Mayor Jim Gray announced on Saturday that two Confederate statues in his city would be taken down and relocated.\n\nPolitical pressure from progressives and the African-American community to remove the statues has mounted. But in the wake of last weekend's violence in Charlottesville, the memorials have also begun to raise questions about public safety: Do the controversial statues, which have become flashpoints for protest, make cities less safe?\n\nThat was the reasoning behind Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh's decision to remove four Confederate statues in her city this week. The violence in Charlottesville expedited her plans, she says, and the statues were taken down in the early morning hours on Wednesday. Removing the memorials in Baltimore, says Pugh, squelches protests and decreases the potential for violence that stems from those demonstrations.\n\n\"I can say for every city who has a Confederate statue in their city, you don't want to invite those elements to your city,\" Pugh says.\n\nPugh's actions echoed the strategy used earlier this year by New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu. He made a unilateral decision to take down four Confederate memorials in the middle of the night. Landrieu also made national headlines for his speech explaining why he believed the statues needed to come down.\n\n\"These monuments,\" said Landrieu, \"purposefully celebrate a fictional, sanitized Confederacy; ignoring the death, ignoring the enslavement, and the terror that it actually stood for.\"", "id": "9769681", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Cities Nationwide Brace for

Boston Counter-Protest & Resistance\" on Facebook, says marchers plan to meet in front of the Reggie Lewis Athletic Center at 10 a.m. before marching to Boston Commons \"to demand justice and stand in defiance of white supremacy.\" The event plans to rally for \"Black Lives, LGBTQI Lives, Indigenous Lives, Palestinian Lives, Cape Verde Lives, Latinx Lives, Jewish Lives, and all who are marginalized,\" according to the Facebook page.\n\nBoston Police Commissioner William Evans said officers will be out patrolling the event, as they do with any major protest. The commissioner has also reportedly said that anyone that becomes remotely violent will be placed in a holding cell, according to the Boston Globe.\n\nPolice have asked rally-goers to keep backpacks, strollers, bikes, weapons and pets at home.

Though the rally's organizers, Boston Free Speech Coalition, claim to have no ties to white supremacy or the organizers of last weekend's \"Unite the Right\" rally -- a far-right event that descended into violence and left three dead and dozens injured -- many of the Boston rally's themes are eerily reminiscent of those present in Charlottesville.\n\nBoston's rally originally featured speakers including Gavin McInnes, leader of far-right men's organization Proud Boys, who also co-founded Vice Magazine (the Proud Boys were a presence at a right-wing rally held in Boston in May); goat-killing agitator Augustus Invictus (also a speaker at the Charlottesville rally); and social media star Cassandra Fairbanks, a former Bernie Sanders fan who now supports Trump and works at a Russian state-funded news agency. Collectively, these speakers have called for the U.S.'s borders to be closed, stated that feminism leads to death and suffering, and accused Black Lives Matter of being a \"hostile, divisive movement.\" Though some of these speakers have allegedly now pulled out of the event, the fact that their presence was planned is cause for alarm -- especially in a city like Boston.\n\nOn Monday, after the violent events in Charlottesville (and prior to the rumors that the Boston rally had been cancelled, which organizers have denied), Boston mayor Marty Walsh held a press conference. The mayor spoke about his concerns regarding those heading to Boston for the rally, noting that he and the Boston police department said that they will do what they can to ensure everyone's safety. \"So my message is clear to this group,\" he said. \"We don't want you in Boston. We don't want you on Boston Common. We don't want you spewing the hate that we saw yesterday, and the loss of life.\"\n\nAnd repudiation by the mayor and others, I believe, is exactly what the organizers, speakers, and attendees of this \"free speech rally'' expected. These white supremacists and far-right extremists, along with their supporters, seem to be banking on having their rally engage a juxtaposition that has plagued the city for years -- even though it often presents itself to the world as a bastion of all that is good, liberal, and democratic, Boston is also one of the most historically racist towns in the United States.\n\nFew cities embody America's clashing cultural forces in a more storied way than Boston. A key location in the American Revolution, it's often considered the mythical cradle of American democracy, and the birthplace of a resilient, gallant national identity. Walking through the city is a lesson on how America presents its oldest, most celebrated self.\n\nBut steer from the cobblestone path of legends, and the city's -- and in turn, the nation's -- history reveals itself more clearly. Through initiatives such as Mayor Marty Walsh's \"Resilient Boston\" program, the municipality insists that past issues of systematic racism -- like the busing crisis, in which white rage fueled a cruel fight against desegregated schools from 1974 to 1988 -- are simply not part of the Boston of today. But 42 percent of Bostonians consider this city, which prides itself on a liberal, enlightened ethos, a racist place. Its revered, progressive academic institutions are situated near neighborhoods that were purposely segregated by past local and federal Housing Authority policies that secluded black residents, leaving long legacies of poverty and violence in their wake. These issues, taken alongside the fact that Red Sox fans shouted racial epitaphs at Baltimore Orioles player Adam Jones this past May, or that the city's Holocaust Memorial has been vandalized twice this summer (once right after Charlottesville), tell a different story: the Boston of today is the same Boston of yesterday.\n\nLooking at national statistics that show 176 hate crimes reported in Massachusetts over a three year period (2013-2016) -- compared to 60 in Alabama, 72 in Louisiana, and 128 in Texas over the same period -- might be a shock to people from outside the state. But to residents, including myself, it's a daily part of life.\n\nWhen I first moved to Boston from New York this year, I hoped SNL comedian Michael Che's infamous assertion that it was \"the most racist city I've ever been to\" would not mirror my experience. But it did.\n\nDespite having read the warnings, nothing prepared me for the onslaught of microaggressions I'd encounter there. During my time in Boston, I've been stopped on the street with my son by a well-meaning white woman for the sole purpose of asking me what kind of Asian I am (I'm Mexican); I've fielded suspicious stares from shop owners; I've seen an older white man, presumably upset he couldn't find a seat, yell at two women of color on the train, \"That's what happens when you overpay the help.\" A woman behind me in line at an ice cream shop seethed about my Black Lives Matter shirt, yelled \"I don't want to be anywhere near this scumbag,\" and pushed past me, to the horrified stares of other patrons and the young black woman working behind the counter. As my exasperation came to a head, the most I could manage was to mumble something about how I'd enjoy my ice cream and she'd enjoy her racism. The woman at the counter apologized and handed over my son's plain vanilla scoop. I left in an adrenaline-filled rush. It's these experiences, and countless others that people live through in Boston every single day, that make this coming Saturday worrisome.\n\nIn a city where a visiting baseball team has to worry about Boston fans yelling slurs, a show of solidarity and support in the fight against racism sometimes feels like a shot in the dark. But Boston native Brian Liberge tells me, \"Boston has a rich history and it's not always something to be proud of, but we do not like being threatened, told what to do or how to think. I'm no longer surprised when I hear that alt-right groups want to gain traction in a place as liberal as Boston. But I am angry, and I'm far from alone.\"\n\nBoston's dark, racist history and its prominence as an old, quintessentially American city make it both an attractive target and the most low-hanging-fruit in the North for white supremacist groups -- if they can cause a real stir in a historic city that prides itself on liberal ideology but has racist history, it would be an enormous win for the cause of white supremacy. But as Monica Cannon, member of social justice group Violence in Boston and one of the organizers of Saturday's counter-protest, tells Bustle, \"White supremacists are targeting Boston, but white supremacy is perpetrated every day in every city, country, and continent in our world. Further, the actions they are taking are not strategic: from the Boston busing crisis to the Charles Stuart case, and from Bo Ramsey[-White] to Terrance Coleman -- racism in Boston is only ripening.\"\n\n\"This is the city's chance to prove it can not only own its past, but learn from it.\"\n\nOverwhelming support for the counter-protest is Boston's opportunity to shift the perception of the city -- and this seems likely, considering that the counterprotest has 8,000 confirmed attendees on Facebook, compared to the rally, which has less around 300. Liberge, who plans to attend the counter-protest on Saturday, adds \"We saw the Holocaust Memorial vandalized again this week, but we also saw a bystander intervene. Our leaders, Democrat and Republican, are standing up for immigrants and refugees. Boston's still got race issues to work on, but we're not going to let outsiders, or even the President, drag us to a new low.\"\n\nThis is the city's chance to prove it can not only own its past, but learn from it. Disavowing the legacy of racism is a burden not for the people of color in Boston, but for the whites who have long benefitted from it. \"We hope that this moment means that people will begin to show up beyond these moments of national and global attention,\" Cannon adds. \"In Boston, this looks like white people talking to their parents, children, other family, friends, and co-workers about terms like oppression, white supremacy, privilege and fragility. People must challenge and resist white supremacy in its many different manifestations every single day.\"\n\nIf Boston has wanted to show that its future doesn't look like its past, the time to start is now. By devastating white supremacists with a show of numbers, Boston can not only prove itself to be the liberal enclave it so fiercely claims to be, but will also show itself as an important site in the struggle for freedom and independence -- as it was once before. Except this time, it will be supporting freedom and independence for all.", "id": "9899617", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "There's A Far-Right Rally In Boston On Saturday & The City

Meet the Fascist-Fighting Coalition Dubbed the 'Alt-Left' by President\n\nANSWER Coalition also emphasized that their protest would not be a one-note demonstration and would also address institutionalized and government-based elements of white supremacy and intolerance.\n\nWith the sudden influx in interest, the protest groups warned those planning to join them on Saturday that there is a risk of injury, but said they would bring \"marshals,\" safety teams and legal observers to ensure attendees' welfare.\n\nBlack Lives Matter and ANSWER Coalition made it clear that they do not condone violence, but Antifa, the coalition of more militant left-wingers, are also expected to make an unpermitted appearance.\n\nWhile Antifa has often been present at counter-protests across the country, they are a decentralized group and have made no statements about their presence.\n\n\"Though we don't agree with Antifa's tactics and strategy and adventurism, we respect their willingness to put their bodies on the line to fight fascists,\" Brown explained.\n\nThe organizers also resents the label of \"alt-left\" placed on them by President Trump.\n\n\"It's a distraction because we don't mirror the alt-right,\" Brown said. \"The alt-right is trying to hide its politics, and we have nothing to hide.\"\n\nHe said racist and oppressive ideas are being buoyed by the Trump administration, which means organizing is ever more important.\n\n\"Those ideas and ideology are in the White House right now, so they have the largest platform to spread their lies and bigotry,\" said Brown. \"It's impossible to destroy without organizing.\"\n\nANSWER Coalition, which also brought out thousands of protesters to Donald Trump's inauguration in January, are working alongside the Coalition to Organize and Mobilize Boston Against Trump as well as a number of local activist and socialist organizations to hold \"Stand for Solidarity\" at 11 a.m. outside the Boston State House.\n\nBlack Lives Matter's protest begins at Reggie Lewis Track and Athletic Center in downtown Boston at 10 a.m. ET, and the organizers plan to march the two miles to Boston Common, where the so-called \"Free Speech\" rally will take place. ANSWER Coalition will merge its protest later in the day.\n\nThe city's Parks Department provided the \"Boston Free Speech\" rally, scheduled for Saturday on Boston Common, a permit after a Wednesday meeting between organizers and police.\n\nOfficials plan to place dump trucks at intersections around Boston Common to block vehicles and plan on searching bags. No large bags, sticks or weapons are allowed.\n\n\"I didn't want them to get a permit, quite honestly,\" Mayor Marty Walsh said, according to NBC Boston, \"but we also believe in free speech.\"\n\nThe permit allows for 100 people to attend. Neither ANSWER Coalition Boston nor Black Lives Matter have acquired permits for the counter-protests.\n\nWalsh later told WGBH Greater Boston that he's confident there will be no violent repeats of Charlottesville, stating that he believed Saturday's group is not the same as those who appeared in Virginia.\n\nThis is the second rally planned by the Boston Free Speech Coalition. During a May event the event was made up of self-described libertarians and Trump supporters as well as Oathkeepers and American Patriot Three Percenters -- the latter two groups attended the \"Unite the Right Rally\" in Charlottesville.\n\nJohn Medlar, one of the organizers, has told multiple media organizations that the rally is not intended for white supremacists, neo-Nazis or members of the Ku Klux Klan and has made it clear that the \"Boston Free Speech Rally\" is not for those who attended the protests in Charlottesville. He also claimed the event was for liberals and posted an email he wrote on Facebook that seems to indicate he invited Black Lives Matter's Boston chapter to send a speaker.\n\nNBC News was not able to confirm the authenticity of the invitation.\n\n\"We are seeing this kind of rebranding of what white supremacy is since Charlottesville, but we are not buying this at all,\" said ANSWER Coalition Boston organizer Kim Barzola.\n\nA number of scheduled speakers who were supposed to attend -- right-wing firebrands Gavin McInnes and Tim Gionet (also known as Baked Alaska) -- decided to avoid the rally altogether in light of Charlottesville. Both have shared fears of being labeled white supremacists via social media and claimed to disavow violence.\n\nCurrent speakers include congressional candidates Shiva Ayyadurai and Samson Racioppi as well as former InfoWars writer Joe Biggs. Kyle Chapman, a California activist who gained notoriety for bashing an Antifa protester with a stick and earned the nickname \"Based Stick Man,\" will also speak.\n\nChapman founded the Fraternal Order of Alt Knights, which is to be the \"tactical defensive arm\" of McInnes' mens-rights organization, the Proud Boys.\n\nNevertheless, Medlar maintains the rally's aims are nonviolent and will promote free speech of all -- except hate groups.\n\n\"We absolutely denounce the KKK, neo-Nazis, ID Evropa [Identify Evropa], Vanguard -- all these legit hate groups. We have nothing to do with them and you don't want them here, we don't want them here,\" Medlar said, according to NBC Boston. \"If they want to come have their own rally, we don't want any part of it.\"", "id": "9868419", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "After Charlottesville, thousands expected to attend Boston counter-protests", "image":

Organizers of that rally said 3,000 people indicated on Facebook they were coming to the event, and another 2,000 expressed an interest in attending.\n\nBoth groups said they do not have permits from the city to hold their events, but stressed their constitutional right to gather in protest.\n\n\"We have the right to organize and the right to assemble,'' said Kelsey Taylor, an organizer with the group COMBAT or the Coalition to Organize, to Mobilize Boston Against Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCannon, who stressed a peaceful gathering, said the march from Roxbury to the Common will begin at 10 a.m. There will \"healing spaces\" where people can gather to speak along the way to accommodate those who do not want to be on the Common, said Cannon.\n\nIn addition, volunteers are being trained by Black Lives Matter representatives from Toronto, Charlottesville, Va., Washington, D.C., and Minneapolis on nonviolent de-escalation techniques, Cannon added.\n\nAt the rally at the State House, beginning at 11 a.m., Saturday, 30 marshals in neon vests and arm bands are expected to help keep the peace, one of the organizers said.\n\nWith days to go before the rally, police are investigating reports that some radical counterprotesters are planning to bring acid to throw at rally-goers, even at police, a law enforcement official with knowledge of the warnings said. The official is not authorized to discuss the intelligence publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe reports have not been substantiated, the official said, but police are preparing for the possibility of such attacks and being told to seek immediate first aid if they are hit with any substances.\n\nThe Boston Police Department has already laid out a series of restrictions, citing public safety concerns. Parking will be prohibited along the march route from Roxbury -- on Malcolm X Boulevard, Tremont Street, and Columbus Avenue -- and on streets surrounding the Common, police said.\n\nBackpacks and other large bags are subjected to a search. Police are also banning any weapons, objects that could be used to harm, beverage containers, grills, and bicycles, according to a list released by the police.\n\nMeanwhile, police Commissioner William B. Evans, in an open letter to returning college students, urged them \"act in a way that would make your school . . . proud\" on Saturday.\n\n\"Today, I am writing to ask for your help as we prepare for these events,\" Evans wrote Thursday. \"As I have stated in the past, please act in a way that would make your school, your family, and your city proud and please respect our neighborhoods. Student behavior off campus will be regarded the same as if it were on campus.\"\n\nBoston Free Speech Coalition organizers have said that their rally is not linked to organizers of the rally in Charlottesville, Va., that led to bloodshed and one death. Coalition members said they support free speech of any kind -- no matter the content -- and denounce violence.\n\nBut civil rights advocates said the group, which also calls itself the New Free Speech Coalition, is giving a platform to people who spew racial hatred and violence.\n\nThe free speech members said they planned this month's rally in May, after their first event. They event was initially slated for last weekend, but was postponed because of the Charlottesville rally, an organizer said.\n\nFacing a blacklash after the violence in Virginia, some of the speakers began canceling, including Kyle Chapman, who participated in the Charlottesville rally. He later changed his mind.\n\nChapman gained notoriety earlier this year after a video went viral of him smashing a wooden post over the head of an antifascist protester at a march for President Trump in Berkeley, Calif.\n\nBut Chapman wrote on Facebook Thursday that he will be on the Common on Boston to speak: \"It's estimated 10,000 #AltLeft Terrorist will be counter protesting and potentially attacking us,'' Chapman wrote. \"We knew this time was coming. It's time to honor our ancestors. This event is for the Brave. Cowards stay home.\"\n\nAn organizer of the free speech rally extended an invitation to the Black Lives Matter movement to speak at the rally.\n\n\"It's up to them if they choose to accept,'' John Medlar wrote on Facebook. \"And they have every right to counterprotest our other speakers. That is, after all, free speech.\"\n\nCannon, whose march is being coorganized by local Black Lives Matter chapters, rejected the offer.\n\n\"We don't need to speak at their rally,'' she said. \"We don't need their platform. Their platform exudes hate and white supremacy.\"\n\nMilton Valencia of the Globe staff contributed to this report. Meghan E. Irons can be reached at meghan.irons@globe.com.

The next morning, many donned helmets and shields and clashed with counter-protesters before a car drove into the crowd, killing a 32-year-old woman and injuring 19 others.\n\nOn Monday, Texas A&M University canceled plans for a \"White Lives Matter\" rally in September. On Wednesday, the University of Florida denied a request for white nationalist Richard Spencer to rent space on campus for a September event. Spencer and his supporters are promising court challenges.\n\nExpecting more rallies to come, Riseling's group is planning a series of training events to help campus police prepare.\n\n\"If you're sitting on a campus where this hasn't happened, consider this your wake-up call that it might,\" she said.\n\n* In Minnesota: Hamline picked to open racial healing center\n\nLast school year, racist flyers popped up on college campuses at a rate that experts called unprecedented. The Anti-Defamation League counted 161 white supremacist \"flyering incidents\" on 110 college campuses between September and June. Oren Segal, director of the group's Center on Extremism, said the culprits can't be dismissed as harmless trolls.\n\n\"You might have a few that don't take it seriously. But those that do, those are the ones we're concerned about,\" Segal said.\n\nMatthew Heimbach, the 26-year-old leader of the white nationalist Traditionalist Worker Party, admits that dropping leaflets on campuses is a cheap way to generate media coverage.\n\n\"A dollar worth of paper, if it triggers the right person, can become $100,000 in media attention,\" he said.\n\nAs a student at Towson University in Maryland, Heimbach made headlines for forming a \"White Student Union\" and scrawling messages like \"white pride\" in chalk on campus sidewalks. His college years are behind him, but Heimbach still views colleges as promising venues to expand his group's ranks. College students are running four of his group's chapters, he said.\n\n\"The entire dynamic has changed,\" Heimbach said. \"I used to be the youngest person at white nationalist meetings by 20 or 30 years.\"\n\nThe Foundation for the Marketplace of Ideas, a self-described \"alt-right\" nonprofit educational group, says it's offering legal assistance to students caught hanging up posters or flyers containing \"hate facts.\" The \"alt-right\" is a fringe movement loosely mixing white nationalism, anti-Semitism and anti-immigration populism.\n\nOne of the foundation's attorneys, Jason Van Dyke, said he represented a student at Southern Methodist University who was accused last year of posting flyers on campus that said, \"Why White Women Shouldn't Date Black Men.\" The student wasn't suspended or expelled, Van Dyke added.\n\n\"Just because speech makes someone uncomfortable or offends somebody does not make it a violation of the student code of conduct,\" he said.\n\nScores of schools publicly denounced the violence in Virginia this week, including some that learned they enroll students who attended the \"Unite the Right\" rally.\n\nThe University of Nevada, Reno, said it stands against bigotry and racism but concluded there's \"no constitutional or legal reason\" to expel Peter Cvjetanovic, a 20-year-old student and school employee who attended the rally, as an online petition demanded.\n\nOther schools, including Washington State University, condemned the rally but didn't specifically address their students who attended it.\n\nCampus leaders say they walk a fine line when trying to combat messages from hate groups. Many strive to protect speech even if it's offensive but also recognize hate speech can make students feel unsafe. Some schools have sought to counter extremist messages with town halls and events promoting diversity. Others try to avoid drawing attention to hate speech.\n\nAfter flyers promoting white supremacy were posted at Purdue University last school year, Purdue President Mitch Daniels refused to dwell on the incident.\n\n* Help MPR News cover racism and acts of aggression against marginalized communities\n\n\"This is a transparent effort to bait people into overreacting, thereby giving a minuscule fringe group attention it does not deserve, and that we decline to do,\" Daniels said in a statement at the time.\n\nCameron Padgett, a 23-year-old senior at Georgia State University, only dabbled in campus activism before he decided to organize a speaking engagement for Spencer this year. Padgett sued -- successfully -- for Spencer to speak at Auburn University in April after the school tried to cancel the event.\n\n\"My motivation from the beginning was just free speech,\" he said. Padgett calls himself an \"identitarian\" -- not a white nationalist -- and insists \"advocating for the interests of white people\" doesn't make him a racist. Padgett said he hasn't faced harassment for working with Spencer and doesn't fear any.\n\n\"There are a lot of people who just sit behind keyboards,\" he said. \"But what are we doing this for if no one wants to show their face?\"\n\nAt Boston University, Fuentes says he met a few others with similar views -- he considers himself a \"white advocate\" -- but mostly found political kinship online. He hosts his own YouTube show and is prolific on social media, but when he heard about the \"Unite the Right\" rally, he saw it as a chance to network in the real world.\n\n\"It was going from online to actually physically assembling somewhere,\" he said. \"We shake hands, we look people in the eye. We actually have some solidarity in the movement.\"\n\nSo, along with a friend from Chicago, Fuentes booked a flight and headed to Virginia.", "id": "9895266", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18",

Spencer and his supporters are promising court challenges.\n\nExpecting more rallies to come, Riseling's group is planning a series of training events to help campus police prepare.\n\n\"If you're sitting on a campus where this hasn't happened, consider this your wake-up call that it might,\" she said.\n\n* In Minnesota: Hamline picked to open racial healing center\n\nLast school year, racist flyers popped up on college campuses at a rate that experts called unprecedented. The Anti-Defamation League counted 161 white supremacist \"flyering incidents\" on 110 college campuses between September and June. Oren Segal, director of the group's Center on Extremism, said the culprits can't be dismissed as harmless trolls.\n\n\"You might have a few that don't take it seriously. But those that do, those are the ones we're concerned about,\" Segal said.\n\nMatthew Heimbach, the 26-year-old leader of the white nationalist Traditionalist Worker Party, admits that dropping leaflets on campuses is a cheap way to generate media coverage.\n\n\"A dollar worth of paper, if it triggers the right person, can become $100,000 in media attention,\" he said.\n\nAs a student at Towson University in Maryland, Heimbach made headlines for forming a \"White Student Union\" and scrawling messages like \"white pride\" in chalk on campus sidewalks. His college years are behind him, but Heimbach still views colleges as promising venues to expand his group's ranks. College students are running four of his group's chapters, he said.\n\n\"The entire dynamic has changed,\" Heimbach said. \"I used to be the youngest person at white nationalist meetings by 20 or 30 years.\"\n\nThe Foundation for the Marketplace of Ideas, a self-described \"alt-right\" nonprofit educational group, says it's offering legal assistance to students caught hanging up posters or flyers containing \"hate facts.\" The \"alt-right\" is a fringe movement loosely mixing white nationalism, anti-Semitism and anti-immigration populism.\n\nOne of the foundation's attorneys, Jason Van Dyke, said he represented a student at Southern Methodist University who was accused last year of posting flyers on campus that said, \"Why White Women Shouldn't Date Black Men.\" The student wasn't suspended or expelled, Van Dyke added.\n\n\"Just because speech makes someone uncomfortable or offends somebody does not make it a violation of the student code of conduct,\" he said.\n\nScores of schools publicly denounced the violence in Virginia this week, including some that learned they enroll students who attended the \"Unite the Right\" rally.\n\nThe University of Nevada, Reno, said it stands against bigotry and racism but concluded there's \"no constitutional or legal reason\" to expel Peter Cvjetanovic, a 20-year-old student and school employee who attended the rally, as an online petition demanded.\n\nOther schools, including Washington State University, condemned the rally but didn't specifically address their students who attended it.\n\nCampus leaders say they walk a fine line when trying to combat messages from hate groups. Many strive to protect speech even if it's offensive but also recognize hate speech can make students feel unsafe. Some schools have sought to counter extremist messages with town halls and events promoting diversity. Others try to avoid drawing attention to hate speech.\n\nAfter flyers promoting white supremacy were posted at Purdue University last school year, Purdue President Mitch Daniels refused to dwell on the incident.\n\n* Help MPR News cover racism and acts of aggression against marginalized communities\n\n\"This is a transparent effort to bait people into overreacting, thereby giving a minuscule fringe group attention it does not deserve, and that we decline to do,\" Daniels said in a statement at the time.\n\nCameron Padgett, a 23-year-old senior at Georgia State University, only dabbled in campus activism before he decided to organize a speaking engagement for Spencer this year. Padgett sued -- successfully -- for Spencer to speak at Auburn University in April after the school tried to cancel the event.\n\n\"My motivation from the beginning was just free speech,\" he said. Padgett calls himself an \"identitarian\" -- not a white nationalist -- and insists \"advocating for the interests of white people\" doesn't make him a racist. Padgett said he hasn't faced harassment for working with Spencer and doesn't fear any.\n\n\"There are a lot of people who just sit behind keyboards,\" he said. \"But what are we doing this for if no one wants to show their face?\"\n\nAt Boston University, Fuentes says he met a few others with similar views -- he considers himself a \"white advocate\" -- but mostly found political kinship online. He hosts his own YouTube show and is prolific on social media, but when he heard about the \"Unite the Right\" rally, he saw it as a chance to network in the real world.\n\n\"It was going from online to actually physically assembling somewhere,\" he said. \"We shake hands, we look people in the eye. We actually have some solidarity in the movement.\"\n\nSo, along with a friend from Chicago, Fuentes booked a flight and headed to Virginia.", "id": "9895298", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18",

According to a Facebook post for the rally, the speakers were expected to include Joe Biggs, a former employee of right-wing conspiracy site InfoWars, as well as Kyle Chapman, the founder of an alt-right \"fight club\" organized specifically to fight counter-protesters in the streets.\n\nBut it never appeared to get off the ground, and the site of the protest was almost completely absent of people willing to stand up and represent the alt-right, just one weekend after Heather Heyer was killed by a neo-Nazi terrorist in Virginia.\n\nHalf an hour before it is slated to start, the \"free speech\" rally crowd is...sparse pic.twitter.com/s2ftb85pD5 -- Meghan Barr (@meghanbarr)\n\nAugust 19, 2017\n\nAnother man who was scheduled to speak at the rally claimed to be shocked by how unorganized it was. \"I didn't realize how unplanned of an event it was going to be,\" said Samson Racioppi,. \"It kinda fell apart.\"\n\nThis could be explained by the show of force from the other side that showed up. An estimated 15,000 people, many of them chanting anti-Nazi slogans and openly shaming supporters of Donald Trump, made their presence felt. The message was pretty clear: the intolerant will not be tolerated.\n\nBottom pic, is a picture of Americans in Boston\n\nTop pic, is a picture of fascists in Boston\n\nReal America v an inbred family reunion pic.twitter.com/TjBTP3j5kv -- Facts Do Matter (@WilDonnelly)\n\nAugust 19, 2017\n\nThey appeared to wildly outnumber members of the alt-right, and through their presence alone, they shamed and intimidated open Trump supporters into hiding symbols connecting them to the President.\n\nCounter protesters just surrounded a man in a red Trump hat pic.twitter.com/ae5VDa4DLP -- Meghan Barr (@meghanbarr)\n\nAugust 19, 2017\n\nThe few protesters who did show up would eventually run away with their tails between their legs. Several different people in attendance at the rally alluded to Nazis and white supremacists taking refuge in Boston Police vehicles, and the local PD was tasked with transporting them to an unidentified safe area somewhere else in the city.\n\nIt didn't fall apart. They were terrified. They're hiding in police buses now.

Demonstrators have left the Common. -- Boston Police Dept. (@bostonpolice)\n\nAugust 19, 2017\n\nThe overwhelming sentiment from the Boston crowd was a rejection of the beliefs that led to the death of Heyer one week prior. The fight against racism, specifically against neo-Nazis and their ideals, was even given a Boston-themed touch up by some of the attendees.\n\nThe most Boston anti-fascist sign out here today: pic.twitter.com/f4KjytE4eU -- Jack Smith IV (@JackSmithIV)\n\nAugust 19, 2017\n\nJust bring cake to the rally. #Boston pic.twitter.com/4gvX8uj5bs -- Liz Plank (@feministabulous)\n\nAugust 19, 2017\n\nWhile the counter-protest will not erase what happened in Charlottesville, it did make a lot of people around the country feel better about America, if only for a brief moment. Messages of support poured in from all around the world, cheering on the people who hit the ground and made their voices heard.\n\nPOST CONTINUES BELOW\n\nI hope the \"ignore them and they'll go away\" folks see Boston and realize that \"show up in great number and they'll go away\" is way better -- dan solo (@dansolomon)\n\nAugust 19, 2017\n\nThe Celtics have more small forwards on their roster than Nazis were willing to show up in Boston -- \u1f385\u1f3ff (@nomchompsky)\n\nAugust 19, 2017\n\nFrom a proud New Yorker, thank you Boston. You are beautiful and inspiring. -- Ben Schwartz (@rejectedjokes)\n\nAugust 19, 2017\n\nThe best news of the day? The protests remained mostly peaceful. Aided by counter-protesters who served as a wall between the two sides, peace was kept for the most part. One known arrest was made as of mid-afternoon on Saturday.\n\nVeterans For Peace, here to protest Nazis, are staying between Nazis and protesters, trying to keep the peace. @VFPNational #DefendBoston pic.twitter.com/7DlyaxxoEk -- Robin (@caulkthewagon)\n\nAugust 19, 2017\n\nThe event's organizers have not yet indicated whether or not the disbanded protest will be rescheduled.", "eventUri": "eng-3369697", "timeCrawl": "20:16:00", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T20:16:00Z"}]}}}

World Food Program Executive Director Cindy McCain told NBC News that there was now \"full-blown famine\" in northern Gaza.\n\nIn excerpts of an interview to be aired on Sunday on Meet the Press, McCain told NBC that she hoped for a ceasefire accord so that more aid could be delivered faster.\n\n\"There is famine - full-blown famine - in the north, and it's moving its way south. And so what we're asking for and what we've continually asked for is a ceasefire and the ability to have unfettered access,\" said McCain, the widow of the late Senator John McCain.\n\nU.S. officials say that while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has taken steps that have boosted aid deliveries, the amounts remain insufficient.\n\nThe lawmakers also condemned Hamas' Oct. 7 attack in their letter, endorsed Israel's right to exist and expressed support for U.S. efforts to broker a ceasefire and a second hostage release.\n\nIsrael, they noted, recently opened more aid routes and crossing points into Gaza that have allowed in more aid trucks.\n\nBut the lawmakers expressed \"serious concerns\" over Israel's conduct of the war \"as it pertains to the deliberate withholding of humanitarian aid.\"\n\nThey urged Biden \"to make clear\" to Netanyahu \"that so long as Israel restricts, directly or indirectly\" aid to Gaza \"the Israeli government is risking its

World Food Program Executive Director Cindy McCain told NBC News that there was now \"full-blown famine\" in northern Gaza.\n\nIn excerpts of an interview to be aired on Sunday on Meet the Press, McCain told NBC that she hoped for a ceasefire accord so that more aid could be delivered faster.\n\n\"There is famine - full-blown famine - in the north, and it's moving its way south. And so what we're asking for and what we've continually asked for is a ceasefire and the ability to have unfettered access,\" said McCain, the widow of the late Senator John McCain.\n\nU.S. officials say that while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has taken steps that have boosted aid deliveries, the amounts remain insufficient.\n\nThe lawmakers also condemned Hamas' Oct. 7 attack in their letter, endorsed Israel's right to exist and expressed support for U.S. efforts to broker a ceasefire and a second hostage release.\n\nIsrael, they noted, recently opened more aid routes and crossing points into Gaza that have allowed in more aid trucks.\n\nBut the lawmakers expressed \"serious concerns\" over Israel's conduct of the war \"as it pertains to the deliberate withholding of humanitarian aid.\"\n\nThey urged Biden \"to make clear\" to Netanyahu \"that so long as Israel restricts, directly or indirectly\" aid to Gaza \"the Israeli government is risking its eligibility for further offensive security assistance from the U.S.\"\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Landay, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

The lawmakers said the Israeli government had resisted repeated U.S. requests to open enough sea and land routes for aid to Gaza, and cited reports that it failed to allow in enough food to avert famine, enforced \"arbitrary restrictions\" on aid and imposed an inspection system that impeded supplies.\n\nScores of lawmakers from U.S. President Joe Biden's Democratic Party told him on Friday that they believe there is sufficient evidence to show that Israel has violated U.S. law by restricting humanitarian aid flows into war-stricken Gaza.\n\nA letter to Biden signed by 86 House of Representatives Democrats said Israel's aid restrictions \"call into question\" its assurances that it was complying with a U.S. Foreign Assistance Act provision requiring recipients of U.S.-funded arms to uphold international humanitarian law and allow free flows of U.S. assistance. Such written assurances were mandated by a national security memorandum that Biden issued in February after Democratic lawmakers began questioning if Israel was upholding international law in its Gaza operations.\n\nThe lawmakers said the Israeli government had resisted repeated U.S. requests to open enough sea and land routes for aid to Gaza, and cited reports that it failed to allow in enough food to avert famine, enforced \"arbitrary restrictions\" on aid and imposed an inspection system that impeded supplies. \"We expect the administration to ensure (Israel's) compliance with existing law and to take all conceivable steps to prevent further humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza,\" the lawmakers wrote.\n\nBiden's memorandum requires that Secretary of State Antony Blinken report to Congress by Wednesday on whether he finds credible Israel's assurances that its use of U.S. arms adheres to international law. At least four State Department bureaus advised Blinken last month that they found Israel's assurances \"neither credible nor reliable.\"\n\nIf Israel's assurances are questioned, Biden would have the option to \"remediate\" the situation through actions ranging from seeking fresh assurances to suspending U.S. arms transfers, according to the memorandum. UN SAYS FAMINE ADVANCING IN GAZA\n\nIsrael denies violating international law and limiting aid in its war against Gaza's ruling Hamas militants, which was triggered by their Oct. 7 onslaught into Israel in which they killed more than 1,200 people and seized more than 200 hostages. More than 34,000 Palestinians have died in nearly seven months of fighting, according to Gaza's health ministry, which has devastated the coastal enclave and left most of the population of 2.3 million displaced amid dire food and water shortages.\n\nU.N. World Food Program Executive Director Cindy McCain told NBC News that there was now \"full-blown famine\" in northern Gaza. In excerpts of an interview to be aired on Sunday on Meet the Press, McCain told NBC that she hoped for a ceasefire accord so that more aid could be delivered faster.\n\n\"There is famine - full-blown famine - in the north, and it's moving its way south. And so what we're asking for and what we've continually asked for is a ceasefire and the ability to have unfettered access,\" said McCain, the widow of the late Senator John McCain. U.S. officials say that while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has taken steps that have boosted aid deliveries, the amounts remain insufficient.\n\nThe lawmakers also condemned Hamas' Oct. 7 attack in their letter, endorsed Israel's right to exist and expressed support for U.S. efforts to broker a ceasefire and a second hostage release. Israel, they noted, recently opened more aid routes and crossing points into Gaza that have allowed in more aid trucks.\n\nBut the lawmakers expressed \"serious concerns\" over Israel's conduct of the war \"as it pertains to the deliberate withholding of humanitarian aid.\" They urged Biden \"to make clear\" to Netanyahu \"that so long as Israel restricts, directly or indirectly\" aid to Gaza \"the Israeli government is risking its eligibility for further offensive security assistance from the U.S.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated

In April, Samantha Power, the director of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) became the first U.S. official to say that it was credible to assess that famine is occurring in portions of Gaza. No other U.S. official has made that assessment.\n\nMs. McCain said that while there has not yet been an official declaration of famine, based on what her organization has seen and experienced on the ground, she believes there is a \"full-blown\" issue in Gaza. \"It's horror. It's - You know, it's so hard to look at and it's so hard to hear, also,\" McCain said in her interview.\n\nShe went on to say that she is hopeful for a ceasefire in Gaza so that people can begin to be fed \"in a much faster fashion.\" Ms. McCain added that the people in Gaza need \"water, sanitation, medicine - it's all part of the famine -- the famine issue.\"\n\nEfforts to provide food aid to Gaza have been met both by Israeli resistance and ceaseless air strikes. World Central Kitchen, a U.S.-based nonprofit group that has distributed over 43 million meals across Gaza, just resumed operations Monday after seven of its aid workers were killed by an Israeli airstrike on April 1.\n\nEarlier this week, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged the international community to \"do everything possible to avert an entirely preventable human-made famine\".\n\nLack of security is a major obstacle to distributing aid across Gaza, and he stressed that humanitarian convoys, facilities and personnel as well as people in need \"must not be targets\".\n\n\"We welcome aid delivery by air and sea, but there is no alternative to the massive use of land routes,\" he said, before again calling on Israel to allow and facilitate safe, rapid and unimpeded humanitarian access throughout Gaza, including for the UN's Palestine relief agency, UNRWA.\n\nGuterres also addressed how Israeli attacks have \"decimated\" the health system in the enclave, where two thirds of hospitals and health centres are out of commission, while many of those remaining are seriously damaged. \"Some hospitals now resemble cemeteries,\" he said, voicing deep alarm over reports of the discovery of mass graves at several locations, including at Al-Shifa and Nasser hospitals. More than 390 bodies reportedly have been exhumed at Nasser Hospital alone, and \"there are competing narratives around several of these mass graves, including serious allegations that some of those buried were \"unlawfully killed,\" he added. The UN chief said it is imperative that independent international forensic investigators are allowed immediate access to these sites to determine the precise circumstances under which hundreds of Palestinians lost their lives and were buried or reburied.\n\n\"The families of the dead and missing have a right to know what happened, and the world has a right to accountability for any violations of international law that may have taken place,\" he said. The Secretary-General ended his remarks by drawing attention to UNRWA and its \"irreplaceable and indispensable work\"\u009d supporting millions of Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. \"UNRWA's presence across the region is a source of hope and stability. Its education, healthcare and other services provide a sense of normality, safety and stability to desperate communities,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "dailytimes.com.pk", "dataType": "news",

Gaza health authorities say Israel has killed more than 34,600 people in Gaza since then.\n\nHamas came to power in Gaza in 2006 after Israeli soldiers and settlers withdrew in 2005, but the enclave is still deemed as Israeli-occupied territory by the United Nations.\n\nAs the occupying power, the UN human rights chief has said Israel is obligated to ensure the provision of food and medical care to the population and to facilitate the work of humanitarian organizations trying to deliver aid.\n\nRead more:", "source": {"uri": "english.alarabiya.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Arabiya English"}, "authors": [{"uri": "al_arabiya_english@english.alarabiya.net", "name": "Al Arabiya English", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclave_and_exclave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enclave and exclave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Food Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John McCain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Lazzarini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philippe Lazzarini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UNRWA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_checkpoint", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Security checkpoint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malnutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant\u00f3nio_Guterres", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ant\u00f3nio Guterres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian fedayeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starvation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli-occupied territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_occupation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military occupation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://vid.alarabiya.net/images/2024/05/06/d4c7f1f1-f861-41ce-a1c4-8dd7b3267233/d4c7f1f1-f861-41ce-a1c4-8dd7b3267233_16x9_600x338.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538170", "eventUri": "eng-9538170", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2508, "textEnd": 2514}], "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Although reports of widespread starvation and deteriorating humanitarian conditions have surfaced, this is the first time a UN official has confirmed ongoing famine in Gaza.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News on Sunday, McCain claimed that, based on what WFP has \"seen and experienced\" on the ground, there is \"full-blown famine in the North, and it's moving its way South\". McCain urged for an immediate ceasefire as well as a safe and unfettered influx of humanitarian aid - including food, sanitation, and medicine. McCain also warned that generations of children would be affected by famine even if the war is ended due to their bodies not developing properly.\n\nGetting aid into Gaza has been a major priority for international groups and a source of conflict with Israel. In recent weeks, more humanitarian assistance has been able to reach Gaza with the opening of the Erez and Karem Shalom crossing with Israel. However, the amount of humanitarian aid still needs to be significantly increased, says McCain, and the safety of workers needs to be ensured; anyone working on the ground is in danger. McCain asserts more than 200 UN aid workers have been killed in Gaza.\n\nCOGAT, an agency of the Israeli Ministry of Defense coordinating the influx of humanitarian aid into Gaza, claimed that no UN representatives had indicated a risk of famine in Northern Gaza and that \"the humanitarian situation is improving\". Furthermore, the agency claimed that international organizations had stated that the amount of aid to Northern Gaza should be reduced based on the quantity of goods in relation to the population.\n\nThe International Court of Justice twice ordered Israel to provide for the entry of humanitarian assistance into Gaza to prevent a \"plausible\" genocide of Palestinians, following proceedings that South Africa initiated in January. In its second order, the ICJ noted, \"Palestinians in Gaza are no longer facing only a risk of famine, as noted in the Order of 26 January 2024, but that famine is setting in.\"\n\nIn March, UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths urged Israel to revoke the decision to block UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) food convoys as it \"only pushes thousands closer to famine\".", "source": {"uri": "jurist.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "JURIST"}, "authors": [{"uri": "malaika_grafe@jurist.org", "name": "Malaika Grafe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Food Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John McCain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starvation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinator_of_Government_Activities_in_the_Territories", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UNRWA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under-Secretary-General_for_Humanitarian_Affairs_and_Emergency_Relief_Coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.jurist.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/05/1024px-World_Food_Programme.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538170", "eventUri": "eng-9538170", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), Philippe Lazzarini, on Sunday accused Israel of continuing to deny the United Nations aid access in Gaza as it tries to avert famine.\n\n\"Only in the past 2 weeks, we have recorded 10 incidents involving shooting at convoys, arrests of UN staff including bullying, stripping them naked, threats with arms & long delays at checkpoints forcing convoys to move during the dark or abort,\" Lazzarini posted on X.\n\nIsrael's government did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Lazzarini's remarks.\n\nLazzarini also called on \"Hamas and other armed groups to stop any attacks on humanitarian crossings, refrain from aid diversion and make sure assistance reaches all those in need.\" The militants claimed responsibility on Sunday for an attack that shut down the main humanitarian aid crossing into Gaza.\n\n'ALREADY DYING'\n\nA U.N.-backed report in March said famine was imminent and likely by May in northern Gaza, and could spread across the enclave by July. Famine is assessed as at least 20% of the population suffering extreme food shortages, with one in three children acutely malnourished and two people out of every 10,000 dying daily from starvation or from malnutrition and disease.\n\nU.N. officials say that generally by the time a famine is formally declared somewhere it is too late to save many people. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said last week that the most vulnerable in northern Gaza \"are already dying of hunger and disease.\"\n\nThe U.N. has complained about a lack of humanitarian aid access throughout the seven-month-long war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas in Gaza. Guterres has said the U.N. is trying to avert \"an entirely preventable, human-made famine\" in northern Gaza.\n\nIsrael is retaliating against Hamas over an Oct. 7 attack in which Israel says the militants killed about 1,200 people and took more than 250 people hostage. Gaza health authorities say Israel has killed more than 34,600 people in Gaza since then.\n\nHamas came to power in Gaza in 2006 after Israeli soldiers and settlers withdrew in 2005, but the enclave is still deemed as Israeli-occupied territory by the United Nations.\n\nAs the occupying power, the U.N. human rights chief has said Israel is obligated to ensure the provision of food and medical care to the population and to facilitate the work of humanitarian organizations trying to deliver aid.", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@staradvertiser.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Food Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John McCain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclave_and_exclave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enclave and exclave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Lazzarini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philippe Lazzarini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UNRWA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_checkpoint", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Security checkpoint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malnutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant\u00f3nio_Guterres", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ant\u00f3nio Guterres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian fedayeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starvation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli-occupied territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_occupation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military occupation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Star-Advertiser-thumbnail-image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538170", "eventUri": "eng-9538170", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2587, "textEnd": 2593}], "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Samantha Power, director of the U.S. Agency for International Development, was the first to do so during congressional testimony last month.\n\nMcCain told NBC's Kristen Welker that she believes there is famine in Gaza \"based on what we've seen and what we've experienced on the ground.\"\n\n\"It's horror.

In the wake of the Oct. 7 attack, Israel launched a counterattack and called for a \"complete siege\" of Gaza, stopping any electricity, food, water or fuel from entering the territory. Israel also destroyed Gaza's port, and fishing and farming have become inaccessible.\n\nThat siege has since ended, but it is still challenging for aid workers to get supplies through to Palestinians. Israel conducts extensive inspections of the goods crossing the border through few checkpoints. American military forces are now building two floating piers off the Gaza coast to help deliver 2 million meals a day to people facing starvation as a result of the war.\n\nMore: Pentagon begins building floating pier to ferry humanitarian aid to Gaza\n\nIsrael has faced increased pressure in recent weeks to make it easier for aid workers to get into Gaza. The death of seven international aid workers from World Central Kitchen in an Israeli airstrike pushed President Joe Biden to give Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu an ultimatum to either protect civilians and aid workers, or lose U.S. military support.\n\nIsrael said it would open new aid routes, but has not backed down from promises to invade the southern city of Rafah, where many refugees who have fled bombing in the north now reside.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Israeli military also destroyed Gaza's port, restricted fishing and bombed many of its farms.\n\nIsrael eventually loosened that siege but instituted a meticulous inspection process that it says is necessary to ensure that supplies do not fall into the hands of Hamas.

The head of the United Nations World Food Program says northern Gaza has entered \"full-blown famine\" after nearly seven months of war between Israel and Hamas. But a formal -- and highly sensitive -- famine declaration [...]\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- The head of the United Nations World Food Program says northern Gaza has entered \"full-blown famine\" after nearly seven months of war between Israel and Hamas. But a formal, and highly sensitive, famine declaration faces the complications of politics and of confirming how many people have died.\n\nCindy McCain in an NBC interview broadcast Sunday said severe Israeli restrictions on humanitarian deliveries to the territory that has long relied on outside food assistance have pushed civilians in the most isolated, devastated part of Gaza over the brink. Famine was now moving south in Gaza, she said.\n\nA WFP spokesman later told The Associated Press that one of the three benchmarks for a formal famine declaration has already been met in northern Gaza and another is nearly met -- important details on how far the effort to document deadly hunger has progressed.\n\nIsrael faces mounting pressure from top ally the United States and others to let more aid into Gaza, notably by opening more land crossings for the most efficient delivery by truck. Aid groups say deliveries by air and sea by the United States and other countries cannot meet the needs of Gaza's 2.3 million people, a growing number of them reaching the stage of malnutrition where a child's growth is stunted and deaths occur.\n\nFamine had been projected in parts of Gaza this month in a March report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, a global initiative that includes WFP as a partner. It said nearly a third of Gaza's population was experiencing the highest level of catastrophic hunger, and that could rise to nearly half by July.\n\nThe next IPC report is expected in July. Israel strongly rejects any claims of famine in Gaza, and its humanitarian agency called McCain's assertion incorrect. A formal declaration could be used as evidence at the International Criminal Court as well as at the International Court of Justice, where Israel faces allegations of genocide in a case brought by South Africa.\n\nHere's what we know about famine and the hunger crisis in Gaza.\n\nWHAT A FAMINE MEANS\n\nAccording to the IPC, an area is considered to be in famine when three things occur: 20% of households have an extreme lack of food, or essentially starving; at least 30% of children suffer from acute malnutrition or wasting, meaning they're too thin for their height; and two adults or four children per every 10,000 people are dying daily of hunger and its complications.\n\nIn northern Gaza, the first condition of extreme lack of food has been met, senior WFP spokesman Steve Taravella told The Associated Press. The second condition of child acute malnutrition is nearly met, he said. But the death rate could not be verified.\n\nDoing so is difficult. Aid groups note that Israeli airstrikes and raids have devastated medical facilities in northern Gaza and displaced much of the population. Along with restrictions on access, they complicate the ability to formally collect data on deaths.\n\nA document explaining famine published in March by the IPC noted, however, that an area can be classified as \"famine with reasonable evidence\" if two of the three thresholds have been reached and analysts believe from available evidence that the third likely has been reached.\n\n\"The bottom line is that people are practically dying from a lack of food, water and medicines. If we are waiting for the moment when all the facts are in hand to verify the final conditions to scientifically declare a famine, it would be after thousands of people have perished,\" Taravella said.\n\nTHE CAUSES OF CATASTROPHIC HUNGER\n\nShortly after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Israel sealed its borders with Gaza and for weeks prevented aid from entering. Aid groups have said assistance since then has been restricted to a trickle far below the 500 trucks of aid that entered before the war. Since March, as Israel has pointed to progress, an average of 171 trucks per day have entered Gaza, according to the U.S.-established Famine Early Warning Systems Network.\n\nOnce inside Gaza, food and other aid doesn't always reach the most vulnerable. Aid groups say access is limited, particularly in the north, due to ongoing fighting and a chaotic security situation.\n\nNorthern Gaza, including Gaza City, was the first target of Israel's invasion and became the epicenter of the hunger crisis, with many residents reduced to eating animal feed and foraging for weeds. The IPC report in March said around 210,000 people in the north were in catastrophic levels of hunger.\n\nThe very young, the very old and those with health problems are the most affected. On Sunday, a 6-year-old from northern Gaza with cystic fibrosis was taken to the United States on a humanitarian flight after his mother made a video pleading for help. Fadi Al-Zant's jutting ribs and thin arms showed advanced malnutrition.\n\nHOW TO AVERT A FAMINE\n\nHumanitarian groups say it will be difficult to deliver life-saving aid without a cease-fire. Even with a pause in fighting, some experts say the situation in northern Gaza will have life-lasting consequences, especially for newborns and pregnant women.\n\nWhile Israel has allowed more aid in recent weeks under international pressure, a humanitarian official for the U.S. Agency for International Development told the AP that since March, northern Gaza has not received anything like the aid needed to stave off famine. USAID made the official available on condition of the official's anonymity, citing security concerns over his work in conflict.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken has welcomed Israel's recent steps to increase deliveries but stressed such moves must be sustained. That's not easy. Israel on Sunday closed its main crossing point for delivering aid after a Hamas attack killed soldiers.\n\nVOICES FROM GAZA\n\nSome Palestinians say the increase in aid has eased things slightly, especially by lowering the cost of food.\n\nGaza City resident Said Siam said prices have dropped in recent weeks. Still, the 18-year-old said he and family members have each lost at least 10 kilograms (22 pounds) since the start of the war, mostly eating one meal of pumpkin soup each day. Fruits, vegetables and fresh meat are still scarce.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name":

It's so hard to look at and it's so hard to hear, also,\" she added. \"So I'm so hoping that we can get a ceasefire and begin to feed these people, especially in the North, in a much faster fashion.\"\n\nMore: Biden to meet with King of Jordan as US, Israel go 'back and forth' over Rafah invasion\n\nThe group estimated last week that 30% of children under the age of 2 in Gaza are \"acutely malnourished\" and 70% of the population in the north \"is facing catastrophic hunger.\"\n\nLocal health authorities say that more than 34,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the war began on Oct. 7, when Israel began a bombing campaign in retaliation for an attack in which Hamas killed around 1,200 people and took more than 200 people as hostages into Gaza.\n\nGaza has been in a hunger crisis for months as Israel bombards the strip. In the wake of the Oct. 7 attack, Israel launched a counterattack and called for a \"complete siege\" of Gaza, stopping any electricity, food, water or fuel from entering the territory. Israel also destroyed Gaza's port, and fishing and farming have become inaccessible.\n\nThat siege has since ended, but it is still challenging for aid workers to get supplies through to Palestinians. Israel conducts extensive inspections of the goods crossing the border through few checkpoints. American military forces are now building two floating piers off the Gaza coast to help deliver 2 million meals a day to people facing starvation as a result of the war.\n\nMore: Pentagon begins building floating pier to ferry humanitarian aid to Gaza\n\nIsrael has faced increased pressure in recent weeks to make it easier for aid workers to get into Gaza. The death of seven international aid workers from World Central Kitchen in an Israeli airstrike pushed President Joe Biden to give Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu an ultimatum to either protect civilians and aid workers, or lose U.S. military support.\n\nIsrael said it would open new aid routes, but has not backed down from promises to invade the southern city of Rafah, where many refugees who have fled bombing in the north now reside.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "riley_beggin@ca.news.yahoo.com", "name":

Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), Philippe Lazzarini, on Sunday accused Israel of continuing to deny the U.N. aid access in Gaza as it tries to avert famine.\n\n\"Only in the past 2 weeks, we have recorded 10 incidents involving shooting at convoys, arrests of UN staff including bullying, stripping them naked, threats with arms & long delays at checkpoints forcing convoys to move during the dark or abort,\" Lazzarini posted on X.\n\nLazzarini also called on \"Hamas and other armed groups to stop any attacks on humanitarian crossings, refrain from aid diversion and make sure assistance reaches all those in need.\" The militants claimed responsibility on Sunday for an attack that shut down the main humanitarian aid crossing into Gaza.\n\n'ALREADY DYING'\n\nA U.N.-backed report in March said famine was imminent and likely by May in northern Gaza, and could spread across the enclave by July. Famine is assessed as at least 20% of the population suffering extreme food shortages, with one in three children acutely malnourished and two people out of every 10,000 dying daily from starvation or from malnutrition and disease.\n\nU.N. officials say that generally by the time a famine is formally declared somewhere it is too late to save many people. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said last week that the most vulnerable in northern Gaza \"are already dying of hunger and disease.\"\n\nThe U.N. has complained about a lack of humanitarian aid access throughout the seven-month-long war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas in Gaza. Guterres has said the U.N. is trying to avert \"an entirely preventable, human-made famine\" in northern Gaza.\n\nIsrael is retaliating against Hamas over an Oct. 7 attack in which Israel says the militants killed about 1,200 people and took more than 250 people hostage. Gaza health authorities say Israel has killed more than 34,600 people in Gaza since then.\n\nHamas came to power in Gaza in 2006 after Israeli soldiers and settlers withdrew in 2005, but the enclave is still deemed as Israeli-occupied territory by the United Nations.\n\nAs the occupying power, the U.N. human rights chief has said Israel is obligated to ensure the provision of food and medical care to the population and to facilitate the work of humanitarian organizations trying to deliver aid.\n\n(Reporting by Michelle Nichols, Additional reporting by Maytaal Angel and Hatem Maher;

But a formal -- and highly sensitive -- famine declaration faces the complications of politics and of confirming how many people have died.\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- The head of the United Nations World Food Program says northern Gaza has entered \"full-blown famine\" after nearly seven months of war between Israel and Hamas. But a formal, and highly sensitive, famine declaration faces the complications of politics and of confirming how many people have died.\n\nCindy McCain in an NBC interview broadcast Sunday said severe Israeli restrictions on humanitarian deliveries to the territory that has long relied on outside food assistance have pushed civilians in the most isolated, devastated part of Gaza over the brink. Famine was now moving south in Gaza, she said.\n\nA WFP spokesman later told The Associated Press that one of the three benchmarks for a formal famine declaration has already been met in northern Gaza and another is nearly met -- important details on how far the effort to document deadly hunger has progressed.\n\nIsrael faces mounting pressure from top ally the United States and others to let more aid into Gaza, notably by opening more land crossings for the most efficient delivery by truck. Aid groups say deliveries by air and sea by the United States and other countries cannot meet the needs of Gaza's 2.3 million people, a growing number of them reaching the stage of malnutrition where a child's growth is stunted and deaths occur.\n\nFamine had been projected in parts of Gaza this month in a March report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, a global initiative that includes WFP as a partner. It said nearly a third of Gaza's population was experiencing the highest level of catastrophic hunger, and that could rise to nearly half by July.\n\nThe next IPC report is expected in July. Israel strongly rejects any claims of famine in Gaza, and its humanitarian agency called McCain's assertion incorrect. A formal declaration could be used as evidence at the International Criminal Court as well as at the International Court of Justice, where Israel faces allegations of genocide in a case brought by South Africa.\n\nHere's what we know about famine and the hunger crisis in Gaza.\n\nWHAT A FAMINE MEANS\n\nAccording to the IPC, an area is considered to be in famine when three things occur: 20% of households have an extreme lack of food, or essentially starving; at least 30% of children suffer from acute malnutrition or wasting, meaning they're too thin for their height; and two adults or four children per every 10,000 people are dying daily of hunger and its complications.\n\nIn northern Gaza, the first condition of extreme lack of food has been met, senior WFP spokesman Steve Taravella told The Associated Press. The second condition of child acute malnutrition is nearly met, he said. But the death rate could not be verified.\n\nDoing so is difficult. Aid groups note that Israeli airstrikes and raids have devastated medical facilities in northern Gaza and displaced much of the population. Along with restrictions on access, they complicate the ability to formally collect data on deaths.\n\nA document explaining famine published in March by the IPC noted, however, that an area can be classified as \"famine with reasonable evidence\" if two of the three thresholds have been reached and analysts believe from available evidence that the third likely has been reached.\n\n\"The bottom line is that people are practically dying from a lack of food, water and medicines. If we are waiting for the moment when all the facts are in hand to verify the final conditions to scientifically declare a famine, it would be after thousands of people have perished,\" Taravella said.\n\nTHE CAUSES OF CATASTROPHIC HUNGER\n\nShortly after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Israel sealed its borders with Gaza and for weeks prevented aid from entering. Aid groups have said assistance since then has been restricted to a trickle far below the 500 trucks of aid that entered before the war. Since March, as Israel has pointed to progress, an average of 171 trucks per day have entered Gaza, according to the U.S.-established Famine Early Warning Systems Network.\n\nOnce inside Gaza, food and other aid doesn't always reach the most vulnerable. Aid groups say access is limited, particularly in the north, due to ongoing fighting and a chaotic security situation.\n\nNorthern Gaza, including Gaza City, was the first target of Israel's invasion and became the epicenter of the hunger crisis, with many residents reduced to eating animal feed and foraging for weeds. The IPC report in March said around 210,000 people in the north were in catastrophic levels of hunger.\n\nThe very young, the very old and those with health problems are the most affected. On Sunday, a 6-year-old from northern Gaza with cystic fibrosis was taken to the United States on a humanitarian flight after his mother made a video pleading for help. Fadi Al-Zant's jutting ribs and thin arms showed advanced malnutrition.\n\nHOW TO AVERT A FAMINE\n\nHumanitarian groups say it will be difficult to deliver life-saving aid without a cease-fire. Even with a pause in fighting, some experts say the situation in northern Gaza will have life-lasting consequences, especially for newborns and pregnant women.\n\nWhile Israel has allowed more aid in recent weeks under international pressure, a humanitarian official for the U.S. Agency for International Development told the AP that since March, northern Gaza has not received anything like the aid needed to stave off famine. USAID made the official available on condition of the official's anonymity, citing security concerns over his work in conflict.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken has welcomed Israel's recent steps to increase deliveries but stressed such moves must be sustained. That's not easy. Israel on Sunday closed its main crossing point for delivering aid after a Hamas attack killed soldiers.\n\nVOICES FROM GAZA\n\nSome Palestinians say the increase in aid has eased things slightly, especially by lowering the cost of food.\n\nGaza City resident Said Siam said prices have dropped in recent weeks. Still, the 18-year-old said he and family members have each lost at least 10 kilograms (22 pounds) since the start of the war, mostly eating one meal of pumpkin soup each day. Fruits, vegetables and fresh meat are still scarce.\n\nKnickmeyer reported from Washington.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war", "source": {"uri":

Famine is assessed as at least 20% of the population suffering extreme food shortages, with one in three children acutely malnourished and two people out of every 10,000 dying daily from starvation or from malnutrition and disease.\n\nUN officials say that generally by the time a famine is formally declared somewhere it is too late to save many people. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said last week that the most vulnerable in northern Gaza \"are already dying of hunger and disease.\"\n\nThe UN has complained about a lack of humanitarian aid access throughout the seven-month-long war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas in Gaza. Guterres has said the U.N. is trying to avert \"an entirely preventable, human-made famine\" in northern Gaza.\n\nIsrael is retaliating against Hamas over an Oct 7 attack in which Israel says the militants killed about 1,200 people and took more than 250 people hostage. Gaza health authorities say Israel has killed more than 34,600 people in Gaza since then.\n\nHamas came to power in Gaza in 2006 after Israeli soldiers and settlers withdrew in 2005, but the enclave is still deemed as Israeli-occupied territory by the United Nations.\n\nAs the occupying power, the UN human rights chief has said Israel is obligated to ensure the provision of food and medical care to the population and to facilitate the work of humanitarian organizations trying to deliver aid.", "source": {"uri": "bdnews24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "bdnews24.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bdnews24_com@bdnews24.com", "name": "Bdnews24 Com", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah_Border_Crossing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafah Border Crossing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclave_and_exclave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enclave and exclave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Food Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John McCain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Lazzarini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philippe Lazzarini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UNRWA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_checkpoint", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Security checkpoint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malnutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant\u00f3nio_Guterres", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ant\u00f3nio Guterres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian fedayeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starvation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli-occupied territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_occupation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military occupation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://cdn.bdnews24.com/bdnews24/media/english/imgAll/2024May/PLATE/drone-picture-060524-01-1714937970.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538170", "eventUri": "eng-9538170", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2603, "textEnd": 2608}], "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

But a formal, and highly sensitive, famine declaration faces the complications of politics and of confirming how many people have died.\n\nCindy McCain in an NBC interview broadcast Sunday said severe Israeli restrictions on humanitarian deliveries to the territory that has long relied on outside food assistance have pushed civilians in the most isolated, devastated part of Gaza over the brink. Famine was now moving south in Gaza, she said.\n\nA WFP spokesman later told The Associated Press that one of the three benchmarks for a formal famine declaration has already been met in northern Gaza and another is nearly met - important details on how far the effort to document deadly hunger has progressed.\n\nIsrael faces mounting pressure from top ally the United States and others to let more aid into Gaza, notably by opening more land crossings for the most efficient delivery by truck. Aid groups say deliveries by air and sea by the United States and other countries cannot meet the needs of Gaza's 2.3 million people, a growing number of them reaching the stage of malnutrition where a child's growth is stunted and deaths occur.\n\nFamine had been projected in parts of Gaza this month in a March report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, a global initiative that includes WFP as a partner. It said nearly a third of Gaza's population was experiencing the highest level of catastrophic hunger, and that could rise to nearly half by July.\n\nThe next IPC report is expected in July.

What Does That Mean?", "body": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- The head of the United Nations World Food Program says northern Gaza has entered \"full-blown famine\" after nearly seven months of war between Israel and Hamas. But a formal, and highly sensitive, famine declaration faces the complications of politics and of confirming how many people have died.\n\nCindy McCain in an NBC interview broadcast Sunday said severe Israeli restrictions on humanitarian deliveries to the territory that has long relied on outside food assistance have pushed civilians in the most isolated, devastated part of Gaza over the brink. Famine was now moving south in Gaza, she said.\n\nA WFP spokesman later told The Associated Press that one of the three benchmarks for a formal famine declaration has already been met in northern Gaza and another is nearly met -- important details on how far the effort to document deadly hunger has progressed.\n\nIsrael faces mounting pressure from top ally the United States and others to let more aid into Gaza, notably by opening more land crossings for the most efficient delivery by truck. Aid groups say deliveries by air and sea by the United States and other countries cannot meet the needs of Gaza's 2.3 million people, a growing number of them reaching the stage of malnutrition where a child's growth is stunted and deaths occur.\n\nFamine had been projected in parts of Gaza this month in a March report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, a global initiative that includes WFP as a partner. It said nearly a third of Gaza's population was experiencing the highest level of catastrophic hunger, and that could rise to nearly half by July.\n\nThe next IPC report is expected in July. Israel strongly rejects any claims of famine in Gaza, and its humanitarian agency called McCain's assertion incorrect. A formal declaration could be used as evidence at the International Criminal Court as well as at the International Court of Justice, where Israel faces allegations of genocide in a case brought by South Africa.\n\nHere's what we know about famine and the hunger crisis in Gaza.\n\nAccording to the IPC, an area is considered to be in famine when three things occur: 20% of households have an extreme lack of food, or essentially starving; at least 30% of children suffer from acute malnutrition or wasting, meaning they're too thin for their height; and two adults or four children per every 10,000 people are dying daily of hunger and its complications.\n\nIn northern Gaza, the first condition of extreme lack of food has been met, senior WFP spokesman Steve Taravella told The Associated Press. The second condition of child acute malnutrition is nearly met, he said. But the death rate could not be verified.\n\nDoing so is difficult. Aid groups note that Israeli airstrikes and raids have devastated medical facilities in northern Gaza and displaced much of the population. Along with restrictions on access, they complicate the ability to formally collect data on deaths.\n\nA document explaining famine published in March by the IPC noted, however, that an area can be classified as \"famine with reasonable evidence\" if two of the three thresholds have been reached and analysts believe from available evidence that the third likely has been reached.\n\n\"The bottom line is that people are practically dying from a lack of food, water and medicines.

No other U.S. official has made that assessment.\n\nMs. McCain said that while there has not yet been an official declaration of famine, based on what her organization has seen and experienced on the ground, she believes there is a \"full-blown\" issue in Gaza.\n\n\"It's horror. It's - You know, it's so hard to look at and it's so hard to hear, also,\" McCain said in her interview.\n\nShe went on to say that she is hopeful for a ceasefire in Gaza so that people can begin to be fed \"in a much faster fashion.\" Ms. McCain added that the people in Gaza need \"water, sanitation, medicine - it's all part of the famine -- the famine issue.\"\n\nEfforts to provide food aid to Gaza have been met both by Israeli resistance and ceaseless air strikes.\n\nWorld Central Kitchen, a U.S.-based nonprofit group that has distributed over 43 million meals across Gaza, just resumed operations Monday after seven of its aid workers were killed by an Israeli airstrike on April 1.\n\nEarlier this week, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged the international community to \"do everything possible to avert an entirely preventable human-made famine\".\n\nLack of security is a major obstacle to distributing aid across Gaza, and he stressed that humanitarian convoys, facilities and personnel as well as people in need \"must not be targets\".\n\n\"We welcome aid delivery by air and sea, but there is no alternative to the massive use of land routes,\" he said, before again calling on Israel to allow and facilitate safe, rapid and unimpeded humanitarian access throughout Gaza, including for the UN's Palestine relief agency, UNRWA.\n\nGuterres also addressed how Israeli attacks have \"decimated\" the health system in the enclave, where two thirds of hospitals and health centres are out of commission, while many of those remaining are seriously damaged.\n\n\"Some hospitals now resemble cemeteries,\" he said, voicing deep alarm over reports of the discovery of mass graves at several locations, including at Al-Shifa and Nasser hospitals.\n\nMore than 390 bodies reportedly have been exhumed at Nasser Hospital alone, and \"there are competing narratives around several of these mass graves, including serious allegations that some of those buried were \"unlawfully killed,\" he added.\n\nThe UN chief said it is imperative that independent international forensic investigators are allowed immediate access to these sites to determine the precise circumstances under which hundreds of Palestinians lost their lives and were buried or reburied.\n\n\"The families of the dead and missing have a right to know what happened, and the world has a right to accountability for any violations of international law that may have taken place,\" he said.\n\nThe Secretary-General ended his remarks by drawing attention to UNRWA and its \"irreplaceable and indispensable work\"\u009d supporting millions of Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.\n\n\"UNRWA's presence across the region is a source of hope and stability. Its education, healthcare and other services provide a sense of normality, safety and stability to desperate communities,\" he said.\n\nThe agency recently appealed for $1.2 billion to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and to respond to needs in the West Bank, where violence is rising.\n\nUNRWA largely depends on donors and some 16 countries halted their contributions earlier this year following Israeli allegations that 12 staff were involved in the 7 October attacks. The UN appointed an independent body to review the agency's efforts to ensure the humanitarian principle of neutrality.\n\nThe panel, headed by former French foreign minister Catherine Colonna, recently published its report which found that \"the set of rules and the mechanisms and procedures in place (at UNRWA) are the most elaborate within the UN system\".\n\nGuterres said an action plan is being put in place to implement the report's recommendations, and he appealed for cooperation from donors, host countries and staff.\n\nMeanwhile, most countries that suspended contributions to UNRWA have resumed them, and the Secretary-General said \"we are optimistic that others will join.\" Additionally, some UN Member States have given to the agency for the first time, while private donors have also provided support.\n\nHowever, as a funding gap persists, he urged Member States and donors to pledge generously to ensure the agency's work continues.\n\n\"This is the moment to reaffirm our hope for and contributions to a two-State solution - the only sustainable path to peace and security for Israelis, Palestinians and the wider region,\" he concluded.", "source": {"uri":

Aid Official says", "body": "Parts of Gaza in 'Full-Blown Famine,' U.N. Aid Official says\n\nMay 05, 2024 News\n\nKaieteur News - Cindy McCain, the director of the World Food Program, said starvation is entrenched in northern Gaza and is \"moving its way south.\"\n\nThe leader of the World Food Program said that parts of the Gaza Strip are experiencing a \"full-blown famine\" that is spreading across the territory after almost seven months of war that have made delivering aid extremely challenging.\n\n\"There is famine -- full-blown famine in the north, and it's moving its way south,\" Cindy McCain, the program's director, said in excerpts released late Friday of an interview with \"Meet The Press.\"\n\nMs. McCain is the second high-profile American who is leading a U.S. government or U.N. aid effort, who has said that there is famine in northern Gaza, although her remarks do not constitute an official declaration, which is a complex bureaucratic process. She did not explain why an official famine declaration has not been made. But she said her assessment was \"based on what we have seen and what we have experienced on the ground.\"\n\nThe New York Times reported that the hunger crisis is most severe in the strip's northern section, a largely lawless and gang ridden area where the Israeli military exercises little or no control. In recent weeks, after Israel faced mounting global pressure to improve dire conditions there, more aid has flowed into the devastated area.\n\nOn the diplomatic front, negotiations resumed in Cairo on Saturday aimed at reaching a cease-fire and an agreement to release Israeli and Palestinian hostages. A delegation of Hamas leaders traveled to the Egyptian capital, the Palestinian armed group said.\n\nIsrael unfortunately had not dispatched a delegation to Cairo to engage in indirect negotiations with the Hamas officials, as Israeli officials had done in previous rounds of talks, according to two Israeli officials who, following diplomatic protocol, spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nEven if Hamas announced in Cairo that it had accepted the proposed deal, a truce was unlikely to be imminent, one of the Israeli officials said. Hamas's approval would be followed by intensive negotiations to hash out the finer details of a cease-fire, and such talks are likely to be protracted and difficult, the official added.\n\nMs. McCain said a cease-fire could help ease conditions in Gaza.\n\n\"It is horror,\" she said on \"Meet the Press.\" \"It is so hard to look at, and it is so hard to hear, also. I am so hoping we can get a cease-fire and begin to feed these people, especially in the north, in a much faster fashion.\"\n\nMs. McCain, the widow of Senator John McCain, was appointed by President Biden as the American ambassador to the U.N. Agencies for Food and Agriculture in 2021 and became head of the World Food Program, a U.N. agency, last year.\n\nAn official declaration of famine is made by a United Nations agency, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, and the government of the country where the famine is taking place. It is unclear what local authority might have the power to do that in Gaza. Declarations, which are based on measured rates of hunger, malnutrition and death over short periods, are rare. But for aid groups, a famine elevates one crisis above competing disasters and helps them raise money to respond.\n\nGaza has been gripped by what experts have called a severe human-made hunger crisis. Israel's bombardment and restrictions in the territory have made delivering aid very difficult. The amount of aid entering Gaza has increased recently, but aid groups say it is far from adequate.\n\nIsrael eventually loosened the siege but instituted a meticulous inspection process that it says is necessary to ensure that weapons and other supplies do not fall into the hands of Hamas. Aid groups and foreign diplomats have said the inspections create bottlenecks, and have accused Israel of arbitrarily turning away aid, including water filters, solar lights and medical kits that contain scissors, for spurious reasons.\n\nVolker T\u00fcrk, the U.N. human rights chief, said in a statement last month that Israel's policies regarding aid in Gaza could amount to a war crime.\n\nUsing starvation of civilians as a weapon is a serious violation of international humanitarian law and a war crime under the Rome Statute, the treaty of the International Criminal Court, or I.C.C.\n\nIsraeli and foreign officials told The New York Times last week that they were worried that the I.C.C. was preparing to issue arrest warrants against senior Israeli officials -- including potentially over accusations that they prevented the delivery of aid to civilians in Gaza. (They also said they believed that the court was considering arrest warrants for Hamas leaders, which could be issued concurrently.)\n\nMeanwhile, last week, the BBC reported that thousands of students, at more than 130 colleges and universities across the US, have demonstrated in opposition to the ongoing war in Gaza with protests and encampments.\n\nMore than 2,000 demonstrators have been arrested, but the protests continue.\n\nSince the October 7 attack by Hamas and Israel's retaliatory assault, students have launched rallies, sit-ins, fasts and, most recently, encampments against the war.\n\nThey are demanding that their schools, many with massive endowments, financially divest from Israel.\n\nDivestment, for many of the protesters, means cutting those endowments' ties to Israeli companies or ones that do business with Israel. Many also want their universities to end academic relationships with Israeli institutions.\n\nStudent activists say that companies doing business in Israel, or with Israeli organisations, are complicit in its ongoing war in Gaza - as are colleges investing in those companies.\n\nUniversity endowments fund everything from research labs to scholarship funds, mostly using returns from millions - and billions - of dollars in investments.\n\nThe encampments began last month, with dozens of students at Columbia University pitching tents on a campus lawns, while the president of the New York City university testified before Congress about antisemitism.\n\nThe police moved in a day later and detained the protesters, sparking a wave of action at other colleges across the US.\n\nActivists quickly set up camp again at Columbia and eventually moved into an academic building. The police were called in again due to vandalism and risks to public safety, the university said. More than 100 arrests were made as both the building and encampment were cleared. The escalating crisis at Columbia inspired similar protests and encampments across the country.\n\nThe BBC has counted more than 130 colleges and universities in the US where protests or encampments have arisen in the past few weeks. Protests have occurred in 45 states and Washington D.C.\n\nPro-Palestinian protesters have also gathered over the past week on university campuses in Australia, Canada, France, Italy and the UK.",

(File)\n\nThe Gaza Strip is suffering an unfolding humanitarian catastrophe nearly seven months since Israel launched a devastating offensive in response to the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks that killed 1,200 people in Israel.\n\nMore than 34,600 people have been killed in the Israeli offensive which has laid to waste much of the Gaza Strip, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, with thousands more dead feared lost under the rubble.\n\nHere are some details of the humanitarian situation:\n\nDISPLACEMENT, SHELTER\n\nAn estimated 1.7 million people, more than 75% of Gaza's population, have been displaced, many of them forced to move repeatedly, according to the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA).\n\nMany have sought shelter in Rafah at the Egyptian border where the threat of an Israeli assault has loomed large for months, stoking concerns of an even bigger humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe displaced have crammed into overcrowded shelters in or near UNRWA facilities such as schools, makeshift tents, and homes that have not been flattened.\n\nThe conflict has damaged or destroyed roughly 62% of all homes in Gaza, or 290,820 housing units, according to a World Bank interim damage assessment published in March.\n\nIt could take some 14 years to remove the vast amount of rubble including unexploded ordnance, according to a senior officer at the U.N. Mine Action Service.\n\nLOOMING FAMINE\n\nThe World Food Programme (WFP) says that 1.1 million people in Gaza are suffering catastrophic levels of hunger. The situation is particularly dire in the north.\n\nThere has not been a formal declaration of famine in Gaza by U.N. agencies: such a declaration hinges on a set of criteria measuring the extent of hunger suffered by a population and is assessed by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), an initiative of more than a dozen U.N. agencies, regional bodies and aid groups.\n\nHowever, WFP Executive Director Cindy McCain told NBC News there was now \"full-blown famine\" in northern Gaza.\n\nIn excerpts of an interview to be aired on May 5 on \"Meet the Press\", McCain told NBC that she hoped for a ceasefire accord so that more aid could be delivered faster.\n\n\"There is famine - full-blown famine - in the north, and it's moving its way south. And so what we're asking for and what we've continually asked for is a ceasefire and the ability to have unfettered access,\" said McCain.\n\nHer remarks followed comments by deputy WFP head Carl Skau on April 25 that more aid must be delivered to avert famine in northern Gaza, despite what he described as an uptick in deliveries and some progress in accessing that part of Gaza.\n\nThe Gaza health ministry reported on April 25 that at least 28 children, most of them no older than 12 months, had died as a result of malnutrition and dehydration since February.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO), in a report covering the period up to April 20, said 16-25% of children aged from 6-59 months have acute malnutrition in northern Gaza, while 2-4% of them had severe acute malnutrition. In southern Gaza, 3-7% of children have acute malnutrition, it said.\n\nTowards the end of April, four bakeries had reopened in northern Gaza with WFP support. UNRWA has called it a drop in the ocean.\n\nThe senior U.N. humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza Sigrid Kaag said on April 24 the scarcity of food and other essential goods had led to a breakdown in civil order, and there was no effective law enforcement.\n\nPRESSURE ON ISRAEL FOR MORE AID\n\nIsrael, which imposed a complete siege on Gaza in the early days of the war, has faced growing international pressure including from its ally the United States to let in more aid. U.S. pressure on Israel mounted further after an Israeli attack killed seven World Central Kitchen aid workers on April 1.\n\nIsrael checks all aid shipments before they enter Gaza.\n\nIn early April, Israel pledged to improve aid access, particularly to northern Gaza, including reopening the Erez crossing and allowing the use of Ashdod port. The Israeli army said on April 28 the amount of aid going into Gaza would be ramped up in the coming days.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on April 29 there had been \"measurable progress\" in the humanitarian situation. But he said it still wasn't sufficient and said he would press Israeli officials to do more.\n\nIn March, the EU foreign policy chief said Israel was provoking famine in Gaza and using starvation as a weapon of war. Israel's foreign minister rejected the accusation, saying it had let in \"extensive humanitarian aid\". Israel has also accused Hamas of stealing aid - which Hamas strongly denies - and placed blame on U.N. agencies, calling them inefficient.\n\nThe United States is building a pier off Gaza to deliver aid, though U.N. officials have said this is no substitute for land routes from Israel into Gaza. The United States and some of its allies have also air-dropped aid to Gaza. A number of Palestinians have drowned or been killed by air-dropped aid.\n\nDISEASE SPREADS AMID DECIMATED HEALTH SYSTEM\n\nHealth infrastructure in Gaza has been decimated, U.N. humanitarian official Kaag said on April 24. The few hospitals still standing struggle to operate due to severe shortages of supplies and frequent power outages. \"As summer draws near and temperatures rise, communicable diseases threaten to sweep through Gaza,\" she said.\n\nThe WHO says only 11 of Gaza's 36 hospitals are even partially functioning - five in the north and six in the south. Donors have set up six field hospitals in southern Gaza.\n\nUNRWA says that as of April 18, eight of the 24 health centres it operates in the Gaza Strip were operational.\n\nIn a snapshot of the dire situation, the WHO reported that two medical points near the largest site for displaced people in east Khan Younis were inundated with daily cases of hepatitis, skin diseases, and diarrhoea, and critically low on medical supplies when U.N. officials visited on April 9.\n\nThe WHO said an estimated 9,000 critical patients need to be evacuated from Gaza.\n\nWATER, SANITATION\n\nGaza had suffered a water crisis for years before the latest conflict. It has worsened markedly since the war began.\n\nAid agencies warned in February that the majority of people had no access to clean drinking water and that sanitation services were wholly ineffective, with none of Gaza's wastewater treatment systems working.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nOutbreaks of diarrhoeal diseases and hepatitis A were among the indicators of dire water supplies and sanitation. They urged sufficient fuel for the operation of critical water and sanitation plants.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated

But she said her assessment was \"based on what we have seen and what we have experienced on the ground.\"\n\nThe hunger crisis is most severe in the strip's northern section, a largely lawless and gang-ridden area where the Israeli military exercises little or no control. In recent weeks, after Israel faced mounting global pressure to improve dire conditions there, more aid has flowed into devastated the area.\n\nOn the diplomatic front, negotiations resumed in Cairo on Saturday aimed at reaching a cease-fire and an agreement to release Israeli and Palestinian hostages. A delegation of Hamas leaders traveled to the Egyptian capital, the Palestinian armed group said.\n\nOver the past few days, Israel and mediators in the talks -- Egypt, Qatar and the United States -- have awaited Hamas' response to the latest cease-fire proposal, with Hamas signaling that it was open to discussing the Israeli-approved offer. On Friday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said U.S. officials were waiting to see if Hamas \"can take 'yes' for an answer on the cease-fire and the release of hostages.\"\n\n\"The only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a cease-fire is Hamas,\" Blinken said at the McCain Institute in Arizona. \"So we look to see what they will do.\"\n\nHusam Badran, a senior Hamas official, said in a text message that the group's representatives came to Cairo \"with great positivity\" toward the proposed deal. \"If there is no agreement, it will be because of Netanyahu alone,\" he said, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nFor weeks, Netanyahu has vowed that Israeli forces will invade Rafah, where many of Hamas' remaining military forces are believed to be arrayed alongside some of its leaders. The plan has prompted widespread criticism, including from the Biden administration, fueled by concern for the safety of more than 1 million displaced Palestinians from Gaza sheltering there.\n\nAs of Saturday, Israel had not dispatched a delegation to Cairo to engage in indirect negotiations with Hamas officials, as Israeli officials had done in previous rounds of talks, according to two Israeli officials who, following diplomatic protocol, spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nEven if Hamas announced in Cairo that it had accepted the proposed deal, a truce was unlikely to be imminent, one of the Israeli officials said. Hamas' approval would be followed by intensive negotiations to hash out the finer details of a cease-fire, and such talks are likely to be protracted and difficult, the official added.\n\nMcCain said a cease-fire could help ease conditions in Gaza.\n\n\"It is horror,\" she said on \"Meet the Press.\" \"It is so hard to look at, and it is so hard to hear, also. I am so hoping we can get a cease-fire and begin to feed these people, especially in the north, in a much faster fashion.\"\n\nThe first U.S. official to say there was famine in Gaza during the conflict was Samantha Power, director of the U.S. Agency for International Development, who made her remarks in congressional testimony last month.\n\nMcCain, the widow of Sen. John McCain, was appointed by President Joe Biden as U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Agencies for Food and Agriculture in 2021 and became head of the World Food Program, a U.N. agency, last year.\n\nAn official declaration of famine is made by a U.N. agency, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, and the government of the country where the famine is taking place. It is unclear what local authority might have the power to do that in Gaza. Declarations, which are based on measured rates of hunger, malnutrition and death over short periods, are rare. But for aid groups, a famine elevates one crisis above competing disasters and helps them raise money to respond.\n\nGaza has been gripped by what experts have called a severe human-made hunger crisis. Israel's bombardment and restrictions in the territory have made delivering aid difficult. The amount of aid entering Gaza has increased recently, but aid groups say it is far from adequate.\n\nFor the first three weeks of the war, Israel maintained what it called a \"complete siege\" of Gaza, with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant saying that \"no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel\" would be allowed into the territory. The Israeli military also destroyed Gaza's port, restricted fishing and bombed many of its farms.", "source": {"uri": "westhawaiitoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "West Hawaii Today"},

What does that mean?", "body": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- The head of the United Nations World Food Program says northern Gaza has entered \"full-blown famine\" after nearly seven months of war between Israel and Hamas. But a formal, and highly sensitive, famine declaration faces the complications of politics and of confirming how many people have died.\n\nCindy McCain in an NBC interview broadcast Sunday said severe Israeli restrictions on humanitarian deliveries to the territory that has long relied on outside food assistance have pushed civilians in the most isolated, devastated part of Gaza over the brink. Famine was now moving south in Gaza, she said.\n\nA WFP spokesman later told The Associated Press that one of the three benchmarks for a formal famine declaration has already been met in northern Gaza and another is nearly met -- important details on how far the effort to document deadly hunger has progressed.\n\nIsrael faces mounting pressure from top ally the United States and others to let more aid into Gaza, notably by opening more land crossings for the most efficient delivery by truck. Aid groups say deliveries by air and sea by the United States and other countries cannot meet the needs of Gaza's 2.3 million people, a growing number of them reaching the stage of malnutrition where a child's growth is stunted and deaths occur.\n\nFamine had been projected in parts of Gaza this month in a March report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, a global initiative that includes WFP as a partner. It said nearly a third of Gaza's population was experiencing the highest level of catastrophic hunger, and that could rise to nearly half by July.\n\nThe next IPC report is expected in July. Israel strongly rejects any claims of famine in Gaza, and its humanitarian agency called McCain's assertion incorrect. A formal declaration could be used as evidence at the International Criminal Court as well as at the International Court of Justice, where Israel faces allegations of genocide in a case brought by South Africa.\n\nHere's what we know about famine and the hunger crisis in Gaza.\n\nWHAT A FAMINE MEANS\n\nAccording to the IPC, an area is considered to be in famine when three things occur: 20% of households have an extreme lack of food, or essentially starving; at least 30% of children suffer from acute malnutrition or wasting, meaning they're too thin for their height; and two adults or four children per every 10,000 people are dying daily of hunger and its complications.\n\nIn northern Gaza, the first condition of extreme lack of food has been met, senior WFP spokesman Steve Taravella told The Associated Press. The second condition of child acute malnutrition is nearly met, he said. But the death rate could not be verified.\n\nDoing so is difficult. Aid groups note that Israeli airstrikes and raids have devastated medical facilities in northern Gaza and displaced much of the population. Along with restrictions on access, they complicate the ability to formally collect data on deaths.\n\nA document explaining famine published in March by the IPC noted, however, that an area can be classified as \"famine with reasonable evidence\" if two of the three thresholds have been reached and analysts believe from available evidence that the third likely has been reached.\n\n\"The bottom line is that people are practically dying from a lack of food, water and medicines. If we are waiting for the moment when all the facts are in hand to verify the final conditions to scientifically declare a famine, it would be after thousands of people have perished,\" Taravella said.\n\nTHE CAUSES OF CATASTROPHIC HUNGER\n\nShortly after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Israel sealed its borders with Gaza and for weeks prevented aid from entering. Aid groups have said assistance since then has been restricted to a trickle far below the 500 trucks of aid that entered before the war. Since March, as Israel has pointed to progress, an average of 171 trucks per day have entered Gaza, according to the U.S.-established Famine Early Warning Systems Network.\n\nOnce inside Gaza, food and other aid doesn't always reach the most vulnerable. Aid groups say access is limited, particularly in the north, due to ongoing fighting and a chaotic security situation.\n\nNorthern Gaza, including Gaza City, was the first target of Israel's invasion and became the epicenter of the hunger crisis, with many residents reduced to eating animal feed and foraging for weeds. The IPC report in March said around 210,000 people in the north were in catastrophic levels of hunger.\n\nThe very young, the very old and those with health problems are the most affected. On Sunday, a 6-year-old from northern Gaza with cystic fibrosis was taken to the United States on a humanitarian flight after his mother made a video pleading for help. Fadi Al-Zant's jutting ribs and thin arms showed advanced malnutrition.\n\nHOW TO AVERT A FAMINE\n\nHumanitarian groups say it will be difficult to deliver life-saving aid without a cease-fire. Even with a pause in fighting, some experts say the situation in northern Gaza will have life-lasting consequences, especially for newborns and pregnant women.\n\nWhile Israel has allowed more aid in recent weeks under international pressure, a humanitarian official for the U.S. Agency for International Development told the AP that since March, northern Gaza has not received anything like the aid needed to stave off famine. USAID made the official available on condition of the official's anonymity, citing security concerns over his work in conflict.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken has welcomed Israel's recent steps to increase deliveries but stressed such moves must be sustained. That's not easy. Israel on Sunday closed its main crossing point for delivering aid after a Hamas attack killed soldiers.\n\nVOICES FROM GAZA\n\nSome Palestinians say the increase in aid has eased things slightly, especially by lowering the cost of food.\n\nGaza City resident Said Siam said prices have dropped in recent weeks. Still, the 18-year-old said he and family members have each lost at least 10 kilograms (22 pounds) since the start of the war, mostly eating one meal of pumpkin soup each day. Fruits, vegetables and fresh meat are still scarce.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war", "source": {"uri": "kdvr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX31

Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA).\n\nMany have sought shelter in Rafah at the Egyptian border where the threat of an Israeli assault has loomed large for months, stoking concerns of an even bigger humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe displaced have crammed into overcrowded shelters in or near UNRWA facilities such as schools, makeshift tents, and homes that have not been flattened.\n\nThe conflict has damaged or destroyed roughly 62% of all homes in Gaza, or 290,820 housing units, according to a World Bank interim damage assessment published in March.\n\nIt could take some 14 years to remove the vast amount of rubble including unexploded ordnance, according to a senior officer at the U.N. Mine Action Service.\n\nThe World Food Programme (WFP) says that 1.1 million people in Gaza are suffering catastrophic levels of hunger. The situation is particularly dire in the north.\n\nThere has not been a formal declaration of famine in Gaza by U.N. agencies: such a declaration hinges on a set of criteria measuring the extent of hunger suffered by a population and is assessed by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), an initiative of more than a dozen U.N. agencies, regional bodies and aid groups.\n\nHowever, WFP Executive Director Cindy McCain told NBC News there was now \"full-blown famine\" in northern Gaza.\n\nIn excerpts of an interview to be aired on May 5 on \"Meet the Press\", McCain told NBC that she hoped for a ceasefire accord so that more aid could be delivered faster.\n\n\"There is famine - full-blown famine - in the north, and it's moving its way south. And so what we're asking for and what we've continually asked for is a ceasefire and the ability to have unfettered access,\" said McCain.\n\nHer remarks followed comments by deputy WFP head Carl Skau on April 25 that more aid must be delivered to avert famine in northern Gaza, despite what he described as an uptick in deliveries and some progress in accessing that part of Gaza.\n\nThe Gaza health ministry reported on April 25 that at least 28 children, most of them no older than 12 months, had died as a result of malnutrition and dehydration since February.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO), in a report covering the period up to April 20, said 16-25% of children aged from 6-59 months have acute malnutrition in northern Gaza, while 2-4% of them had severe acute malnutrition. In southern Gaza, 3-7% of children have acute malnutrition, it said.\n\nTowards the end of April, four bakeries had reopened in northern Gaza with WFP support. UNRWA has called it a drop in the ocean.\n\nThe senior U.N. humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza Sigrid Kaag said on April 24 the scarcity of food and other essential goods had led to a breakdown in civil order, and there was no effective law enforcement.\n\nIsrael, which imposed a complete siege on Gaza in the early days of the war, has faced growing international pressure including from its ally the United States to let in more aid. U.S. pressure on Israel mounted further after an Israeli attack killed seven World Central Kitchen aid workers on April 1.\n\nIsrael checks all aid shipments before they enter Gaza.\n\nIn early April, Israel pledged to improve aid access, particularly to northern Gaza, including reopening the Erez crossing and allowing the use of Ashdod port. The Israeli army said on April 28 the amount of aid going into Gaza would be ramped up in the coming days.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on April 29 there had been \"measurable progress\" in the humanitarian situation. But he said it still wasn't sufficient and said he would press Israeli officials to do more.\n\nIn March, the EU foreign policy chief said Israel was provoking famine in Gaza and using starvation as a weapon of war. Israel's foreign minister rejected the accusation, saying it had let in \"extensive humanitarian aid\". Israel has also accused Hamas of stealing aid - which Hamas strongly denies - and placed blame on U.N. agencies, calling them inefficient.\n\nThe United States is building a pier off Gaza to deliver aid, though U.N. officials have said this is no substitute for land routes from Israel into Gaza. The United States and some of its allies have also air-dropped aid to Gaza. A number of Palestinians have drowned or been killed by air-dropped aid.\n\nHealth infrastructure in Gaza has been decimated, U.N. humanitarian official Kaag said on April 24. The few hospitals still standing struggle to operate due to severe shortages of supplies and frequent power outages. \"As summer draws near and temperatures rise, communicable diseases threaten to sweep through Gaza,\" she said.\n\nThe WHO says only 11 of Gaza's 36 hospitals are even partially functioning - five in the north and six in the south. Donors have set up six field hospitals in southern Gaza.\n\nUNRWA says that as of April 18, eight of the 24 health centres it operates in the Gaza Strip were operational.\n\nIn a snapshot of the dire situation, the WHO reported that two medical points near the largest site for displaced people in east Khan Younis were inundated with daily cases of hepatitis, skin diseases, and diarrhoea, and critically low on medical supplies when U.N. officials visited on April 9.\n\nThe WHO said an estimated 9,000 critical patients need to be evacuated from Gaza.\n\nGaza had suffered a water crisis for years before the latest conflict. It has worsened markedly since the war began.\n\nAid agencies warned in February that the majority of people had no access to clean drinking water and that sanitation services were wholly ineffective, with none of Gaza's wastewater treatment systems working.\n\nOutbreaks of diarrhoeal diseases and hepatitis A were among the indicators of dire water supplies and sanitation. They urged sufficient fuel for the operation of critical water and sanitation plants.\n\n(Compiled by Tom Perry; Editing by Peter Graff and Frances Kerry)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in",

What Does That Mean?", "body": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- The head of the United Nations World Food Program says northern Gaza has entered \"full-blown famine\" after nearly seven months of war between Israel and Hamas. But a formal, and highly sensitive, famine declaration faces the complications of politics and of confirming how many people have died.\n\nCindy McCain in an NBC interview broadcast Sunday said severe Israeli restrictions on humanitarian deliveries to the territory that has long relied on outside food assistance have pushed civilians in the most isolated, devastated part of Gaza over the brink. Famine was now moving south in Gaza, she said.\n\nA WFP spokesman later told The Associated Press that one of the three benchmarks for a formal famine declaration has already been met in northern Gaza and another is nearly met -- important details on how far the effort to document deadly hunger has progressed.\n\nIsrael faces mounting pressure from top ally the United States and others to let more aid into Gaza, notably by opening more land crossings for the most efficient delivery by truck. Aid groups say deliveries by air and sea by the United States and other countries cannot meet the needs of Gaza's 2.3 million people, a growing number of them reaching the stage of malnutrition where a child's growth is stunted and deaths occur.\n\nFamine had been projected in parts of Gaza this month in a March report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, a global initiative that includes WFP as a partner. It said nearly a third of Gaza's population was experiencing the highest level of catastrophic hunger, and that could rise to nearly half by July.\n\nThe next IPC report is expected in July. Israel strongly rejects any claims of famine in Gaza, and its humanitarian agency called McCain's assertion incorrect. A formal declaration could be used as evidence at the International Criminal Court as well as at the International Court of Justice, where Israel faces allegations of genocide in a case brought by South Africa.\n\nHere's what we know about famine and the hunger crisis in Gaza.\n\nWHAT A FAMINE MEANS\n\nAccording to the IPC, an area is considered to be in famine when three things occur: 20% of households have an extreme lack of food, or essentially starving; at least 30% of children suffer from acute malnutrition or wasting, meaning they're too thin for their height; and two adults or four children per every 10,000 people are dying daily of hunger and its complications.\n\nIn northern Gaza, the first condition of extreme lack of food has been met, senior WFP spokesman Steve Taravella told The Associated Press. The second condition of child acute malnutrition is nearly met, he said. But the death rate could not be verified.\n\nDoing so is difficult. Aid groups note that Israeli airstrikes and raids have devastated medical facilities in northern Gaza and displaced much of the population. Along with restrictions on access, they complicate the ability to formally collect data on deaths.\n\nA document explaining famine published in March by the IPC noted, however, that an area can be classified as \"famine with reasonable evidence\" if two of the three thresholds have been reached and analysts believe from available evidence that the third likely has been reached.\n\n\"The bottom line is that people are practically dying from a lack of food, water and medicines. If we are waiting for the moment when all the facts are in hand to verify the final conditions to scientifically declare a famine, it would be after thousands of people have perished,\" Taravella said.\n\nTHE CAUSES OF CATASTROPHIC HUNGER\n\nShortly after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Israel sealed its borders with Gaza and for weeks prevented aid from entering. Aid groups have said assistance since then has been restricted to a trickle far below the 500 trucks of aid that entered before the war. Since March, as Israel has pointed to progress, an average of 171 trucks per day have entered Gaza, according to the U.S.-established Famine Early Warning Systems Network.\n\nOnce inside Gaza, food and other aid doesn't always reach the most vulnerable. Aid groups say access is limited, particularly in the north, due to ongoing fighting and a chaotic security situation.\n\nNorthern Gaza, including Gaza City, was the first target of Israel's invasion and became the epicenter of the hunger crisis, with many residents reduced to eating animal feed and foraging for weeds. The IPC report in March said around 210,000 people in the north were in catastrophic levels of hunger.\n\nThe very young, the very old and those with health problems are the most affected. On Sunday, a 6-year-old from northern Gaza with cystic fibrosis was taken to the United States on a humanitarian flight after his mother made a video pleading for help. Fadi Al-Zant's jutting ribs and thin arms showed advanced malnutrition.\n\nHOW TO AVERT A FAMINE\n\nHumanitarian groups say it will be difficult to deliver life-saving aid without a cease-fire. Even with a pause in fighting, some experts say the situation in northern Gaza will have life-lasting consequences, especially for newborns and pregnant women.\n\nWhile Israel has allowed more aid in recent weeks under international pressure, a humanitarian official for the U.S. Agency for International Development told the AP that since March, northern Gaza has not received anything like the aid needed to stave off famine. USAID made the official available on condition of the official's anonymity, citing security concerns over his work in conflict.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken has welcomed Israel's recent steps to increase deliveries but stressed such moves must be sustained. That's not easy. Israel on Sunday closed its main crossing point for delivering aid after a Hamas attack killed soldiers.\n\nSome Palestinians say the increase in aid has eased things slightly, especially by lowering the cost of food.\n\nGaza City resident Said Siam said prices have dropped in recent weeks. Still, the 18-year-old said he and family members have each lost at least 10 kilograms (22 pounds) since the start of the war, mostly eating one meal of pumpkin soup each day. Fruits, vegetables and fresh meat are still scarce.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

While not a formal famine declaration, World Food Programme Executive Director Cindy McCain said - in an NBC News interview broadcast on Sunday - that based on the \"horror\" on the ground: \"There is famine, full-blown famine, in the north, and it's moving its way south.\"\n\nIsrael has continued to enhance its efforts to boost aid to Gaza, said COGAT, an Israeli Defense Ministry agency tasked with coordinating aid deliveries into Palestinian territories. \"In talks between Israeli and UN representatives, including @WFP, none of the entities indicated a risk of famine in northern Gaza,\" COGAT said in a post on X. \"Noting the improved situation, int'l orgs stated last week that the volume of goods transported to northern Gaza must be reduced since the quantities are too high in relation to the population.\"\n\nThe head of the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), Philippe Lazzarini, on Sunday accused Israel of continuing to deny the U.N. aid access in Gaza as it tries to avert famine. \"Only in the past 2 weeks, we have recorded 10 incidents involving shooting at convoys, arrests of UN staff including bullying, stripping them naked, threats with arms & long delays at checkpoints forcing convoys to move during the dark or abort,\" Lazzarini posted on X.\n\nLazzarini also called on \"Hamas and other armed groups to stop any attacks on humanitarian crossings, refrain from aid diversion and make sure assistance reaches all those in need.\" The militants claimed responsibility on Sunday for an attack that shut down the main humanitarian aid crossing into Gaza. 'ALREADY DYING'\n\nA U.N.-backed report in March said famine was imminent and likely by May in northern Gaza, and could spread across the enclave by July. Famine is assessed as at least 20% of the population suffering extreme food shortages, with one in three children acutely malnourished and two people out of every 10,000 dying daily from starvation or from malnutrition and disease. U.N. officials say that generally by the time a famine is formally declared somewhere it is too late to save many people. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said last week that the most vulnerable in northern Gaza \"are already dying of hunger and disease.\"\n\nThe U.N. has complained about a lack of humanitarian aid access throughout the seven-month-long war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas in Gaza. Guterres has said the U.N. is trying to avert \"an entirely preventable, human-made famine\" in northern Gaza. Israel is retaliating against Hamas over an Oct. 7 attack in which Israel says the militants killed about 1,200 people and took more than 250 people hostage. Gaza health authorities say Israel has killed more than 34,600 people in Gaza since then.\n\nHamas came to power in Gaza in 2006 after Israeli soldiers and settlers withdrew in 2005, but the enclave is still deemed as Israeli-occupied territory by the United Nations. As the occupying power, the U.N. human rights chief has said Israel is obligated to ensure the provision of food and medical care to the population and to facilitate the work of humanitarian organizations trying to deliver aid.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinator_of_Government_Activities_in_the_Territories", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Food Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclave_and_exclave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enclave and exclave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John McCain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UNRWA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_checkpoint", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Security checkpoint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malnutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant\u00f3nio_Guterres", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ant\u00f3nio Guterres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian fedayeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starvation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli-occupied territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_occupation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military occupation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/03_03_2020_19_04_32_3060217.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538170", "eventUri": "eng-9538170", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2772, "textEnd": 2778}], "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA).\n\nMany have sought shelter in Rafah at the Egyptian border where the threat of an Israeli assault has loomed large for months, stoking concerns of an even bigger humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe displaced have crammed into overcrowded shelters in or near UNRWA facilities such as schools, makeshift tents, and homes that have not been flattened.\n\nThe conflict has damaged or destroyed roughly 62% of all homes in Gaza, or 290,820 housing units, according to a World Bank interim damage assessment published in March.\n\nIt could take some 14 years to remove the vast amount of rubble including unexploded ordnance, according to a senior officer at the U.N. Mine Action Service.\n\nLOOMING FAMINE\n\nThe World Food Programme (WFP) says that 1.1 million people in Gaza are suffering catastrophic levels of hunger. The situation is particularly dire in the north.\n\nThere has not been a formal declaration of famine in Gaza by U.N. agencies: such a declaration hinges on a set of criteria measuring the extent of hunger suffered by a population and is assessed by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), an initiative of more than a dozen U.N. agencies, regional bodies and aid groups.\n\nHowever, WFP Executive Director Cindy McCain told NBC News there was now \"full-blown famine\" in northern Gaza.\n\nIn excerpts of an interview to be aired on May 5 on \"Meet the Press\", McCain told NBC that she hoped for a ceasefire accord so that more aid could be delivered faster.\n\n\"There is famine - full-blown famine - in the north, and it's moving its way south. And so what we're asking for and what we've continually asked for is a ceasefire and the ability to have unfettered access,\" said McCain.\n\nHer remarks followed comments by deputy WFP head Carl Skau on April 25 that more aid must be delivered to avert famine in northern Gaza, despite what he described as an uptick in deliveries and some progress in accessing that part of Gaza.\n\nThe Gaza health ministry reported on April 25 that at least 28 children, most of them no older than 12 months, had died as a result of malnutrition and dehydration since February.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO), in a report covering the period up to April 20, said 16-25% of children aged from 6-59 months have acute malnutrition in northern Gaza, while 2-4% of them had severe acute malnutrition. In southern Gaza, 3-7% of children have acute malnutrition, it said.\n\nTowards the end of April, four bakeries had reopened in northern Gaza with WFP support. UNRWA has called it a drop in the ocean.\n\nThe senior U.N. humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza Sigrid Kaag said on April 24 the scarcity of food and other essential goods had led to a breakdown in civil order, and there was no effective law enforcement.\n\nPRESSURE ON ISRAEL FOR MORE AID\n\nIsrael, which imposed a complete siege on Gaza in the early days of the war, has faced growing international pressure including from its ally the United States to let in more aid. U.S. pressure on Israel mounted further after an Israeli attack killed seven World Central Kitchen aid workers on April 1.\n\nIsrael checks all aid shipments before they enter Gaza.\n\nIn early April, Israel pledged to improve aid access, particularly to northern Gaza, including reopening the Erez crossing and allowing the use of Ashdod port. The Israeli army said on April 28 the amount of aid going into Gaza would be ramped up in the coming days.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on April 29 there had been \"measurable progress\" in the humanitarian situation. But he said it still wasn't sufficient and said he would press Israeli officials to do more.\n\nIn March, the EU foreign policy chief said Israel was provoking famine in Gaza and using starvation as a weapon of war. Israel's foreign minister rejected the accusation, saying it had let in \"extensive humanitarian aid\". Israel has also accused Hamas of stealing aid - which Hamas strongly denies - and placed blame on U.N. agencies, calling them inefficient.\n\nThe United States is building a pier off Gaza to deliver aid, though U.N. officials have said this is no substitute for land routes from Israel into Gaza. The United States and some of its allies have also air-dropped aid to Gaza. A number of Palestinians have drowned or been killed by air-dropped aid.\n\nDISEASE SPREADS AMID DECIMATED HEALTH SYSTEM\n\nHealth infrastructure in Gaza has been decimated, U.N. humanitarian official Kaag said on April 24. The few hospitals still standing struggle to operate due to severe shortages of supplies and frequent power outages. \"As summer draws near and temperatures rise, communicable diseases threaten to sweep through Gaza,\" she said.\n\nThe WHO says only 11 of Gaza's 36 hospitals are even partially functioning - five in the north and six in the south. Donors have set up six field hospitals in southern Gaza.\n\nUNRWA says that as of April 18, eight of the 24 health centres it operates in the Gaza Strip were operational.\n\nIn a snapshot of the dire situation, the WHO reported that two medical points near the largest site for displaced people in east Khan Younis were inundated with daily cases of hepatitis, skin diseases, and diarrhoea, and critically low on medical supplies when U.N. officials visited on April 9.\n\nThe WHO said an estimated 9,000 critical patients need to be evacuated from Gaza.\n\nWATER, SANITATION\n\nGaza had suffered a water crisis for years before the latest conflict. It has worsened markedly since the war began.\n\nAid agencies warned in February that the majority of people had no access to clean drinking water and that sanitation services were wholly ineffective, with none of Gaza's wastewater treatment systems working.\n\nOutbreaks of diarrhoeal diseases and hepatitis A were among the indicators of dire water supplies and sanitation. They urged sufficient fuel for the operation of critical water and sanitation plants.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), Philippe Lazzarini, on Sunday accused Israel of continuing to deny the United Nations aid access in Gaza as it tries to avert famine.\n\n\"Only in the past 2 weeks, we have recorded 10 incidents involving shooting at convoys, arrests of UN staff including bullying, stripping them naked, threats with arms & long delays at checkpoints forcing convoys to move during the dark or abort,\" Lazzarini posted on X.\n\nIsrael's government did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Lazzarini's remarks.\n\nLazzarini also called on \"Hamas and other armed groups to stop any attacks on humanitarian crossings, refrain from aid diversion and make sure assistance reaches all those in need.\" The militants claimed responsibility on Sunday for an attack that shut down the main humanitarian aid crossing into Gaza.\n\n'ALREADY DYING'\n\nA U.N.-backed report in March said famine was imminent and likely by May in northern Gaza, and could spread across the enclave by July. Famine is assessed as at least 20% of the population suffering extreme food shortages, with one in three children acutely malnourished and two people out of every 10,000 dying daily from starvation or from malnutrition and disease.\n\nU.N. officials say that generally by the time a famine is formally declared somewhere it is too late to save many people. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said last week that the most vulnerable in northern Gaza \"are already dying of hunger and disease.\"\n\nThe U.N. has complained about a lack of humanitarian aid access throughout the seven-month-long war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas in Gaza. Guterres has said the U.N. is trying to avert \"an entirely preventable, human-made famine\" in northern Gaza.\n\nIsrael is retaliating against Hamas over an Oct. 7 attack in which Israel says the militants killed about 1,200 people and took more than 250 people hostage. Gaza health authorities say Israel has killed more than 34,600 people in Gaza since then.\n\nHamas came to power in Gaza in 2006 after Israeli soldiers and settlers withdrew in 2005, but the enclave is still deemed as Israeli-occupied territory by the United Nations.\n\nAs the occupying power, the U.N. human rights chief has said Israel is obligated to ensure the provision of food and medical care to the population and to facilitate the work of humanitarian organizations trying to deliver aid.\n\n(Reporting by Michelle Nichols, Additional reporting by Maytaal Angel and Hatem Maher;

But she said her assessment was \"based on what we have seen and what we have experienced on the ground.\"\n\nThe hunger crisis is most severe in the strip's northern section, a largely lawless and gang-ridden area where the Israeli military exercises little or no control. In recent weeks, after Israel faced mounting global pressure to improve dire conditions there, more aid has flowed into the devastated area.\n\nOn the diplomatic front, negotiations resumed in Cairo on Saturday aimed at reaching a cease-fire and an agreement to release Israeli and Palestinian hostages. A delegation of Hamas leaders traveled to the Egyptian capital, the Palestinian armed group said.\n\nOver the past few days, Israel and mediators in the talks - Egypt, Qatar and the United States - have awaited Hamas' response to the latest cease-fire proposal, with Hamas signaling that it was open to discussing the Israeli-approved offer. On Friday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said U.S. officials were waiting to see if Hamas \"can take 'yes' for an answer on the cease-fire and the release of hostages.\"\n\n\"The only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a cease-fire is Hamas,\" Blinken said at the McCain Institute in Arizona. \"So we look to see what they will do.\"\n\nHusam Badran, a senior Hamas official, said in a text message that the group's representatives came to Cairo \"with great positivity\" toward the proposed deal. \"If there is no agreement, it will be because of Netanyahu alone,\" he said, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nFor weeks, Netanyahu has vowed that Israeli forces will invade Rafah, where many of Hamas' remaining military forces are believed to be arrayed alongside some of its leaders. The plan has prompted widespread criticism, including from the Biden administration, fueled by concern for the safety of more than 1 million displaced Palestinians from Gaza sheltering there.\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nAs of Saturday, Israel had not dispatched a delegation to Cairo to engage in indirect negotiations with Hamas officials, as Israeli officials had done in previous rounds of talks, according to two Israeli officials who, following diplomatic protocol, spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nEven if Hamas announced in Cairo that it had accepted the proposed deal, a truce was unlikely to be imminent, one of the Israeli officials said. Hamas' approval would be followed by intensive negotiations to hash out the finer details of a cease-fire, and such talks are likely to be protracted and difficult, the official added.\n\nMcCain said a cease-fire could help ease conditions in Gaza.\n\n\"It is horror,\" she said on \"Meet the Press.\" \"It is so hard to look at, and it is so hard to hear, also. I am so hoping we can get a cease-fire and begin to feed these people, especially in the north, in a much faster fashion.\"\n\nThe first U.S. official to say there was famine in Gaza during the conflict was Samantha Power, director of the U.S. Agency for International Development, who made her remarks in congressional testimony last month.\n\nMcCain, the widow of Sen. John McCain, was appointed by President Joe Biden as U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Agencies for Food and Agriculture in 2021 and became head of the World Food Program, a U.N. agency, last year.\n\nAn official declaration of famine is made by a U.N. agency, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, and the government of the country where the famine is taking place. It is unclear what local authority might have the power to do that in Gaza. Declarations, which are based on measured rates of hunger, malnutrition and death over short periods, are rare. But for aid groups, a famine elevates one crisis above competing disasters and helps them raise money to respond.\n\nGaza has been gripped by what experts have called a severe human-made hunger crisis. Israel's bombardment and restrictions in the territory have made delivering aid difficult. The amount of aid entering Gaza has increased recently, but aid groups say it is far from adequate.\n\nFor the first three weeks of the war, Israel maintained what it called a \"complete siege\" of Gaza, with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant saying that \"no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel\" would be allowed into the territory. The Israeli military also destroyed Gaza's port, restricted fishing and bombed many of its farms.\n\nIsrael eventually loosened the siege but instituted a meticulous inspection process that it says is necessary to ensure that weapons and other supplies do not fall into the hands of Hamas. Aid groups and foreign diplomats have said the inspections create bottlenecks, and have accused Israel of arbitrarily turning away aid, including water filters, solar lights and medical kits that contain scissors, for spurious reasons.\n\nVolker T\u00fcrk, the U.N. human rights chief, said in a statement last month that Israel's policies regarding aid in Gaza could amount to a war crime.\n\nUsing starvation of civilians as a weapon is a serious violation of international humanitarian law and a war crime under the Rome Statute, the treaty of the International Criminal Court, or ICC.\n\nIsraeli and foreign officials told The New York Times last week that they were worried that the ICC was preparing to issue arrest warrants against senior Israeli officials - including potentially over accusations that they prevented the delivery of aid to civilians in Gaza. (They also said they believed that the court was considering arrest warrants for Hamas leaders, which could be issued concurrently.)\n\nIsrael has vehemently denied placing limits on aid, accusing the United Nations of failing to distribute aid adequately and Hamas of looting supplies. U.S. and U.N. officials have said there is no evidence of that, other than one shipment that Hamas seized this past week, which is now being recovered.\n\nHowever the issue is resolved, there is little doubt that conditions are still life threatening for many in Gaza, particularly children suffering from illnesses that make them especially vulnerable. As of April 17, at least 28 children younger than 12 had died of malnutrition or related causes in Gaza hospitals, according to local health authorities, including a dozen babies under 1 month old. Officials believe that many more deaths outside hospitals have gone unrecorded.\n\n(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n\nThere have been some improvements to aid flows in recent weeks, and on Wednesday, Israel reopened the Erez border crossing, allowing some aid to cross directly into northern Gaza.\n\nFatma Edaama, a 36-year-old resident of Jabalia, in northern Gaza, said conditions in her neighborhood were still difficult. Many commodities, such as meat, are unavailable or sold at sky-high prices, she said.\n\nBut flour, canned goods and other items had started to flow far more freely and their cost had dropped sharply, Edaama said. \"Earlier there was nothing, people would grind up animal feed,\" she said. \"Now, we have food.\"\n\nStill, foreign officials and aid agencies say more is needed.", "source": {"uri":

And it brought into sharp focus the scale of the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding.\n\n\"Whenever you have conflicts like this, and emotions rage high, and things happen in a war, famine happens,\" the WFP's Cindy McCain told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" in a clip released ahead of the interview airing on Sunday.\n\n\"What I can explain to you is - is that there is famine - full-blown famine - in the north, and it's moving its way south.\" While McCain's remarks do not constitute an official declaration of famine, she said they were based on what WFP staff have seen on the ground.\n\n\"It's horror,\" she said of the situation in Gaza. \"It's so hard to look at and it's so hard to hear.\"\n\nMcCain said the WFP is asking for a ceasefire and \"unfettered access\" to Gaza as delivering aid to the territory has been extremely difficult.\n\nIsrael has faced increasing pressure in recent weeks to allow aid into Gaza after its military strikes killed seven staffers of World Central Kitchen, a US-based charity.\n\nHuman rights agencies have long warned of a spiraling humanitarian crisis in Gaza under Israel's military assault, launched in response to the Hamas-led October 7 attacks. More than 34,600 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza as of May 1, according to the Gaza health ministry.\n\nOver the course of the war, more than 1.9 million Palestinians have been forcibly displaced, according to the UN, with many sheltering in cramped tent camps that cannot offer enough access to sanitation or food. The entire population of more than 2.2 million people is now at risk of famine, and at least 30 children have already died of malnutrition and dehydration in Gaza, according to the health ministry.\n\nConcerns are also heightened over an anticipated Israeli military operation in southern Gaza's Rafah, prompting renewed calls for a ceasefire.\n\nUS officials currently assess that a limited number of tents are currently being constructed in southern Gaza for the purpose of temporarily sheltering civilians who would be moved out of Rafah in the case of an incursion by the Israel Defense Forces, according to a senior administration official on Friday.\n\nHowever, the official stressed that the tents that are being built are nowhere near the amount that would be needed to house the more than 1 million people who would seek shelter.\n\n\"[There is] no sign that they are imminently able to, willing or ready to go into Rafah,\" the official said of Israeli forces. \"Certainly they're not prepared for the care and the feeding and the sustenance of a million and a half people.\"\n\nThe Israeli government briefed humanitarian aid organizations in recent days about its plans for evacuating civilians from Rafah, according to a source familiar with the matter. The government warned that a Rafah operation was coming but did not provide any sort of timeline and didn't suggest it was imminent.\n\nUS and Israeli officials have said any potential agreement on a framework that would bring both a temporary ceasefire and a release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza would likely be followed by continued negotiations over the finer details.\n\nA final deal between Israel and Hamas is expected to take several more days to negotiate in the Egyptian capital.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Food Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John McCain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet_the_Press", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meet the Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_displacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forced displacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dehydration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malnutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/d1f6d7cd6b6ba9703da50dc5a461a05b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538170", "eventUri": "eng-9538170", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1569, "textEnd": 1578}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 1668, "textEnd": 1673}], "sentiment": -0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

But she said her assessment was \"based on what we have seen and what we have experienced on the ground.\"\n\nThe hunger crisis is most severe in the strip's northern section, a largely lawless and gang-ridden area where the Israeli military exercises little or no control. In recent weeks, after Israel faced mounting global pressure to improve dire conditions there, more aid has flowed into devastated the area.\n\nOn the diplomatic front, negotiations resumed in Cairo on Saturday aimed at reaching a cease-fire and an agreement to release Israeli and Palestinian hostages. A delegation of Hamas leaders traveled to the Egyptian capital, the Palestinian armed group said.\n\nOver the past few days, Israel and mediators in the talks -- Egypt, Qatar and the United States -- have awaited Hamas' response to the latest cease-fire proposal, with Hamas signaling that it was open to discussing the Israeli-approved offer. On Friday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said U.S. officials were waiting to see if Hamas \"can take 'yes' for an answer on the cease-fire and the release of hostages.\"\n\n\"The only thing standing between the people of Gaza and a cease-fire is Hamas,\" Blinken said at the McCain Institute in Arizona. \"So we look to see what they will do.\"\n\nHusam Badran, a senior Hamas official, said in a text message that the group's representatives came to Cairo \"with great positivity\" toward the proposed deal. \"If there is no agreement, it will be because of Netanyahu alone,\" he said, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nFor weeks, Netanyahu has vowed that Israeli forces will invade Rafah, where many of Hamas' remaining military forces are believed to be arrayed alongside some of its leaders. The plan has prompted widespread criticism, including from the Biden administration, fueled by concern for the safety of more than 1 million displaced Palestinians from Gaza sheltering there.\n\nAs of Saturday, Israel had not dispatched a delegation to Cairo to engage in indirect negotiations with Hamas officials, as Israeli officials had done in previous rounds of talks, according to two Israeli officials who, following diplomatic protocol, spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nEven if Hamas announced in Cairo that it had accepted the proposed deal, a truce was unlikely to be imminent, one of the Israeli officials said. Hamas' approval would be followed by intensive negotiations to hash out the finer details of a cease-fire, and such talks are likely to be protracted and difficult, the official added.\n\nMcCain said a cease-fire could help ease conditions in Gaza.\n\n\"It is horror,\" she said on \"Meet the Press.\" \"It is so hard to look at, and it is so hard to hear, also. I am so hoping we can get a cease-fire and begin to feed these people, especially in the north, in a much faster fashion.\"\n\nThe first U.S. official to say there was famine in Gaza during the conflict was Samantha Power, director of the U.S. Agency for International Development, who made her remarks in congressional testimony last month.\n\nMcCain, the widow of Sen. John McCain, was appointed by President Joe Biden as U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Agencies for Food and Agriculture in 2021 and became head of the World Food Program, a U.N. agency, last year.\n\nAn official declaration of famine is made by a U.N. agency, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, and the government of the country where the famine is taking place. It is unclear what local authority might have the power to do that in Gaza. Declarations, which are based on measured rates of hunger, malnutrition and death over short periods, are rare. But for aid groups, a famine elevates one crisis above competing disasters and helps them raise money to respond.\n\nGaza has been gripped by what experts have called a severe human-made hunger crisis. Israel's bombardment and restrictions in the territory have made delivering aid difficult. The amount of aid entering Gaza has increased recently, but aid groups say it is far from adequate.\n\nFor the first three weeks of the war, Israel maintained what it called a \"complete siege\" of Gaza, with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant saying that \"no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel\" would be allowed into the territory. The Israeli military also destroyed Gaza's port, restricted fishing and bombed many of its farms.\n\nIsrael eventually loosened the siege but instituted a meticulous inspection process that it says is necessary to ensure that weapons and other supplies do not fall into the hands of Hamas. Aid groups and foreign diplomats have said the inspections create bottlenecks, and have accused Israel of arbitrarily turning away aid, including water filters, solar lights and medical kits that contain scissors, for spurious reasons.\n\nVolker T\u00fcrk, the U.N. human rights chief, said in a statement last month that Israel's policies regarding aid in Gaza could amount to a war crime.\n\nUsing starvation of civilians as a weapon is a serious violation of international humanitarian law and a war crime under the Rome Statute, the treaty of the International Criminal Court, or ICC.\n\nIsraeli and foreign officials told The New York Times last week that they were worried that the ICC was preparing to issue arrest warrants against senior Israeli officials -- including potentially over accusations that they prevented the delivery of aid to civilians in Gaza. (They also said they believed that the court was considering arrest warrants for Hamas leaders, which could be issued concurrently.)\n\nIsrael has vehemently denied placing limits on aid, accusing the United Nations of failing to distribute aid adequately and Hamas of looting supplies. U.S. and U.N. officials have said there is no evidence of that, other than one shipment that Hamas seized this past week, which is now being recovered.\n\nHowever the issue is resolved, there is little doubt that conditions are still life threatening for many in Gaza, particularly children suffering from illnesses that make them especially vulnerable. As of April 17, at least 28 children younger than 12 had died of malnutrition or related causes in Gaza hospitals, according to local health authorities, including a dozen babies under 1 month old. Officials believe that many more deaths outside hospitals have gone unrecorded.\n\nThere have been some improvements to aid flows in recent weeks, and on Wednesday, Israel reopened the Erez border crossing, allowing some aid to cross directly into northern Gaza.\n\nFatma Edaama, a 36-year-old resident of Jabalia, in northern Gaza, said conditions in her neighborhood were still difficult. Many commodities, such as meat, are unavailable or sold at sky-high prices, she said.\n\nBut flour, canned goods and other items had started to flow far more freely and their cost had dropped sharply, Edaama said. \"Earlier there was nothing, people would grind up animal feed,\" she said. \"Now, we have food.\"\n\nStill, foreign officials and aid agencies say more is needed.\n\n\"This is real and important progress, but more still needs to be done,\" Blinken told reporters this past week after visiting an aid warehouse in Jordan.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news",

No other US official has made that assessment.\n\nMcCain said that while there has not yet been an official declaration of famine, based on what her organization has seen and experienced on the ground, she believes there is a \"full-blown\" issue in Gaza.\n\n\"It's horror. It's You know, it's so hard to look at and it's so hard to hear, also,\" McCain said in her interview.\n\nShe went on to say that she is hopeful for a ceasefire in Gaza so that people can begin to be fed \"in a much faster fashion\".\n\nMcCain added that the people in Gaza need \"water, sanitation, medicine it's all part of the famine the famine issue.\"\n\nEfforts to provide food aid to Gaza have been met both by Israeli resistance and ceaseless air strikes.\n\nWorld Central Kitchen, a US-based nonprofit group that has distributed over 43 million meals across Gaza, just resumed operations Monday after seven of its aid workers were killed by an Israeli airstrike on April 1.\n\nEarlier this week, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged the international community to \"do everything possible to avert an entirely preventable human-made famine\".\n\nLack of security is a major obstacle to distributing aid across Gaza, and he stressed that humanitarian convoys, facilities and personnel as well as people in need \"must not be targets\".\n\n\"We welcome aid delivery by air and sea, but there is no alternative to the massive use of land routes,\" he said, before again calling on Israel to allow and facilitate safe, rapid and unimpeded humanitarian access throughout Gaza, including for the UN's Palestine relief agency, UNRWA.\n\nGuterres also addressed how Israeli attacks have \"decimated\" the health system in the enclave, where two thirds of hospitals and health centers are out of commission, while many of those remaining are seriously damaged.\n\n\"Some hospitals now resemble cemeteries,\" he said, voicing deep alarm over reports of the discovery of mass graves at several locations, including at Al-Shifa and Nasser hospitals.\n\nMore than 390 bodies reportedly have been exhumed at Nasser Hospital alone, and \"there are competing narratives around several of these mass graves, including serious allegations that some of those buried were \"unlawfully killed\", he added.\n\nThe UN chief said it is imperative that independent international forensic investigators are allowed immediate access to these sites to determine the precise circumstances under which hundreds of Palestinians lost their lives and were buried or reburied.\n\n\"The families of the dead and missing have a right to know what happened, and the world has a right to accountability for any violations of international law that may have taken place,\" he said.\n\nThe secretary-general ended his remarks by drawing attention to UNRWA and its \"irreplaceable and indispensable work\" supporting millions of Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.\n\n\"UNRWA's presence across the region is a source of hope and stability. Its education, healthcare and other services provide a sense of normality, safety and stability to desperate communities,\" he said.\n\nThe agency recently appealed for $1.2 billion to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and to respond to needs in the West Bank, where violence is rising.\n\nUNRWA largely depends on donors and some 16 countries halted their contributions earlier this year following Israeli allegations that 12 staff were involved in the October 7 attacks. The UN appointed an independent body to review the agency's efforts to ensure the humanitarian principle of neutrality.\n\nThe panel, headed by former French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna, recently published its report which found that \"the set of rules and the mechanisms and procedures in place (at UNRWA) are the most elaborate within the UN system\".\n\nGuterres said an action plan is being put in place to implement the report's recommendations, and he appealed for cooperation from donors, host countries and staff.\n\nMeanwhile, most countries that suspended contributions to UNRWA have resumed them, and the Secretary-General said \"we are optimistic that others will join\". Additionally, some UN Member States have given to the agency for the first time, while private donors have also provided support.\n\nHowever, as a funding gap persists, he urged Member States and donors to pledge generously to ensure the agency's work continues.\n\n\"This is the moment to reaffirm our hope for and contributions to a two-State solution - the only sustainable path to peace and security for Israelis, Palestinians and the wider region,\" he concluded./Fars news", "source": {"uri": "avapress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u062e\u0628\u0631\u06af\u0632\u0627\u0631\u06cc

What does that mean?", "body": "TEL AVIV - The head of the United Nations World Food Program says northern Gaza has entered \"full-blown famine\" after nearly seven months of war between Israel and Hamas. But a formal, and highly sensitive, famine declaration faces the complications of politics and of confirming how many people have died.\n\nCindy McCain in an NBC interview broadcast Sunday said severe Israeli restrictions on humanitarian deliveries to the territory that has long relied on outside food assistance have pushed civilians in the most isolated, devastated part of Gaza over the brink. Famine was now moving south in Gaza, she said.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nA WFP spokesman later told The Associated Press that one of the three benchmarks for a formal famine declaration has already been met in northern Gaza and another is nearly met -- important details on how far the effort to document deadly hunger has progressed.\n\nIsrael faces mounting pressure from top ally the United States and others to let more aid into Gaza, notably by opening more land crossings for the most efficient delivery by truck. Aid groups say deliveries by air and sea by the United States and other countries cannot meet the needs of Gaza's 2.3 million people, a growing number of them reaching the stage of malnutrition where a child's growth is stunted and deaths occur.\n\nFamine had been projected in parts of Gaza this month in a March report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, a global initiative that includes WFP as a partner. It said nearly a third of Gaza's population was experiencing the highest level of catastrophic hunger, and that could rise to nearly half by July.\n\nThe next IPC report is expected in July. Israel strongly rejects any claims of famine in Gaza, and its humanitarian agency called McCain's assertion incorrect. A formal declaration could be used as evidence at the International Criminal Court as well as at the International Court of Justice, where Israel faces allegations of genocide in a case brought by South Africa.\n\nHere's what we know about famine and the hunger crisis in Gaza.\n\nWHAT A FAMINE MEANS\n\nAccording to the IPC, an area is considered to be in famine when three things occur: 20% of households have an extreme lack of food, or essentially starving; at least 30% of children suffer from acute malnutrition or wasting, meaning they're too thin for their height; and two adults or four children per every 10,000 people are dying daily of hunger and its complications.\n\nIn northern Gaza, the first condition of extreme lack of food has been met, senior WFP spokesman Steve Taravella told The Associated Press. The second condition of child acute malnutrition is nearly met, he said. But the death rate could not be verified.\n\nDoing so is difficult. Aid groups note that Israeli airstrikes and raids have devastated medical facilities in northern Gaza and displaced much of the population. Along with restrictions on access, they complicate the ability to formally collect data on deaths.\n\nA document explaining famine published in March by the IPC noted, however, that an area can be classified as \"famine with reasonable evidence\" if two of the three thresholds have been reached and analysts believe from available evidence that the third likely has been reached.\n\n\"The bottom line is that people are practically dying from a lack of food, water and medicines. If we are waiting for the moment when all the facts are in hand to verify the final conditions to scientifically declare a famine, it would be after thousands of people have perished,\" Taravella said.\n\nTHE CAUSES OF CATASTROPHIC HUNGER\n\nShortly after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Israel sealed its borders with Gaza and for weeks prevented aid from entering. Aid groups have said assistance since then has been restricted to a trickle far below the 500 trucks of aid that entered before the war. Since March, as Israel has pointed to progress, an average of 171 trucks per day have entered Gaza, according to the U.S.-established Famine Early Warning Systems Network.\n\nOnce inside Gaza, food and other aid doesn't always reach the most vulnerable. Aid groups say access is limited, particularly in the north, due to ongoing fighting and a chaotic security situation.\n\nNorthern Gaza, including Gaza City, was the first target of Israel's invasion and became the epicenter of the hunger crisis, with many residents reduced to eating animal feed and foraging for weeds. The IPC report in March said around 210,000 people in the north were in catastrophic levels of hunger.\n\nThe very young, the very old and those with health problems are the most affected. On Sunday, a 6-year-old from northern Gaza with cystic fibrosis was taken to the United States on a humanitarian flight after his mother made a video pleading for help. Fadi Al-Zant's jutting ribs and thin arms showed advanced malnutrition.\n\nHOW TO AVERT A FAMINE\n\nHumanitarian groups say it will be difficult to deliver life-saving aid without a cease-fire. Even with a pause in fighting, some experts say the situation in northern Gaza will have life-lasting consequences, especially for newborns and pregnant women.\n\nWhile Israel has allowed more aid in recent weeks under international pressure, a humanitarian official for the U.S. Agency for International Development told the AP that since March, northern Gaza has not received anything like the aid needed to stave off famine. USAID made the official available on condition of the official's anonymity, citing security concerns over his work in conflict.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken has welcomed Israel's recent steps to increase deliveries but stressed such moves must be sustained. That's not easy. Israel on Sunday closed its main crossing point for delivering aid after a Hamas attack killed soldiers.\n\nVOICES FROM GAZA\n\nSome Palestinians say the increase in aid has eased things slightly, especially by lowering the cost of food.\n\nGaza City resident Said Siam said prices have dropped in recent weeks. Still, the 18-year-old said he and family members have each lost at least 10 kilograms (22 pounds) since the start of the war, mostly eating one meal of pumpkin soup each day. Fruits, vegetables and fresh meat are still scarce.\n\n___\n\nKnickmeyer reported from Washington.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war", "source":

Mine Action Service. LOOMING FAMINE The World Food Programme (WFP) says that 1.1 million people in Gaza are suffering catastrophic levels of hunger.\n\nThe Gaza Strip is suffering an unfolding humanitarian catastrophe nearly seven months since Israel launched a devastating offensive in response to the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks that killed 1,200 people in Israel.\n\nMore than 34,600 people have been killed in the Israeli offensive which has laid to waste much of the Gaza Strip, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, with thousands more dead feared lost under the rubble. Here are some details of the humanitarian situation:\n\nDISPLACEMENT, SHELTER An estimated 1.7 million people, more than 75% of Gaza's population, have been displaced, many of them forced to move repeatedly, according to the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA).\n\nMany have sought shelter in Rafah at the Egyptian border where the threat of an Israeli assault has loomed large for months, stoking concerns of an even bigger humanitarian crisis. The displaced have crammed into overcrowded shelters in or near UNRWA facilities such as schools, makeshift tents, and homes that have not been flattened.\n\nThe conflict has damaged or destroyed roughly 62% of all homes in Gaza, or 290,820 housing units, according to a World Bank interim damage assessment published in March. It could take some 14 years to remove the vast amount of rubble including unexploded ordnance, according to a senior officer at the U.N. Mine Action Service.\n\nLOOMING FAMINE The World Food Programme (WFP) says that 1.1 million people in Gaza are suffering catastrophic levels of hunger. The situation is particularly dire in the north.\n\nThere has not been a formal declaration of famine in Gaza by U.N. agencies: such a declaration hinges on a set of criteria measuring the extent of hunger suffered by a population and is assessed by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), an initiative of more than a dozen U.N. agencies, regional bodies and aid groups. However, WFP Executive Director\n\nCindy McCain told NBC News there was now \"full-blown famine\" in northern Gaza.\n\nIn excerpts of an interview to be aired on May 5 on \"Meet the Press\", McCain told NBC that she hoped for a ceasefire accord so that more aid could be delivered faster. \"There is famine - full-blown famine - in the north, and it's moving its way south. And so what we're asking for and what we've continually asked for is a ceasefire and the ability to have unfettered access,\" said McCain.\n\nHer remarks followed comments by deputy WFP head Carl Skau on April 25 that more aid must be delivered to avert famine in northern Gaza, despite what he described as an uptick in deliveries and some progress in accessing that part of Gaza. The Gaza health ministry reported on April 25 that at least 28 children, most of them no older than 12 months, had died as a result of malnutrition and dehydration since February.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO), in a report covering the period up to April 20, said 16-25% of children aged from 6-59 months have acute malnutrition in northern Gaza, while 2-4% of them had severe acute malnutrition. In southern Gaza, 3-7% of children have acute malnutrition, it said. Towards the end of April, four bakeries had reopened in northern Gaza with WFP support. UNRWA has called it a drop in the ocean.\n\nThe senior U.N. humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza Sigrid Kaag said on April 24 the scarcity of food and other essential goods had led to a breakdown in civil order, and there was no effective law enforcement. PRESSURE ON ISRAEL FOR MORE AID\n\nIsrael, which imposed a complete siege on Gaza in the early days of the war, has faced growing international pressure including from its ally the United States to let in more aid. U.S. pressure on Israel mounted further after an Israeli attack killed seven World Central Kitchen aid workers on April 1. Israel checks all aid shipments before they enter Gaza.\n\nIn early April, Israel pledged to improve aid access, particularly to northern Gaza, including reopening the Erez crossing and allowing the use of Ashdod port. The Israeli army said on April 28 the amount of aid going into Gaza would be ramped up in the coming days. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on April 29 there had been \"measurable progress\" in the humanitarian situation. But he said it still wasn't sufficient and said he would press Israeli officials to do more.\n\nIn March, the EU foreign policy chief said Israel was provoking famine in Gaza and using starvation as a weapon of war. Israel's foreign minister rejected the accusation, saying it had let in \"extensive humanitarian aid\". Israel has also accused Hamas of stealing aid - which Hamas strongly denies - and placed blame on U.N. agencies, calling them inefficient. The United States is building a pier off Gaza to deliver aid, though U.N. officials have said this is no substitute for land routes from Israel into Gaza. The United States and some of its allies have also air-dropped aid to Gaza. A number of Palestinians have drowned or been killed by air-dropped aid.\n\nDISEASE SPREADS AMID DECIMATED HEALTH SYSTEM Health infrastructure in Gaza has been decimated, U.N. humanitarian official Kaag said on April 24. The few hospitals still standing struggle to operate due to severe shortages of supplies and frequent power outages. \"As summer draws near and temperatures rise, communicable diseases threaten to sweep through Gaza,\" she said.\n\nThe WHO says only 11 of Gaza's 36 hospitals are even partially functioning - five in the north and six in the south. Donors have set up six field hospitals in southern Gaza. UNRWA says that as of April 18, eight of the 24 health centres it operates in the Gaza Strip were operational.\n\nIn a snapshot of the dire situation, the WHO reported that two medical points near the largest site for displaced people in east Khan Younis were inundated with daily cases of hepatitis, skin diseases, and diarrhoea, and critically low on medical supplies when U.N. officials visited on April 9. The WHO said an estimated 9,000 critical patients need to be evacuated from Gaza.\n\nWATER, SANITATION Gaza had suffered a water crisis for years before the latest conflict. It has worsened markedly since the war began.\n\nAid agencies warned in February that the majority of people had no access to clean drinking water and that sanitation services were wholly ineffective, with none of Gaza's wastewater treatment systems working. Outbreaks of diarrhoeal diseases and hepatitis A were among the indicators of dire water supplies and sanitation. They urged sufficient fuel for the operation of critical water and sanitation plants.

Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), Philippe Lazzarini, on Sunday accused Israel of continuing to deny the United Nations aid access in Gaza as it tries to avert famine.\n\n\"Only in the past 2 weeks, we have recorded 10 incidents involving shooting at convoys, arrests of UN staff including bullying, stripping them naked, threats with arms & long delays at checkpoints forcing convoys to move during the dark or abort,\" Lazzarini posted on X.\n\nIsrael's government did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Lazzarini's remarks.\n\nLazzarini also called on \"Hamas and other armed groups to stop any attacks on humanitarian crossings, refrain from aid diversion and make sure assistance reaches all those in need.\" The militants claimed responsibility on Sunday for an attack that shut down the main humanitarian aid crossing into Gaza.\n\nA U.N.-backed report in March said famine was imminent and likely by May in northern Gaza, and could spread across the enclave by July. Famine is assessed as at least 20% of the population suffering extreme food shortages, with one in three children acutely malnourished and two people out of every 10,000 dying daily from starvation or from malnutrition and disease.\n\nU.N. officials say that generally by the time a famine is formally declared somewhere it is too late to save many people. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said last week that the most vulnerable in northern Gaza \"are already dying of hunger and disease.\"\n\nThe U.N. has complained about a lack of humanitarian aid access throughout the seven-month-long war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas in Gaza. Guterres has said the U.N. is trying to avert \"an entirely preventable, human-made famine\" in northern Gaza.\n\nIsrael is retaliating against Hamas over an Oct. 7 attack in which Israel says the militants killed about 1,200 people and took more than 250 people hostage. Gaza health authorities say Israel has killed more than 34,600 people in Gaza since then.\n\nHamas came to power in Gaza in 2006 after Israeli soldiers and settlers withdrew in 2005, but the enclave is still deemed as Israeli-occupied territory by the United Nations.\n\nAs the occupying power, the U.N. human rights chief has said Israel is obligated to ensure the provision of food and medical care to the population and to facilitate the work of humanitarian organizations trying to deliver aid.\n\n(Reporting by Michelle Nichols, Additional reporting by Maytaal Angel and Hatem Maher; Editing by Andrea Ricci)", "source": {"uri": "dailymaverick.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Maverick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@dailymaverick.co.za", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Lazzarini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philippe Lazzarini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UNRWA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Food Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John McCain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_checkpoint", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Security checkpoint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant\u00f3nio_Guterres", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ant\u00f3nio Guterres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclave_and_exclave", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Enclave and exclave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starvation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malnutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian fedayeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli-occupied territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_occupation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military occupation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/h_55868814.jpg?w=1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538170", "eventUri": "eng-9538170", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2176, "textEnd": 2182}], "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

More than 34,600 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza as of May 1, according to the Gaza health ministry.\n\nOver the course of the war, more than 1.9 million Palestinians have been forcibly displaced, according to the UN, with many sheltering in cramped tent camps that cannot offer enough access to sanitation or food. The entire population of more than 2.2 million people is now at risk of famine, and at least 30 children have already died of malnutrition and dehydration in Gaza, according to the health ministry.\n\nConcerns are also heightened over an anticipated Israeli military operation in southern Gaza's Rafah, prompting renewed calls for a ceasefire.\n\nAs negotiations continued in Cairo, Hamas political bureau leader Ismail Haniyeh issued a statement Sunday saying that \"the Hamas movement is still keen to reach a comprehensive, interconnected agreement that ends the aggression, guarantees withdrawal [of the Israeli military from Gaza], and achieves a serious prisoner exchange deal.\"\n\nHaniyeh said that the delegation carried \"positive and flexible positions\" aimed at stopping \"the aggression against our people, which is a fundamental and logical position that lays the foundation for a more stable future.\" A Hamas delegation arrived in Egypt on Saturday for discussions on a possible ceasefire and hostage deal.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a video statement accusing Hamas of making unacceptable demands in the negotiations.\n\nHe said Israel had \"demonstrated a willingness to go a long way\" but \"Hamas remained entrenched in its extreme positions, chief among them the demand to withdraw all our forces from the Strip, end the war, and leave Hamas intact.\"\n\n\"The State of Israel cannot accept this,\" Netanyahu continued. \"Israel will not agree to Hamas's demands, which mean surrender, and will continue the fighting until all its goals are achieved.\"\n\nUS officials currently assess that a limited number of tents are currently being constructed in southern Gaza for the purpose of temporarily sheltering civilians who would be moved out of Rafah in the case of an incursion by the Israel Defense Forces, according to a senior administration official on Friday.\n\nHowever, the official stressed that the tents that are being built are nowhere near the amount that would be needed to house the more than 1 million people who would seek shelter.\n\n\"[There is] no sign that they are imminently able to, willing or ready to go into Rafah,\" the official said of Israeli forces. \"Certainly they're not prepared for the care and the feeding and the sustenance of a million and a half people.\"\n\nThe Israeli government briefed humanitarian aid organizations in recent days about its plans for evacuating civilians from Rafah, according to a source familiar with the matter. The government warned that a Rafah operation was coming but did not provide any sort of timeline and didn't suggest it was imminent.\n\nUS and Israeli officials have said any potential agreement on a framework that would bring both a temporary ceasefire and a release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza would likely be followed by continued negotiations over the finer details.\n\nA final deal between Israel and Hamas is expected to take several more days to negotiate in the Egyptian capital.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

children under five have surged from 1% before the war to 30% five months later, the USAID added, calling it the fastest such climb in hunger in recent history, more than in grave conflicts and food shortages in Somalia or South Sudan.\n\nIn an interview with CNN last month, McCain said children are starving to death in the besieged Palestinian territory as the Tel Aviv regime has been using food as a weapon of war and deliberately blocking aid deliveries to Gaza over the past months.\n\nShe warned that Gaza is \"literally on the brink of going over the edge, over the cliff with famine and not being able to recover from it.\"\n\nIsrael unleased its brutal US-backed war on the Gaza Strip on October 7 after the Palestinian resistance groups carried out a historic operation against the usurping entity in retaliation for the regime's intensified atrocities against the Palestinian people.\n\nRead More:\n\nThe Tel Aviv regime has so far killed at least 34,596 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injured 77,816 others.\n\nThe Israeli aggression has left 85 percent of Gaza's population internally displaced amid acute shortages of food, clean water and medicine, while 60 percent of the territory's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed, according to the United Nations.", "source": {"uri": "iqna.ir", "dataType": "news", "title": "iqna.ir |

Dozens of Palestinians -- the vast majority of them children and infants -- have already died of malnutrition and dehydration in northern Gaza.\n\nAccording to Palestinian and international officials, Israel's 211-day assault on Gaza -- which many experts including Israelis call genocidal -- has killed or maimed more than 123,000 Palestinians since the Hamas-led October 7 attacks, including an estimated 11,000 people who are believed to be dead and buried beneath the ruins of the hundreds of thousands of destroyed or damaged homes and other buildings.\n\nIn addition to not allowing adequate humanitarian aid into Gaza, Israeli forces have also repeatedly attacked both aid workers and desperate civilians trying to access the lifesaving provisions.\n\n\"What we are asking for and what we continually ask for is a cease-fire and the ability to have unfettered access, to get in safe through the various ports and gate crossings,\" McCain said during the interview.\n\nOn Saturday, Hamas spokesperson Osman Hamdan said there have been \"some forward steps\" toward a cease-fire agreement during negotiations in Egypt. Egyptian mediators proposed a six-week cessation of hostilities, the release of an unspecified number of Israeli and international hostages, and a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.\n\nHowever, one Israeli official told ABC News on condition of anonymity Saturday that \"Israel will under no circumstances agree to the end of the war as part of an agreement to release our abductees.\"\n\nThe negotiations come as Israeli forces prepare for an expected ground invasion of Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city, where more than a million refugees forcibly displaced from other parts of the strip are sheltering alongside around 280,000 local residents. On Friday, the U.N.'s humanitarian agency warned that an Israeli ground invasion of Rafah would put hundreds of thousands of Palestinians \"at imminent risk of death.\"", "source": {"uri": "truthout.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Truthout"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brett_wilkins@truthout.org", "name": "Brett Wilkins", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malnutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John McCain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dehydration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristen_Welker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kristen Welker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet_the_Press", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meet the Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Food Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starvation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_displacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forced displacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2150689784-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538170", "eventUri": "eng-9538170", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1383, "textEnd": 1392}], "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The network is funded by the Qatari government, which has been a key mediator in cease-fire talks. Like many media outlets around the world, however, Al Jazeera has been critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza.\n\n\"The Israeli PM and his military... wanted everything to happen and be concealed without anybody reporting or talking about it,\" said Al Jazeera reporter Hani Mahmoud.\n\nParts of Gaza in 'full-blown famine': World Food Program director Cindy McCain says crisis worsening\n\nDevelopments:\n\n\u220e Hamas called the Israeli decision on Al Jazeera a \"blatant violation of freedom of the press, and a repressive and retaliatory measure against Al Jazeera's professional role in exposing the crimes of the occupation.\"\n\n\u220e Pro-Palestinian rallies and protests continued to sweep across the U.S., with dozens of arrests and sometimes violent clashes with counterdemonstrators.\n\n\u220e Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said signs indicate Hamas won't accept the latest hostage deal and that the military will launch its offensive into the southern Gaza city of Rafah in \"the near future,\" the Times of Israel reported.

Israel is willing to pause fighting in Gaza in order to secure the release of hostages still being held by Hamas-led militants, he said.\n\n\"But while Israel has shown willingness, Hamas remains entrenched in its extreme positions, first among them the demand to remove all our forces from the Gaza Strip, end the war, and leave Hamas in power,\" Netanyahu said. \"Israel cannot accept that.\"\n\nHamas Chief Ismail Haniyeh said the militants remain committed to a \"comprehensive\" cease-fire that guarantees Israel's withdrawal from Gaza.

Her remarks are not an official declaration of famine, which is a technical designation spearheaded by the United Nations. The U.N. has said famine is \"imminent\" in Gaza since mid-March. But McCain, in an interview airing Sunday on NBC's \"Meet The Press, joinied Samantha Power, director of the U.S. Agency for International Development, in making the claim.

But as historian Yan Slobodkin wrote for Slate, whether or not the severe starvation that's happening in Gaza is officially declared a famine is, from a humanitarian perspective, irrelevant:\n\nIsrael has inflicted staggering levels of destruction and suffering on Gaza in its retaliatory assault after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, which killed 1,200 people. The IDF's relentless bombing campaign has destroyed Gaza's agricultural lands, critical infrastructure and large swaths of housing.

More than 34,600 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza as of May 1, according to the Gaza health ministry.\n\nOver the course of the war, more than 1.9 million Palestinians have been forcibly displaced, according to the UN, with many sheltering in cramped tent camps that cannot offer enough access to sanitation or food. The entire population of more than 2.2 million people is now at risk of famine, and at least 30 children have already died of malnutrition and dehydration in Gaza, according to the health ministry.\n\nConcerns are also heightened over an anticipated Israeli military operation in southern Gaza's Rafah, prompting renewed calls for a ceasefire.\n\nA Hamas delegation arrived in Egypt on Saturday for discussions on a possible ceasefire and hostage deal, having said in advance it would approach the talks with a \"positive spirit\" and \"determined to finalize the agreement to meet our people's demands.\"\n\nEgyptian state affiliated Al-Qahera News cited a senior Egyptian official on Saturday, saying Egyptian mediators are approaching a \"consensus formula on many points of disagreement.\" CNN has reached out to other mediators in the negotiations.\n\nPeople in southern Gaza queue to receive a bowl of food for their families from charity organizations, on May 3, 2024.

The government warned that a Rafah operation was coming but did not provide any sort of timeline and didn't suggest it was imminent.\n\nUS and Israeli officials have said any potential agreement on a framework that would bring both a temporary ceasefire and a release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza would likely be followed by continued negotiations over the finer details.\n\nA final deal between Israel and Hamas is expected to take several more days to negotiate in the Egyptian capital.\n\nCNN's Kareem Khadder, Mostafa Salem and Eve Brennan contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri":

Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), Philippe Lazzarini, on Sunday accused Israel of continuing to deny the United Nations aid access in Gaza as it tries to avert famine.\n\n\"Only in the past 2 weeks, we have recorded 10 incidents involving shooting at convoys, arrests of UN staff including bullying, stripping them naked, threats with arms & long delays at checkpoints forcing convoys to move during the dark or abort,\" Lazzarini posted on X.\n\nIsrael's government did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Lazzarini's remarks.\n\nLazzarini also called on \"Hamas and other armed groups to stop any attacks on humanitarian crossings, refrain from aid diversion and make sure assistance reaches all those in need.\" The militants claimed responsibility on Sunday for an attack that shut down the main humanitarian aid crossing into Gaza.\n\n'ALREADY DYING'\n\nA U.N.-backed report in March said famine was imminent and likely by May in northern Gaza, and could spread across the enclave by July. Famine is assessed as at least 20% of the population suffering extreme food shortages, with one in three children acutely malnourished and two people out of every 10,000 dying daily from starvation or from malnutrition and disease.\n\nU.N. officials say that generally by the time a famine is formally declared somewhere it is too late to save many people. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said last week that the most vulnerable in northern Gaza \"are already dying of hunger and disease.\"\n\nThe U.N. has complained about a lack of humanitarian aid access throughout the seven-month-long war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas in Gaza. Guterres has said the U.N. is trying to avert \"an entirely preventable, human-made famine\" in northern Gaza.\n\nIsrael is retaliating against Hamas over an Oct. 7 attack in which Israel says the militants killed about 1,200 people and took more than 250 people hostage. Gaza health authorities say Israel has killed more than 34,600 people in Gaza since then.\n\nHamas came to power in Gaza in 2006 after Israeli soldiers and settlers withdrew in 2005, but the enclave is still deemed as Israeli-occupied territory by the United Nations.\n\nAs the occupying power, the U.N. human rights chief has said Israel is obligated to ensure the provision of food and medical care to the population and to facilitate the work of humanitarian organizations trying to deliver aid.\n\n(Reporting by Michelle Nichols, Additional reporting by Maytaal Angel and Hatem Maher; Editing by Andrea Ricci)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

No other US official has made that assessment.\n\nMs. McCain said that while there has not yet been an official declaration of famine, based on what her organization has seen and experienced on the ground, she believes there is a \"full-blown\" issue in Gaza.\n\n\"It's horror. It's - You know, it's so hard to look at and it's so hard to hear, also,\" McCain said in her interview.\n\nShe went on to say that she is hopeful for a ceasefire in Gaza so that people can begin to be fed \"in a much faster fashion.\" Ms. McCain added that the people in Gaza need \"water, sanitation, medicine - it's all part of the famine -- the famine issue.\"\n\nEfforts to provide food aid to Gaza have been met both by Israeli resistance and ceaseless air strikes.\n\nWorld Central Kitchen, a US-based nonprofit group that has distributed over 43 million meals across Gaza, just resumed operations Monday after seven of its aid workers were killed by an Israeli airstrike on April 1.\n\nEarlier this week, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged the international community to \"do everything possible to avert an entirely preventable human-made famine\".\n\nLack of security is a major obstacle to distributing aid across Gaza, and he stressed that humanitarian convoys, facilities and personnel as well as people in need \"must not be targets\".\n\n\"We welcome aid delivery by air and sea, but there is no alternative to the massive use of land routes,\" he said, before again calling on Israel to allow and facilitate safe, rapid and unimpeded humanitarian access throughout Gaza, including for the UN's Palestine relief agency, UNRWA.\n\nGuterres also addressed how Israeli attacks have \"decimated\" the health system in the enclave, where two thirds of hospitals and health centres are out of commission, while many of those remaining are seriously damaged.\n\n\"Some hospitals now resemble cemeteries,\" he said, voicing deep alarm over reports of the discovery of mass graves at several locations, including at Al-Shifa and Nasser hospitals.\n\nMore than 390 bodies reportedly have been exhumed at Nasser Hospital alone, and \"there are competing narratives around several of these mass graves, including serious allegations that some of those buried were \"unlawfully killed,\" he added.\n\nThe UN chief said it is imperative that independent international forensic investigators are allowed immediate access to these sites to determine the precise circumstances under which hundreds of Palestinians lost their lives and were buried or reburied.\n\n\"The families of the dead and missing have a right to know what happened, and the world has a right to accountability for any violations of international law that may have taken place,\" he said.\n\nThe Secretary-General ended his remarks by drawing attention to UNRWA and its \"irreplaceable and indispensable work\" supporting millions of Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.\n\n\"UNRWA's presence across the region is a source of hope and stability. Its education, healthcare and other services provide a sense of normality, safety and stability to desperate communities,\" he said.\n\nThe agency recently appealed for $1.2 billion to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and to respond to needs in the West Bank, where violence is rising.\n\nUNRWA largely depends on donors and some 16 countries halted their contributions earlier this year following Israeli allegations that 12 staff were involved in the 7 October attacks.\n\nThe UN appointed an independent body to review the agency's efforts to ensure the humanitarian principle of neutrality.\n\nThe panel, headed by former French foreign minister Catherine Colonna, recently published its report which found that \"the set of rules and the mechanisms and procedures in place (at UNRWA) are the most elaborate within the UN system\". Guterres said an action plan is being put in place to implement the report's recommendations, and he appealed for cooperation from donors, host countries and staff.\n\nMeanwhile, most countries that suspended contributions to UNRWA have resumed them, and the Secretary-General said \"we are optimistic that others will join.\" Additionally, some UN Member States have given to the agency for the first time, while private donors have also provided support.\n\nHowever, as a funding gap persists, he urged Member States and donors to pledge generously to ensure the agency's work continues.\n\n\"This is the moment to reaffirm our hope for and contributions to a two-State solution - the only sustainable path to peace and security for Israelis, Palestinians and the wider region,\" he concluded.", "source": {"uri": "en.neonews.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "NEO TV | Voice of Pakistan"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City",

What does that mean?", "body": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- The head of the United Nations World Food Program says northern Gaza has entered \"full-blown famine\" after nearly seven months of war between Israel and Hamas. But a formal, and highly sensitive, famine declaration faces the complications of politics and of confirming how many people have died.\n\nCindy McCain in an NBC interview broadcast Sunday said severe Israeli restrictions on humanitarian deliveries to the territory that has long relied on outside food assistance have pushed civilians in the most isolated, devastated part of Gaza over the brink. Famine was now moving south in Gaza, she said.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nA WFP spokesman later told The Associated Press that one of the three benchmarks for a formal famine declaration has already been met in northern Gaza and another is nearly met -- important details on how far the effort to document deadly hunger has progressed.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIsrael faces mounting pressure from top ally the United States and others to let more aid into Gaza, notably by opening more land crossings for the most efficient delivery by truck. Aid groups say deliveries by air and sea by the United States and other countries cannot meet the needs of Gaza's 2.3 million people, a growing number of them reaching the stage of malnutrition where a child's growth is stunted and deaths occur.\n\nFamine had been projected in parts of Gaza this month in a March report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, a global initiative that includes WFP as a partner. It said nearly a third of Gaza's population was experiencing the highest level of catastrophic hunger, and that could rise to nearly half by July.\n\nThe next IPC report is expected in July. Israel strongly rejects any claims of famine in Gaza, and its humanitarian agency called McCain's assertion incorrect. A formal declaration could be used as evidence at the International Criminal Court as well as at the International Court of Justice, where Israel faces allegations of genocide in a case brought by South Africa.\n\nHere's what we know about famine and the hunger crisis in Gaza.\n\nWHAT A FAMINE MEANS\n\nAccording to the IPC, an area is considered to be in famine when three things occur: 20% of households have an extreme lack of food, or essentially starving; at least 30% of children suffer from acute malnutrition or wasting, meaning they're too thin for their height; and two adults or four children per every 10,000 people are dying daily of hunger and its complications.\n\nIn northern Gaza, the first condition of extreme lack of food has been met, senior WFP spokesman Steve Taravella told The Associated Press. The second condition of child acute malnutrition is nearly met, he said. But the death rate could not be verified.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDoing so is difficult. Aid groups note that Israeli airstrikes and raids have devastated medical facilities in northern Gaza and displaced much of the population. Along with restrictions on access, they complicate the ability to formally collect data on deaths.\n\nA document explaining famine published in March by the IPC noted, however, that an area can be classified as \"famine with reasonable evidence\" if two of the three thresholds have been reached and analysts believe from available evidence that the third likely has been reached.\n\n\"The bottom line is that people are practically dying from a lack of food, water and medicines. If we are waiting for the moment when all the facts are in hand to verify the final conditions to scientifically declare a famine, it would be after thousands of people have perished,\" Taravella said.\n\nTHE CAUSES OF CATASTROPHIC HUNGER\n\nShortly after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Israel sealed its borders with Gaza and for weeks prevented aid from entering. Aid groups have said assistance since then has been restricted to a trickle far below the 500 trucks of aid that entered before the war. Since March, as Israel has pointed to progress, an average of 171 trucks per day have entered Gaza, according to the U.S.-established Famine Early Warning Systems Network.\n\nOnce inside Gaza, food and other aid doesn't always reach the most vulnerable. Aid groups say access is limited, particularly in the north, due to ongoing fighting and a chaotic security situation.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nNorthern Gaza, including Gaza City, was the first target of Israel's invasion and became the epicenter of the hunger crisis, with many residents reduced to eating animal feed and foraging for weeds. The IPC report in March said around 210,000 people in the north were in catastrophic levels of hunger.\n\nThe very young, the very old and those with health problems are the most affected. On Sunday, a 6-year-old from northern Gaza with cystic fibrosis was taken to the United States on a humanitarian flight after his mother made a video pleading for help. Fadi Al-Zant's jutting ribs and thin arms showed advanced malnutrition.\n\nHOW TO AVERT A FAMINE\n\nHumanitarian groups say it will be difficult to deliver life-saving aid without a cease-fire. Even with a pause in fighting, some experts say the situation in northern Gaza will have life-lasting consequences, especially for newborns and pregnant women.\n\nWhile Israel has allowed more aid in recent weeks under international pressure, a humanitarian official for the U.S. Agency for International Development told the AP that since March, northern Gaza has not received anything like the aid needed to stave off famine. USAID made the official available on condition of the official's anonymity, citing security concerns over his work in conflict.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken has welcomed Israel's recent steps to increase deliveries but stressed such moves must be sustained. That's not easy. Israel on Sunday closed its main crossing point for delivering aid after a Hamas attack killed soldiers.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nVOICES FROM GAZA\n\nSome Palestinians say the increase in aid has eased things slightly, especially by lowering the cost of food.\n\nGaza City resident Said Siam said prices have dropped in recent weeks. Still, the 18-year-old said he and family members have each lost at least 10 kilograms (22 pounds) since the start of the war, mostly eating one meal of pumpkin soup each day. Fruits, vegetables and fresh meat are still scarce.\n\n___\n\nKnickmeyer reported from Washington.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war", "source":

Dozens of Palestinians -- the vast majority of them children and infants -- have already died of malnutrition and dehydration in northern Gaza.\n\nAccording to Palestinian and international officials, Israel's 211-day assault on Gaza -- which many experts including Israelis call genocidal -- has killed or maimed more than 123,000 Palestinians since the Hamas-led October 7 attacks, including an estimated 11,000 people who are believed to be dead and buried beneath the ruins of the hundreds of thousands of destroyed or damaged homes and other buildings.\n\nIn addition to not allowing adequate humanitarian aid into Gaza, Israeli forces have also repeatedly attacked both aid workers and desperate civilians trying to access the lifesaving provisions.\n\n\"What we are asking for and what we continually ask for is a cease-fire and the ability to have unfettered access, to get in safe through the various ports and gate crossings,\" McCain said during the interview.\n\nOn Saturday, Hamas spokesperson Osman Hamdan said there have been \"some forward steps\" toward a cease-fire agreement during negotiations in Egypt. Egyptian mediators proposed a six-week cessation of hostilities, the release of an unspecified number of Israeli and international hostages, and a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.\n\nHowever, one Israeli official toldABC News on condition of anonymity Saturday that \"Israel will under no circumstances agree to the end of the war as part of an agreement to release our abductees.\"\n\nThe negotiations come as Israeli forces prepare for an expected ground invasion of Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city, where more than a million refugees forcibly displaced from other parts of the strip are sheltering alongside around 280,000 local residents.

accusing it of blocking of humanitarian aid to Gaza", "body": "A large group of Congress members is calling on the Biden administration to reconsider its aid to Israel, arguing there's a credible case that the US partner is deliberately blocking American aid to Palestinian civilians in violation of federal law.\n\nOn Friday, a coalition of 88 Democratic members wrote to the White House, arguing that Israel's \"restrictions on US-backed humanitarian aid efforts have contributed to an unprecedented humanitarian disaster for Palestinian civilians and to credible reports of famine in parts of Gaza.\"\n\nThe letter argues that US support for Israel shouldn't be a \"blank check,\" and that federal law under Section 620I of the Foreign Assistance Act prohibits the US from giving security assistance to nations directly preventing the delivery of US humanitarian aid.\n\n\"Make clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that so long as Israel restricts, directly or indirectly, the facilitation of humanitarian aid delivery into Gaza, the Israeli government is risking its eligibility for further offensive security assistance from the US,\" the lawmakers wrote.\n\nThe Independent has contacted the White House for comment.\n\nHumanitarian officials have been warning for months that restrictions on international aid to the besieged Gaza strip will result in devastating consequences.\n\n\"It's horror,\" Cindy McCain, the director of the UN World Food Program, told Meet the Press in an interview airing on Sunday. \"There is famine -- full-blown famine -- in the north, and it's moving its way south.\"\n\nAccording to US humanitarian agency USAID, acute malnutrition among children under 5 has multiplied by nearly 30 times since the beginning of the war, and the few remaining medical facilities in Gaza that haven't been bombed by Israel are filled with children seeking treatment for the condition.\n\nIsrael has insisted it is not unduly restricting the flow of aid.\n\nIt has also accused the UN of failing to distribute aid effectively and has alleged that Hamas and other militant groups have looted supplies bound for civilians.\n\n\"Israel is constantly making significant efforts to find additional solutions to facilitate the flow of aid to the Gaza Strip and in particular to the north,\" a government official said Saturday when questioned about Israel's aid policies.\n\nIn Gaza, the movement of people and goods are heavily restricted even outside of wartime, and the war has further disrupted the delivery of key supplies.\n\nFor the first three weeks of the Israel-Hamas war, no aid trucks were allowed to enter Gaza, and deliveries still are not even at half of pre-war levels, even as Israel recently re-opened the Erez border crossing, and the US is at work on a new sea aid route slated to open in May.\n\nInternational observers argue Israel has unduly burdened the delivery of food and other supplies with excessive inspections of aid shipments.\n\n\"The main blockers remain arbitrary denials by the government of Israel and lengthy clearance procedures including multiple screenings and narrow opening windows in daylight hours,\" British foreign secretary David Cameron wrote in a March letter to UK parliament.\n\nOthers have gone further than the US congressional delegation, suggesting Israeli practices constitute war crimes.\n\n\"The extent of Israel's continued restrictions on the entry of aid into Gaza, together with the manner in which it continues to conduct hostilities, may amount to the use of starvation as a method of war, which is a war crime,\" UN human rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk said in a statement in March.\n\nHumanitarian access has emerged as a key issue in the Biden administration's vital support for Israel.\n\nIn April, a furious Joe Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu that the fatal Israeli military strike on seven World Central Kitchen aid workers in Gaza was \"unacceptable.\"\n\nThe White House warned future US policy was contingent on Israel announcing \"a series of specific, concrete, and measurable steps to address civilian harm, humanitarian suffering, and the safety of aid workers\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_marcus@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Josh

Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), Philippe Lazzarini, on Sunday accused Israel of continuing to deny the United Nations aid access in Gaza as it tries to avert famine.\n\n\"Only in the past 2 weeks, we have recorded 10 incidents involving shooting at convoys, arrests of UN staff including bullying, stripping them naked, threats with arms & long delays at checkpoints forcing convoys to move during the dark or abort,\" Lazzarini posted on X.\n\nIsrael's government did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Lazzarini's remarks.\n\nLazzarini also called on \"Hamas and other armed groups to stop any attacks on humanitarian crossings, refrain from aid diversion and make sure assistance reaches all those in need.\" The militants claimed responsibility on Sunday for an attack that shut down the main humanitarian aid crossing into Gaza.\n\nA U.N.-backed report in March said famine was imminent and likely by May in northern Gaza, and could spread across the enclave by July. Famine is assessed as at least 20% of the population suffering extreme food shortages, with one in three children acutely malnourished and two people out of every 10,000 dying daily from starvation or from malnutrition and disease.\n\nU.N. officials say that generally by the time a famine is formally declared somewhere it is too late to save many people. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said last week that the most vulnerable in northern Gaza \"are already dying of hunger and disease.\"\n\nThe U.N. has complained about a lack of humanitarian aid access throughout the seven-month-long war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas in Gaza. Guterres has said the U.N. is trying to avert \"an entirely preventable, human-made famine\" in northern Gaza.\n\nIsrael is retaliating against Hamas over an Oct. 7 attack in which Israel says the militants killed about 1,200 people and took more than 250 people hostage. Gaza health authorities say Israel has killed more than 34,600 people in Gaza since then.\n\nHamas came to power in Gaza in 2006 after Israeli soldiers and settlers withdrew in 2005, but the enclave is still deemed as Israeli-occupied territory by the United Nations.\n\nAs the occupying power, the U.N. human rights chief has said Israel is obligated to ensure the provision of food and medical care to the population and to facilitate the work of humanitarian organizations trying to deliver aid.\n\n(Reporting by Michelle Nichols, Additional reporting by Maytaal Angel and Hatem Maher; Editing by Andrea Ricci)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@theprint.in", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Lazzarini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philippe Lazzarini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UNRWA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_checkpoint", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Security checkpoint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malnutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant\u00f3nio_Guterres", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ant\u00f3nio Guterres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starvation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian fedayeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli-occupied territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_occupation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military occupation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 62}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538170", "eventUri": "eng-9538170", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1904, "textEnd": 1910}], "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

WORLD FOOD PROGRAM\n\nSEDONA, Ariz. -- The head of the U.N. World Food Program, Cindy McCain, says northern Gaza is experiencing \"full-blown famine.\"\n\nSpeaking to NBC News on Friday at the McCain Institute's Sedona Forum in Arizona, McCain pressed for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas and access for humanitarian aid because \"there is famine -- full-blown famine -- in the north, and it's moving its way south.\"\n\nThere hasn't yet been an official declaration of famine. The U.N. and others have said the Palestinian territory is on the brink of famine, and the comments from the head of the agency that distributes food assistance go farther than others.\n\nThe nearly seven-month-old Israel-Hamas war has thrown Gaza into humanitarian crisis, and relief workers struggle to bring in desperately needed aid because of the fighting and Israeli restrictions on land crossings.\n\nFacing pressure to ease the catastrophe, the U.S. has pressed its ally Israel to open more land routes. One reopened this week for the first time since the start of the war. The U.S. is also building a pier system off Gaza to bring in aid by sea.\n\nMcCain's comments come as U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Samantha Power pointed Friday to the food crises in Gaza and other parts of the world in announcing a $200 million investment aimed at increasing production of emergency nutritional paste for starving children under 5.\n\nU.N. REPORTS 'INCREMENTAL PROCESS' RESTORING WATER TO GAZA\n\nUNITED NATIONS - U.N. humanitarian officials report \"incremental progress\" in restoring water to Gaza, with the territory producing just 20% of the water supply it did before the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7.\n\nThe Palestinian Water Authority announced earlier this week that the Al Muntar water line from Israel has resumed pumping, and U.N. humanitarian officials reported this would benefit four neighborhoods in Gaza City, U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said Friday. The water line, which had been shut down for 200 days, was the third Israeli water line to restart operations and can potentially serve some 300,000 people in Gaza City, he said.\n\nWith much of northern Gaza's population displaced, it's not clear how many people are still living in those neighborhoods, or how badly the water infrastructure has been damaged.\n\nBefore Oct. 7, Gaza normally got its water supplies from a combination of sources, including pipelines from Israel, desalination plants on the Mediterranean Sea, and wells.\n\nThose supplies were slashed when Israel cut off water, along with the fuel and electricity that power water and sewage plants, in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas.\n\nOCHA reports that 83% of groundwater wells are not operating, two out of three main water desalination plants are partially functioning, and 57% of water, sanitation and health facilities in Gaza are damaged or destroyed, Haq said. As of April 30, just 20% of Gaza's pre-Oct. 7 water production is being produced, he said.\n\nThe U.N. earlier reported a breakdown in sanitation services in Gaza and the U.N. humanitarian office estimates there are now 270,000 tons of accumulated solid waste in the territory.\n\nU.N. SAYS ISRAELI CIVILIANS VANDALIZED SOME HUMANITARIAN AID AS CONVOY TRAVELED THROUGH WEST BANK\n\nUNITED NATIONS -- The United Nations reports that a U.N. convoy carrying humanitarian aid from Jordan to Gaza had \"a limited amount of goods\" vandalized by Israeli civilians when it went through the West Bank. It was also rerouted by armed men when it entered Gaza to the wrong U.N. facility.\n\nU.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters Friday \"there was a miscommunication\" with the convoy Wednesday and the trucks were ultimately directed to the U.N. World Food Program warehouse in Beit Hanoun.\n\nReferring to Hamas, he said the U.N. has clarified the misunderstanding with \"the de facto authorities in Gaza to ensure that this doesn't happen again.\" They reiterated their commitment to respect the delivery of humanitarian aid, he said.\n\n\"All of the goods have been subsequently accounted for and are being distributed by the U.N.,\" Haq said.\n\nThe U.N. humanitarian office reported that the convoy started in Jordan and entered Gaza \"via back-to-back transfer at Erez crossing, following inspection by Israeli authorities only at Allenby Bridge,\" he said.\n\nThe bridge links Jordan to the West Bank, and Haq said \"Going through the West Bank, Israeli civilians offloaded and vandalized a limited amount of goods from the convoy,\" which included food parcels, sugar, rice, supplementary food for those malnourished and milk powder.\n\nThe U.N. doesn't think the incident should impact further aid deliveries from Jordan, Haq said.\n\nBIDEN TO HOST JORDAN'S KING ABDULLAH II FOR TALKS AT THE WHITE HOUSE\n\nWASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden will host Jordan's King Abdullah II for talks at the White House next week in the midst of the latest push for a cease-fire deal to end the Israel-Hamas war can soon be reached, according to the White House.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre confirmed that the private talks would happen at some point next week but did provide further details.\n\nThe meeting comes as Israel and Hamas were negotiating a potential cease-fire in Gaza and the return of Israeli hostages. A leaked truce proposal hints at compromises by both sides after months of stalemated talks.\n\nBiden last hosted Abdullah, a close ally, for White House talks in February.\n\nISRAEL TO SEEK TO REDUCE ECONOMIC TIES BETWEEN TURKEY AND THE PALESTINIANS IN RETALIATION FOR TURKEY'S TRADE BAN ON ISRAEL\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israel said Friday it will seek to reduce economic ties between Turkey and the Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza in retaliation for Turkey's trade ban with Israel over its military actions in Gaza.\n\nForeign Minister Israel Katz said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan \"wants to harm Israel\" with the ban \"but will primarily harm the Palestinian economy.\"\n\nThe Foreign Ministry said it would take \"action to minimize all economic ties between Turkey and the Palestinian Authority and Gaza.\"\n\nIt did not elaborate on how it would do so. Israel controls all entry points into the occupied West Bank, both through its own territory and from neighboring Jordan. It imposes inspections on good entering the West Bank but has imposed a wholesale block on imports, though it did stop all Palestinian exports to Israel for weeks in 2020 during a trade dispute with the Palestinian Authority.\n\nMultiple times in the past, it has withheld customs duties on imports that it collects on behalf of the authority, which controls enclaves around the West Bank. Since the war with Hamas began in October, it has blocked entry to almost all commercial goods to Gaza, except for a trickle of supplies along with international aid entering the territory.\n\nAfter Israel, Turkey is the largest importer to the Palestinian Authority, accounting for about 18% of its imports.\n\nThe ministry said it would also seek sanctions against Turkey at international economic forums for violating trade agreements.\n\n\"The Israeli economy is strong, and the Turkish economy will be much more affected than the Israeli economy due to the trade balance between the countries. It's a mistake Erdogan will regret,\" Katz said.\n\nTurkey imposed the ban on Thursday, suspending all imports and exports to Israel. Erdogan said his country could no longer \"stand by and watch\" the violence in Gaza.\n\nA 23-YEAR-OLD ISRAELI WAS KILLED DURING THE OCT. 7 ATTACK, AFTER ORIGINALLY THROUGHT ABDUCTED BY HAMAS\n\nJERUSALEM -- The Israeli military and a support group for the families of Israeli hostages confirmed Friday that Elyakim Libman, a 23-year-old Israeli who had been believed abducted by Hamas, was killed during the militants' Oct. 7 attack. His body was found in Israel.\n\nThe Hostages Families Forum Headquarters said Libman was working as a security guard at a music festival that was attacked by the militants after they stormed out of Gaza. It said he helped evacuate the wounded during the mayhem before being killed.\n\nThe military said it, the police and forensic officials had identified the body after it was found in Israeli territory.\n\nAt least 260 people were killed at the Nova music festival, taking place in an open space near Gaza when Hamas militants rampaged through communities in southern Israel. Some 1,200 people were killed in the attack, and militants took around 250 hostage. Because of the chaos of the day, a few believed taken captive were later determined to be among the dead.\n\nIsrael says Hamas is holding about 100 hostages and the remains of more than 30 others in Gaza, after many were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November. Since the Oct. 7 attack, Israel's bombardment and offensive in Gaza has killed more than 34,500 Palestinians.\n\nCIA CHIEF ARRIVES IN EGYPT AS HAMAS CONSIDERS CEASE-FIRE DEAL WITH ISRAEL\n\nCAIRO -- Two Egyptian security officials say CIA director William Burns has arrived in Egypt amid a push to seal a cease-fire accord between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza war.\n\nBurns' visit comes as Hamas is considering the latest proposal for a cease-fire and hostage release put forward by U.S., Egyptian and Qatari mediators, who hope to avert an Israeli offensive against Rafah, Gaza's southernmost town.\n\nHamas said it will send a delegation to Cairo on Saturday for further discussions on the offer, though it has not specified when.\n\nThe two Egyptian officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the press, did not give details on Burns' visit. U.S. officials would not comment on the report.\n\nThe latest proposal reportedly calls for a three-stage cease-fire, starting with a six-week halt in fighting during which Hamas would release a number of hostages it holds, including women and elderly, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. Talks would then take place on a permanent calm, during which Israel would withdraw troops from Gaza and Hamas would release all the remaining hostages.\n\nAn Egyptian official has said Hamas is seeking firmer language in the text to ensure a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and an end to its offensive and bombardment - as well as the return of Palestinians displaced from the north of the territory.\n\nHamas said in its statement that it has responded in a \"positive spirit\" to the proposal and \"we are going to Cairo in the same spirit to reach an agreement.\"\n\nIt said the group is demanding a \"complete cessation of aggression\" and withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, \"the return of the displaced, relief for our people, the start of reconstruction, and the completion of a serious (hostage for prisoner) exchange deal.\"\n\nHamas is believed to still hold around 100 Israelis in Gaza, as well as the bodies of around 30 others who died in captivity. Israel launched its campaign in Gaza vowing to destroy Hamas after the group's Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel.\n\n2 PALESTINIANS FROM GAZA DIED IN ISRAELI CUSTODY, INCLUDING A SURGEON FROM SHIFA HOSPITAL, GROUP SAYS\n\nBEIRUT -- The Palestinian Prisoner's Club said two Palestinian detainees from Gaza have died in Israeli custody, including a prominent surgeon seized by troops during a raid on a hospital.\n\nThe cause of their deaths was not immediately known. Israeli and Palestinian rights groups have reported harsh conditions in Israeli prisons for the hundreds of Palestinians detained from Gaza, including beatings and medical neglect.\n\nThe Israeli prison authority and army officials had no comment.\n\nThe surgeon, Dr. Adnan al-Borsh, 50, was head of the orthopedic department in Gaza City's Shifa hospital. After an Israeli siege in November crippled Shifa, he worked in nearby al-Awda Hospital, which Israeli troops later stormed, detaining him and others inside in December.\n\nAbdullah al-Zaghari, head of the Palestinian Prisoner's Club, said they were informed by the Palestinian Administrative Affairs office, which coordinates with the Israeli military, that al-Borsh died in Ofer Prison in the West Bank on April 19. He said the body was still being held by Israeli authorities.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean Pierre said she could not speak specifically about the case but that it was \"devastating to hear\" that a doctor was killed.\n\n\"We know humanitarian aid is dire and the innocent people of Gaza, the Palestinian citizens obviously need that care. They need that assistance,\" she said. President Biden \"has said very clearly that when it comes to people -- who are citizens in Gaza providing that all important care, humanitarian aid, they need to be protected.\"\n\nThe body of the second prisoner, 33-year-old Ismail Abdul-Bari Rajab Khodr, was handed over with dozens of released prisoners who were returned to Gaza this week, the Club said. The circumstances of his detention were not immediately known.\n\nThree Palestinian human rights groups -- Addameer, Al Mezan, Al-Haq, and the Palestinian Center for Human Rights -- said in a joint statement that Khodr's body was examined at Rafah's Abu Youssef al-Najjar Hospital. They quoted the hospital's director, Dr. Marwan Al-Hems, saying he died of torture and that marks of torture were found on his wrists as well as swelling in his shoulders, knees and chest. The three groups said others among the prisoners released this week showed signs of abuse.\n\nThe Club said both Khodr and al-Borsh had been tortured, without providing evidence. It said their deaths brought to 18 the number of Palestinians who have died in Israeli prisons since the launch of Israel's offensive in Gaza following Hamas' Oct. 7 attack.\n\nMore than 490 medical workers have been killed in Gaza since the war began, the Palestinian Health Ministry said. Israel has raided multiple hospitals during its campaign in Gaza, claiming Hamas activity inside, often arresting large numbers of staff and displaced people sheltering in the facilities.\n\nTURKISH PRESIDENT EXPLAINS DECISION TO IMPOSE TRADE BAN ON ISRAEL\n\nISTANBUL -- Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says his country imposed a trade ban on Israel because it could no longer \"stand by and watch\" the violence in Gaza.\n\nTurkey on Thursday announced that it had suspended all imports and exports to Israel over its military actions in Gaza. It said Friday that the ban would stay in place until a permanent cease-fire is achieved and the Israeli government allows all humanitarian aid to reach Gaza without hindrance.\n\n\"Up to now, Israel has killed 40,000 to 45,000 Palestinians without mercy. As Muslims, we could not stand by and watch,\" Erdogan told reporters following traditional Friday prayers in Istanbul.\n\nErdogan said: \"We had a trade volume that had reached 9.5 billion dollars between us. But we closed the door (to trade) as though this trade volume did not exist.\"\n\nThe Turkish leader had faced intense pressure to stop trade ties with Israel and lost some votes in local elections in March to a small Islamist party that had been critical of Turkey's continued commercial relations with Israel.\n\nErdogan again held the United States and other Western nations responsible for deaths in the Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\"The whole West and especially America, are working for Israel by mobilizing all resources and unfortunately the poor people of Palestine were sentenced to death through Israel's bombings,\" he said.\n\nGAZA HEALTH MINISTRY ADDS 26 PEOPLE TO THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR DEATH TOLL\n\nBEIRUT -- The Gaza Health Ministry said Friday the bodies of 26 people killed by Israeli strikes have been brought to local hospitals over the past 24 hours. Hospitals also received 51 wounded, it said in its daily report.\n\nThat brings the overall Palestinian death toll from the Israel-Hamas war to at least 34,622 the ministry said, and 77,867 wounded.\n\nThe Health Ministry does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its tallies, but says that women and children make up around two-thirds of those killed.\n\nThe Israeli military says it has killed 13,000 militants, without providing evidence to back up the claim.\n\nU.N. AID OFFICE WARNS THAT AN ISRAELI ASSAULT ON RAFAH WOULD RISK KILLING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS\n\nGENEVA -- The United Nations humanitarian aid agency says hundreds of thousands of people would be \"at imminent risk of death\" if Israel carries out a military assault in the southern Gaza city of Rafah.\n\nJens Laerke, spokesperson for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said Rafah has become a crucial humanitarian hub for distribution of aid into Gaza.\n\nRafah is pivotal for food, water, health, sanitation, hygiene and other critical support to the people there, including hundreds of thousands of Gazans who fled fighting elsewhere. But most importantly, Laerke told reporters at a regular U.N. briefing in Geneva, the hundreds of thousands of people there \"would be at imminent risk of death if there is an assault.\"\n\nWorld Health Organization officials said they have been preparing contingency plans for a possible assault in Rafah. They noted, meanwhile, that more food has been reaching beleaguered Palestinians in recent weeks, but the threat of famine remains.\n\nDr. Rik Peeperkorn, the WHO representative for occupied Palestinian areas, said by videoconference that the threat of famine had \"absolutely not\" declined. Dr. Ahmed Dahir, the head of WHO's office in Gaza, said the food situation was fragile, and \"the risk of famine has not passed.\"\n\nATTEMPTS AT INTIMIDATION AND IMPEDING MUST STOP IMMEDIATELY, INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT SAYS\n\nTHE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The International Criminal Court's prosecution office issued a statement Friday insisting that \"all attempts to impede, intimidate or improperly influence its officials cease immediately.\"\n\nThe statement did not mention any of its active investigations or elaborate on the nature of attempts to influence its work. The office declined to elaborate further on the statement.\n\nHowever, it came amid speculation that the court could soon issue arrest warrants against Israeli officials. There has been fierce pushback against the global court, including by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said Tuesday that it would be \"an outrage of historic proportions\" if the court issues arrest warrants against Israeli officials.\n\nThe ICC is investigating alleged crimes in the Palestinian territories dating back to the previous war in Gaza in 2014. It has not commented on the status of the probe or whether warrants for any suspects are imminent.\n\nIn the statement posted Friday on the social media platform X, the office of the prosecutor said its independence and impartiality are undermined \"when individuals threaten to retaliate against the Court or against Court personnel should the Office, in fulfilment of its mandate, make decisions about investigations or cases falling within its jurisdiction.\"\n\nNetanyahu has said that Israel \"will never accept any attempt by the ICC to undermine its inherent right of self-defense.\"\n\nTURKEY WILL IMPOSE ITS TRADE BAN ON ISRAEL UNTIL THERE IS A PERMANENT CEASE-FIRE AND UNHINDERED AID INTO GAZA\n\nISTANBUL -- Turkey's trade minister says a trade ban imposed on Israel will remain in place until a permanent cease-fire is achieved and the Israeli government allows all humanitarian aid to enter Gaza without hindrance.\n\nTurkey, a vocal critic of Israel's military actions in Gaza, announced Thursday that it had suspended all imports and exports to Israel over its ongoing offensive. The move came weeks after the country had announced trade restrictions on a number of items, including aluminum, steel, construction products and chemical fertilizers.\n\nTrade Minister Omer Bolat said Friday that the new measure was in response to \"the deterioration and aggravation of the situation in Rafah\" -- a reference to Gaza's southernmost town.\n\n\"The trade (block) related to Israel will be implemented until a permanent cease-fire is achieved and aid to Gaza is freed in an uninterrupted manner,\" he said.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose ruling party suffered a major setback in local elections in March, was under intense pressure to stop halt trade relations with Israel.\n\nISRAELI STRIKE ON RAFAH KILLS 7, INCLUDING CHILDREN\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- An Israeli strike on the city of Rafah on the southern edge of the Gaza Strip killed seven people, including children, hospital officials said Friday.\n\nThe overnight strike on the Chahine family home killed two adults and five kids whose ages ranged between 7 and 16, according to a list of the names released by Abu Youssef al-Najjar Hospital.\n\nThe strike came a day after the militant Palestinian group Hamas said it was sending a delegation to Egypt for further cease-fire talks -- a new sign of progress in attempts by international mediators to hammer out an agreement between Israel and the militant group to end the war in Gaza.\n\nIsrael has regularly carried out airstrikes on Rafah since the start of the war seven months ago and has threatened to send in ground troops, saying Rafah is the last major Hamas stronghold in the coastal enclave. Over 1 million Palestinians have sought refuge in the city on the Egyptian border. The United States and others have urged Israel not to invade, fearing a humanitarian catastrophe.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged Tuesday to launch an incursion into Rafah.\n\nDEATH CONFIRMED OF ISRAELI MAN WHOSE BODY WAS TAKEN INTO GAZA ON OCT. 7\n\nTEL AVIV -- A support group for the families of Israeli hostages taken into Gaza confirmed Friday the death of Dror Or, 49, the 38th hostage known to have died. Or was killed in the Oct. 7 attack and his body taken into Gaza, the Hostages Families Forum said.\n\nOr and two of his children were abducted from Kibbutz Be'eri when Hamas attacked on Oct. 7 and his wife, Yonat, was killed. His children, 17-year-old Noam and 13-year-old Alma, were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November.\n\nIsrael says Hamas is holding about 100 hostages and the remains of more than 30 others. Or's body has not been returned, the Forum said, demanding that the Israeli government \"exhaust every effort\" to bring back his remains as well as all the hostages still in Gaza.\n\nIsrael and Hamas appear to be seriously negotiating an end to the war in Gaza and the return of Israeli hostages. A leaked truce proposal hints at compromises by both sides after months of talks languishing in a stalemate. Hamas said Thursday that it was sending a delegation to Egypt for further cease-fire talks, in a new sign of progress.\n\nSome families worry that Israel's war aims of eliminating Hamas and launching an incursion into Gaza's southern city of Rafah will derail negotiations. Dozens of people demonstrated Thursday night outside Israel's military headquarters in Tel Aviv, demanding a deal to release the hostages.\n\nDuring a meeting with Holocaust survivors in Jerusalem Friday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said \"We are making great efforts. We have already brought back half (the hostages), when people did not believe that we would get anyone back.\"\n\nHe made no specific reference to Or, but said, \"I can tell you that we are determined to return everyone -- the ones who are alive as well as the ones who are dead. We brought back 124 (people) as of today, but there are more. We do not forget anyone.\"\n\nUS DEFENSE SECRETARY SAYS 'CONDITIONS ARE NOT FAVORABLE' FOR AN ISRAELI OPERATION IN RAFAH\n\nHONOLULU -- United States Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, while at a news conference Thursday in Hawaii, was asked by a reporter what consequences Israel would face from the U.S. if Israel conducted an offensive operation in Rafah without \"appropriately taking into account\" civilians in the area.\n\nAustin said it would be up to President Joe Biden and he wouldn't speculate on that, but that currently, \"conditions are not favorable to any kind of operation.\"\n\n\"What we've highlighted for the Israelis is that it's really important to make sure that the civilians that are in that battle space move out of that battle space before any activity is conducted. And that if and when they return to any kind of operation that it be conducted in a more much more precise fashion,\" Austin said.\n\nHe noted there were about 275,000 people living in and around Rafah before the conflict started but there are now about 1.4 million.\n\n\"That's a lot of people in a very small space. There's a good chance that without taking the right measures that we'll see a lot more civilian casualties going forward. So before anything happens, we certainly want to see them address that threat to the civilians,\" Austin said.\n\n\"Right now, the conditions are not favorable to any kind of operation. And we've been clear about that. It is necessary to take care of the civilian population that's in that area before anything else happens,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "newdelhitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Delhi

Satterfield's comments came after months of requests from President Biden -- who has been supporting the Israeli government militarily and diplomatically -- for Israel to allow additional aid into the territory. More than thirty-four thousand Gazans have already been killed in Israel's military campaign, and the enclave remains at serious risk of famine -- a risk that Satterfield acknowledged. (Several weeks ago, Save the Children, a humanitarian group, reported that twenty-seven Gazan children have died from starvation and health conditions related to malnourishment.) The situation is especially dire in the northern part of Gaza, where around three hundred thousand people still live. The majority of the population is now in the south.\n\nAlmost eight months into the war, I wanted to understand how much aid is actually reaching Gazans. I recently spoke by phone with Arif Husain, the chief economist of the United Nations World Food Programme, which both collects data on where people are in need of food and helps to provide food to needy populations. Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, is below.\n\nHow much aid is currently reaching Gaza right now, as we begin May?\n\nFor me, the most important data in terms of accuracy is our own data. I know that in February we were able to bring only about twenty-seven trucks into northern Gaza. And then, in March, we were able to bring forty-seven trucks into northern Gaza. In April, we saw the real improvement. By April 29th, about a hundred and seventy-two trucks that were able to come in, enough to feed about five hundred and sixteen thousand people. Ninety-one of those trucks came through the Erez Crossing, and another eighty-one were able to reach the north from inside Gaza, which is crucial. A single truck, on average, carries about fifteen tons of basic food commodities, which is enough to feed about three thousand people for ten days. This means that, for northern Gaza alone, we need three hundred trucks with food per month.\n\nIt is definitely true that there has been an uptick in terms of what is coming in. Over all, the World Food Programme sent nine hundred and ninety-one trucks into Gaza through April 29th, compared with eight hundred and sixty-six trucks in March, and seven hundred and four in February. Is it enough? No. We need a lot more. Think about all the displacement, lack of shelter, think about congestion, think about the lack of food, lack of water, lack of medicine, all of that, and what it means for these people whose immune systems are extremely weak. They're highly susceptible to disease outbreaks. We need to make sure that they get the nourishment they need. And that cannot be for one day or two days or for a week. That has to be every single day for the foreseeable future. And if we can do that, we can essentially minimize the pain. We can reverse famine.\n\nThe U.N. has said that more trucks are getting in, but the average was a hundred and sixty per day in March and it rose to more than a hundred and ninety per day in April. That's throughout the whole territory. Those numbers are still pretty low considering that experts say at least five hundred trucks need to come in per day. Correct?\n\nYeah. It is low. All we have is an uptick. It is something positive. But we are not at a level by any means where we can say, O.K., this is great, this is enough.\n\nI know that there's been some talk about more aid being brought in by boat. The United Arab Emirates has been trying to bring in aid that way, and the Biden Administration is in the process of constructing a floating pier. Has there been any success with non-truck routes?\n\nWell, look, at the end of the day, what is important is to get enough nourishment, enough sustenance, into the Gaza Strip. The best way to do that is through roads and through the Port of Ashdod, where it can be inspected before going in through Kerem Shalom crossing. That's what worked before. Whatever is arriving on top of that is obviously welcome. If it comes through the pier, it's welcome; if it comes through air drops, it's welcome. But, at the end of the day, the most cost-effective, fastest way is through roads and ports.\n\nDo you understand why there's been an uptick in your food deliveries, however insufficient?\n\nAll I can say is that there is a definite change in terms of what is coming into the Gaza Strip. Now, for what reason? I really don't care. I'm just happy that it is moving. From Day One we were basically saying that if you're going to stop this famine, three things must happen. One, enough food, water, medicine, and essential commodities need to come into the Gaza Strip. Two, people who are bringing in this stuff, such as humanitarian workers, people from the commercial sector, they must feel safe. Three, people who are receiving this stuff must also be safe to receive it.\n\nRight. There has been a lot of concern that -- because of lawlessness in Gaza, because aid workers have been killed, as we saw with the I.D.F. strike on the World Central Kitchen convoy -- some of the aid that got in was not able to be delivered. Do you have some confidence that your trucks are reaching the intended recipients?\n\nI think they are reaching their intended recipients. And we are collecting data. So what we are seeing is that prices of commodities in the markets are coming down. They've come down in the south but also in the north. We are seeing that there is an improvement in people's food consumption. Does that mean that there is no risk of famine? No -- there is absolutely a risk of famine. Why? Because the population is at such an elevated risk. In March, seventy per cent of the population in northern Gaza was in Phase 5 of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (I.P.C.).\n\nWhat do those terms mean?\n\nWhen we try to determine whether there is famine or a risk of famine in a particular place, we are essentially analyzing three things. First, at least twenty per cent of the population must be experiencing extreme hunger -- essentially, starving. At least thirty per cent of the children must be wasted, meaning they're too thin for their height. And the daily mortality rate, meaning death rate, must be double the global benchmark: for adults, that means from one to two per ten thousand, and, for children, from two to four per ten thousand. When these three conditions come together in one place, we call it a famine.\n\nIn Gaza's case, especially in the north, the first condition was met. Why? Because seventy per cent of the population was starving. The second condition was met. Why? Because more than thirty per cent of the children were wasted. And then the third condition was not verified. Why? Because it's kind of a lag condition and the mechanisms are not there to really verify if non-trauma mortality has doubled or not. This is why we said that, in northern Gaza, famine was imminent by mid-May.\n\nThe World Food Programme, in conjunction with other groups, released a report in March projecting that famine was imminent for the three hundred thousand Palestinian civilians in northern Gaza.\n\nAt the time the report was done, not enough nourishment was coming in, and the assumption was that if things continued in the same way, a famine would occur by mid-May. Now, for one reason or another, aid has picked up -- not enough, but it has still picked up -- which means that people are starting to get more nourishment than they were getting before. In the month of April, we have seen the number of people who are experiencing extreme levels of food insecurity, extreme hunger, start to drop. We are planning on compiling another report at the end of May to see what the data is telling us.", "source": {"uri": "newyorker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Yorker"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@newyorker.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Food Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Israel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_the_Children", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Save the Children"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erez_Crossing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erez Crossing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starvation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malnutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerem_Shalom_border_crossing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kerem Shalom border crossing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Ashdod", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Port of Ashdod"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Food_Security_Phase_Classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Integrated Food Security Phase Classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Food security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/66326bfc960890c839cbd999/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Chotiner-Arif-Husain.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538170", "eventUri": "eng-9538170", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-29", "textStart": 1671, "textEnd": 1681, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

nations directly preventing the delivery of US humanitarian aid.\n\n\"Make clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that so long as Israel restricts, directly or indirectly, the facilitation of humanitarian aid delivery into Gaza, the Israeli government is risking its eligibility for further offensive security assistance from the US,\" the lawmakers wrote.\n\nThe Independent has contacted the White House for comment.\n\nHumanitarian officials have been warning for months that restrictions on international aid to the besieged Gaza strip will result in devastating consequences.\n\n\"It's horror,\" Cindy McCain, the director of the UN World Food Program, told Meet the Press in an interview airing on Sunday. \"There is famine -- full-blown famine -- in the north, and it's moving its way south.\"\n\nAccording to US humanitarian agency USAID, acute malnutrition among children under 5 has multiplied by nearly 30 times since the beginning of the war, and the few remaining medical facilities in Gaza that haven't been bombed by Israel are filled with children seeking treatment for the condition.\n\nIsrael has insisted it is not unduly restricting the flow of aid.\n\nIt has also accused the UN of failing to distribute aid effectively and has alleged that Hamas and other militant groups have looted supplies bound for civilians.\n\n\"Israel is constantly making significant efforts to find additional solutions to facilitate the flow of aid to the Gaza Strip and in particular to the north,\" a government official said Saturday when questioned about Israel's aid policies.\n\nIn Gaza, the movement of people and goods are heavily restricted even outside of wartime, and the war has further disrupted the delivery of key supplies.\n\nFor the first three weeks of the Israel-Hamas war, no aid trucks were allowed to enter Gaza, and deliveries still are not even at half of pre-war levels, even as Israel recently re-opened the Erez border crossing, and the US is at work on a new sea aid route slated to open in May.\n\nInternational observers argue Israel has unduly burdened the delivery of food and other supplies with excessive inspections of aid shipments.\n\n\"The main blockers remain arbitrary denials by the government of Israel and lengthy clearance procedures including multiple screenings and narrow opening windows in daylight hours,\" British foreign secretary David Cameron wrote in a March letter to UK parliament.\n\nOthers have gone further than the US congressional delegation, suggesting Israeli practices constitute war crimes.\n\n\"The extent of Israel's continued restrictions on the entry of aid into Gaza, together with the manner in which it continues to conduct hostilities, may amount to the use of starvation as a method of war, which is a war crime,\" UN human rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk said in a statement in March.\n\nHumanitarian access has emerged as a key issue in the Biden administration's vital support for Israel.\n\nIn April, a furious Joe Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu that the fatal Israeli military strike on seven World Central Kitchen aid workers in Gaza was \"unacceptable.\"\n\nThe White House warned future US policy was contingent on Israel announcing \"a series of specific, concrete, and measurable steps to address civilian harm, humanitarian suffering, and the safety of aid workers\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

into Gaza.\n\nThe World Health Organization said Friday that the availability of food in the Gaza Strip has very slightly improved, though the risk of famine continues in the besieged Palestinian territory, which is home to 2.4 million people.\n\nIsrael has repeatedly accused the United Nations and nongovernmental organizations of not distributing aid quickly enough.\n\nThe aid agencies blame the trickle of essential food into the Palestinian enclave on restrictions and inspections imposed by Israel.\n\nMeanwhile, British-Palestinian doctor and Glasgow University rector Ghassan Abu-Sittah was on Saturday denied access to France where he had been due address a meeting on the medical situation in Gaza.\n\nAbu-Sittah said on X, formerly Twitter, that he had been invited to address French senators about his experience as a doctor in Gaza since the Israeli offensive there but had been blocked at Paris's Charles-de-Gaulle airport.\n\n\"They say the Germans put a 1 year ban on my entry to Europe,\" he wrote.\n\nA French police source confirmed to AFP that France could not admit the doctor because it was bound by a German-issued ban on his entry into the visa-free Schengen zone of which

Famine is assessed as at least 20 per cent of the population suffering extreme food shortages, with one in three children acutely malnourished and two people out of every 10,000 dying daily from starvation or from malnutrition and disease.\n\nUN officials say that generally by the time a famine is formally declared somewhere it is too late to save many people. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said last week that the most vulnerable in northern Gaza \"are already dying of hunger and disease.\"\n\nThe U. has complained about a lack of humanitarian aid access throughout the seven-month-long war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas in Gaza. Guterres has said the UN is trying to avert \"an entirely preventable, human-made famine\" in northern Gaza.\n\nIsrael is retaliating against Hamas over an Oct. 7 attack in which Israel says the militants killed about 1,200 people and took more than 250 people hostage. Gaza health authorities say Israel has killed more than 34,600 people in Gaza since then.\n\nHamas came to power in Gaza in 2006 after Israeli soldiers and settlers withdrew in 2005, but the enclave is still deemed as Israeli-occupied territory by the United Nations.\n\nAs the occupying power, the UN human rights chief has said Israel is obligated to ensure the provision of food and medical care to the population and to facilitate the work of humanitarian organizations trying to deliver aid.", "source": {"uri": "deccanherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deccan Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@deccanherald.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malnutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant\u00f3nio_Guterres", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ant\u00f3nio Guterres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian fedayeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli-occupied territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_occupation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military occupation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://images.deccanherald.com/deccanherald%2Fimport%2Fsites%2Fdh%2Ffiles%2Farticleimages%2F2023%2F06%2F17%2Fun-reuters-1228651-1687017305.jpg?rect=0%2C0%2C1280%2C672&w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538170", "eventUri": "eng-9538170", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1262, "textEnd": 1268}], "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

No other U.S. official has made that assessment.\n\nMs. McCain said that while there has not yet been an official declaration of famine, based on what her organization has seen and experienced on the ground, she believes there is a \"full-blown\" issue in Gaza.\n\n\"It's horror. It's - You know, it's so hard to look at and it's so hard to hear, also,\" McCain said in her interview.\n\nShe went on to say that she is hopeful for a ceasefire in Gaza so that people can begin to be fed \"in a much faster fashion.\" Ms. McCain added that the people in Gaza need \"water, sanitation, medicine - it's all part of the famine -- the famine issue.\"\n\nEfforts to provide food aid to Gaza have been met both by Israeli resistance and ceaseless air strikes.\n\nWorld Central Kitchen, a U.S.-based nonprofit group that has distributed over 43 million meals across Gaza, just resumed operations Monday after seven of its aid workers were killed by an Israeli airstrike on April 1.\n\nEarlier this week, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged the international community to \"do everything possible to avert an entirely preventable human-made famine\".\n\nLack of security is a major obstacle to distributing aid across Gaza, and he stressed that humanitarian convoys, facilities and personnel as well as people in need \"must not be targets\".\n\n\"We welcome aid delivery by air and sea, but there is no alternative to the massive use of land routes,\" he said, before again calling on Israel to allow and facilitate safe, rapid and unimpeded humanitarian access throughout Gaza, including for the UN's Palestine relief agency, UNRWA.\n\nGuterres also addressed how Israeli attacks have \"decimated\" the health system in the enclave, where two thirds of hospitals and health centres are out of commission, while many of those remaining are seriously damaged.\n\n\"Some hospitals now resemble cemeteries,\" he said, voicing deep alarm over reports of the discovery of mass graves at several locations, including at Al-Shifa and Nasser hospitals.\n\nMore than 390 bodies reportedly have been exhumed at Nasser Hospital alone, and \"there are competing narratives around several of these mass graves, including serious allegations that some of those buried were \"unlawfully killed,\" he added.\n\nThe UN chief said it is imperative that independent international forensic investigators are allowed immediate access to these sites to determine the precise circumstances under which hundreds of Palestinians lost their lives and were buried or reburied.\n\n\"The families of the dead and missing have a right to know what happened, and the world has a right to accountability for any violations of international law that may have taken place,\" he said.\n\nThe Secretary-General ended his remarks by drawing attention to UNRWA and its \"irreplaceable and indispensable work\"\u009d supporting millions of Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.\n\n\"UNRWA's presence across the region is a source of hope and stability. Its education, healthcare and other services provide a sense of normality, safety and stability to desperate communities,\" he said.\n\nThe agency recently appealed for $1.2 billion to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and to respond to needs in the West Bank, where violence is rising.\n\nUNRWA largely depends on donors and some 16 countries halted their contributions earlier this year following Israeli allegations that 12 staff were involved in the 7 October attacks. The UN appointed an independent body to review the agency's efforts to ensure the humanitarian principle of neutrality.\n\nThe panel, headed by former French foreign minister Catherine Colonna, recently published its report which found that \"the set of rules and the mechanisms and procedures in place (at UNRWA) are the most elaborate within the UN system\".\n\nGuterres said an action plan is being put in place to implement the report's recommendations, and he appealed for cooperation from donors, host countries and staff.\n\nMeanwhile, most countries that suspended contributions to UNRWA have resumed them, and the Secretary-General said \"we are optimistic that others will join.\" Additionally, some UN Member States have given to the agency for the first time, while private donors have also provided support.\n\nHowever, as a funding gap persists, he urged Member States and donors to pledge generously to ensure the agency's work continues.\n\n\"This is the moment to reaffirm our hope for and contributions to a two-State solution - the only sustainable path to peace and security for Israelis, Palestinians and the wider region,\" he concluded.", "source": {"uri":

McCain explained that \"there is famine -- full-blown famine -- in the north, and it's moving its way south.\"\n\nWelker introduced the conversation when she pointed out that the World Food Programme has so far provided 1.4 people a month since the war began in October 2023. She then asked, \"How dire is the humanitarian crisis on the groud right now in Gaza?\"\n\n\"Whenever you have conflicts like this, and emotions rage high, and things happen in a war, famine happens,\" McCain answered. \"And so what I can explain to you is -- is there is famine -- full-blown famine -- in the north, and it's moving its way south.\"\n\n\"And so what we're asking for and what we've continually asked for is a ceasefire and the ability to have unfettered access to get in -- safe and unfettered access -- to get into Gaza various ports and various gate crossings,\" she continued.\n\n\"But we -- you know, it hasn't always worked that way,\" McCain added. \"It's been a very difficult run and I'm so proud of our people on the ground there because it's dangerous, and they continue to deliver.\"\n\nAfter Welker asked if there has been \"an official declaration\" of famine in northern Gaza, to which McCain responded, \"No, no\" before she added that based on what the organization has seen, famine is the appropriate term.\n\n\"It's horror,\" McCain told Welker. \"It's -- you know, it's so hard to look at and it's so hard to hear, also. So I'm just -- I'm so hoping that we can get a ceasefire and -- and begin to -- to feed these people, especially in the north, in a much faster fashion.\"\n\nPeople in northern Gaza also need more than food, she continued. \"But also including, as I said, water, sanitation, medicine -- it's all part of the famine -- the famine issue, and it's also something we need to make sure the world understands we can't let this happen.\"\n\n\"It just -- in this day and age when... when the world has the ability to feed itself 10 times over, nobody should starve,\" she said. \"Nobody should starve.\"\n\nOn Wednesday Reuters reported that people in northern Gaza are \"suffering an unfolding humanitarian catastrophe.\" At least 34,000 people have died, countless bodies are still buried under rubble, more than 75% of the population has been displaced, and 62% of homes in the Gaza Strip have been destroyed. It is estimated that it could take 14 years to rebuild Gaza.\n\nIn addition to the World Food Programme, the The World Health Organization has said 16-25% of children under 5 years old in Gaza suffer from acute malnutrition.

PHOTO COURTESY OF X.COM\n\nThe Hague, Netherlands (AP) -- The top United Nations court on Thursday ordered Israel to take measures to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza, including opening more land crossings to allow food, water, fuel and other supplies into the war-ravaged enclave.\n\nThe International Court of Justice issued two new so-called provisional measures in a case brought by South Africa accusing Israel of acts of genocide in its military campaign launched after the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas. Israel denies it is committing genocide and accused South Africa of trying to \"undermine Israel's inherent right and obligation to defend its citizens.\"\n\nThursday's order came after South Africa sought more provisional measures, including a cease-fire, citing starvation in Gaza. Israel, which had urged the court not to issue new orders, said it places no limits on aid entering Gaza and vowed to \"promote new initiatives\" to bring in even more assistance.\n\nIn its legally binding order, the court told Israel to take measures \"without delay\" to ensure \"the unhindered provision\" of basic services and humanitarian assistance, including food, water, fuel and medical supplies.\n\nIt also ordered Israel to immediately ensure that its military does not take action that could that could harm Palestinians' rights under the Genocide Convention, including by preventing the delivery of humanitarian assistance.\n\nThe court told Israel to report back in a month on its implementation of the orders.\n\nIsrael declared war in response to a bloody cross-border attack by Hamas on Oct. 7 in which 1,200 people were killed and 250 others were taken hostage. Israel responded with a campaign of airstrikes and a ground offensive that have left over 32,000 Palestinians dead, according to local health authorities.\n\nThe Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza does not differentiate between civilians and combatants, but say roughly two-thirds of the dead are women, children and teens. Israel says over one-third of the dead are militants, though it has not provided evidence to support the claim, and it blames Hamas for civilian casualties because the group operates in residential areas.\n\nThe fighting has displaced over 80% of Gaza's population, caused widespread damage and has sparked a humanitarian crisis. The U.N. and international aid agencies say virtually the entire Gaza population is struggling to get enough food, with hundreds of thousands of people on the brink of famine, especially in hard-hit northern Gaza.\n\nSouth Africa welcomed Thursday's decision, calling it \"significant.\"\n\n\"The fact that Palestinian deaths are not solely caused by bombardment and ground attacks, but also by disease and starvation, indicates a need to protect the group's right to exist,\" the South African president said in a statement.\n\nHamas, an Islamic militant group sworn to Israel's destruction, said the ruling must be enforced by the international community.\n\n\"It must be implemented immediately, so that this decision does not remain a dead letter,\" it said.\n\nThe Palestinian Foreign Ministry thanked South Africa, calling the case \"a vital step in the global effort to hold Israel accountable for perpetrating genocide.\"\n\nAfter initially sealing Gaza's borders in the early days of the war, Israel began to permit entry of humanitarian supplies. It says it places no restrictions on the amount of humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza and accuses the United Nations of failing to properly organize the deliveries. On Tuesday, the army said it inspected 258 aid trucks, but only 116 were distributed within Gaza by the U.N.\n\nThe U.N. and international aid groups say deliveries have been impeded by Israeli military restrictions, ongoing hostilities and the breakdown of public order.\n\nThe Israeli Foreign Ministry accused South Africa of making \"cynical attempts\" to exploit the world court to undermine Israel's right to self-defense and to win the release of remaining hostages. Israel says Hamas continues to hold some 100 hostages and the remains of 30 others either killed on Oct. 7 or who died in captivity.\n\n\"Israel will continue to promote new initiatives, and to expand existing ones, in order to enable and facilitate the flow of aid to the Gaza Strip ... despite the operational challenges on the ground and Hamas' active and abhorrent efforts to commandeer, hoard and steal aid,\" it added.\n\nIsrael has been working with international partners on a plan to soon begin deliveries of aid by sea.\n\nIsrael has repeatedly feuded with the United Nations, particularly UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees and main provider of aid in Gaza. Israel accuses the agency of tolerating and even cooperating with Hamas -- a charge UNRWA denies.\n\nThe court said in its order that \"Palestinians in Gaza are no longer facing only a risk of famine ... but that famine is setting in.\" It cited a report from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs that said at least 31 people, including 27 children, have already died of malnutrition and dehydration.\n\nThe world court said earlier orders imposed on Israel after landmark hearings in South Africa's case \"do not fully address the consequences arising from the changes in the situation\" in Gaza.\n\nCOGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of Palestinian civilian affairs, has also run pilot programs to inspect the humanitarian aid at Israel's main checkpoints in the south and then use land crossings in central Gaza to try to bring aid to the devastated northern part of the Strip. The agency had no immediate comment on the ICJ ruling.", "source": {"uri": "sfltimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South Florida Times: Miami , Broward, Palm Beach, Breaking News & Weather at SFLTimes.com - Home"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@sfltimes.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclave_and_exclave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enclave and exclave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starvation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hague"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genocide Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_South_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of South Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Declaration of war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aid_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aid agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mujahideen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mujahideen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UNRWA"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "http://www.sfltimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/3.13.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538170", "eventUri": "eng-9538170", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 662, "textEnd": 668, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

This testimony served to hasten international efforts to more efficiently get aid into the Strip, such as the Pentagon's Gaza pier project, though it didn't put a halt of the Western weapons flowing to Tel Aviv.\n\nNow, a top UN official has warned the crisis is worse than previously assessed. The head of the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) Cindy McCain is now warning that northern Gaza is in the midst of a \"full-blown famine\".\n\nShe further said that famine is \"moving its way south\" in a new NBC News interview set to air Sunday. She described that this is base on the humanitarian office's assessment on the ground.\n\n\"It's horror. It's so hard to look at and it's so hard to hear,\" McCain told Meet the Press. \"What we are asking for and what we continually ask for is a ceasefire and the ability to have unfettered access, to get in safe through the various ports and gate crossings.\"\n\nBut a ceasefire is unlikely to come for at least a week, given that is how long Israel has just given Hamas to respond in a a fresh ultimatum. \"Israel has informed Egyptian mediators that Hamas has one week to agree to a hostage deal or Tel Aviv will begin the invasion of Rafah,\" AntiWar.com writes. \"The Israeli proposal does not offer a permanent ceasefire, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared the attack on the city will occur with or without the release of hostages.\"\n\nConditions for the civilian population are expected to compound in the south if Israel's military goes through with its planned ground offensive against Rafah.\n\n\"The idea that we will halt the war before achieving all of its goals is out of the question,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyhu told representatives of hostage families this past Tuesday. \"We will enter Rafah and we will eliminate the Hamas battalions there - with or without a deal, in order to achieve the total victory.\"\n\nThe southern city is packed with some 1.5 million people at this point - with most of these being internally displaced refugees. But Israel says that some final key Hamas battalions and commanders are hiding out in the city, embedded within the civilian population, and that there will be no way to root them out except to send in the IDF infantry.\n\nIn her early April testimony, USAID's Power warned that \"Food has not flowed in sufficient quantities to avoid this imminent famine in the south, and these conditions that are giving rise already to child deaths in the north.\"\n\nAid officials have warned that in addition to the likelihood of mass deaths, famine would grow in the south of the Strip as well in the wake of a major Rafah assault. The population is so concentrated there that people would have few or no safe places to which to flee for safety. The US has been leaning on Israel to establish a credible civilian evacuation plan, but it's unclear the degree to which this is being realized.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John McCain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Agency_for_International_Development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Agency for International Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Power", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samantha Power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Food Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet_the_Press", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meet the Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2024-05/rafahfile2.jpg?itok=_jV_wJ1I", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538170", "eventUri": "eng-9538170", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

We support all of that. And we're grateful for this pier that's being built. That's another way to get aid in. But we need more than one pier,\" McCain said. \"I've spoken to Netanyahu myself, and he has reiterated to me several times that it's important, that they want to make sure aid gets in, that these crossings are going to be open and somewhat are open now.

The keynote address at the RSA Conference in San Francisco will outline the strategy, which according to the State Department will highlight \"technology's transformative impact on foreign policy and the U.S. vision towards an innovative, secure, and rights-respecting digital future.\"\n\nBlinken's remarks at 3:50 p.m. Pacific time, or 6:50 p.m. Eastern time, will be livestreamed on the State Department homepage and YouTube channel.\n\nRANSOMWARE ATTACKS UP 74% GLOBALLY: The cyberspace policy comes as Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines warned Congress last week that cyberattacks have become one of the \"most pernicious transnational threats\" facing the nation.\n\n\"We have seen a massive increase in the number of ransomware attacks globally in the last year, which went up as much as 74% in 2023,\" Haines testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee Thursday. \"U.S. entities were the most heavily targeted, with attacks against the healthcare sector roughly doubling what they had been here before.\"\n\n\"Cyber actors are attacking U.S. industrial control systems, which are typically used to automate industrial processes, at record levels. Many critical infrastructure sectors, including water and wastewater, food and agriculture, defense, energy, and transportation, rely on such systems,\" she testified.\n\n\"In virtually all of the attacks we have seen against U.S. critical infrastructure, cyber actors took advantage of default or weak passwords, unpatched known vulnerabilities, and poorly secured network connections to launch relatively simple attacks. And for this reason, it is crucial that all of us, particularly critical infrastructure owners and operators, improve our cybersecurity practices to reduce overall our vulnerability to such efforts.\"\n\nFBI THWARTS CHINESE EFFORT TO PLANT SLEEPER MALWARE ON US ROUTERS TO 'WREAK HAVOC'\n\nALSO TODAY: House meets convenes at noon and then at 2 p.m. is scheduled to consider H.R. 6972, the \"Securing the Chain of Command Continuity Act,\" a bill prompted by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's clumsy attempt to undergo prostate surgery in late December and early January without telling anyone.\n\n\"This bill requires certain notifications whenever a head of an executive branch agency who is a member of the National Security Council (for example, the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Defense) becomes medically incapacitated,\" according to Congress.gov. \"In the event that such an agency head becomes medically incapacitated, the person serving in an acting capacity as the agency head (or, if no person is acting, the first assistant to the office of the agency head) must notify within 24 hours the Executive Office of the President, the Comptroller General, the Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate, and the Speaker and Minority Leader of the House of Representatives.\"\n\nAustin admitted his mistake and apologized in a lengthy Pentagon briefing in February. \"I did not handle this right. I should have told the president about my cancer diagnosis. I take full responsibility,\" Austin said. \"I have apologized directly to President Biden, and I've told him that I'm deeply sorry for not letting him know immediately that I received a heavy diagnosis and was getting treatment.\"\n\nCHAD'S ELECTION: Voters in Chad go to the polls today to select a president, and the United States and France are both watching with intense interest as the outcome could affect the ability of the two nations to maintain counterterrorism troops in West Africa.\n\nThe expected winner is Mahamat Idriss Deby, who seized power in 2021 when his father was shot by rebels, but Western observers are waiting to see if the election could result in Chad emerging from years of military rule.\n\nOne of Deby's most prominent challengers is Succes Masra, described by Reuters as \"a political opponent who spent a year in exile from 2022-2023, then shocked Chadians by agreeing to become Deby's prime minister.\"\n\nLast month, the Pentagon \"temporarily repositioned\" about 100 U.S. troops who were operating out of a French military base in Chad after the Chadian government asked them to leave. \"This is a temporary step as part of an ongoing review of our security cooperation, which will resume after Chad's May 6 presidential election,\" spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said on April 25.\n\nFrance has about 1,000 troops based in Chad.\n\nAS US PULLS TROOPS FROM NIGER AND CHAD, WHAT HAPPENS TO COUNTERTERRORISM?\n\nNOEM'S PROBLEMATIC KIM CLAIM: In her forthcoming book, No Going Back: The Truth On What's Wrong With Politics And How We Move America Forward, Gov. Kristi Noem (R-SD) included a pity anecdote to illustrate her fearlessness in the face of dictators. \"I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. I'm sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants. I have been a children's pastor after all,\" she wrote, a passage she also included when she recorded the audio version of the book.\n\nThe only problem is, apparently, Noem never actually met Kim. \"I have met with many, many world leaders. I have traveled around the world. As soon as it was brought to my attention, we went forward and have made some edits,\" Noem said in a contentious interview on CBS's Face the Nation.\n\nDespite a verbal pummeling by host Margaret Brennan, Noem would never say how the confusion came about or whether she had ever seen the North Korean leader. \"I'm not going to talk about my specific meetings with world leaders. I'm just not going to do that. This anecdote shouldn't have been in the book. And as soon as it was brought to my attention, I made sure that that was adjusted,\" Noem said.\n\nWhen Brennan wouldn't give up on the line of questioning, Noem became frustrated. \"Listen, this is what is so discouraging about politics and the media today, is that we have the White House that just recently came out and confirmed that President Joe Biden has misspoken, has made mistakes, has even outright lied over close to 150 times just this year, and you've done nothing to question him on any of that.\"\n\nAnd inevitably, the discussion moved on to Noem's account of shooting her 14-month-old wirehaired pointer named Cricket.\n\n\"This was a dangerous animal that was killing livestock and attacking people. And I had little children at the time. Our operation had many kids running around and people and interaction with the public. And I made a difficult choice. I think you're a mother, too, and you have little kiddos. Would you make a choice between your children or a dangerous animal? And I think I would ask everybody in the country to put themselves in that situation,\" Noem said in her defense.\n\n\"You say the very first thing you would do if you got to the White House that was different from Joe Biden is you'd make sure Joe Biden's dog was nowhere on the grounds.

World Food Program, Cindy McCain, says northern Gaza is experiencing \"full-blown famine.\"\n\nSpeaking to NBC News on Friday at the McCain Institute's Sedona Forum in Arizona, McCain pressed for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas and access for humanitarian aid because \"there is famine -- full-blown famine -- in the north, and it's moving its way south.\"\n\nThere hasn't yet been an official declaration of famine. The U.N. and others have said the Palestinian territory is on the brink of famine, and the comments from the head of the agency that distributes food assistance go farther than others.\n\nThe nearly seven-month-old Israel-Hamas war has thrown Gaza into humanitarian crisis, and relief workers struggle to bring in desperately needed aid because of the fighting and Israeli restrictions on land crossings.\n\nFacing pressure to ease the catastrophe, the U.S. has pressed its ally Israel to open more land routes. One reopened this week for the first time since the start of the war. The U.S. is also building a pier system off Gaza to bring in aid by sea.\n\nMcCain's comments come as U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Samantha Power pointed Friday to the food crises in Gaza and other parts of the world in announcing a $200 million investment aimed at increasing production of emergency nutritional paste for starving children under 5.\n\nUNITED NATIONS - U.N. humanitarian officials report \"incremental progress\" in restoring water to Gaza, with the territory producing just 20% of the water supply it did before the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7.\n\nThe Palestinian Water Authority announced earlier this week that the Al Muntar water line from Israel has resumed pumping, and U.N. humanitarian officials reported this would benefit four neighborhoods in Gaza City, U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said Friday. The water line, which had been shut down for 200 days, was the third Israeli water line to restart operations and can potentially serve some 300,000 people in Gaza City, he said.\n\nWith much of northern Gaza's population displaced, it's not clear how many people are still living in those neighborhoods, or how badly the water infrastructure has been damaged.\n\nBefore Oct. 7, Gaza normally got its water supplies from a combination of sources, including pipelines from Israel, desalination plants on the Mediterranean Sea, and wells.\n\nThose supplies were slashed when Israel cut off water, along with the fuel and electricity that power water and sewage plants, in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas.\n\nOCHA reports that 83% of groundwater wells are not operating, two out of three main water desalination plants are partially functioning, and 57% of water, sanitation and health facilities in Gaza are damaged or destroyed, Haq said. As of April 30, just 20% of Gaza's pre-Oct. 7 water production is being produced, he said.\n\nThe U.N. earlier reported a breakdown in sanitation services in Gaza and the U.N. humanitarian office estimates there are now 270,000 tons of accumulated solid waste in the territory.\n\nUNITED NATIONS -- The United Nations reports that a U.N. convoy carrying humanitarian aid from Jordan to Gaza had \"a limited amount of goods\" vandalized by Israeli civilians when it went through the West Bank. It was also rerouted by armed men when it entered Gaza to the wrong U.N. facility.\n\nU.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters Friday \"there was a miscommunication\" with the convoy Wednesday and the trucks were ultimately directed to the U.N. World Food Program warehouse in Beit Hanoun.\n\nReferring to Hamas, he said the U.N. has clarified the misunderstanding with \"the de facto authorities in Gaza to ensure that this doesn't happen again.\" They reiterated their commitment to respect the delivery of humanitarian aid, he said.\n\n\"All of the goods have been subsequently accounted for and are being distributed by the U.N.,\" Haq said.\n\nThe U.N. humanitarian office reported that the convoy started in Jordan and entered Gaza \"via back-to-back transfer at Erez crossing, following inspection by Israeli authorities only at Allenby Bridge,\" he said.\n\nThe bridge links Jordan to the West Bank, and Haq said \"Going through the West Bank, Israeli civilians offloaded and vandalized a limited amount of goods from the convoy,\" which included food parcels, sugar, rice, supplementary food for those malnourished and milk powder.\n\nThe U.N. doesn't think the incident should impact further aid deliveries from Jordan, Haq said.\n\nWASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden will host Jordan's King Abdullah II for talks at the White House next week in the midst of the latest push for a cease-fire deal to end the Israel-Hamas war can soon be reached, according to the White House.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre confirmed that the private talks would happen at some point next week but did provide further details.\n\nThe meeting comes as Israel and Hamas were negotiating a potential cease-fire in Gaza and the return of Israeli hostages. A leaked truce proposal hints at compromises by both sides after months of stalemated talks.\n\nBiden last hosted Abdullah, a close ally, for White House talks in February.\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israel said Friday it will seek to reduce economic ties between Turkey and the Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza in retaliation for Turkey's trade ban with Israel over its military actions in Gaza.\n\nForeign Minister Israel Katz said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan \"wants to harm Israel\" with the ban \"but will primarily harm the Palestinian economy.\"\n\nThe Foreign Ministry said it would take \"action to minimize all economic ties between Turkey and the Palestinian Authority and Gaza.\"\n\nIt did not elaborate on how it would do so. Israel controls all entry points into the occupied West Bank, both through its own territory and from neighboring Jordan. It imposes inspections on good entering the West Bank but has imposed a wholesale block on imports, though it did stop all Palestinian exports to Israel for weeks in 2020 during a trade dispute with the Palestinian Authority.\n\nMultiple times in the past, it has withheld customs duties on imports that it collects on behalf of the authority, which controls enclaves around the West Bank. Since the war with Hamas began in October, it has blocked entry to almost all commercial goods to Gaza, except for a trickle of supplies along with international aid entering the territory.\n\nAfter Israel, Turkey is the largest importer to the Palestinian Authority, accounting for about 18% of its imports.\n\nThe ministry said it would also seek sanctions against Turkey at international economic forums for violating trade agreements.\n\n\"The Israeli economy is strong, and the Turkish economy will be much more affected than the Israeli economy due to the trade balance between the countries. It's a mistake Erdogan will regret,\" Katz said.\n\nTurkey imposed the ban on Thursday, suspending all imports and exports to Israel. Erdogan said his country could no longer \"stand by and watch\" the violence in Gaza.\n\nJERUSALEM -- The Israeli military and a support group for the families of Israeli hostages confirmed Friday that Elyakim Libman, a 23-year-old Israeli who had been believed abducted by Hamas, was killed during the militants' Oct. 7 attack. His body was found in Israel.\n\nThe Hostages Families Forum Headquarters said Libman was working as a security guard at a music festival that was attacked by the militants after they stormed out of Gaza. It said he helped evacuate the wounded during the mayhem before being killed.\n\nThe military said it, the police and forensic officials had identified the body after it was found in Israeli territory.\n\nAt least 260 people were killed at the Nova music festival, taking place in an open space near Gaza when Hamas militants rampaged through communities in southern Israel. Some 1,200 people were killed in the attack, and militants took around 250 hostage. Because of the chaos of the day, a few believed taken captive were later determined to be among the dead.\n\nIsrael says Hamas is holding about 100 hostages and the remains of more than 30 others in Gaza, after many were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November. Since the Oct. 7 attack, Israel's bombardment and offensive in Gaza has killed more than 34,500 Palestinians.\n\nCAIRO -- Two Egyptian security officials say CIA director William Burns has arrived in Egypt amid a push to seal a cease-fire accord between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza war.\n\nBurns' visit comes as Hamas is considering the latest proposal for a cease-fire and hostage release put forward by U.S., Egyptian and Qatari mediators, who hope to avert an Israeli offensive against Rafah, Gaza's southernmost town.\n\nHamas said it will send a delegation to Cairo on Saturday for further discussions on the offer, though it has not specified when.\n\nThe two Egyptian officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the press, did not give details on Burns' visit. U.S. officials would not comment on the report.\n\nThe latest proposal reportedly calls for a three-stage cease-fire, starting with a six-week halt in fighting during which Hamas would release a number of hostages it holds, including women and elderly, in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. Talks would then take place on a permanent calm, during which Israel would withdraw troops from Gaza and Hamas would release all the remaining hostages.\n\nAn Egyptian official has said Hamas is seeking firmer language in the text to ensure a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and an end to its offensive and bombardment - as well as the return of Palestinians displaced from the north of the territory.\n\nHamas said in its statement that it has responded in a \"positive spirit\" to the proposal and \"we are going to Cairo in the same spirit to reach an agreement.\"\n\nIt said the group is demanding a \"complete cessation of aggression\" and withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, \"the return of the displaced, relief for our people, the start of reconstruction, and the completion of a serious (hostage for prisoner) exchange deal.\"\n\nHamas is believed to still hold around 100 Israelis in Gaza, as well as the bodies of around 30 others who died in captivity. Israel launched its campaign in Gaza vowing to destroy Hamas after the group's Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel.\n\nBEIRUT -- The Palestinian Prisoner's Club said two Palestinian detainees from Gaza have died in Israeli custody, including a prominent surgeon seized by troops during a raid on a hospital.\n\nThe cause of their deaths was not immediately known. Israeli and Palestinian rights groups have reported harsh conditions in Israeli prisons for the hundreds of Palestinians detained from Gaza, including beatings and medical neglect.\n\nThe Israeli prison authority and army officials had no comment.\n\nThe surgeon, Dr. Adnan al-Borsh, 50, was head of the orthopedic department in Gaza City's Shifa hospital. After an Israeli siege in November crippled Shifa, he worked in nearby al-Awda Hospital, which Israeli troops later stormed, detaining him and others inside in December.\n\nAbdullah al-Zaghari, head of the Palestinian Prisoner's Club, said they were informed by the Palestinian Administrative Affairs office, which coordinates with the Israeli military, that al-Borsh died in Ofer Prison in the West Bank on April 19. He said the body was still being held by Israeli authorities.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean Pierre said she could not speak specifically about the case but that it was \"devastating to hear\" that a doctor was killed.\n\n\"We know humanitarian aid is dire and the innocent people of Gaza, the Palestinian citizens obviously need that care. They need that assistance,\" she said. President Biden \"has said very clearly that when it comes to people -- who are citizens in Gaza providing that all important care, humanitarian aid, they need to be protected.\"\n\nThe body of the second prisoner, 33-year-old Ismail Abdul-Bari Rajab Khodr, was handed over with dozens of released prisoners who were returned to Gaza this week, the Club said. The circumstances of his detention were not immediately known.\n\nThree Palestinian human rights groups -- Addameer, Al Mezan, Al-Haq, and the Palestinian Center for Human Rights -- said in a joint statement that Khodr's body was examined at Rafah's Abu Youssef al-Najjar Hospital. They quoted the hospital's director, Dr. Marwan Al-Hems, saying he died of torture and that marks of torture were found on his wrists as well as swelling in his shoulders, knees and chest. The three groups said others among the prisoners released this week showed signs of abuse.\n\nThe Club said both Khodr and al-Borsh had been tortured, without providing evidence. It said their deaths brought to 18 the number of Palestinians who have died in Israeli prisons since the launch of Israel's offensive in Gaza following Hamas' Oct. 7 attack.\n\nMore than 490 medical workers have been killed in Gaza since the war began, the Palestinian Health Ministry said. Israel has raided multiple hospitals during its campaign in Gaza, claiming Hamas activity inside, often arresting large numbers of staff and displaced people sheltering in the facilities.\n\nISTANBUL -- Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says his country imposed a trade ban on Israel because it could no longer \"stand by and watch\" the violence in Gaza.\n\nTurkey on Thursday announced that it had suspended all imports and exports to Israel over its military actions in Gaza. It said Friday that the ban would stay in place until a permanent cease-fire is achieved and the Israeli government allows all humanitarian aid to reach Gaza without hindrance.\n\n\"Up to now, Israel has killed 40,000 to 45,000 Palestinians without mercy. As Muslims, we could not stand by and watch,\" Erdogan told reporters following traditional Friday prayers in Istanbul.\n\nErdogan said: \"We had a trade volume that had reached 9.5 billion dollars between us. But we closed the door (to trade) as though this trade volume did not exist.\"\n\nThe Turkish leader had faced intense pressure to stop trade ties with Israel and lost some votes in local elections in March to a small Islamist party that had been critical of Turkey's continued commercial relations with Israel.\n\nErdogan again held the United States and other Western nations responsible for deaths in the Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\"The whole West and especially America, are working for Israel by mobilizing all resources and unfortunately the poor people of Palestine were sentenced to death through Israel's bombings,\" he said.\n\nBEIRUT -- The Gaza Health Ministry said Friday the bodies of 26 people killed by Israeli strikes have been brought to local hospitals over the past 24 hours. Hospitals also received 51 wounded, it said in its daily report.\n\nThat brings the overall Palestinian death toll from the Israel-Hamas war to at least 34,622 the ministry said, and 77,867 wounded.\n\nThe Health Ministry does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its tallies, but says that women and children make up around two-thirds of those killed.\n\nThe Israeli military says it has killed 13,000 militants, without providing evidence to back up the claim.\n\nGENEVA -- The United Nations humanitarian aid agency says hundreds of thousands of people would be \"at imminent risk of death\" if Israel carries out a military assault in the southern Gaza city of Rafah.\n\nJens Laerke, spokesperson for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said Rafah has become a crucial humanitarian hub for distribution of aid into Gaza.\n\nRafah is pivotal for food, water, health, sanitation, hygiene and other critical support to the people there, including hundreds of thousands of Gazans who fled fighting elsewhere. But most importantly, Laerke told reporters at a regular U.N. briefing in Geneva, the hundreds of thousands of people there \"would be at imminent risk of death if there is an assault.\"\n\nWorld Health Organization officials said they have been preparing contingency plans for a possible assault in Rafah. They noted, meanwhile, that more food has been reaching beleaguered Palestinians in recent weeks, but the threat of famine remains.\n\nDr. Rik Peeperkorn, the WHO representative for occupied Palestinian areas, said by videoconference that the threat of famine had \"absolutely not\" declined. Dr. Ahmed Dahir, the head of WHO's office in Gaza, said the food situation was fragile, and \"the risk of famine has not passed.\"\n\nTHE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The International Criminal Court's prosecution office issued a statement Friday insisting that \"all attempts to impede, intimidate or improperly influence its officials cease immediately.\"\n\nThe statement did not mention any of its active investigations or elaborate on the nature of attempts to influence its work. The office declined to elaborate further on the statement.\n\nHowever, it came amid speculation that the court could soon issue arrest warrants against Israeli officials. There has been fierce pushback against the global court, including by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said Tuesday that it would be \"an outrage of historic proportions\" if the court issues arrest warrants against Israeli officials.\n\nThe ICC is investigating alleged crimes in the Palestinian territories dating back to the previous war in Gaza in 2014. It has not commented on the status of the probe or whether warrants for any suspects are imminent.\n\nIn the statement posted Friday on the social media platform X, the office of the prosecutor said its independence and impartiality are undermined \"when individuals threaten to retaliate against the Court or against Court personnel should the Office, in fulfilment of its mandate, make decisions about investigations or cases falling within its jurisdiction.\"\n\nNetanyahu has said that Israel \"will never accept any attempt by the ICC to undermine its inherent right of self-defense.\"\n\nISTANBUL -- Turkey's trade minister says a trade ban imposed on Israel will remain in place until a permanent cease-fire is achieved and the Israeli government allows all humanitarian aid to enter Gaza without hindrance.\n\nTurkey, a vocal critic of Israel's military actions in Gaza, announced Thursday that it had suspended all imports and exports to Israel over its ongoing offensive. The move came weeks after the country had announced trade restrictions on a number of items, including aluminum, steel, construction products and chemical fertilizers.\n\nTrade Minister Omer Bolat said Friday that the new measure was in response to \"the deterioration and aggravation of the situation in Rafah\" -- a reference to Gaza's southernmost town.\n\n\"The trade (block) related to Israel will be implemented until a permanent cease-fire is achieved and aid to Gaza is freed in an uninterrupted manner,\" he said.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose ruling party suffered a major setback in local elections in March, was under intense pressure to stop halt trade relations with Israel.\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- An Israeli strike on the city of Rafah on the southern edge of the Gaza Strip killed seven people, including children, hospital officials said Friday.\n\nThe overnight strike on the Chahine family home killed two adults and five kids whose ages ranged between 7 and 16, according to a list of the names released by Abu Youssef al-Najjar Hospital.\n\nThe strike came a day after the militant Palestinian group Hamas said it was sending a delegation to Egypt for further cease-fire talks -- a new sign of progress in attempts by international mediators to hammer out an agreement between Israel and the militant group to end the war in Gaza.\n\nIsrael has regularly carried out airstrikes on Rafah since the start of the war seven months ago and has threatened to send in ground troops, saying Rafah is the last major Hamas stronghold in the coastal enclave. Over 1 million Palestinians have sought refuge in the city on the Egyptian border. The United States and others have urged Israel not to invade, fearing a humanitarian catastrophe.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged Tuesday to launch an incursion into Rafah.\n\nTEL AVIV -- A support group for the families of Israeli hostages taken into Gaza confirmed Friday the death of Dror Or, 49, the 38th hostage known to have died. Or was killed in the Oct. 7 attack and his body taken into Gaza, the Hostages Families Forum said.\n\nOr and two of his children were abducted from Kibbutz Be'eri when Hamas attacked on Oct. 7 and his wife, Yonat, was killed. His children, 17-year-old Noam and 13-year-old Alma, were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November.\n\nIsrael says Hamas is holding about 100 hostages and the remains of more than 30 others. Or's body has not been returned, the Forum said, demanding that the Israeli government \"exhaust every effort\" to bring back his remains as well as all the hostages still in Gaza.\n\nIsrael and Hamas appear to be seriously negotiating an end to the war in Gaza and the return of Israeli hostages. A leaked truce proposal hints at compromises by both sides after months of talks languishing in a stalemate. Hamas said Thursday that it was sending a delegation to Egypt for further cease-fire talks, in a new sign of progress.\n\nSome families worry that Israel's war aims of eliminating Hamas and launching an incursion into Gaza's southern city of Rafah will derail negotiations. Dozens of people demonstrated Thursday night outside Israel's military headquarters in Tel Aviv, demanding a deal to release the hostages.\n\nDuring a meeting with Holocaust survivors in Jerusalem Friday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said \"We are making great efforts. We have already brought back half (the hostages), when people did not believe that we would get anyone back.\"\n\nHe made no specific reference to Or, but said, \"I can tell you that we are determined to return everyone -- the ones who are alive as well as the ones who are dead. We brought back 124 (people) as of today, but there are more. We do not forget anyone.\"\n\nHONOLULU -- United States Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, while at a news conference Thursday in Hawaii, was asked by a reporter what consequences Israel would face from the U.S. if Israel conducted an offensive operation in Rafah without \"appropriately taking into account\" civilians in the area.\n\nAustin said it would be up to President Joe Biden and he wouldn't speculate on that, but that currently, \"conditions are not favorable to any kind of operation.\"\n\n\"What we've highlighted for the Israelis is that it's really important to make sure that the civilians that are in that battle space move out of that battle space before any activity is conducted. And that if and when they return to any kind of operation that it be conducted in a more much more precise fashion,\" Austin said.\n\nHe noted there were about 275,000 people living in and around Rafah before the conflict started but there are now about 1.4 million.\n\n\"That's a lot of people in a very small space. There's a good chance that without taking the right measures that we'll see a lot more civilian casualties going forward. So before anything happens, we certainly want to see them address that threat to the civilians,\" Austin said.\n\n\"Right now, the conditions are not favorable to any kind of operation. And we've been clear about that. It is necessary to take care of the civilian population that's in that area before anything else happens,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "japannews.yomiuri.co.jp", "dataType": "news", "title":

The UN has said the amounts remain insufficient to meet the vast and growing needs of Gaza's starving population.\n\nThe UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification has previously warned that more than 70 percent of Gaza's 2.3 million population is facing \"catastrophic hunger\" any time between mid-March and May.\n\nOn Saturday, Gaza's Ministry of Health said at least 34,654 Palestinians have been killed and 77,908 wounded in Israeli attacks on Gaza since October 7.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Food Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John McCain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_Hamdan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Osama Hamdan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet_the_Press", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meet the Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Health (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Food_Security_Phase_Classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Integrated Food Security Phase Classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli settlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erez_Crossing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erez Crossing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/AA-20240218-33741852-33741827-WARM_MEAL_DISTRIBUTED_TO_DISPLACED_PALESTINIANS_IN_RAFAH-1708262563.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538170", "eventUri": "eng-9538170", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2300, "textEnd": 2309}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

We get an update on conditions among the besieged and starving population of Gaza -- including of children now suffering from the psychological effects of intense and prolonged trauma -- from Walid Masoud, a vascular surgeon and a board member of the Palestine Children's Relief Fund who is just back from heading a medical mission to Gaza.\n\nThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nWe continue to look at the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza as the head of the World Food Programme warns northern Gaza is experiencing a \"full-blown famine,\" with severe starvation quickly spreading to the south, due to Israel's war and total blockade of Gaza. World Food Programme Executive Director Cindy McCain, the widow of the late Senator John McCain, spoke Sunday on NBC News' Meet the Press.\n\nCINDY McCAIN: There is famine, full-blown famine, in the north, and it's moving its way south. And so, with -- what we're asking for and what we've continually asked for is a ceasefire and the ability to have unfettered access to get in -- safe and unfettered access to get into the -- into Gaza.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Human rights groups accuse Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war, a war crime. The Israeli military has repeatedly blocked the entry of vital aid into Gaza, attacked humanitarian aid convoys and killed Palestinian civilians waiting to receive food and other aid. A Palestinian mother in Gaza City described the dire situation.\n\nASMAA AL-BELBASI: [translated] We need food to survive. We need to feed our children. We want to get to this area but can't get there with cars, because the roads are blocked by rubble from the strikes. The sun hits us as we walk. And you find a long queue there from the morning. And you're exhausted by the time you return, all for some bread.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: For more, we go to Amman, Jordan, where we're joined by Dr. Walid Masoud, a vascular surgeon, board member of Palestine Children's Relief Fund. He headed PCRF's medical mission to Gaza earlier this month.\n\nWelcome to Democracy Now!, Doctor. If you can start off by describing what we're seeing, I mean, to have Cindy McCain, the head of the World Food Programme, saying the north is in \"full-blown famine\"? Describe the effects and what this means for the people who are surviving in Palestine, Gaza.\n\nDR. WALID MASOUD: Good morning, first of all. Good morning, America.\n\nFirst of all, let me say about PCRF that our mission is to provide medical and humanitarian relief for the children throughout the Levant, regardless their nationalities or religion. We headed to Gaza under the umbrella of PCRF and the umbrella of WHO. OK? We had one lecture in the WHO in Cairo telling us about the safety measures, what we are going to meet in Rafah.\n\nOnce we entered there, the moment we entered there, we could see the children around us begging for food, begging for money, begging for anything. OK? The starvation, you could see it in everywhere in the hospital. We were based in the European Hospital. And in the buildings of the hospitals, it was full of refugees. More than 50,000 refugees came from the north to this hospital, because they feel it is safe. It's not only in the territory around the hospital, but inside the hospital, inside the corridors, in the stairs, every room, they had refugees.\n\nWhile we were walking in the corridors, you could see the children around, and you could see by their eyes how they underfed and they have malnutrition and they are starving. You could see how they lost the muscle mass. You could see the skin. You could see how they fatigue. You could see how they are depressed, actually. When you talk to them, they are slow, slow motion in talking. OK? You can see the loss of the weight on these children. In the theaters, when we operate upon children, we could see how their body mass index is low, and we could see they are not oriented, actually, most of the patients upon which we operated. This reflects this decreased immunity of the children and increased rate of the infection, because there is not enough proteins in their body to initiate or to make the immunity system in the right way.\n\nWe had to operate immediately as emergency on many injured patients, not only children but also adults. Starvation does not only with the children. It was everyone in the population. Imagine you have 1.8 million in Rafah, and there is not enough food for these. If there is food, you cannot even reach it, because transportations is dangerous. You could see how is the World Kitchen being bombed and killed there. What about the locals? If the foreigners died from bombarding their cars, what about the locals?\n\nYou can imagine how 1.8 million, they don't have enough hospitals. Only three proper hospitals is working in Rafah. We operated in Rafah only, but some of our surgeons went to Al-Kuwaiti Hospital, because they could not transfer the kids to the European Hospital. One of our surgeons, pediatric surgeons, went to the Al-Kuwaiti Hospital and performed 16 surgeries. Totally, we operated around 250 or 275 and more. The situation was very bad in the theater.\n\nThe staff, if we talk about the staff, the staff are exhausted, the staff depressed, the staff disoriented. All the staff in the theaters and in the wards in the hospital, they are volunteers, actually. They don't receive salaries. Do you know what they receive? They are volunteers working, no money, but they receive only the lunch. And this lunch, they eat a little bit. Maybe they eat 10% of their lunch, in order to take the lunch to the tents to their families, because they don't have money to buy anything. And if they have money, there is not enough food in the market.\n\nWe operated upon children who've been injured around five, six months ago. We had a patient, 13-years-old patient. I sent you his video. He had shrapnels behind the knee, and he developed a fistula between the artery and the vein. So, because of that, his foot and leg became ischemic, not enough blood, and it began a gangrene in his toes. So, we did such an operation. This patient had a referral letter to go to Egypt for treatment, but he could not, because there is a queue. Maybe it will take him 10 months just to his chance to go to Egypt. We did the operation. We disconnected the fistula. And he is OK. But you could tell how his muscles are weak and there is a loss of muscle bulk with him. His wounds -- we followed him a few days after that. His wounds is not healing well because of the lack of proteins in his body, lack of minerals, lack of vitamins in his body. There is not enough food even in the hospital to give them IV fluids or IV nutrients.\n\nMany patients died from infection because they don't have enough immunity. They don't have enough antibiotics or proper antibiotics, because sometimes they have the basics of the antibiotics. We managed to bring many medications, many antibiotics, other things, but it's not that enough. When a mission comes, they bring some, but it's not enough for 1.8 million people there. And there is, as you said earlier, above 78,000 injured patients.\n\nOur mission was depressing to us from inside, but we were happy to give what we can do to them. There were many things which disturbed us. We could work in an environment which is unsuitable. OK? Example, these drones all the time have noisy, noise, voices, like zzzzz. They called it zanana. First three days, in our team, they could not sleep because of these drones and zanana and these noises. And it is 24 hours there. The staff is exhausted and depressed. When we came, we were seven surgeons from Jordan and one nurse also from Jordan. We had two from Ireland. We have one from Germany and one from United States. All of them, we gathered them. We could not eat full food, because we feel we are guilty once we are eating. And outside, there is a lot of children begging for food, and families, maybe they don't eat at all or they eat one time a day.\n\nMany surgeries were done, major surgeries, which means that this patient should have well feeding, IV or something, in order his wounds to heal. We managed to help patients, but in some situations it is out of our hands to continue. OK, I managed, for example, to reoperate the lab cath -- the cath lab, so we can do some surgeries with intervention, interventional radiology. This cath lab was out of work for more than seven months. We managed to start working on this. We did many surgeries and, the patients, discharged them home.\n\nThis is another point. When we did surgery, patient went to discharge. The patient said, \"Where I am going? I don't have any home. I don't have even tent to go.\" So, many patients stay in the hospital so they can have a home, shelter. They can have food also.\n\nWe managed -- also they have dialysis machines, which is out of work for the last seven, eight months in the European Hospital. We managed, with the help of one of the biomedical engineers who came from Jordan, Dr. Samadi, we managed to fix up these two machines, and we reopened the dialysis unit there. We tried to bring some medicine, some instruments, some tools, equipment to be used for the patients there, but that was not enough.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Doctor -- Dr. Masoud, there's a delay, but I just wanted to end by saying that we are seeing nonstop breaking news on Twitter now. For example, The New Yorker contributor Mosab Abu Toha says the Israeli army is starting to blow up complete neighborhoods in East Rafah, just four hours after ordering families to evacuate the area. And I wanted to end -- we just have 30 seconds -- because you work with Palestine Children's Relief, with your observation that increasingly children are expressing suicidal thoughts. We have 30 seconds.\n\nDR. WALID MASOUD: Unfortunately, I had two patients -- one patient and his sister -- they were around 8 and 7 years. They were questioning me when I was in the round, \"Why I am still alive while my wife -- my mother and father and brothers died?\" The children there, they started to think about suicidal attempts. And we have another patient who lost their legs and lost all the family, and she's bedridden. And she tried to attempt suicide.\n\nChildren, I cannot imagine how they will grow, these children, in the future, while they were thinking about suicidal attempt because their family has died. Unfortunately, many children thinking about this. I cannot imagine in the future how they will act and how they will look to the world and to the peace. Imagine what's happening. Each family has lost many of their main supporter as father or mother. This creates a psychiatric situation with these children.\n\nI think as they need surgeons to be there, they need psychiatrists in order to treat these patients. There's a need, definitely a need, because the increase of the, let us say, not suicide, because I did not see any suicidal attempts, but I heard from many children they are thinking about suicide. Unfortunately, the help now is going through vascular surgeon, orthopedic surgeon, etc. I think we need to send more doctors there. Unfortunately, the borders now is closed.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Dr. Walid Masoud, we're going to have to leave it there as we go to the students who are protesting across the United States. I want to thank you so much for joining us from Amman, Jordan, just back from Gaza, vascular surgeon and board member of the Palestine Children's Relief Fund.\n\nComing up, the protests at University of Michigan graduation, at State University of New York, New Paltz, and more.

US Democratic lawmakers said in a letter to President Joe Biden that they believe there is sufficient evidence to prove that Israel violated US law by restricting the flow of humanitarian aid to the besieged Gaza Strip.\n\nIn the letter, signed by 86 House Democrats, the lawmakers pointed to Israel's restrictions on aid and its failure to respond to repeated demands to open enough sea and land routes to deliver aid to the population of the Gaza Strip, to respect international humanitarian law, and to allow the free flow of aid.\n\nThere are reports that Israel has not allowed in enough food to avoid famine, and has imposed a system of inspections and arbitrary restrictions on aid, hampering supplies, lawmakers said.\n\nBiden issued a national security memo in February requiring written guarantees after Democratic lawmakers began questioning Israel's compliance with international law in its operations in Gaza.\n\nThe memo, issued by Biden in February, requires Secretary of State Antony Blinken to report to Congress by Wednesday on whether there are credible assurances from Israel that its use of U.S. weapons complies with international law.\n\nAt least four State Department offices told Secretary Blinken last month that they found the (Israeli) assertions \"neither credible nor reliable.\"\n\nAccording to a report issued by the Ministry of State for Relief Affairs on the humanitarian situation in Gaza as a result of the aggression of the Zionist enemy since the seventh of last October, until the twenty-fourth of April, 265,000 citizens face a crisis of medium levels of food insecurity, 854,000 citizens face emergency levels of food insecurity, and 1.1 million people face catastrophic levels of food insecurity.\n\nShe pointed out that 28 children died due to malnutrition and dehydration, and that 31% of children under the age of two in northern Gaza suffer from acute malnutrition, and 10% of children under the age of two in Rafah suffer from acute malnutrition.\n\nThe Zionist enemy forces continue their aggression by land, sea and air on the Gaza Strip since the seventh of last October, resulting in the death of 34,622 citizens, most of them women and children, and the injury of more than 77,867 others, while thousands of victims are still under the rubble and in the roads and ambulance and rescue crews cannot reach them.\n\nAl-hamadani", "source": {"uri": "saba.ye", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u0633\u0628\u0623\u0646\u062a -

There are two crossings set up for aid delivery in northern Gaza and two in the south, with over 350 trucks entering Gaza daily.\n\nAdditionally, four bakeries run by the WFP in northern Gaza have been producing 2.2 million pitas daily.

He additionally claimed that there has recently been an increase in \"the denial of humanitarian access and attacks on humanitarian workers and convoys.\"\n\nThe UN agency's chief said that, in the past two weeks, there were ten incidents involving \"shooting at convoys, arrests of UN staff including bullying, stripping them naked, threats with arms, and long delays at checkpoints forcing convoys to move during the dark or abort.\"\n\nAt the end of his statement, Lazzarini noted that \"Palestinian armed groups\" launched rockets toward the Kerem Shalom crossing, causing its closure.\n\n\"I demand an independent investigation and accountability for the blatant disregard of humanitarian workers, operations, and facilities, all protected under international law,\" said the agency's chief. \"To do otherwise would set a dangerous precedent and compromise humanitarian work worldwide.\"\n\n\"I call on the Israeli Authorities to facilitate humanitarian access across the Gaza Strip, including to the north. I also call on Hamas and other armed groups to stop any attacks on humanitarian crossings, refrain from aid diversion, and make sure assistance reaches all those in need. The denial of humanitarian access is a violation of humanitarian law,\" concluded Lazzarini.\n\nAccording to data from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), 8,756 trucks carrying just food entered the Gaza Strip from January to March of this year, with an average of about 127 trucks entering the Strip each day in March. Another 1,310 trucks entered Gaza from January to March carrying other supplies.\n\nIn comparison, last March, about 84 trucks carrying food supplies entered the Strip each day, meaning there was a 50% increase in the entry of food trucks to Gaza in March 2024 compared to March 2023.\n\nAdditionally, OCHA reported that from April 1-30, 52 humanitarian aid missions to northern Gaza were facilitated by Israeli authorities, nine were denied, 25 were impeded (delayed temporarily due to various issues including active combat zones), and eight were cancelled due to logistical constraints.\n\nAccording to that data, 55% of UN missions to northern Gaza were facilitated without any issues and 26% were temporarily impeded but still got through eventually, meaning 81% of UN aid missions were facilitated to northern Gaza and about 10% were blocked by Israel.\n\nIn addition, 147 aid missions to southern Gaza were facilitated by Israeli authorities, 19 were denied, six were impeded, and 13 were cancelled.", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

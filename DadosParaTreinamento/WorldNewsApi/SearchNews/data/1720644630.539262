{"id": 231232068, "title": "John Ruddy reveals brutally honest message to Wayne Rooney - and what he wishes he had done", "text": "John Ruddy has revealed he told Wayne Rooney that Birmingham City weren\u2019t good enough to play \u2018no fear\u2019 football after his second game in charge. Rooney\u2019s second match was memorable for all the wrong reasons. A hapless Blues were comfortably beaten by Hull City and the manager was booed off on his St Andrew\u2019s debut. Rooney revealed after that match that some players had suggested they weren\u2019t comfortable playing his style of football, after 15 months working under his predecessor John Eustace, and promised to make changes. Those tweaks didn\u2019t result in improvements, though, and Rooney was fired in January after nine defeats in 15 matches. Opening up on that managerial change in an appearance on Ben Foster\u2019s podcast The Fozcast, Ruddy said: \u201cIt was completely different. What John had done over that year and a bit was build a squad that he knew could be competitive, physically, and be able to get around the pitch.

We went to Peterborough in pre-season and tried to play football and we were 3-0 down in 20 minutes. John quickly realised that we needed solid foundations. If you have the base of a good defence and have pace and quality going forwards, and that\u2019s what we had, we had a good balance. \u201cThe club put out this \u2018no fear\u2019 brand of football \u2013 I\u2019ve got no idea what that means and I still don\u2019t \u2013 and Wayne came in and tried to implement a style of play that was more possession-based with the same players. \u201cAfter the second game, we played Hull at home in midweek and lost 2-0, I said, \u2018We\u2019re not where you need us to be at this moment. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re good enough at this moment in time to play your style of football. If you work on it every day then I have no doubt we will be.\u2019 It was going to take a lot of work and nailing down specific roles and information for every individual and I don\u2019t think we did enough of it, personally.\u201d Rooney \u2013 who recently returned to management at Plymouth Argyle \u2013 presents himself differently on the touchline to how he did during his illustrious playing career. There were, however, occasions when Ruddy felt Rooney\u2019s fiery side was needed. The goalkeeper added: \u201cHe was the complete opposite and he alluded to it in a couple of meetings that he realised he was too hot-headed as a player, and when he stepped into management he made sure he was more conscious and precise in the way he delivered information. I think there was a couple of times when he should have lost his head. He tried to remain calm and be true to his demeanour that he wants people to perceive him as a manager.\u201d", "summary": "John Ruddy was part of the Birmingham City squad Wayne Rooney inherited when he replaced John Eustace in October last year", "url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-ruddy-wayne-rooney-29317817", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article29317849.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_escenic-31.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:02:23", "author": "Alex Dicken", "authors": ["Alex Dicken"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.053}

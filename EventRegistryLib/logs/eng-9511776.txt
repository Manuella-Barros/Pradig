family are selling the NHS fundraiser's \u00a32.25m mansion less than three months after they were ordered to tear down an unauthorised spa on its grounds.\n\nThe seven-bedroom home owned by Hannah Ingram-Moore, 53, and her husband Colin, 66, is where Second World War veteran Captain Tom completed 100 laps of the garden to raise \u00a338.9m for the NHS during the first Covid lockdown in 2020.\n\nThe Grade II-listed Old Rectory, which is being marketed by estate agents Fine & Country, is described in the sale listing as a \"magnificent seven-bedroom property\".\n\nIn a video tour of the house, a sculpture of Captain Tom with his walking frame is seen in the hallway of the main house.\n\nAn owner's statement on Rightmove reads: \"A particularly special memory of our time here is of my father walking 100 laps of the garden to raise a record-breaking sum of almost \u00a340m for NHS charities during the pandemic.\"\n\nThe listing adds: \"The property is owned by the family of Captain Sir Tom Moore who spent his final years there raising money for the NHS during the Covid pandemic.\"\n\nA photograph of the fundraising hero being knighted by the Queen is also seen displayed on a wall in the separate coach house building within the house's grounds, which is currently being used as a gym and offices.\n\nCaptain Tom completed his charity challenge before his 100th birthday in April 2020.\n\nHe was knighted by the late Queen during a unique open-air ceremony at Windsor Castle in the summer of that year.\n\nThe Charity Commission opened a case into the Captain Tom Foundation shortly after his death in 2021 and launched an inquiry in June 2022 amid concerns about its management and independence from Captain Tom's family.\n\nScott Stemp, representing Ms Ingram-Moore and her husband, said last year that the foundation \"is to be closed down following an investigation by the Charity Commission\".\n\nHe was speaking at an appeal hearing over an unauthorised spa pool block in the grounds of the property, which was flattened in February of this year.\n\nInspector Diane Fleming had ruled in November that the spa block must be demolished within three months by February 7.\n\nThe sale listing said that the 18th Century Old Rectory boasts four bathrooms, four reception rooms and is set within 3.5 acres of land, with a standalone coach house.\n\nAn agent's note states that, prior to viewing the property, any interested parties will be required to \"provide proof of financial ability to proceed with the purchase\".", "source":

The block was demolished in February this year following the orders of an inspector, Diane Fleming, in November.\n\nThe sale listing said the 18th-century Old Rectory has four bathrooms, four reception rooms and is set in 3.5 acres of land, with a standalone coach house.\n\nAn agent's note states that, before viewing the property, any interested parties will have to \"provide proof of financial ability to proceed with the purchase\".", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_weaver@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Matthew Weaver", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Tom_Moore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain Tom Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(British_Army_and_Royal_Marines)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedfordshire", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bedfordshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bedfordshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_(mobility)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Walker (mobility)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_pool", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Swimming pool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lockdowns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marston_Moreteyne", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marston Moreteyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Marston Moreteyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Bachelor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knight Bachelor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veteran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estate_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Estate agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conflict of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charity_Commission_for_England_and_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charity Commission for England and Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clergy house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listed_building", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Listed building"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor_Castle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Windsor Castle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Partition of India"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Swimming_Pools_and_Spas", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Swimming Pools and Spas", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Charitable_Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Charitable Gambling", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Real_Estate", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Real Estate", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511776", "eventUri": "eng-9511776", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-04-", "textStart": 1394, "textEnd": 1404}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

Pictured: The family home (left) and unauthorised spa (right) before it was demolished in January\n\nA bust of the late lockdown charity fundraiser can be seen in the Rightmove advert to sell the family's \u00a32.25million home\n\nThe 'owner's statement' for the house reads: 'A particularly special memory of our time here is of my father walking 100 laps of the garden to raise a record-breaking sum of almost \u00a340million for NHS charities during the pandemic.\n\n'The property is owned by the family of Captain Sir Tom Moore who spent his final years there raising money for the NHS during the Covid pandemic.'\n\nThe house boasts four bathrooms, four reception rooms and is set in 3.5 acres with a stand alone Coach House.\n\nPotential buyers will have to provide ID, proof of wealth and sign NDAs before visiting the property.\n\nThe unauthorised spa was torn down in January this year. Pictured: Demolishers knocking down the building\n\nHannah Ingram-Moore pictured with her lockdown hero father Captain Toom in April 2020\n\nThe owner description continues: 'It was the opportunity for multigenerational living that first drew us to this property.\n\n'We were living in Surrey, my elderly father was in Kent, and we were setting up our own business needing access to London, so we drew a circle on the map to determine how far we were willing to move.\n\n'Initially, we were looking for a house for us and our young family, and another nearby for my father, but when we found The Rectory with its own Coach House in the grounds, we increasingly liked the idea of all living together.\n\n'As the Coach House was in use as a B&B, my father ended up living with us in the main house, which with its 7 bedrooms including two master suites is more than big enough!\n\n'In the years since, it has been wonderful to see young and old thrive in a family home where everyone has their own space.'\n\nThe bust of Captain Tom Moore is being used in promotional pictures to sell the family's \u00a32.25million home\n\nThe home also included a controversial L-shaped spa complex that had to be taken down in February of this year.\n\nIn August 2021, the Ingram-Moores were granted permission for a Captain Tom Foundation Building in the grounds of their home to support its charitable objectives.\n\nThe building was given the green light, but Central Bedfordshire Council refused a subsequent retrospective application in 2022 for a larger C-shaped building containing a spa pool.\n\nThe demolition work was carried out on February 7, after the family lost an appeal against Central Bedfordshire Council to keep the complex after a planning inspector ruled it was 'at odds' with their Grade ll-listed home.\n\nBefore it was taken down, the Ingram-Moore's were seen packing away Sir Tom's legacy in boxes with photos of the war hero at Windsor Castle and his Sports Personality of the Year and Guinness World Record awards removed from the complex.\n\nMs Ingram Moore also faced a probe into payments made through her family company for appearances linked to her late father's charity in August 2023.\n\nShe reportedly attended and judged awards ceremonies in 2021 and 2022 as interim chief executive of the Captain Tom Foundation, but had payments for the appearances made to her company, Maytrix Group.\n\nIn an interview with Piers Morgan on TalkTV in October, she admitted to keeping \u00a3800,000 from books that the late army veteran had written.\n\nShe said the family kept the sum from three books because Captain Tom had wanted them to retain the profits.\n\nWorld War Two veteran Captain Tom was knighted by the late Queen for walking 100 laps around the garden of the house during the Covid pandemic in 2020, raising \u00a338million for NHS charities.\n\nHe died on February 2, 2001, at the age of 100, with Buckingham Palace

Now, the family appear to be cashing in on the beloved war veteran by using his fundraising achievements during the Coronavirus pandemic to push the sale in their property listing.\n\nDuring a difficult time for the nation, Captain Tom's actions reflected the efforts that many showed to help their local communities. But in the aftermath, his daughter made headlines for the wrong reasons, including raking in a handsome salary as CEO of his namesake charity, and claiming his awards for herself - with her charity now under investigation.\n\nThe family home, complete with 7 bedrooms and its own gym, is up for sale for \u00a32.25m\n\nThe 'owner's statement' on the property listing reads: \"A particularly special memory of our time here is of my father walking 100 laps of the garden to raise a record-breaking sum of almost \u00a340million for NHS charities during the pandemic.\" The brochure adds: \"The property is owned by the family of Captain Sir Tom Moore who spent his final years there raising money for the NHS during the Covid pandemic.\"\n\nPhotos posted on Rightmove show a bust of Tom on full display, while other snaps show a bottle of champagne yards from the site where an illegal indoor pool in a building named after Captain Tom was built.\n\nIt comes after neighbours expressed their rage over the family name being tarnished. Tom moved the nation when he raised \u00a339m from a sponsored walk in the garden of the property. He died on 2 February, 2021, aged 100 after being admitted to hospital with Covid-19 and pneumonia.\n\nThe Ingram-Moores have since come under fire for a charity probe over payments made to the couple from the Captain Tom charity they ran with donations. In October last year, Mrs Ingram-Moore admitted to Piers Morgan on TalkTV that the family had kept \u00a3800,000 book profits from former soldier Capt Tom.\n\nThe family have now mentioned in the property brochure that they have a moat packed with koi carp, and insist viewers provide ID, proof of wealth and sign NDAs before visiting the property.\n\nCaptain Tom raised almost \u00a340million for NHS charities during the pandemic Hannah has previously come under fire for raking in a handsome salary as CEO of her father's namsake charity\n\nThe owner description also reads: \"It was the opportunity for multigenerational living that first drew us to this property. We were living in Surrey, my elderly father was in Kent, and we were setting up our own business needing access to London, so we drew a circle on the map to determine how far we were willing to move.\n\n\"Initially, we were looking for a house for us and our young family, and another nearby for my father, but when we found The Rectory with its own Coach House in the grounds, we increasingly liked the idea of all living together. As the Coach House was in use as a B&B, my father ended up living with us in the main house, which with its 7 bedrooms including two master suites is more than big enough! In the years since, it has been wonderful to see young and old thrive in a family home where everyone has their own space.\"\n\nHannah Ingram-Moore has been contacted for comment.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zahra_khaliq@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Zahra Khaliq", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(British_Army_and_Royal_Marines)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Veteran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Tom_Moore", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain Tom Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marston_Moreteyne", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marston Moreteyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Marston Moreteyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedfordshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bedfordshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bedfordshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bust_(sculpture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bust (sculpture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TalkTV_(British_TV_channel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TalkTV (British TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed_and_breakfast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bed and breakfast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Koi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Piers Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pneumonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kent"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kent"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large_Families", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large Families", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32667814.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Moore-split.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511776", "eventUri": "eng-9511776", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

listed for sale for \u00a32.25 million", "body": "It comes less than three months after the demolition of an unauthorised spa pool block in the grounds of the property in Marston Moretaine, Bedfordshire.\n\nThe Grade II-listed Old Rectory, which is being marketed by estate agents Fine & Country, is described in the sale listing as a \"magnificent seven-bedroom property\".\n\nIn a video tour of the house, a sculpture of Captain Tom with his walking frame is seen in the hallway of the main house.\n\nA photograph of the fundraising hero being knighted by the Queen is seen displayed on a wall in the separate coach house building within the house's grounds, which is currently being used as a gym and offices.\n\nIntroducing the property, an estate agent says in the tour video: \"I'm sure you'll recognise this iconic and very famous driveway behind me as it was home to the late Captain Sir Tom Moore who walked 100 laps of his garden raising over \u00a337 million for NHS charities.\"\n\nWorld War Two veteran Captain Tom, who raised \u00a338.9 million for the NHS, including gift aid, completed his charity challenge before his 100th birthday in April 2020.\n\nHe was knighted by the late Queen during a unique open-air ceremony at Windsor Castle in the summer of that year.\n\nThe Charity Commission opened a case into the Captain Tom Foundation shortly after his death in 2021 and launched an inquiry in June 2022.\n\nIt came amid concerns about its management and independence from Captain Tom's family.\n\nScott Stemp, representing Captain Tom's daughter Hannah Ingram-Moore and her husband, said last year that the foundation \"is to be closed down following an investigation by the Charity Commission\".\n\nHe was speaking at an appeal hearing over an unauthorised spa pool block in the grounds of the property, which was flattened in February of this year.\n\nInspector Diane Fleming had ruled in November that the spa block must be demolished within three months by February 7.\n\nThe sale listing said that the 18th Century Old Rectory boasts four bathrooms, four reception rooms and is set within 3.5 acres of land, with a standalone coach house.\n\nAn agent's note states that, prior to viewing the property, any interested parties will be required to \"provide proof of financial ability to proceed with the purchase\".", "source":

despite promotional videos suggesting she was representing the charity.\n\nThe Charity Commission began investigating possible conflicts of interest between the Ingram-Moore's private companies and the charity in November 2022. At the time, the family did not respond to the claims.\n\nIn an interview with Piers Morgan on TalkTV in October 2023, Ms Ingram Moore admitted to keeping \u00a3800,000 from books that the late army veteran had written.\n\nShe said the family kept the sum from three books because Captain Tom had wanted them to retain the profits.\n\nWorld War Two veteran Captain Tom was knighted by the late Queen for walking 100 laps around the garden of the house during the Covid pandemic in 2020, raising \u00a338million for NHS charities.\n\nHe died on February 2, 2001, at the age of 100, with Buckingham Palace announcing the Queen had sent the family a 'private message of condolence'", "source": {"uri": "todayheadline.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "TodayHeadline"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nCaptain Tom's daughter has used his name in a brochure to help sell the family home in Bedfordshire, which is currently listed for \u00a32.25m.\n\nHannah Ingram-Moore and her husband Colin have recently listed the Grade II seven-bedroom property in Rightmove, just months after they were forced to tear down an unauthorised spa building.\n\nAmong the many pictures of the property is one of the hallway, which features a large bust of the war veteran, which commemorates the 100 laps he walked around his garden to raise money for the NHS.\n\nIn a statement from the owner that is included in the brochure, Ms Ingram-Moore says: \"A particularly special memory of our time here is of my father walking 100 laps of the garden to raise a record-breaking sum of almost \u00a340million for NHS charities during the pandemic!\".\n\nWithin the brochure, it adds: \"The property is owned by the family of Captain Sir Tom Moore who spent his final years there raising money for the NHS during the Covid pandemic.\"\n\nThe property in Marston Moretaine boasts four bathrooms, four reception rooms and comes with a stand alone coach house.\n\nWhile Captain Tom received a knighthood for his charitable efforts for the NHS, his family have since become embroiled in controversy after an investigation was launched into the charity established in his memory.\n\nIn February 2022, the Charity Commission announced it would be reviewing the accounts, after it emerged that the foundation had given grants of \u00a3160,000 to four charities but paid more than \u00a3162,000 in management costs.\n\nDuring an interview with TalkTV's Piers Morgan Uncensored in October 2023, his daughter tearfully admitted that the family kept the profits from three books that Captain Tom had written, which amounted to an estimated \u00a3800,000.\n\nThis was despite a prologue in his autobiography 'Tomorrow will be a Good Day' stating that the opportunity to write the memoir gave him \"the chance to raise even more money\" for his foundation.\n\nShe also revealed that she was paid \u00a318,000 to attend the Captain Tom awards but only donated \u00a32,000 of that sum to charity.\n\nSince July last year, the foundation is not actively seeking donations or making payments and is co-operating with the inquiry.\n\nThe controversy escalated further after Ms Ingram-Moore and her husband were ordered to knock down an unauthorised building that was being used as a home spa.\n\nThe U-shaped building received planning permission from the Captain Tom Foundation in August 2021, with revised plans submitted in February 2022, which included the construction of a spa pool, toilets and a kitchen.\n\nThese were rejected by Central Bedfordshire Council, with an appeal dismissed and the building was demolished earlier this year.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors":

spa demolished", "body": "Sir Captain Tom Moore's family home where he raised millions for the NHS has been put on sale following a planning row which forced the veteran's daughter to demolish a spa building on the property.\n\nThe Old Rectory in Marston Moretaine, Bedfordshire, where Sir Tom walked 100 laps of the garden to raise money for NHS Charities Together in 2020, is now on the market for \u00a32.25 million.\n\nThe 3.5 acre site boasts seven bedrooms and four bathrooms, being described by Birmingham-based estate agents Fine & Country as a historic rectory and coach house with semi-moated gardens.\n\nThe property's advertisement includes multiple references to the Army veteran in an attempt to entice buyers, with pictures of the house's hallway showing a statue of Sir Tom with his walking frame.\n\nHe lived at the Bedfordshire property with his daughter, Hannah Ingram-Moore, 53, and her family, who came under fire last year for the construction of an unauthorised building on the land of the Grade II-listed home.\n\nThe advertisement brochure describes the home as \"owned by the family of Captain Sir Tom Moore who spent his final years there raising money for the NHS during the Covid pandemic\".\n\nMs Ingram-Moore also gave insight into the property, adding: \"It is a playground for young and old alike: a particularly special memory of our time here is of my father walking 100 laps of the garden to raise a record-breaking sum of almost \u00a340 million for NHS charities during the pandemic!\"\n\nApplicants, however, will need to provide identification for all those wishing to view the property and sign a confidentiality agreement in advance.\n\nProspective buyers will be able to review the remains of the Captain Tom Foundation Building, which was demolished in February after workers were seen dismantling the building's roof and knocking down brick walls.\n\nIt comes after Ms Ingram-Moore and her husband, Colin, lost an appeal against an order to remove the building after claiming the spa pool, gym and office complex was meant to help rehabilitate elderly people.\n\nCentral Bedfordshire Council had granted planning permission for an L-shaped building in the grounds of the Old Rectory but refused a retrospective application in 2022 for a larger C-shaped spa building.\n\nDiane Fleming, the inspector, told the October 2023 hearing that the \"scale and massing\" of the building had resulted in harm to the Grade II-listed property.\n\nThe Captain Tom Foundation was shut down in October 2023 after becoming the subject of an investigation by the Charity Commission amid concerns over its management and independence from Sir Tom's family in the midst of the planning row.\n\nSir Tom was knighted by the late Queen in summer 2020 after raising nearly \u00a340 million for the NHS at the height of the first national Covid-19 lockdown before his death in February 2021.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType":

Not many people have time for them after the way they have behaved by putting up the illegal sauna and all the antics with Captain Tom's book and the charity.\n\n'Mind you I can't see her being welcome anywhere else. They have tarnished Captain Tom's reputation.'\n\nAnother resident said: 'Everybody is talking about it. I can't see anyone paying all that money for it. They are trying to exploit Captain Tom's reputation.'\n\nIn August 2021, the Ingram-Moores were granted permission for a Captain Tom Foundation Building in the grounds of their home to support its charitable objectives.\n\nThe extension was called the Captain Tom Building in the plans, but it soon became apparent that the structure taking shape bore little resemblance to the one that had been sanctioned.\n\nFollowing complaints from locals, a site visit was undertaken in March 2022, but the planning officer reported that the 'windows were covered and access to the inside of the building was not possible'.\n\nCentral Bedfordshire Council refused a subsequent retrospective application in 2022 for a larger C-shaped building containing a spa pool.\n\nIn November planning inspector Diane Fleming gave the Ingram-Moores three months to demolish the unauthorised complex which was 'at odds' with the listed building. It was then torn down in February.\n\nThe unauthorised spa was torn down in January this year.

I think she was given bad advice.'\n\nThree signs have been put up on fences around the property warning against drones being flown over.\n\nAnother local said: 'They were happy enough to have a Spitfire fly over for Captain Tom's 100th birthday.\n\n'I don't know if you can ban people sending up a drone. It is not as if it is a Royal palace or a Ministry of Defence establishment.'\n\nBefore it was taken down, the Ingram-Moores were seen packing away Sir Tom's legacy into boxes.\n\nPhotos of the war hero at Windsor Castle and his Sports Personality of the Year and Guinness World Record awards were seen being removed from the complex.\n\nMrs Ingram Moore also faced a probe into payments made through her family company for appearances linked to her late father's charity in August 2023.\n\nShe attended and judged awards ceremonies in 2021 and 2022 as interim chief executive of the Captain Tom Foundation, but had payments for the appearances made to her company, Maytrix Group.\n\nThe BBC claimed she received thousands of pounds into Maytrix for attending the Virgin Media O2 Captain Tom Foundation Connector Awards - despite promotional videos suggesting she was representing the charity.\n\nThe Charity Commission began investigating possible conflicts of interest between the Ingram-Moore's private companies and the charity in November 2022. At the time, the family did not respond to the claims.\n\nThe family lost an appeal against Central Bedfordshire Council to keep the spa complex (pictured) after a planning inspector ruled it was 'at odds' with their Grade ll-listed home\n\nThe Ingram-Moore's were seen packing away Sir Tom's legacy into boxes before the spa complex was taken down on February 7\n\nIn an interview with Piers Morgan on TalkTV in October 2023, Ms Ingram Moore admitted to keeping \u00a3800,000 from books that the late army veteran had written.\n\nShe said the family kept the sum from three books because Captain Tom had wanted them to retain the profits.\n\nWorld War Two veteran Captain Tom was knighted by the late Queen for walking 100 laps around the garden of the house during the Covid pandemic in 2020, raising \u00a338million for NHS charities.\n\nHe died on February 2, 2021, aged 100, with Buckingham Palace announcing the Queen had sent the family a 'private message of condolence'.\n\nThe family's home up for sale boasts four bathrooms, four reception rooms and is set in 3.5 acres with a stand alone Coach House.\n\nPotential buyers will have to provide ID, proof of wealth and sign NDAs before visiting the property.\n\nThe demolition work being carried out on the spa complex\n\nSir Tom was made an honorary colonel and was later knighted by the Queen (pictured in 2020) at Windsor Castle, after completing 100 laps of his garden for charity. This picture could be seen inside a gymnasium on the grounds in a video of the property listing\n\nA passage written for the brochure by Mrs Ingram-Moore noted that she had purchased the property to ensure Captain Tom could live with her in his later years.\n\nShe wrote: 'It was the opportunity for multigenerational living that first drew us to this property.\n\n'We were living in Surrey, my elderly father was in Kent, and we were setting up our own business needing access to London, so we drew a circle on the map to determine how far we were willing to move.\n\n'Initially, we were looking for a house for us and our young family, and another nearby for my father, but when we found The Rectory with its own Coach House in the grounds, we increasingly liked the idea of all living together.\n\n'As the Coach House was in use as a B&B, my father ended up living with us in the main house, which with its 7 bedrooms including two master suites is more than big enough!\n\n'In the years since, it has been wonderful to see young and old thrive in a family home where everyone has their own space.'\n\nMs Ingram-Moore was seen at the property helping remove items from the spa complex before it was taken down in February\n\nCaptain Tom Moore's family have been handed money from various routes, including from three of his books", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk",

It was a good thing what he's done, and now it's embarrassing.\"\n\nThe C-shaped building has \"devalued\" other homes and looks like a \"prison\", one neighbour said.\n\nA third said it was \"about time they knocked it down\".\n\nOthers claimed Hannah and husband Colin had \"never spoken to anybody\", which further soured the neighbours' opinions.\n\nA fourth angry local claimed fury was sparked in the village after Hannah spoke of installing a jacuzzi in the spa.\n\nThe resident said: \"They said we will probably let the older people in the village come and use it.\n\n\"You must be bloody joking. It's a load of bulls***.\n\n\"The worst bit is that it's made a mockery of Captain Tom's name.\"\n\nHannah pocketed \u00a3800,000 from the three books her dad had written, she told Piers Morgan in October. She claimed he wanted his family to keep the profits.\n\nShe also revealed she was paid \u00a318,000 to attend the Captain Tom awards - but only donating \u00a32,000 of it to his charity.\n\nShe told the TalkTV's host: \"We have to accept that we made a decision, and it was probably the wrong one.\"\n\nBut \u00a3800,000 went to her firm Club Nook Ltd, which was set up just four months before the first tome, Tomorrow Will Be A Good Day: My Autobiography, was published in September 2020.\n\nCharity Commission bosses are now probing the foundation.\n\nThe latest financial details about the charity show a total income of \u00a3400,000 and expenditure of \u00a3680,000.\n\nHannah pocketed \u00a3800,000 from the three books her dad had written, she told Piers Morgan in October.

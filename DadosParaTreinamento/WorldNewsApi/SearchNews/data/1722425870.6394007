{"id": 243239396, "title": "Veterinarian\u2019s office in suburban Japan has custom sign drawn by manga star Rumiko Takahashi", "text": "She may be one of the biggest names in the manga/anime world, but Takahashi hasn\u2019t forgotten her roots. With the announcement of a new Ranma 1/2 anime coming on the heels of the finale of the Urusei Yatsura remake, original creator Rumiko Takahashi is back in the pop culture spotlight. Not that Takahashi is ever all that far from that spotlight, though, being one of Japan\u2019s most successful manga artists of all time, with at least one series in serialization for the better part of four decades. But as we wait for the reveal of more information about the new Ranma project, people have rediscovered a piece of Takahashi artwork that\u2019s been hiding in plain sight for at least 25 years. Seen on Google Street View above is Inagaki Veterinary Clinic, located in the suburbs of Niigata City. The understated sign on the front of the building lists their hours of operation and phone number, and also features a drawing of a dog and cat. This particular dog and cat, however, will look very familiar to Takahashi fans. The cat is clearly Ranma 1/2\u2019s martial artist Shampoo, in the feline form she takes whenever she\u2019s splashed with cold water. The dog, meanwhile, is Soichiro-san, the pet of Kyoko Otonashi, the female lead of Maison Ikkoku, yet another Takahashi series. With Takahashi being a Niigata native, one might mistakenly assume that the vet slyly copied some of the hometown hero\u2019s artwork to curry favor with local customers. The Niigata connection runs deeper than that, though, because it turns out that not only is Takahashi fully aware that Inagaki Veterinary Clinic has a sign with her illustrations on it, she drew it specifically for them! \u6563\u7b56\u4e2d\u306b\u3081\u305e\u3093\u4e00\u523b\u306e\u60e3\u4e00\u90ce\u3055\u3093\u3068\u3089\u3093\u307e1/2\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u30fc\u3092\u767a\u898b\u9ad8\u6a4b\u7559\u7f8e\u5b50\u5148\u751f\u3068\u52d5\u7269\u75c5\u9662\u306e\u5148\u751f\u304c\u540c\u7d1a\u751f\u3068\u3044\u3046\u7e4b\u304c\u308a\u3089\u3057\u3044\u65b0\u6f5f\u5e02\u5185\u306b\u306f\u7559\u7f8e\u5b50\u5148\u751f\u306e\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u4f7f\u7528\u3055\u308c\u305f\u770b\u677f\u7b49\u3092\u3088\u304f\u898b\u304b\u3051\u308b\u304c\u3053\u3053\u306f\u77e5\u3089\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u2026 pic.twitter.com/LLTlATUqfI\u2014 \u3088\u3057@\u65b0\u6f5f\u7279\u64ae\u4e0a\u6620\u4f1a@7\u670813\u301c14\u65e5 \u7b2c14\u30fb15\u56de\u65b0\u6f5f\u7279\u64ae\u4e0a\u6620\u4f1a (@lapis0122) October 23, 2021 As explained on the clinic\u2019s website, Inagaki\u2019s owner and Takahashi are childhood friends, having been schoolmates in both elementary and junior high school. Takahashi\u2019s stardom eventually took her away from Niigata and off to the big city and big publishers of Tokyo, but when Inagaki\u2019s owner got back in touch with her and the topic of Takahashi drawing a piece of artwork for the clinic came up, she agreed. \u8aa0\u306b\u52dd\u624b\u306a\u304c\u3089\u3001\u9ad8\u6a4b\u7559\u7f8e\u5b50\u5148\u751f\u306e\u3054\u5b9f\u5bb6(\u8de1)\u3092\u8a2a\u554f\u3002\u4eca\u306f\u99d0\u8eca\u5834\u3002\u3061\u306a\u307f\u306b\u3001\u5c11\u3057\u96e2\u308c\u305f\u3054\u8fd1\u6240\u306b\u52d5\u7269\u75c5\u9662\u304c\u3042\u3063\u3066\u5148\u751f\u306e\u30b5\u30a4\u30f3\u3068\u60e3\u4e00\u90ce\u3055\u3093\u30fb\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u30fc\u3068\u601d\u308f\u308c\u308b\u72ac\u732b\u304c\u63cf\u304b\u308c\u305f\u770b\u677f\u304c\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u30de\u30fc\u30b9\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u308b\u266a pic.twitter.com/jAB0Uxiom2\u2014 \u306f\u3044\u306d@RINNE3\u671f\u518d\u653e\u9001 (@heinekenbeer11) July 23, 2016 The posting on Inagaki Veterinary Clinic\u2019s website explaining the sign is from 1999, but it\u2019s unclear if it was posted at the same time as the sign went up or sometime after. Takahashi\u2019s artwork appears to have been gracing the building ever since, though, with photos shared on social media stretching back several years, and experiencing a new batch of attention recently. \u8fd1\u6240\u306b\u3042\u308b\u52d5\u7269\u75c5\u9662\u306e\u770b\u677f\u306e\u30a4\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8\u3092\u63cf\u3044\u305f\u65b9\u306f\u3042\u306e\u9ad8\u6a4b\u7559\u7f8e\u5b50\u5148\u751f\uff01\u7363\u533b\u5148\u751f\u3068\u540c\u7d1a\u751f\u3089\u3057\u3044\u3002\u56fd\u5b9d\u306b\u6307\u5b9a\u306f\u3088\uff01 pic.twitter.com/kpNG3cjmDL\u2014 fretboard (@fretrock) June 26, 2024 As we\u2019ve talked about before, though, Takahashi has an insanely busy work schedule. When she agreed to do the drawing for Inagaki\u2019s sign, it had been six years since she\u2019d had three days off in a row. Nevertheless, the manga star was happy to help out, because no matter where your adult life takes you, your childhood friends will always be special.

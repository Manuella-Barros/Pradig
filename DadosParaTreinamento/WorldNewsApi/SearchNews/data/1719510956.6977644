Murray, a two-time PGA Tour winner, died Saturday morning. He was 30 years old. Malnati and Murray played in the same group during the first two rounds of the Charles Schwab Challenge in Fort Worth, Texas, before Murray withdrew on Friday due to illness. \u201cThis is going to be really hard,\u201d Malnati said in an interview with CBS\u2019 Amanda Balionis during the broadcast. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Grayson all that well, but I spent the last two days with him. It\u2019s so funny, we get so worked up out here about a bad break here or a good break there.\u201d Malnati, 36, then began trying to fight back tears. \u201cWe\u2019re so competitive out here, we all want to beat each other, and then something like this happens, and you realize, we\u2019re all just humans,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a really hard day.\u201d A cause of death has not yet been revealed. PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan offered to pause the Charles Schwab Challenge on Saturday, but Murray\u2019s family insisted that the tournament continue. \u201cI am at a loss for words,\u201d Monahan said in a statement on Saturday. \u201cThe PGA Tour is a family, and when you lose a member of your family, you are never the same.\u201d Murray previously talked openly about battling depression and alcoholism, and he had recently been in the midst of a career resurgence. He won the Sony Open in January, after which Murray detailed his struggles. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy,\u201d Murray said. \u201cI wanted to give up a lot of times. Give up on myself. Give up on the game of golf. Give up on life, at times.\u201d Malnati touched on that topic during his interview. \u201cYou look at Grayson and you see him, someone who has visibly, outwardly struggled in the past,\u201d Malnati said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s been open about it. And you see him get his life back to a place where he\u2019s feeling good about things, it\u2019s just so sad.\u201d", "summary": "PGA Tour golfer Peter Malnati became emotional when speaking about Grayson Murray.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/05/26/sports/peter-malnati-gives-emotional-interview-on-grayson-murrays-death/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/newspress-collage-9559j3nyn-1716731306461.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1716717005&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:02:27", "author": "Jared Schwartz", "authors": ["Jared Schwartz"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.457}

According to the University of Melbourne, the proposed international student cap will \u201cwreak havoc\u201d on the education sector and harm Australia\u2019s reputation among international students. \u201cThese caps are penalising the sector for a temporary, larger-than-expected increase in student numbers due primarily to the pandemic lag effect. Already the number of international students granted visas to come to Australia has decreased dramatically, with student visa grants down 34 percent in March compared to the same time in 2023,\u201d said Deputy-Vice Chancellor (Global, Culture, and Engagement) Professor Michael Wesley in a statement. The current international student cap policy was initially announced in a May 11 joint media release where the government empowered the minister of education to set the maximum allocation of new international students that education providers can accept. The proposed legislation was also part of the government\u2019s new migration strategy to address existing problems with regards to the country\u2019s national migration policy. \u201cThese reforms are designed to ensure the integrity, quality and ongoing sustainability of this vitally important sector,\u201d said Education Minister Jason Clare. Latest data from the Ministry of Education showed that there were 741,224 international students in the year-to-date March 2024, a 16 percent increase in enrollments in the same period in 2019. China, India, Nepal, the Philippines, and Vietnam are the top countries of origin of international students in Australia. \u201cWith international student visa grants back to pre-pandemic levels, the focus now shifts to ensuring numbers in the sector are managed more strategically over the long-term,\u201d said Home Affairs Minister Clare O\u2019Neill. However, the University of Melbourne said that the international student cap will reduce funding for teaching and research, which could lead to job losses and course cancellations. The university expressed concern that the Albanese government did not consult the universities before legislating the said proposal. \u201cWe are urging the government to prioritise integrity measures in 2025, and use existing regulatory frameworks, focusing on bad actors within the higher education sector. We also recommend implementation of any caps be deferred until 2026, to allow feasible implementation and an orderly transition to reduce the risks of a shock to the sector and the economy,\u201d Mr. Wesley said.", "summary": "The proposed cap is part of the Albanese government's efforts to address migration problems in the country.", "url": "https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/university-of-melbourne-opposes-international-student-caps-5672727", "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2021/04/09/20201117001503784950-minihighres-300x180.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 00:37:18", "author": "Celene Ignacio", "authors": ["Celene Ignacio"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.255}

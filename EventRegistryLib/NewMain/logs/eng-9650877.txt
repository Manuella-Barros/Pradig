The other is heading indoors.\n\nBard on Bower will be returning to Bower Ponds this summer -- but only for one outdoor production. The other is heading indoors.\n\nThe Merry Wives of Windsor will be performed on the outdoor stage at Bower Ponds starting from July 19 with free admission (donations accepted), while Henry IV, Part II will open in the Scott Block Theatre on July 26 as a ticketed event.\n\nRichard Beaune, who's continuing as artistic director of Prime Stock Theatre until the end of this Bard on Bower season, said a decision was made to try something new because some of the more dramatic Shakespearean plays work better in a more intimate setting.\n\nWhile the outdoor stage is a great venue for catching the attention of people who may have come to the park for a walk or picnic, it's not so good for actors trying to convey subtlety, or build intensity in a scene, said Beaune.\n\n\"I really want the audience to hear the actors' voices coming from the actors, not from a loudspeaker.\"\n\nBeaune feels that staging one play indoors and one outdoors gives Bard on Bower more possibilities and is worth the experiment. If there's an audience for it, he said Prime Stock might reprise darker Shakespearean productions, such as Macbeth, at the indoor venue in future seasons of Bard on Bower.\n\nThis summer, Beaune will not be directing either Shakespearean play, but will be taking on the roles of Falstaff, as well as King Henry, in the production that runs from July 26 to Aug. 3 in the Scott Block Theatre.\n\nThe play's director, Allison Weninger, suggested that having one actor tackling both roles could be an interesting interpretation since both characters are father figures to Prince Hal (and, crucially, do not appear in the same scenes). \"It will be a lot of words, so that's a bit frightening, but it is a really exciting opportunity,\" said Beaune.\n\nHenry IV, Part 2, starts with the king beset by illness. His youngest son, Prince John, is busy fighting rebels. Pince Hal prepares to take over the Crown while his friend Falstaff makes mischief.\n\nThe Merry Wives of Windsor, which will run from July 19-28 on the outdoor stage in Bower Ponds, is more of a light-hearted romp. Sir John Falstaff (presumably a different one in this play) conspires to seduce two married women -- the wives of prominent Windsor citizens. They play along only to expose him as a lecher. The director is Piper Rempel.\n\nBeaune, who's now artistic director of The Shakespeare Company in Calgary, will be stepping own from his role with Prime Stock Theatre once the Bard on Bower season is over. His successors are expected to be announced shortly.\n\nMeanwhile, a Prime Stock Theatre fundraiser, featuring the award-winning Duelling Piano Kings, will be held Thursday, June 20, at Bo's Bar and Stage.

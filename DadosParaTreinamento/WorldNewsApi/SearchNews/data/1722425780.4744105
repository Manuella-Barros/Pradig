Dutch designer Iris van Herpen is known for her sculptural, futuristic garments that have been influenced by dance, architecture, the natural world, science and technology, and worn by the likes of Bj\u00f6rk, Beyonc\u00e9 and Lady Gaga. Arriving in Australia direct from its Paris premiere at the Muse\u0301e des Arts De\u0301coratifs, Iris van Herpen: Sculpting the Senses is a showcase of more than 170 items from Van Herpen\u2019s career showing at the Queensland Gallery of Modern Art in Brisbane from 29 June to 7 October. Among the creations on display is the Heliosphere gown worn by Beyonc\u00e9 for the Amsterdam leg of her 2023 Renaissance tour. Designed by Van Herpen and created by a team of 12, the garment features 980 laser-cut leaf-shaped outlines cast in silver-marbled silicone then hand-stitched on to a tulle minidress, along with Swarovski crystals. The \u201chalo\u201d collar is shaped from PETG, a semi-rigid polyester material. For her 2010 Crystallization collection, also on display at the exhibition, Van Herpen was inspired by the \u201cseemingly chaos to structured precision\u201d of water, from its fluid, liquid state to its hard, \u201cmathematical\u201d crystal ice form. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning The Water and Dreams room \u2013 one of nine in the exhibition \u2013 includes creations from Van Herpen\u2019s 2016 Seijaku collection. The glass dress is sculpted from hand-blown glass bubbles, coated in a transparent silicone, which create a \u201cbioluminescent prism around the body\u201d. The Shift Souls garments, from the 2019 collection of the same name, are designed to \u201csmoke around the body in three dimensional \u2018wave drawings\u2019\u201d, according to the designer\u2019s website. The look was created with layers of dyed silk and frames of laser-cut mylar (a type of polyester film). Musician Grimes wore the Bene Gesserit gown \u2013 named after the powerful \u201cReverend Mothers\u201d from Frank Herbert\u2019s science-fantasy novel Dune \u2013 to the 2021 Met Gala. It is made from 26 metres of silk and took more than 900 hours to craft. The spherical Epicycle dress, from the 2019 Hypnosis collection, creates an optical illusion \u2013 the layers of organza hoops appear to \u201cwrap into each other infinitely\u201d.", "summary": "<p>In a new exhibition at Brisbane\u2019s Queensland Gallery of Modern Art, the Dutch designer showcases more than 170 items from her career that cross the realms of art and science</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=cvau_sfl\">Get our weekend culture and lifestyle email</a></li></ul><p>Science, art or haute couture?

This move comes in protest against an agreement to transfer 400 young migrants from the Canary Islands to mainland Spain. The People's Party supports the plan, aimed at alleviating pressure on infrastructure.\n\nSpanish far-right party Vox has escalated political tensions by threatening to dismantle coalition governments with the centre-right People's Party across several regions. This action is in response to an agreement to transfer around 400 young migrants from the Canary Islands to the Spanish mainland.\n\nThe People's Party, which governs five regions including Valencia in coalition with Vox, announced on Wednesday its support for a central government plan to relocate these unaccompanied minors. The Socialist-run Spanish government aims to reduce the strain on infrastructure in the Canary Islands by moving some of the 6,000 young migrants from West Africa currently on the archipelago.\n\nVox leader Santiago Abascal took to X to express his discontent, accusing the People's Party of betraying their coalition and endangering Spaniards by accepting 400 underage migrants. Abascal hinted at the possibility of following through on his threat, which would leave the People's Party struggling to pass legislation and approve budgets without Vox's support.\n\nReacting to Vox's stance, the People's Party released a statement questioning the logic behind jeopardizing regional governance for a relatively small number of migrant children. Secretary General Cuca Gamarra criticized Vox, stating that true patriotism would not abandon innocent children.\n\nSocialist spokesperson Patxi Lopez denounced the rhetoric used by some regional government members, who stigmatize the migrant children as criminals. Regional Policy Minister Angel Victor Torres highlighted the immense pressure an increasing number of West African migrants has placed on the Canary Islands' infrastructure.\n\nGovernment figures revealed that over 16,500 migrants reached the Canary Islands in the first five months of 2024, a fivefold increase compared to the same period in the previous year.

The main aim of these talks is to coordinate the relocation and care of unaccompanied minors in the Canary Islands, which is currently above maximum capacity.\n\nPut simply, the government and regional leaders have been finalising quotas of migrant minors set to be received by each region, as well as potential financial incentives for doing so.\n\nThe government's idea is to centralise the transfer of minors in the event that a region exceeds its maximum occupancy quota, something that has already happened in the Canary Islands, but also in Ceuta and Melilla, Spain's two autonomous cities in North Africa.\n\nREAD ALSO: Cruise ship rescues 68 migrants off Spain's Canaries, five dead\n\nAll three are used as ways to enter Spain, and therefore the EU, by migrants coming from Africa. Migrants going to the Canary Islands, mostly from sub-Saharan African countries, take the dangerous boat journey from the west coast of Africa.\n\nIn Ceuta and Melilla, Europe's only land borders with Africa, sub-Saharan migrants arrive but there's also a mix of Moroccan and Algerian minors.\n\nMany of the unaccompanied minors are housed in overcrowded and unhygienic immigration centres, with no training, language lesson or education made available to them.\n\nSome of these centres have been described as 'punishment places', with conditions so bad that some minors have developed addictions to tranquillising drugs such as Rivotril or Diazepam.\n\nAlmost 16,000 migrants arrived to Canaries on clandestine boats called pateras in the first four months of 2024, further worsening the situation for the islands' local governments, which were already overstretched with the resources available.\n\nThe smallest and least populated of the archipelago's islands - El Hierro - received more migrants than it has inhabitants in 2023.\n\nThe national government wants to arrange the transfer and care of 347 minors in total, though the Canary Islands needs to relocate as many as 3,000.\n\nThe agreed relocations will be distributed as follows: 31 sent to Catalonia; 30 to Madrid, Andalusia and Extremadura; 29 to Cantabria; 26 to Galicia; 24 to Asturias; 23 to the Valencian Community; 21 to Castilla y Le\u00f3n; 20 to Castile-La Mancha; 18 to the Basque Country; 16 to Murcia; 15 to Navarre; 10 to the Balearic Islands; and 4 to La Rioja.\n\nThe PP governs in several of these regions, five of which in coalition with Vox, which means 209 migrant minors would be sent to right-wing controlled regions of Spain under the proposals. The PP leadership has accepted the proposal. This has infuriated Vox, which has now threatened to pull out of the regional governments.\n\n'Breaking' regional coalitions\n\nThe decision of the PP's regional bosses to accept the migrant minors, something the Spanish press suggests was agreed after pressure from the national leadership, has pushed their relationship with Vox to the limit.\n\nVox leader Santiago Abascal released a statement in response to the proposals in which it accused PP leader Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o of having \"broken the PP-Vox governments\" and announced that the party will decide \"the next steps\" to take in an urgent party meeting.\n\nSources in several PP coalitions have told Spanish daily El Pa\u00eds that there's now a real risk of a break-up of regional governments.\n\nFeij\u00f3o, for his part, has stated that the decision to accept minors in \"solidarity\" with the Canary Islands is a moral duty. \"You cannot threaten anyone for doing their duty and we are going to do our duty,\" he said.\n\nREAD ALSO: Spanish minister urges EU to 'deepen' ties to tackle migration roots\n\nHowever the outspoken Vox vice-president of Castilla y Le\u00f3n, Juan Garc\u00eda-Gallardo, has made clear his willingness to leave government if the PP goes ahead with the relocation of immigrant minors.\n\n\"It is being said that in order to show solidarity with the Canary Islands we have to contribute to the distribution of all these supposed minors throughout Spain, but the reality is that if it is concluded, if this distribution is carried out,\" Garc\u00eda-Gallardo said, \"the message we are sending to the mafias is that the Spanish border is a joke and that the Spanish border is useless\".\n\nPP sources have accused Vox of potentially breaking the coalition governments, but a Vox statement made clear the far-right party sees Feij\u00f3o as the one who \"has arbitrarily and self-interestedly broken a relationship of loyalty and collaboration\" between the two parties.\n\nIt is unclear what it would mean for the regional governments if Vox were to pull out, or if it would be one, several, or all the regions where the right governs in coalition.\n\nHowever, by shifting responsibility onto the PP's national leadership rather than the regional 'barons', Abascal has left the door open for Vox to maintain its regional coalition agreements while breaking with national leadership.", "source": {"uri": "thelocal.es", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Local Spain"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_(political_party)", "type": "org",

Vox will not condone rapes, robberies, and machete attacks,\" the party declared in a late-night statement on Wednesday, referring to hosting responsibilities for the young migrants.\n\nThe Popular Party relies on Vox's support to govern in six regions -- Aragon, Castile and Leon, Valencia, Extremadura, Murcia, and the Balearic Islands. Under the proposal, these regions would only accommodate a total of 110 migrants under the age of 18.\n\nThe People's Party secretary-general criticized Vox's actions on Thursday, calling them \"irresponsible,\" especially given the relatively low number of migrants involved.\n\n\"I find it totally disproportionate, more like an excuse or a form of blackmail,\" Cuca Gamarra stated in an interview with broadcaster Antena 3.\n\nThe second-in-command at the Popular Party emphasized that the core issue lies in the Spanish government's failure to prevent migrant arrivals initially and advocated for \"solidarity\" among Spain's regions.\n\nOn Thursday, Vox canceled official events in regions where it governs alongside the Popular Party and convened an emergency meeting to decide on \"next steps\" for later in the evening.\n\nMeanwhile, the spokesperson for Spain's ruling Socialist Party expressed satisfaction with the potential rift between the country's two leading right-wing factions.\n\nSpeaking to Antena 3, spokesperson Patxi Lopez expressed hope that Spain would follow in France's footsteps, where parties united to form a 'sanitary cordon' to keep the far-right out of government.\n\nThe Spanish government is currently working on a migration law reform that would legally mandate other regions to share the responsibility of accommodating young migrants when one part of the country is overwhelmed.\n\nHowever, with the Catalan separatist party Junts opposing the measure, efforts are underway to persuade the Popular Party to support the reform.\n\nFollowing a crucial meeting on Wednesday night, the Popular Party indicated it would need more time to make a decision on how it would vote.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu

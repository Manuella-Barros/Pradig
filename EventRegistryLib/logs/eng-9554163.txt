Here are 14 Q&A nuggets.", "body": "Buffett predicted higher taxes and revealed a $500 million donation of Berkshire stock.\n\nWarren Buffett let slip a slew of intriguing facts and anecdotes during Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting on Saturday.\n\nThe headlines from the event included Buffett confirming he'd sold 13% of his gargantuan Apple stake, admitting responsibility for a losing bet on Paramount, and raising the alarm on AI-powered fraud.\n\nBut the Berkshire CEO also warned of higher taxes, teased a potential Canadian investment, and revealed a $500 million gift of Berkshire stock.\n\nMoreover, Buffett declared that he could earn a 50% annual return on $1 million, predicted Berkshire's cash pile would balloon to more than $200 billion this quarter, and recalled the time a Russian chess grandmaster visited Omaha.\n\nHere are 14 interesting nuggets from the Berkshire meeting:\n\nBuffett pointed out that Berkshire generated some $37 billion in operating profits last year, meaning that on an average day, he received a fresh $100 million to deploy. The investor was underscoring the difficulty of shrewdly investing such a large and relentless inflow of cash.\n\nBerkshire's mountain of cash and Treasury hit a record $189 billion last quarter, and it's likely to swell to more than $200 billion this quarter, Buffett said.\n\n\"I don't mind at all, under current conditions, building the cash position. When I look at the alternative of what's available, in the equity markets, and I look at the composition of what's going on in the world, we find it quite attractive.\"\n\nThe government will probably raise taxes in the coming years in a bid to balance its budget, Buffett said.\n\n\"I would say with the present fiscal policies that something has to give. I think that higher taxes are quite likely. The government may decide that someday they don't want the fiscal deficit to be this large, and they may not want to decrease spending a lot, and they may decide they'll take a larger percentage of what we earn.\"\n\nBuffett bemoaned that he should have listened to his late business partner, Charlie Munger, and been \"more aggressive\" with his investment in Costco.\n\nBerkshire increased its stake in the retailer from $32 million in 1999 to $1.3 billion in June 2020, then exited the following quarter. Costco stock surged more than 500% during that period.\n\n\"Charlie twice pounded the table with me and just said, 'Buy, buy, buy.' BYD was one of them and Costco was the other,\" Buffett said.\n\nBuffett revealed he's exploring a potential investment in Canada.\n\n\"We do not feel uncomfortable in any way, shape, or form putting our money into Canada. In fact, we're actually looking at one thing now.\"\n\nBuffett appeared to change his mind over who would run Berkshire's stock portfolio once he's gone. Instead of his investment managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, he suggested his successor as CEO, Greg Abel, would oversee it.\n\n\"I think the responsibility ought to be entirely with Greg,\" Buffett said. \"He understands businesses extremely well and if you understand businesses, you understand common stocks.\"\n\nBuffett admitted that he and Munger were lenient with underperforming managers, but declared that would change once Abel takes over.\n\n\"If you have 20 children and you're very rich, you'll have some that will be go-getters anyway, and you'll have some that won't. We are a very, very rich company and we haven't had a history of being very tough on people that coasted. Greg will do something about it.\"\n\nBuffett took aim at Wall Street while underscoring that Berkshire's rock-solid financials allow it to lend and invest money during dark periods when nobody else will.\n\n\"At those times, we want to be sure that the US government thinks we're an asset to the situation and not a liability or a supplicant, as the banks were in 2008 and 2009. They were all tarred with the same brush. But we want to be sure that the brush that determines our future is not tarred.\"\n\nBuffett may be a bargain hunter with little respect for middlemen, but he happily paid the standard broker fee on his last home sale.\n\n\"I did sell a house for $7 million. I did not negotiate the 6% down, and I feel I got my money's worth and then some. And I'm cheap by nature, so it isn't I'm careless about it. I got my money's worth.\"\n\nRuth Gottesman, the widow of the late Berkshire director Sandy Gottesman, recently donated $1 billion of Berkshire stock to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine to cover students' tuition in perpetuity.\n\nBuffett revealed that at the same time that Berkshire was repurchasing those shares from the college in exchange for cash, it was also buying back $500 million of stock from another charitable donor in a different state.\n\nHe shared that fact to make the case that Berkshire shareholders are unrivaled in their generosity.\n\nBuffett claimed that if he had only $1 million to invest instead of nearly $200 billion, he could earn a 50% annual return. \"I would try and know everything about everything small, and I would find something.\"\n\nBuffett shrugged off fears of \"de-dollarization\" or dwindling dollar dominance worldwide: \"There really isn't any alternative to the dollar as a reserve currency.\"\n\nThe investor raised the alarm on the US government running a large budget deficit and racking up unprecedented amounts of debt.\n\n\"I don't sit and work myself into a stew about it in the least,\" Buffett said about the government spending more than it brings in each year. \"But I can't help thinking about it.\"\n\n\"It won't be the quantity, it will be whether in any way inflation would get let loose in a way that really threatened the whole world economic situation,\" he said about the national debt.\n\nBuffett recalled that Russian chess icon Garry Kasparov once visited his home town and met the legendary founder of Berkshire-owned Nebraska Furniture Mart.\n\n\"I know great bridge players, I know great chess players.

The article was reviewed, fact-checked and edited by our editorial staff prior to publication.\n\nWarren Buffett is one of the greatest investors of all time. Berkshire Hathaway, the company he's managed since 1965, has returned 19.8 percent annually through the end of 2023 during Buffett's leadership, nearly doubling the return of the S&P 500 on an annualized basis over that time period. A $1,000 investment in the S&P 500 would be worth about $280,000 today, compared to more than $35 million if you'd invested it in Berkshire.\n\nBuffett is not what many people think of when it comes to Wall Street, however. He communicates complex financial topics in simple terms, lives in Omaha, Nebraska and shuns the short-term nature of market traders. Instead, Buffett takes a long-term view, sometimes holding stocks for decades as their value compounds for shareholders.\n\nHere are some of Buffett's best stock investments of all time and some companies he's held for at least a decade.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway investing approach\n\nOne thing that makes Berkshire Hathaway's investment approach unique is that Buffett can purchase both stocks and entire companies. He has often written that he views the two purchases the same, no matter if he's buying 5 percent of a company or the entire thing.\n\nSome of Berkshire's longest and most successful investments have been when they've purchased an entire company, such as when it acquired See's Candy in 1972 for $25 million. Buffett told shareholders in 2019 that See's had produced \"well over\" $2 billion in pre-tax earnings for Berkshire since its purchase. See's strong brand has allowed it to raise prices over time, helping it to limit the impact of inflation.\n\nAnother long-time holding was an investment in The Washington Post, which Buffett bought in 1973 and held for more than 40 years. The newspaper was sold to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos for $250 million in 2013, with remaining assets such as TV stations going to Graham Holdings, which Berkshire exited in 2014. The investment was a profitable one for Berkshire, but would have been even greater if it had been sold earlier. At the end of 2004, Berkshire's stake was worth nearly $1.7 billion, or about 154 times its cost of $11 million at the time.\n\nIn recent years, Buffett has exited some long-time investments in the banking industry including Wells Fargo, M&T Bank and U.S. Bancorp. All three of those investments had been held for more than a decade. The sales of banks at the end of 2022 were well-timed, as the sector sold off following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023.\n\nWarren Buffett's top stocks of all time and long-held positions\n\nBerkshire began buying Coca-Cola's stock in the fall of 1988, eventually building a $1.3 billion position. Just three years later the investment was worth $3.75 billion, more than all of Berkshire at the time of its investment. Buffett saw that Coke had an extremely strong brand with lots of room to grow profitably for many years. In 2023, Berkshire received dividends of $736 million from its Coke holdings and its stake was worth nearly $25 billion.\n\nBerkshire's investment in American Express was built primarily in the mid-1990s, but Buffett had owned the stock in the 1960s in his investment partnership following a scandal that briefly threatened the company's solvency. Buffett told shareholders in his 2022 letter that dividends from American Express to Berkshire have grown from $41 million in 1995 to $302 million in 2022. The dividends reached about $352 million in 2023.\n\nIn early 2000, Berkshire disclosed an investment in Dun & Bradstreet, which spun off Moody's later that year. Moody's credit rating business is extremely profitable and has continued to grow despite periodic calls for reform to the ratings industry. Buffett told the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission in 2010 that he liked Moody's because it had enormous pricing power and \"almost infinite\" returns on tangible assets.\n\nBerkshire disclosed its position in Apple in early 2016, but it was later that year and in early 2017 when Buffett really loaded up on the stock, making it one of Berkshire's largest investments ever. Buffett told shareholders in 2023 that Apple \"just happens to be a better business than any we own.\" Buffett sold some Apple shares from 2018-2020, but told shareholders later that it was a \"dumb decision\" to sell. Buffett told shareholders at the 2024 Berkshire meeting that he'd sold about 13 percent of the Apple position but that it was likely to be a top holding for years to come.\n\nBerkshire invested in Bank of America through preferred stock and warrants in 2011, which were exercised in 2017. Buffett has occasionally added to the position since then, including in the first quarter of 2023. Buffett has invested in many bank stocks over the years and has repeatedly praised Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan. The holding has become one of the largest for Berkshire.", "source": {"uri": "star-telegram.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fort Worth Star-Telegram"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Here are 14 Q&A nuggets.", "body": "Warren Buffett's Q&A at Berkshire's annual meeting was full of interesting nuggets and tidbits. He teased a possible Canadian bet, and said he could make a 50% annual return on $1 million. Buffett predicted higher taxes and revealed a $500 million donation of Berkshire stock.\n\nWarren Buffett let slip a slew of intriguing facts and anecdotes during Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting on Saturday.\n\nThe headlines from the event included Buffett confirming he'd sold 13% of his gargantuan Apple stake, admitting responsibility for a losing bet on Paramount, and raising the alarm on AI-powered fraud.\n\nBut the Berkshire CEO also warned of higher taxes, teased a potential Canadian investment, and revealed a $500 million gift of Berkshire stock.\n\nMoreover, Buffett declared that he could earn a 50% annual return on $1 million, predicted Berkshire's cash pile would balloon to more than $200 billion this quarter, and recalled the time a Russian chess grandmaster visited Omaha.\n\nHere are 14 interesting nuggets from the Berkshire meeting:\n\n1. Raking it in\n\nBuffett pointed out that Berkshire generated some $37 billion in operating profits last year, meaning that on an average day, he received a fresh $100 million to deploy. The investor was underscoring the difficulty of shrewdly investing such a large and relentless inflow of cash.\n\n2. Cash hoard\n\nBerkshire's mountain of cash and Treasury hit a record $189 billion last quarter, and it's likely to swell to more than $200 billion this quarter, Buffett said.\n\n\"I don't mind at all, under current conditions, building the cash position. When I look at the alternative of what's available, in the equity markets, and I look at the composition of what's going on in the world, we find it quite attractive.\"\n\n3. Taxing times\n\nThe government will probably raise taxes in the coming years in a bid to balance its budget, Buffett said.\n\n\"I would say with the present fiscal policies that something has to give. I think that higher taxes are quite likely. The government may decide that someday they don't want the fiscal deficit to be this large, and they may not want to decrease spending a lot, and they may decide they'll take a larger percentage of what we earn.\"\n\n4. Charlie and Costco\n\nBuffett bemoaned that he should have listened to his late business partner, Charlie Munger, and been \"more aggressive\" with his investment in Costco.\n\nBerkshire increased its stake in the retailer from $32 million in 1999 to $1.3 billion in June 2020, then exited the following quarter. Costco stock surged more than 500% during that period.\n\n\"Charlie twice pounded the table with me and just said, 'Buy, buy, buy.' BYD was one of them and Costco was the other,\" Buffett said.\n\n5. Canada intrigue\n\nBuffett revealed he's exploring a potential investment in Canada.\n\n\"We do not feel uncomfortable in any way, shape, or form putting our money into Canada. In fact, we're actually looking at one thing now.\"\n\n6. New regime\n\nBuffett appeared to change his mind over who would run Berkshire's stock portfolio once he's gone. Instead of his investment managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, he suggested his successor as CEO, Greg Abel, would oversee it.\n\n\"I think the responsibility ought to be entirely with Greg,\" Buffett said. \"He understands businesses extremely well and if you understand businesses, you understand common stocks.\"\n\n7. Cracking down\n\nBuffett admitted that he and Munger were lenient with underperforming managers, but declared that would change once Abel takes over.\n\n\"If you have 20 children and you're very rich, you'll have some that will be go-getters anyway, and you'll have some that won't. We are a very, very rich company and we haven't had a history of being very tough on people that coasted. Greg will do something about it.\"\n\n8. Bashing banks\n\nBuffett took aim at Wall Street while underscoring that Berkshire's rock-solid financials allow it to lend and invest money during dark periods when nobody else will.\n\n\"At those times, we want to be sure that the US government thinks we're an asset to the situation and not a liability or a supplicant, as the banks were in 2008 and 2009. They were all tarred with the same brush. But we want to be sure that the brush that determines our future is not tarred.\"\n\n9. Paying fees\n\nBuffett may be a bargain hunter with little respect for middlemen, but he happily paid the standard broker fee on his last home sale.\n\n\"I did sell a house for $7 million. I did not negotiate the 6% down, and I feel I got my money's worth and then some. And I'm cheap by nature, so it isn't I'm careless about it. I got my money's worth.\"\n\n10. Mystery gift\n\nRuth Gottesman, the widow of the late Berkshire director Sandy Gottesman, recently donated $1 billion of Berkshire stock to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine to cover students' tuition in perpetuity.\n\nBuffett revealed that at the same time that Berkshire was repurchasing those shares from the college in exchange for cash, it was also buying back $500 million of stock from another charitable donor in a different state.\n\nHe shared that fact to make the case that Berkshire shareholders are unrivaled in their generosity.\n\n11. Pocket change\n\nBuffett claimed that if he had only $1 million to invest instead of nearly $200 billion, he could earn a 50% annual return. \"I would try and know everything about everything small, and I would find something.\"\n\n12. Dollar champion\n\nBuffett shrugged off fears of \"de-dollarization\" or dwindling dollar dominance worldwide: \"There really isn't any alternative to the dollar as a reserve currency.\"\n\n13. Debt and deficit\n\nThe investor raised the alarm on the US government running a large budget deficit and racking up unprecedented amounts of debt.\n\n\"I don't sit and work myself into a stew about it in the least,\" Buffett said about the government spending more than it brings in each year. \"But I can't help thinking about it.\"\n\n\"It won't be the quantity, it will be whether in any way inflation would get let loose in a way that really threatened the whole world economic situation,\" he said about the national debt.\n\n14. Chess royalty\n\nBuffett recalled that Russian chess icon Garry Kasparov once visited his home town and met the legendary founder of Berkshire-owned Nebraska Furniture Mart.\n\n\"I know great bridge players, I know great chess players. Actually, Kasparov came to Omaha, met Mrs B.\"\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"},

Here are 14 Q&A nuggets.", "body": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nMoreover, Buffett declared that he could earn a 50% annual return on $1 million, predicted Berkshire's cash pile would balloon to more than $200 billion this quarter, and recalled the time a Russian chess grandmaster visited Omaha.\n\nHere are 14 interesting nuggets from the Berkshire meeting:\n\nBuffett pointed out that Berkshire generated some $37 billion in operating profits last year, meaning that on an average day, he received a fresh $100 million to deploy. The investor was underscoring the difficulty of shrewdly investing such a large and relentless inflow of cash.\n\nBerkshire's mountain of cash and Treasury hit a record $189 billion last quarter, and it's likely to swell to more than $200 billion this quarter, Buffett said.\n\n\"I don't mind at all, under current conditions, building the cash position. When I look at the alternative of what's available, in the equity markets, and I look at the composition of what's going on in the world, we find it quite attractive.\"\n\nThe government will probably raise taxes in the coming years in a bid to balance its budget, Buffett said.\n\n\"I would say with the present fiscal policies that something has to give. I think that higher taxes are quite likely. The government may decide that someday they don't want the fiscal deficit to be this large, and they may not want to decrease spending a lot, and they may decide they'll take a larger percentage of what we earn.\"\n\nBuffett bemoaned that he should have listened to his late business partner, Charlie Munger, and been \"more aggressive\" with his investment in Costco.\n\nBerkshire increased its stake in the retailer from $32 million in 1999 to $1.3 billion in June 2020, then exited the following quarter. Costco stock surged more than 500% during that period.\n\n\"Charlie twice pounded the table with me and just said, 'Buy, buy, buy.' BYD was one of them and Costco was the other,\" Buffett said.\n\nBuffett revealed he's exploring a potential investment in Canada.\n\n\"We do not feel uncomfortable in any way, shape, or form putting our money into Canada. In fact, we're actually looking at one thing now.\"\n\nBuffett appeared to change his mind over who would run Berkshire's stock portfolio once he's gone. Instead of his investment managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, he suggested his successor as CEO, Greg Abel, would oversee it.\n\n\"I think the responsibility ought to be entirely with Greg,\" Buffett said. \"He understands businesses extremely well and if you understand businesses, you understand common stocks.\"\n\nBuffett admitted that he and Munger were lenient with underperforming managers, but declared that would change once Abel takes over.\n\n\"If you have 20 children and you're very rich, you'll have some that will be go-getters anyway, and you'll have some that won't. We are a very, very rich company and we haven't had a history of being very tough on people that coasted. Greg will do something about it.\"\n\nBuffett took aim at Wall Street while underscoring that Berkshire's rock-solid financials allow it to lend and invest money during dark periods when nobody else will.\n\n\"At those times, we want to be sure that the US government thinks we're an asset to the situation and not a liability or a supplicant, as the banks were in 2008 and 2009. They were all tarred with the same brush. But we want to be sure that the brush that determines our future is not tarred.\"\n\nBuffett may be a bargain hunter with little respect for middlemen, but he happily paid the standard broker fee on his last home sale.\n\n\"I did sell a house for $7 million. I did not negotiate the 6% down, and I feel I got my money's worth and then some. And I'm cheap by nature, so it isn't I'm careless about it. I got my money's worth.\"\n\nRuth Gottesman, the widow of the late Berkshire director Sandy Gottesman, recently donated $1 billion of Berkshire stock to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine to cover students' tuition in perpetuity.\n\nBuffett revealed that at the same time that Berkshire was repurchasing those shares from the college in exchange for cash, it was also buying back $500 million of stock from another charitable donor in a different state.\n\nHe shared that fact to make the case that Berkshire shareholders are unrivaled in their generosity.\n\nBuffett claimed that if he had only $1 million to invest instead of nearly $200 billion, he could earn a 50% annual return. \"I would try and know everything about everything small, and I would find something.\"\n\nBuffett shrugged off fears of \"de-dollarization\" or dwindling dollar dominance worldwide: \"There really isn't any alternative to the dollar as a reserve currency.\"\n\nThe investor raised the alarm on the US government running a large budget deficit and racking up unprecedented amounts of debt.\n\n\"I don't sit and work myself into a stew about it in the least,\" Buffett said about the government spending more than it brings in each year. \"But I can't help thinking about it.\"\n\n\"It won't be the quantity, it will be whether in any way inflation would get let loose in a way that really threatened the whole world economic situation,\" he said about the national debt.\n\nBuffett recalled that Russian chess icon Garry Kasparov once visited his home town and met the legendary founder of Berkshire-owned Nebraska Furniture Mart.\n\n\"I know great bridge players, I know great chess players. Actually, Kasparov came to Omaha, met Mrs B.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "theron_mohamed@businessinsider.com",

The article was reviewed, fact-checked and edited by our editorial staff prior to publication.\n\nWarren Buffett is one of the greatest investors of all time. Berkshire Hathaway, the company he's managed since 1965, has returned 19.8 percent annually through the end of 2023 during Buffett's leadership, nearly doubling the return of the S&P 500 on an annualized basis over that time period. A $1,000 investment in the S&P 500 would be worth about $280,000 today, compared to more than $35 million if you'd invested it in Berkshire.\n\nBuffett is not what many people think of when it comes to Wall Street, however. He communicates complex financial topics in simple terms, lives in Omaha, Nebraska and shuns the short-term nature of market traders. Instead, Buffett takes a long-term view, sometimes holding stocks for decades as their value compounds for shareholders.\n\nHere are some of Buffett's best stock investments of all time and some companies he's held for at least a decade.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway investing approach\n\nOne thing that makes Berkshire Hathaway's investment approach unique is that Buffett can purchase both stocks and entire companies. He has often written that he views the two purchases the same, no matter if he's buying 5 percent of a company or the entire thing.\n\nSome of Berkshire's longest and most successful investments have been when they've purchased an entire company, such as when it acquired See's Candy in 1972 for $25 million. Buffett told shareholders in 2019 that See's had produced \"well over\" $2 billion in pre-tax earnings for Berkshire since its purchase. See's strong brand has allowed it to raise prices over time, helping it to limit the impact of inflation.\n\nAnother long-time holding was an investment in The Washington Post, which Buffett bought in 1973 and held for more than 40 years. The newspaper was sold to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos for $250 million in 2013, with remaining assets such as TV stations going to Graham Holdings, which Berkshire exited in 2014. The investment was a profitable one for Berkshire, but would have been even greater if it had been sold earlier. At the end of 2004, Berkshire's stake was worth nearly $1.7 billion, or about 154 times its cost of $11 million at the time.\n\nIn recent years, Buffett has exited some long-time investments in the banking industry including Wells Fargo, M&T Bank and U.S. Bancorp. All three of those investments had been held for more than a decade. The sales of banks at the end of 2022 were well-timed, as the sector sold off following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023.\n\nWarren Buffett's top stocks of all time and long-held positions\n\nBerkshire began buying Coca-Cola's stock in the fall of 1988, eventually building a $1.3 billion position. Just three years later the investment was worth $3.75 billion, more than all of Berkshire at the time of its investment. Buffett saw that Coke had an extremely strong brand with lots of room to grow profitably for many years. In 2023, Berkshire received dividends of $736 million from its Coke holdings and its stake was worth nearly $25 billion.\n\nBerkshire's investment in American Express was built primarily in the mid-1990s, but Buffett had owned the stock in the 1960s in his investment partnership following a scandal that briefly threatened the company's solvency. Buffett told shareholders in his 2022 letter that dividends from American Express to Berkshire have grown from $41 million in 1995 to $302 million in 2022. The dividends reached about $352 million in 2023.\n\nIn early 2000, Berkshire disclosed an investment in Dun & Bradstreet, which spun off Moody's later that year. Moody's credit rating business is extremely profitable and has continued to grow despite periodic calls for reform to the ratings industry. Buffett told the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission in 2010 that he liked Moody's because it had enormous pricing power and \"almost infinite\" returns on tangible assets.\n\nBerkshire disclosed its position in Apple in early 2016, but it was later that year and in early 2017 when Buffett really loaded up on the stock, making it one of Berkshire's largest investments ever. Buffett told shareholders in 2023 that Apple \"just happens to be a better business than any we own.\" Buffett sold some Apple shares from 2018-2020, but told shareholders later that it was a \"dumb decision\" to sell. Buffett told shareholders at the 2024 Berkshire meeting that he'd sold about 13 percent of the Apple position but that it was likely to be a top holding for years to come.\n\nBerkshire invested in Bank of America through preferred stock and warrants in 2011, which were exercised in 2017. Buffett has occasionally added to the position since then, including in the first quarter of 2023. Buffett has invested in many bank stocks over the years and has repeatedly praised Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan. The holding has become one of the largest for Berkshire.", "source": {"uri": "bankrate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bankrate.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_baker@bankrate.com", "name":

Our 2022 trip was partly revengeful travel to compensate for a pandemic-derailed spring break. This year's meeting came at a busy time, so I wasn't exactly jumping to do an eight-hour drive through Chicago rush-hour traffic, endless Iowan cornfields, and prairie lightning storms. It was Isaac who insisted. He had emerged from the 2022 meeting a bit of a Berkshirehead and wanted to see how Charlie Munger's passing would change things.\n\nHe also thinks Warren Buffett is hilarious.\n\nFor me, the Berkshire meeting is as much about values as value investing. I promise Isaac was not the only young person among the more than 30,000 \"Woodstock for Capitalists\" attendees at the CHI Health Center. Since Isaac predictably replied to his mother's questions of \"how was it?\" and \"what did you learn?\" with \"good\" and \"stuff,\" I'm listing some virtues I hope he absorbed from this year's meeting.\n\nWhen a representative of an environmental justice group in Nevada asked a challenging question on utility rates and renewable energy investment, the response was thoughtful and courteous. No matter what or how he's asked, Buffett treats the question with respect.\n\n\"Kindness is free,\" he said, noting that \"the world isn't better if you're richer.\" Buffett has signed the The Giving Pledge, committing 99% of his wealth to philanthropy. Kindness is also essential to the Berkshire business model. Owners want to sell to Berkshire because they know they'll be treated well. I got a classic 14-year-old response when I stressed this point to Isaac: \"yeah, I know it's important to be kind, Dad.\" OK then.\n\nAsking investing successor Greg Abel to weigh in on a question, Buffett accidentally said:\n\n\"Charlie?\"\n\nWarm laughter and applause filled the arena (including from Abel). The traditional opening movie was dedicated to Munger's life and legacy, including some of his most memorable quotes (such as, \"I'd rather throw a viper down my shirt than hire a compensation consultant\") and Buffett crediting him as Berkshire's \"architect.\" It's clear how friendship with Munger enriched Buffett's life and how their partnership enriched Berkshire. For his part, Isaac was disappointed that Berkshire subsidiary Jazwares sold out of their Warren and Charlie Squishmallows position (for his younger siblings, of course).\n\nBuffett took personal responsibility for a failed investment in Paramount (PARA). He answered several questions on artificial intelligence (AI) by admitting he knows nothing about it, except that it's potentially transformative and prone to deepfake scams. Though he is one of Apple's (AAPL) largest shareholders, Buffett quipped there might be a little man inside the iPhone for all he understands about the technology (that elicited a guffaw from a digital native 14-year-old). But he also described himself as someone who wants to know if something works - while Munger needed to know how it worked. Understand and acknowledge limitations. But no, Isaac, you can't skip homework because Algebra falls outside your \"circle of competence.\"\n\nBuffett repeatedly stresses his luck at winning the \"birth lottery\", and to have found something he loves to do and people he loves working with. He thanked others throughout the meeting. Though Buffett attributed his and Munger's longevity to luck (\"Charlie never did a day of physical exercise and did not watch what he ate,\" while Buffett seems to subsist on See's Candies and Coca-Cola), it's likely that disposition has contributed. When asked if he worried about the national debt, Buffett replied \"I'm not a worrier.\" That said, he does \"think about it\" and expressed concern. I told Isaac a positive attitude was not necessarily a substitute for vegetables and swim practice.\n\nWhen asked if he was starting out now with a small sum to invest, Buffett said he'd wade through 20,000 pages of stock information to identify opportunities. He has read The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham at least five times. Munger once said \"in my whole life, I have known no wise people who didn't read all the time - none. Zero. You'd be amazed at how much Warren reads - and how much I read. My children laugh at me. They think I'm a book with a couple of legs sticking out.\" I'm keeping this quote in my back pocket for the next time Isaac spends too long on his PlayStation.\n\nOne attendee asked why Berkshire isn't spending its cash pile, which grew to a record $189 billion (\u00a3152 billion) in the first quarter. As Buffett wrote in the 2008 Berkshire shareholder letter: \"we never want to count on the kindness of strangers in order to meet tomorrow's obligations. When forced to choose, I will not trade even a night's sleep for the chance of extra profits.\" Buffett explained the current cash as a function of a few compelling investment opportunities. Maintaining liquidity gives Berkshire the ability to \"be greedy when others are fearful\" and to take advantage of those \"occasional times when we're the only ones willing to act.\" I decided to spare Isaac yet another lecture on the benefits of deferred consumption and the miracle of compound interest.\n\nApple chief executive Tim Cook attended the meeting and was held out as an example of successful corporate baton passing. Ensuring continuity is critical to legacy building. What future Berkshire leaders Greg Abel and Ajit Jain lack in humour and folksy wisdom, they make up for in intelligence and integrity.\n\nTheir comments on Berkshire businesses BNSF, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and Geico were insightful. Abel ably (sorry, had to do it) summed up Berkshire's culture: \"we treat our shareholders as partners and our managers as owners.\" Isaac told me he might not want to drive eight hours to hear Abel and Jain speak, but he does not plan to sell the Berkshire investment that he will inherit. My succession planning at work.\n\nFrom The Archive: Why Berkshire Hathaway's Success Will Continue After Charlie Munger...and Warren Buffett\n\nThe meeting's first questioner had travelled from Hong Kong and asked if Berkshire would be investing more in China. Several hailed from Germany. One young man had made the trip from New Zealand - another from Malaysia. A passionate Canadian asked if Buffett would allocate more capital north of the border, and an Indian extolled the merits of his home market. Buffett said Berkshire would remain mostly domestic in its investments. But he also keeps tabs on most global markets, repeatedly mentioned Berkshire's Japanese holdings, and explained the company would continue to participate in the global economy through its US-based businesses. Even in the middle of America, Isaac and I felt the importance of global connection.\n\nBuffett repeatedly stresses his luck at having been born in America, and he did so here.\n\nAs he reminded us in the 2020 pandemic-era shareholder letter: \"in its brief 232 years of existence [...] there has been no incubator for unleashing human potential like America [...] Never bet against America.\" In this year's meeting, Buffett wore Berkshire's $5 billion-plus tax bill as a badge of pride and chided other companies for pursuing tax shelters. \"It is beyond arrogance for American business or individuals to boast they have 'done it alone,'\" he once wrote, crediting much of Berkshire's success to the \"American tailwind.\" Patriotism is also good business for Berkshire. \"We want the US government to think we're an asset and not a liability or a supplicant,\" said Buffett, alluding to times Berkshire is able to provide liquidity on favourable terms. On the drive home, Isaac and I reflected on the opportunities enjoyed by generations of our family in this country. In a divisive election year when its problems will be highlighted, America's many strengths should be remembered, too.\n\n\"Thanks for coming. I hope you come back next year,\" Buffett said in closing, before quipping: \"I hope I come back next year.\" Isaac and I hope you do too, Mr. Buffett.", "source": {"uri": "morningstar.co.uk",

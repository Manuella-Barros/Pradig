Southgate named his Three Lions squad heading to Germany for this year's tournament earlier this week, cutting seven players from the provisional 33-man list. One significant surprise was the omission of 28-year-old Grealish, alongside Tottenham Hotspur star James Maddison. Eze, now with three international caps under his belt, was selected over Grealish, along with Jarrod Bowen and Anthony Gordon among others. The Crystal Palace forward was viewed as a fringe choice for the squad but managed to sway Southgate with his commendable performances for Palace this season and his impressive contribution to England's 3-0 friendly win against Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The Independent reports that numerous players in Die Mannschaft were \"stunned\" after seeing the English squad set to compete on German soil over the summer It was also said that Grealish was regarded as a player who \"provokes fear in opposition when he runs at them,\" creating impressions Eze has not achieved just yet, writes the Mirror. Grealish is hailed as one of the most beloved figures in both the dressing room and among fans nationwide, having risen to cult hero status during England's journey to the Euro 2020 (played in 2021) final, with supporters frequently clamouring for Southgate to bring him off the bench. While fellow players such as Maddison and Harry Maguire have voiced their disappointment and rallied behind the Three Lions, Grealish has not yet made a public statement regarding his omission. Explaining his choice to leave Grealish out, Southgate said: \"The players took the news respectfully. \"Of course players believe they should be in and that's why they are top players because they have self-belief and they have that mindset. But the reality is we have players who have been performing exceptionally well throughout the season in the league and we just feel there are other players who have had stronger seasons, especially in the past six months. \"In the attacking department, we're fortunate to have numerous options, all with different qualities. These have been difficult decisions, ones we've mulled over repeatedly as a coaching team to ensure fairness and the correct reasoning. We stand by our decisions, but we acknowledge that we could have chosen a different path.\" Despite clinching his third consecutive Premier League title with City, Grealish faced a challenging season. Pep Guardiola, in February, confessed that the 28-year-old's performances had dipped compared to the previous season, where he proved crucial for the Citizens' treble victory. Yet, Southgate decided against delving deep into his decision not to select Grealish in the wake of his recent form, choosing instead to defend the player. Upon being asked about his reasoning behind the decision, Southgate responded: \"I don't think today would be a good day to talk about the bigger picture. I don't think that would be fair.\" He continued: \"I have just delivered a really difficult conversation to a lad who is devastated. I think the world of him as a kid. Yes. I am not going to go any broader than that.\"", "summary": "Manchester City news as Jack Grealish was one of a number of high-profile omissions from the England squad for Euro 2024 and has left Germany camp surprised", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/stunned-germany-squad-stance-jack-29317359", "image": "https://i2-prod.football.london/incoming/article29317387.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_jack-grealish-man-city.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:31:38", "author": "Patrick Austen-Hardy,Tom Coley", "authors": ["Patrick Austen-Hardy", "Tom Coley"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.342}

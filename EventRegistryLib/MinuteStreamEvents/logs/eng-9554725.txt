This criticism comes in the wake of comments made by Patil, expressing his desire to see Sharad Pawar defeated in the Baramati Lok Sabha seat, a constituency deeply rooted in the Pawar family's political legacy.\n\nAjit Pawar's disapproval was voiced two days after the polling concluded in Baramati, where Ajit's wife, Sunetra Pawar, contested against the incumbent MP Supriya Sule, Sharad Pawar's daughter. The Deputy Chief Minister's reaction highlights the tension between coalition partners in Maharashtra's political arena.\n\nChandrakant Patil, while addressing reporters in Baramati earlier in March, had made clear his intentions to defeat Sharad Pawar in his stronghold. He accused the NCP patriarch of undermining the 2019 election mandate that favored the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance by taking away the Shiv Sena, despite the alliance securing 161 MLA seats. \"I and my party workers want defeat of Sharad Pawar in Baramati and that is enough for us,\" Patil had stated.\n\nResponding to these remarks, Ajit Pawar expressed his discontent by advising Patil to concentrate on BJP's performance in Pune city while leaving the Baramati constituency to him and his party workers. Despite his initial criticism, Ajit Pawar noted that Patil refrained from making further comments on the matter.\n\nThe controversy also saw Supriya Sule accusing the BJP of attempting to politically sideline Sharad Pawar. In defense of Patil's statements, state BJP president Chandrashekhar Bawankule remarked that a sarcastic tone is often employed during elections while canvassing for votes. However, when confronted with Ajit Pawar's public disapproval of Patil's comments, Bawankule chose not to respond.\n\nThis incident underscores the complex dynamics within Maharashtra's ruling coalition and reflects the ongoing rivalry between prominent political families and parties in the state.

{"id": 223749886, "title": "Scammer admits being part of \u00a317,000 telephone banking con that preyed on elderly victims", "text": "A man who was part of a group who scammed an Aberdeenshire pensioner out of \u00a317,000 has been warned he may have to pay her compensation. Tariq Russell, 20, was recruited by his barber to join a criminal gang who were targeting the elderly and vulnerable by calling them up and pretending to be from their bank or a financial institution. Russell, from Motherwell, joined the group and it was his bank account they used to funnel their ill-gotten gains. When Russell was caught, police found only \u00a34,000 in the account, leaving his 67-year-old victim more than \u00a313,000 out of pocket. His solicitor told the Aberdeen Sheriff Court that Russell was merely a lowly bit-part player in the fraud operation. Accused \u2018acted alongside others\u2019 Fiscal depute Victoria Kerr told the court that Russell \u201cplayed a role\u201d in inducing his elderly female victim into providing her bank details from which \u201csums where then transferred\u201d. It saw Russell\u2019s bank account used to transfer money from several bank accounts held in the pensioner\u2019s name on April 1 2021. \u201cThe accused was acting alongside others,\u201d Ms Kerr said, adding that \u201cthe total amount taken was \u00a317,750, with only \u00a34,000 being recovered.\u201d Appearing in the dock, Russell pleaded guilty to one charge of fraud. Defence solicitor Stuart Murray told the court that his client recognised he had taken part in a \u201cvery serious offence\u201d. He stated that Russell had been introduced to a group of men by his barber who told him he could make easy money, in the form of \u00a31,000 for every \u00a310,000 obtained by the scam. Accused \u2018played lesser role\u2019 \u201cMr Russell\u2019s role in these proceedings was on the lower end of the scale,\u201d Mr Murray said. \u201cIt was his bank account that was used and whilst he was entirely aware that something untoward was happening, I\u2019m not sure that initially he understood quite what he was involved in. \u201cWhen he tried to get out of it threats were made. \u201cHe has taken full responsibility for his actions here and accepts his involvement in what went on.\u201d Sheriff David Sutherland asked Mr Murray if anyone else involved in the scheme had been charged over the matter. Mr Murray replied that no one other than his client had been implicated. Sheriff Sutherland deferred sentence on Russell, of Windmill Court, Motherwell, until next month to establish how much could be repaid to the victim in compensation.

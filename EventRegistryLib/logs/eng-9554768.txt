The Archdiocese has refused to comply with Ferguson's investigation into whether the three Washington dioceses of the Catholic Church used charitable funds to cover up allegations of child sex abuse by clergy.\n\nThe Attorney General's Office sent subpoenas to the Seattle Archdiocese, the Diocese of Spokane and the Diocese of Yakima. The Seattle Archdiocese refused to cooperate. Consequently, Ferguson filed a petition to enforce the subpoena in King County Superior Court. The office is asking the court to hear the petition on May 22.\n\nThe Attorney General's Office has a longstanding policy that it does not comment on investigations, including confirming whether they exist. Because the Seattle Archdiocese refused to comply with the office's subpoena, the office now must seek a court order to move the investigation forward. This process made the investigation public.\n\n\"Washingtonians deserve a public accounting of how the Catholic Church handles allegations of child sex abuse, and whether charitable dollars were used to cover it up,\" Ferguson said. \"As a Catholic, I am disappointed the Church refuses to cooperate with our investigation. Our goal is to use every tool we have to reveal the truth, and give a voice to survivors. If you or a loved one have been impacted by clergy abuse, please contact my office.\"\n\nSurvivor Esther Lucero-Miner issued a statement in support of the investigation: \"Like too many other women (and men too), I experienced sexual abuse at the hands of a priest, my Catholic pastor. ... For years, I believed that family and friends and the community, would believe and defend the priest. I was terrified of being labeled and becoming an outcast, so I kept quiet. For too long, I felt estranged from my community of faith. I was reticent to go to church because I did not trust that I would be safe in what should be a holy and sacred place, this abuse engulfed my life. For me, the struggle is not over. As with any significant injury, the pain of the incident never completely goes away. ... I strongly support the investigation by the Attorney General into the Catholic dioceses of Washington state. It is long overdue in my opinion and will be an important step in the healing that our Church deserves.\"\n\nAdvocacy organization Heal Our Church offered a statement: \"For too long the faithful have been kept in the dark regarding the 'how and why' of this sordid chapter of Church history. We call on the Church, and its legal representatives, to cooperate fully with the investigation by granting full access to all relevant records, including internal chancery memos, attorney correspondence and financial information. Church members and survivors deserve no less.\"\n\nIf the investigation reveals any violation of the law, the Attorney General's Office will take all steps within its power to seek justice, and to put in place any appropriate oversight and monitoring to ensure that children are not exposed to abuse in the future.\n\nSurvivors of clergy sexual abuse and their loved ones can contact the Attorney General's Office at 833-952-6277.\n\nLegal approach\n\nThe Attorney General's Office has authority under the Charitable Trusts Act to investigate organizations' use of charitable funds.\n\nThe three Catholic dioceses in Washington are organized as a special type of corporation under Washington law -- a \"corporation sole\" -- that holds assets in trust for religious and charitable purposes. The Attorney General's investigation is aimed at uncovering whether these charitable funds were used to conceal the sexual abuse of Washingtonians.\n\nThere is reason to believe that the Seattle Archdiocese knew about certain priests' abusive behavior, but used its resources to protect and support the abusers instead of their victims. For example, publicly available information indicates that the Seattle Archdiocese knew for decades that Father Michael J. Cody repeatedly sexually abused children, but it allowed him to stay in positions of power and moved him to different parishes periodically to hide his predations, giving him access to new victims while continuing to support him financially.\n\nCalls for transparency\n\nWhen Ferguson opened his investigation, he and his team reached out to organizations supporting and advocating for survivors of childhood sexual abuse. At the center of these conversations has been the desire that people of faith have to bring daylight to allegations of sexual abuse and efforts to cover up that abuse.\n\nThe Catholic Church has in recent years made a number of reports about clergy sexual abuse, including publicizing the names of current and former priests that it determined to have been \"credibly\" accused of sexual abuse.\n\nThese claims are evaluated by the church itself. When state attorneys general have conducted their own investigations, some have found a dramatically greater number of credible allegations.\n\nFor example, when the Illinois Attorney General's Office published its report in 2023, it listed four times as many substantiated child sex abusers than the dioceses of Illinois had previously disclosed - 451 compared to 103.\n\nInvestigation timeline\n\nThe Attorney General's Office has primarily civil legal authority, a significant difference from other states that have announced similar investigations. Many states have used grand juries to conduct their investigations, an authority the attorney general does not have in Washington.\n\nIn 2021, Washington State Supreme Court issued a decision that said a statutory religious exemption from a state law did not cover a church's secular activities, where exempting the church from the law would affect another person's fundamental rights.\n\nWhile Washington's Charitable Trust Act contains an exemption for religious organizations, Ferguson argues that there is no reasonable ground for applying this immunity to an investigation focused on sexual abuse. Therefore, his office has the authority to investigate whether the church has misused charitable trust funds to cover up systemic sexual abuse and shield abusive priests.\n\nFerguson subsequently opened a formal investigation, and sent the first round of subpoenas to the Seattle, Spokane and Yakima dioceses in summer of 2023.\n\nThe dioceses only responded with information that was already public. They did not fully respond to the subpoena.\n\nThe office sent a second set of subpoenas this spring seeking additional information, including accounting and financial records.\n\nThe Seattle Archdiocese refused to respond. The office filed today's petition to enforce its subpoenas as a result.\n\nThe office has not yet taken action against the Spokane and Yakima dioceses, but is prepared to do so if they refuse to comply.\n\nInvestigations by other attorneys general\n\nIncluding Washington, 23 state attorneys general have announced investigations into the Catholic Church - 27 have not.\n\nIn the past five years, six states have produced reports detailing their findings. Many investigations are ongoing.\n\n-30-", "source": {"uri": "atg.wa.gov", "dataType": "news", "title": "Attorney General"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese",

The archdiocese publicly identified at least 79 clergy members \"as credibly accused\" sex offenders in 2016, based on its own private evaluations. But for years, it has resisted advocates' calls and media requests to release its secret files about clergy abuse, or allow independent investigators to inspect them.\n\nFerguson's announcement also marked the first time he has acknowledged the existence of his investigation, which has been active since at least July.\n\nIn February, his office declined to confirm or deny the probe after a group of anti-clergy abuse activists held a press conference to contend that he was hiding the investigation from the public.\n\nThe announcement from Ferguson, a Democrat who is running for governor, came two days after NBC News pressed his office to disclose copies of the subpoenas that a reporter requested under Washington's Public Records Act in March. Without confirming whether they existed, the attorney general's office delayed its disclosure for more than two months by contending it was still searching for records.\n\nFerguson's subpoenas, made public for the first time this week and shared with NBC News late Wednesday, clarify the legal underpinning for the probe. The first subpoena cites his office's authority to \"investigate transactions and relationships of trustees and other persons\" under Washington's Charitable Trust Act, which regulates certain tax-exempt corporations and entities that hold charitable assets in trust.\n\nA civil subpoena has never been used in Washington to investigate a religious organization, according to a legal analysis provided to Ferguson's office and obtained by NBC News.\n\nFerguson's approach is similar to one that New York Attorney General Leticia James used in 2020 to sue the Catholic Diocese of Buffalo, based on state civil laws regulating charities. James' suit led to a landmark settlement in 2022.\n\nFerguson's first set of subpoenas to Washington's Catholic dioceses each include a cover letter dated July 26, signed by him and sent separately to Etienne, Yakima Bishop Joseph Tyson and Rev. Victor Blazovich, the vicar of finance for Spokane's bishop.\n\nFerguson's letter contends that while Washington's Charitable Trust Act exempts religious organizations, \"the exclusion does not apply in the context of child sexual abuse, a heinous violation with no connection to religion or an entity's religious status.\"\n\nThe accompanying subpoenas list demands and instructions for each diocese to produce more than 20 categories of records, including all reports about sexual abuse allegations made against priests and other clergy members, employees and volunteers since Jan. 1, 1940.\n\nThe records demanded include those containing allegations against priests and others whom the dioceses already have publicly identified as \"credibly accused\" sexual abusers, as well as those they have not. The subpoenas also demand the dioceses to turn over communications with the Vatican about sexual abuse claims, and records showing church policies for compensating victims who alleged sexual abuse and accounting for any such payments that have been made.\n\nAll three dioceses had initially been given until Aug. 25, 2023, to comply with the first subpoenas, the records show.\n\n\"The dioceses only responded with information that was already public. They did not fully respond to the subpoena,\" Ferguson's office said in its statement.\n\nFerguson's office also released copies of a second set of \"amended subpoenas\" that were issued last month to the three dioceses. Each includes demands for production of all previously identified records, plus five additional categories of records mostly about finances and accounting.\n\nThe Seattle Archdiocese had been given until May 10 to comply with Ferguson's latest subpoena but notified the office this week that it objects to the subpoena and would not be complying, according to the attorney general's office.\n\nThe deadline for the Yakima and Spokane dioceses to comply with their latest subpoenas is May 22, the records show.\n\nNeither diocese immediately responded to NBC News' requests for comment Thursday.",

The archdiocese shares the state's goals -- \"preventing abuse and helping victim survivors on their path to healing and peace,\" it said.\n\n\"We have a good understanding of the content of our files and we have no concern about sharing them with the Attorney General lawfully and fairly,\" the statement said.\n\nFerguson, a Catholic himself, told a news conference that the archdiocese has refused to provide even a single document that had not already been made public, claiming an exemption as a religious institution. The archdiocese disputed that as well, saying it offered this week to provide private deposition documents, but that the attorney general's office said it wasn't interested.\n\nPeople are also reading...

WJBC mourns loss of former radio host Scott Laughlin\n\nFerguson said the archdiocese ignored a second subpoena issued this spring seeking records on how the church handled allegations of sex abuse, including financial records related to how it may have spent charitable trust money moving priests from parish to parish after they were accused of sex abuse.\n\n\"The church has more information than it has shared with the public,\" Ferguson said. \"We believe the public is entitled to see those records.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nSome 23 states have conducted investigations of the Catholic church, and so far at least nine have issued reports detailing their findings. In some cases, those findings have gone far beyond what church officials had voluntarily disclosed.\n\nFor example, the six Catholic dioceses in Illinois had reported publicly that there had been 103 clerics and religious brothers credibly accused of child sex abuse. But in a scathing report last year, the Illinois attorney general's office said it had uncovered detailed information on 451 who had sexually abused at least 1,997 children.\n\nSimilarly, Maryland last year reported staggering evidence of just how widespread the abuse was: More than 150 Catholic priests and others associated with the Archdiocese of Baltimore sexually abused over 600 children and often escaped accountability. In 2018, a Pennsylvania grand jury found that more than 300 Catholic clerics had abused more than 1,000 children in that state over the prior 70 years.\n\nThe Seattle Archdiocese has published a list of 83 clerics it says were credibly accused, and it says that beginning in the 1980s it was one of the first in the nation to begin adopting policies to address and prevent sexual abuse by priests. Sexual abuse by church personnel peaked in 1975, and there have been no reports since 2007, the archdiocese said.\n\nBut despite decades of lawsuits by survivors of clerical sex abuse, the extent of the scandal in Washington state remains unknown, Ferguson said, because the church has not released its files or explained why it found allegations against other priests less than credible.\n\nAccusers, who have long demanded that the church open its books, welcomed Ferguson's announcement and said they regretted its necessity. Transparency is essential for the church to heal, said Terry Carroll, a member of the steering committee at Heal Our Church, a Catholic church reform organization in Washington.\n\n\"We call on the church and its legal representatives to cooperate fully with the investigation by granting full access to all relevant records, including internal chancellery memos, attorneys correspondence and financial information,\" Carroll said during the news conference Thursday. \"Church members and survivors deserve no less.\"\n\nFerguson's investigation is civil, not criminal, and focuses on the three dioceses in Washington -- Seattle, Spokane and Yakima. He said the Spokane and Yakima dioceses have refused to provide documents, but the attorney general's office is not yet seeking court orders to force them to comply.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

whether the Catholic Church used charitable funds to cover up sex abuse.\n\nAttorney General Bob Ferguson announced on May 9 that his office is looking into whether three Washington dioceses covered up alleged abuse by clergy members.\n\n\"Washingtonians deserve a public accounting of how the Catholic Church handles allegations of child sex abuse, and whether charitable dollars were used to cover it up,\" Ferguson said.\n\nThe Seattle, Spokane and Yakima Dioceses were sent subpoenas in the summer of 2023, followed by a new round of subpoenas in the spring of 2024 seeking accounting and financial records, according to the AG's Office.\n\nIt has long been the policy of the AG's Office to not comment on investigations, including to confirm or deny that they are taking place, according to a press release on the legal action.\n\nHowever, the Seattle Archdiocese has refused to comply with the subpoena and a court order is now required for the investigation to proceed, the investigation has been made public.\n\nThe AG's Office has filed a petition in King County Superior Court to enforce the subpoena and is asking the court to consider the case on May 22.\n\nUnder the Charitable Trust Act, the AG's Office has the authority to investigate an organizations' use of charitable funds.\n\nIf the announced investigation finds any violation of the law, the AG's Office will take steps to seek justice and put measures in place to ensure that children are not exposed to abuse in the future, according to today's press release.\n\nThe three dioceses in Washington are organized as a \"corporation sole\" that holds assets in trust for religious and charitable purposes.\n\nAccording to the AG's Office, its investigation hopes to uncover whether these charitable funds were used to conceal the sexual abuse of Washingtonians.\n\n\"Our goal is to use every tool we have to reveal the truth, and give a voice to survivors,\" Ferguson said.\n\nFOX41 Yakima\u00a9FOX11

The archdiocese shares the state's goals -- \"preventing abuse and helping victim survivors on their path to healing and peace,\" it said.\n\n\"We have a good understanding of the content of our files and we have no concern about sharing them with the Attorney General lawfully and fairly,\" the statement said.\n\nFerguson, a Catholic himself, told a news conference that the archdiocese has refused to provide even a single document that had not already been made public, claiming an exemption as a religious institution. The archdiocese disputed that as well, saying it offered this week to provide private deposition documents, but that the attorney general's office said it wasn't interested.\n\nFerguson said the archdiocese ignored a second subpoena issued this spring seeking records on how the church handled allegations of sex abuse, including financial records related to how it may have spent charitable trust money moving priests from parish to parish after they were accused of sex abuse.\n\n\"The church has more information than it has shared with the public,\" Ferguson said. \"We believe the public is entitled to see those records.\"\n\nSome 23 states have conducted investigations of the Catholic church, and so far at least nine have issued reports detailing their findings. In some cases, those findings have gone far beyond what church officials had voluntarily disclosed.\n\nFor example, the six Catholic dioceses in Illinois had reported publicly that there had been 103 clerics and religious brothers credibly accused of child sex abuse. But in a scathing report last year, the Illinois attorney general's office said it had uncovered detailed information on 451 who had sexually abused at least 1,997 children.\n\nSimilarly, Maryland last year reported staggering evidence of just how widespread the abuse was: More than 150 Catholic priests and others associated with the Archdiocese of Baltimore sexually abused over 600 children and often escaped accountability. In 2018, a Pennsylvania grand jury found that more than 300 Catholic clerics had abused more than 1,000 children in that state over the prior 70 years.\n\nThe Seattle Archdiocese has published a list of 83 clerics it says were credibly accused, and it says that beginning in the 1980s it was one of the first in the nation to begin adopting policies to address and prevent sexual abuse by priests. Sexual abuse by church personnel peaked in 1975, and there have been no reports since 2007, the archdiocese said.\n\nBut despite decades of lawsuits by survivors of clerical sex abuse, the extent of the scandal in Washington state remains unknown, Ferguson said, because the church has not released its files or explained why it found allegations against other priests less than credible.\n\nAccusers, who have long demanded that the church open its books, welcomed Ferguson's announcement and said they regretted its necessity. Transparency is essential for the church to heal, said Terry Carroll, a member of the steering committee at Heal Our Church, a Catholic church reform organization in Washington.\n\n\"We call on the church and its legal representatives to cooperate fully with the investigation by granting full access to all relevant records, including internal chancellery memos, attorneys correspondence and financial information,\" Carroll said during the news conference Thursday. \"Church members and survivors deserve no less.\"\n\nFerguson's investigation is civil, not criminal, and focuses on the three dioceses in Washington -- Seattle, Spokane and Yakima. He said the Spokane and Yakima dioceses have refused to provide documents, but the attorney general's office is not yet seeking court orders to force them to comply.", "source": {"uri": "apnews.com",

The archdiocese disputed that as well, saying it offered this week to provide private deposition documents, but that the attorney general's office said it wasn't interested.\n\nFerguson said the archdiocese ignored a second subpoena issued this spring seeking records on how the church handled allegations of sex abuse, including financial records related to how it may have spent charitable trust money moving priests from parish to parish after they were accused of sex abuse.\n\n\"The church has more information than it has shared with the public,\" Ferguson said. \"We believe the public is entitled to see those records.\"\n\nFILE - Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson is seen, April 27, 2023, at the University of Washington's Hans Rosling Center for Population Health in Seattle.

(AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson, File)\n\nSome 23 states have conducted investigations of the Catholic church, and so far at least nine have issued reports detailing their findings. In some cases, those findings have gone far beyond what church officials had voluntarily disclosed.\n\nFor example, the six Catholic dioceses in Illinois had reported publicly that there had been 103 clerics and religious brothers credibly accused of child sex abuse. But in a scathing report last year, the Illinois attorney general's office said it had uncovered detailed information on 451 who had sexually abused at least 1,997 children.\n\nSimilarly, Maryland last year reported staggering evidence of just how widespread the abuse was: More than 150 Catholic priests and others associated with the Archdiocese of Baltimore sexually abused over 600 children and often escaped accountability. In 2018, a Pennsylvania grand jury found that more than 300 Catholic clerics had abused more than 1,000 children in that state over the prior 70 years.\n\nThe Seattle Archdiocese has published a list of 83 clerics it says were credibly accused, and it says that beginning in the 1980s it was one of the first in the nation to begin adopting policies to address and prevent sexual abuse by priests. Sexual abuse by church personnel peaked in 1975, and there have been no reports since 2007, the archdiocese said.\n\nBut despite decades of lawsuits by survivors of clerical sex abuse, the extent of the scandal in Washington state remains unknown, Ferguson said, because the church has not released its files or explained why it found allegations against other priests less than credible.\n\nAccusers, who have long demanded that the church open its books, welcomed Ferguson's announcement and said they regretted its necessity. Transparency is essential for the church to heal, said Terry Carroll, a member of the steering committee at Heal Our Church, a Catholic church reform organization in Washington.\n\n\"We call on the church and its legal representatives to cooperate fully with the investigation by granting full access to all relevant records, including internal chancellery memos, attorneys correspondence and financial information,\" Carroll said during the news conference Thursday. \"Church members and survivors deserve no less.\"\n\nFerguson's investigation is civil, not criminal, and focuses on the three dioceses in Washington - Seattle, Spokane and Yakima. He said the Spokane and Yakima dioceses have refused to provide documents, but the attorney general's office is not yet seeking court orders to force them to comply.", "source": {"uri":

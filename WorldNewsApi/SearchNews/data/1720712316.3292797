The Adare woman was just two votes from the quota in the fifth count and she got in on count six, so her wait was particularly harrowing with the end in sight for such a long time. Speaking to Limerick Live as she was still reeling from the results, she said: \u201cIt always comes down to the wire, doesn\u2019t it? It makes it so much more exciting.\u201d She said they have a good mandate now and she will be working on the water issue in Foynes. Cllr Collins thanked the campaign team who have helped her along the way, canvassed for her and all those who gave her a vote.

Being just two votes was agonisingly close. She said: \u201cTwo votes you\u2019re nearly there and it\u2019s just making sure you get those two votes and I did.\u201d Cllr Collins said the whole process and how close it all gets just goes to show how every vote can make such a huge difference and that\u2019s why preference voting is so important. She added that she\u2019s looking forward to working with the directly elected mayor and to make sure that the Adare-Rathkeale area gets its share of funding from the mayor\u2019s fund.", "summary": "<table><tr><td><img src=\"https://www.limerickleader.ie/resizer/300/200/true/2024_06_09/ilim_Bridie_Collins_elected_9-6-24_1-1717939500147.jpg--.jpg?1717939503382\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\" />IT WAS down to the wire for Fianna F\u00e1il Cllr Bridie Collins, who has now retained her seat in the Adare-Rathkeale area.

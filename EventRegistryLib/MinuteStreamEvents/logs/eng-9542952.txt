They come against the backdrop of China's increasingly assertive actions in the disputed South China Sea, where Chinese and Philippine coast guards and accompanying ships have had several increasingly tense faceoffs since last year.\n\nMore than 250 French and Australian forces are also participating, along with observers from several allied and security partner nations, led by Japan and European nations. The drills, which began April 22, end later this week.\n\nIn Monday's mock battle scenario, American and Filipino forces took positions at the airfield, ringed by low-lying hills, as three Army CH-47 Chinook helicopters landed to deliver combat supplies.\n\nMarine 1st Lt. Annie Pentaleri said aerial combat reconnaissance and counter-reconnaissance drills were also planned in the far-flung region. The Associated Press was among a small group of journalists invited to attend the maneuvers.\n\n\"We are absolutely battle-ready and that's what we train for day in and day out,\" Marine Maj. Robert Patterson said. \"It's important to enhance interoperability with our Filipino counterparts.\"\n\nWashington and Manila say the drills are not directed at any country and are crucial for improving the response to emergencies in the Philippines, one of the world's most disaster-prone countries.\n\nHowever, this year's drills focus on territorial defense and are being staged mainly in two of the most sensitive fault lines in the regional rivalry between China and the United States: the disputed South China Sea and the Bashi Channel.\n\nThe critical waterway between Taiwan and the Philippines, an important trade conduit laden with international undersea cables, has been closely watched and guarded by Chinese and American forces. China considers Taiwan a part of its territory, to be annexed by force if necessary.\n\nIn a telephone call last month, Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed to President Joe Biden that Beijing will not tolerate separatist activities by Taiwan's independence forces, as well as \"exterior indulgence and support,\" an apparent reference to Washington's support for the island.\n\nBiden raised concerns about China's actions in the South China Sea, including efforts to impede the Philippines, which Washington is treaty-obligated to defend, from resupplying its forces on the fiercely disputed Second Thomas Shoal.\n\nDerek Grossman, a senior defense analyst at RAND Corporation, said the message of deterrence was important. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s decision to allow U.S. forces indefinite access to two Philippine air force and naval bases in Cagayan province near Batanes under a 2014 defense pact, \"would likely upgrade the U.S. military's ability to intervene in a Taiwan contingency in a more timely manner,\" he said.\n\n\"Right now, a big concern is the U.S. simply won't get there in time,\" Grossman added.\n\nThe Balikatan exercises have included live-fire drills in the disputed South China Sea during joint naval sails by the U.S., France and the Philippines. An aircraft also dropped food and other supplies on a disputed island occupied by Filipino forces as part of the maneuvers in the disputed waters.\n\nSeparately on Monday, U.S. and Philippine forces practiced repelling invading forces in the coastal province of Ilocos Norte by firing missiles and artillery rounds on floating targets at sea. The northwestern province faces the South China Sea.\n\n\"It was a huge success, the weapons were spot on,\" Marine Lt. Gen. Michael Cederholm said.\n\nIn escalating high-seas encounters in disputed areas, Chinese coast guard vessels have resorted to water cannons, blocking and other dangerous maneuvers that have left Philippine navy personnel injured and supply boats damaged. The Biden administration has repeatedly warned the U.S. is obligated to defend the Philippines, its oldest treaty ally in Asia, should it come under attack.\n\nChina has strongly criticized the exercises, saying the Philippines and countries outside Asia are joining forces against Beijing, warned that the drills could lead to confrontation and undermine regional stability.\n\nAhead of the drills, China specifically opposed the transport of a U.S. ground-launched missile system to the northern Philippines. No missile was to be fired as the goal was only to familiarize military participants with the hi-tech weaponry in a tropical setting.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian expressed

They come against the backdrop of China's increasingly assertive actions in the disputed South China Sea, where Chinese and Philippine coast guards and accompanying ships have had several increasingly tense faceoffs since last year.\n\nMore than 250 French and Australian forces are also participating, along with observers from several allied and security partner nations, led by Japan and European nations. The drills, which began April 22, end later this week.\n\nIn Monday's mock battle scenario, American and Filipino forces took positions at the airfield, ringed by low-lying hills, as three Army CH-47 Chinook helicopters landed to deliver combat supplies.\n\nMarine 1st Lt. Annie Pentaleri said aerial combat reconnaissance and counter-reconnaissance drills were also planned in the far-flung region. The Associated Press was among a small group of journalists invited to attend the maneuvers.\n\n\"We are absolutely battle-ready and that's what we train for day in and day out,\" Marine Maj. Robert Patterson said. \"It's important to enhance inter-operability with our Filipino counterparts.\"\n\nWashington and Manila say the drills are not directed at any country and are crucial for improving the response to emergencies in the Philippines, one of the world's most disaster-prone countries.\n\nHowever, this year's drills focus on territorial defense and are being staged mainly in two of the most sensitive fault lines in the regional rivalry between China and the United States: the disputed South China Sea and the Bashi Channel.\n\nThe critical waterway between Taiwan and the Philippines, an important trade conduit laden with international undersea cables, has been closely watched and guarded by Chinese and American forces. China considers Taiwan a part of its territory, to be annexed by force if necessary.\n\nIn a telephone call last month, Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed to U.S. President Joe Biden that Beijing will not tolerate separatist activities by Taiwan's independence forces, as well as \"exterior indulgence and support,\" an apparent reference to Washington's support for the island.\n\nBiden raised concerns about China's actions in the South China Sea, including efforts to impede the Philippines, which Washington is treaty-obligated to defend, from resupplying its forces on the fiercely disputed Second Thomas Shoal.\n\nDerek Grossman, a senior defense analyst at RAND Corporation, said the message of deterrence was important. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s decision to allow U.S. forces indefinite access to two Philippine air force and naval bases in Cagayan province near Batanes under a 2014 defense pact, \"would likely upgrade the U.S. military's ability to intervene in a Taiwan contingency in a more timely manner,\" he said.\n\n\"Right now, a big concern is the U.S. simply won't get there in time,\" Grossman added.\n\nThe Balikatan exercises have included live-fire drills in the disputed South China Sea during joint naval sails by the U.S., France, and the Philippines. An aircraft also dropped food and other supplies on a disputed island occupied by Filipino forces as part of the maneuvers in the disputed waters.\n\nSeparately on Monday, U.S. and Philippine forces practiced repelling invading forces in the coastal province of Ilocos Norte by firing missiles and artillery rounds on floating targets at sea. The northwestern province faces the South China Sea.\n\n\"It was a huge success, the weapons were spot on,\" Marine Lt. Gen. Michael Cederholm said.\n\nIn escalating high-seas encounters in disputed areas, Chinese coast guard vessels have resorted to water cannons, blocking and other dangerous maneuvers that have left Philippine navy personnel injured and supply boats damaged. The Biden administration has repeatedly warned the U.S. is obligated to defend the Philippines, its oldest treaty ally in Asia, should it come under attack.\n\nChina has strongly criticized the exercises, saying the Philippines and countries outside Asia are joining forces against Beijing, warned that the drills could lead to confrontation and undermine regional stability.\n\nAhead of the drills, China specifically opposed the transport of a U.S. ground-launched missile system to the northern Philippines. No missile was to be fired as the goal was only to familiarize military participants with the hi-tech weaponry in a tropical setting.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian expressed China's grave concern over the deployment of the missile system \"at China's doorstep.\"", "source": {"uri": "thediplomat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Diplomat Magazine"}, "authors": [],

The drills, which started April 22 and end Friday, include a scenario of a foreign invasion of the Philippine archipelago.\n\nIt's the latest indication of how the United States and the Philippines have bolstered a defense treaty alliance that started in the 1950s amid their concern in recent years over China's increasingly aggressive actions in disputed territories in Asia.\n\nMarcos has ordered his military to shift its focus to external defense from decades-long domestic anti-insurgency operations as China's actions in the South China Sea become a top concern. That strategic shift dovetails with the efforts of U.S. President Joe Biden and his administration to reinforce an arc of alliances in the Indo-Pacific region to counter China.\n\nChina has angered the Philippines by repeatedly harassing its navy and coast guard ships with powerful water cannons, a military-grade laser, blocking movements and other dangerous maneuvers in the high seas near two disputed South China Sea shoals. They have led to minor collision that have injured several Filipino navy personnel and damaged supply boats.\n\n\"We're under the gun,\" Philippine Ambassador to Washington Jose Romualdez told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.\n\n\"We don't have the wherewithal to be able to fight all of this bullying coming from China so where else will we go?\" Romualdez said. \"We went to the right party, which is the United States and those that believe in what the US is doing.\"\n\nChina has accused the Philippines of setting off the hostilities in the disputed waters by encroaching in what it says are its offshore territories, demarcated by 10 dashes on a map. It says the Chinese coast guard and navy have been forced to take action to expel Philippine coast guard and other vessels from those areas. The Philippines has repeatedly cited a 2016 international arbitration ruling based on the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea that invalidated China's claim over virtually the entire South China Sea on historical grounds.\n\nChina did not participate in the arbitration complaint filed by the Philippines in 2013, and has rejected the ruling and continues to defy it.\n\nAfter being hit repeatedly by missile and artillery fire and bombs dropped by U.S. and Philippine warplanes during the combat drills, the mock enemy ship sank as black smoke billowed from its stern. The target ship was made in China but decommissioned by the Philippine navy in 2020 due to mechanical and electrical issues, according to the Philippine military.\n\nPhilippine military officials said the drills were not directed at any country. China has opposed military drills involving U.S. forces as well as increasing U.S. military deployments in the region, which it warned would escalate tensions and endanger regional stability.\n\nFor the first time in years, the combat exercises were staged in and near the fiercely contested Spratly Islands area, which China has closely guarded with its coast guard, navy and suspected militia flotillas.\n\nOn Monday, US and Filipino marines transported by Black Hawk helicopters practiced securing an airfield in the country's northernmost town of Itbayat along the Bashi Channel near southern Taiwan. A small group of journalists, including from the AP, was invited to witness the air and ground combat maneuvers.\n\n\"They're not operating in safe areas. They're operating slightly further to the western bounds and they're doing that in order to practice in ways that they might have to work for real,\" said British Defense Attache to Manila Bea Walcot, who watched the ship-sinking drill.\n\nWashington and Beijing have been on a collision course over China's increasingly assertive actions to defend its territorial claims in the South China Sea, and Beijing's stated goal of annexing Taiwan, by force if necessary.\n\nIn February last year, Marcos approved a wider US military presence in the Philippines by allowing rotating groups of American military forces to stay in four more Philippine military camps. That was a sharp turnaround from his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, who feared that a larger American military footprint would antagonize Beijing.\n\nChina strongly opposed the move, which allows US forces to establish staging grounds and surveillance posts in the northern Philippines across the channel from Taiwan, and in western Philippine provinces facing the South China Sea.\n\nChina has warned that the deepening security alliance between Washington and Manila and their ongoing military drills should not harm its security and territorial interests or interfere in the territorial disputes. The Philippines countered that it has the right to defend its sovereignty and territorial interests.\n\n\"An alliance is very important to show China that you may have all the ships that you have, but we have a lot of firepower to sink all of them,\" Romualdez said.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The drills, which started April 22 and end Friday, include a scenario of a foreign invasion of the Philippine archipelago.\n\nIt's the latest indication of how the United States and the Philippines have bolstered a defense treaty alliance that started in the 1950s amid their concern in recent years over China's increasingly aggressive actions in disputed territories in Asia.\n\nMarcos has ordered his military to shift its focus to external defense from decades-long domestic anti-insurgency operations as China's actions in the South China Sea become a top concern. That strategic shift dovetails with the efforts of President Joe Biden and his administration to reinforce an arc of alliances in the Indo-Pacific region to counter China.\n\nChina has angered the Philippines by repeatedly harassing its navy and coast guard ships with powerful water cannons, a military-grade laser, blocking movements and other dangerous maneuvers in the high seas near two disputed South China Sea shoals. They have led to minor collision that have injured several Filipino navy personnel and damaged supply boats.\n\n\"We're under the gun,\" Philippine Ambassador to Washington Jose Romualdez told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.\n\n\"We don't have the wherewithal to be able to fight all of this bullying coming from China so where else will we go?\" Romualdez said. \"We went to the right party, which is the United States and those that believe in what the U.S. is doing.\"\n\nChina has accused the Philippines of setting off the hostilities in the disputed waters by encroaching in what it says are its offshore territories, demarcated by 10 dashes on a map.

The Philippines has repeatedly cited a 2016 international arbitration ruling based on the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea that invalidated China's claim over virtually the entire South China Sea on historical grounds.\n\nREAD MORE: The Philippine President Marcos says he won't give U.S. access to more local military bases\n\nChina did not participate in the arbitration complaint filed by the Philippines in 2013, and has rejected the ruling and continues to defy it.\n\nAfter being hit repeatedly by missile and artillery fire and bombs dropped by U.S. and Philippine warplanes during the combat drills, the mock enemy ship sank as black smoke billowed from its stern. The target ship was made in China but decommissioned by the Philippine navy in 2020 due to mechanical and electrical issues, according to the Philippine military.\n\nPhilippine military officials said the drills were not directed at any country. China has opposed military drills involving U.S. forces as well as increasing U.S. military deployments in the region, which it warned would escalate tensions and endanger regional stability.\n\nFor the first time in years, the combat exercises were staged in and near the fiercely contested Spratly Islands area, which China has closely guarded with its coast guard, navy and suspected militia flotillas.\n\nOn Monday, U.S. and Filipino marines transported by Black Hawk helicopters practiced securing an airfield in the country's northernmost town of Itbayat along the Bashi Channel near southern Taiwan.

That was a sharp turnaround from his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, who feared that a larger American military footprint would antagonize Beijing.\n\nChina strongly opposed the move, which allows U.S. forces to establish staging grounds and surveillance posts in the northern Philippines across the channel from Taiwan, and in western Philippine provinces facing the South China Sea.\n\nChina has warned that the deepening security alliance between Washington and Manila and their ongoing military drills should not harm its security and territorial interests or interfere in the territorial disputes.

They come against the backdrop of China's increasingly assertive actions in the disputed South China Sea, where Chinese and Philippine coast guards and accompanying ships have had several increasingly tense faceoffs since last year.\n\nPHILIPPINE PRESIDENT REJECTS FURTHER US MILITARY ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL ARMY CAMPS\n\nMore than 250 French and Australian forces are also participating, along with observers from several allied and security partner nations, led by Japan and European nations. The drills, which began April 22, end later this week.\n\nIn Monday's mock battle scenario, American and Filipino forces took positions at the airfield, ringed by low-lying hills, as three Army CH-47 Chinook helicopters landed to deliver combat supplies.\n\nMarine 1st Lt. Annie Pentaleri said there would also be aerial combat reconnaissance and counter-reconnaissance drills in the far-flung region. The Associated Press was among a small group of journalists invited to attend the maneuvers.\n\n\"We are absolutely battle-ready and that's what we train for day in and day out,\" Marine Maj. Robert Patterson said. \"It's important to enhance inter-operability with our Filipino counterparts.\"\n\nUS, AUSTRALIA, JAPAN AND PHILIPPINES VOW TO DEEPEN DEFENSE COOPERATION AMID SOUTH CHINA SEA TENSIONS\n\nWashington and Manila say the drills are not directed at any country and are crucial for improving the response to emergencies in the Philippines, one of the world's most disaster-prone countries.\n\nHowever, this year's drills focus on territorial defense and are being staged mainly in two of the most sensitive fault lines in the regional rivalry between China and the United States: the disputed South China Sea and the Bashi Channel.\n\nThe critical waterway between Taiwan and the Philippines, an important trade conduit laden with international undersea cables, has been closely watched and guarded by Chinese and American forces. China considers Taiwant a part of its territory, to be annexed by force if necessary.\n\nIn a telephone call last month, Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed to President Joe Biden that Beijing will not tolerate separatist activities by Taiwan's independence forces, as well as \"exterior indulgence and support,\" an apparent reference to Washington's support for the island.\n\nBiden raised concerns about China's actions in the South China Sea, including efforts to impede the Philippines, which Washington is treaty-obligated to defend, from resupplying its forces on the fiercely disputed Second Thomas Shoal.\n\nThe Balikatan exercises have included live-fire drills in the disputed South China Sea during joint naval sails by the U.S., France and the Philippines. An aircraft also dropped food and other supplies on a disputed island occupied by Filipino forces as part of the maneuvers in the disputed waters.\n\nSeparately on Monday, U.S. and Philippine forces practiced repelling invading forces in the coastal province of Ilocos Norte by firing missiles and artillery rounds on floating targets at sea. The northwestern province faces the South China Sea.\n\n\"It was a huge success, the weapons were spot on,\" Marine Lt. Gen. Michael Cederholm said.\n\nIn escalating high-seas encounters in disputed areas, Chinese coast guard vessels have resorted to water cannons, blocking and other dangerous maneuvers that have left Philippine navy personnel injured and supply boats damaged. The Biden administration has repeatedly warned the U.S. is obligated to defend the Philippines, its oldest treaty ally in Asia, should it come under attack.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWashington lays no claim to the contested waters but has declared that freedom of navigation and overflight and the peaceful resolution of the disputes are in its national interest.\n\nChina has strongly criticized the exercises, saying the Philippines and countries outside Asia are joining forces against Beijing, warned that the drills could lead to confrontation and undermine regional stability.\n\nAhead of the drills, China specifically opposed the transport of a U.S. ground-launched missile system to the northern Philippines. No missile was to be fired as the goal was only to familiarize military participants with the hi-tech weaponry in a tropical setting.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian expressed China's grave concern over the deployment of the missile system \"at China's doorstep.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

American, Australian and Filipino forces launched a barrage of high-precision rockets, artillery fire and airstrikes to sink a ship Wednesday as part of largescale war drills in waters facing the disputed South China Sea that has antagonized Beijing.\n\nLAOAG, Philippines (AP) -- U.S. and Philippine forces, backed by an Australian air force surveillance aircraft, unleashed a barrage of high-precision rockets, artillery fire and airstrikes Wednesday and sank a mock enemy ship as part of largescale war drills in and near the disputed South China Sea that have antagonized Beijing.\n\nMilitary officials and diplomats from several countries watched the display of firepower from a hilltop along a sandy coast in Laoag City in Ilocos Norte, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s northern home province.\n\nMore than 16,000 military personnel from the United States and the Philippines, along with a few hundred Australian troops and military observers from 14 countries, were participating in annual combat-readiness drills called Balikatan, Tagalog for shoulder-to-shoulder. The drills, which started April 22 and end Friday, include a scenario of a foreign invasion of the Philippine archipelago.\n\nIt's the latest indication of how the United States and the Philippines have bolstered a defense treaty alliance that started in the 1950s amid their concern in recent years over China's increasingly aggressive actions in disputed territories in Asia.\n\nMarcos has ordered his military to shift its focus to external defense from decades-long domestic anti-insurgency operations as China's actions in the South China Sea become a top concern. That strategic shift dovetails with the efforts of U.S. President Joe Biden and his administration to reinforce an arc of alliances in the Indo-Pacific region to counter China.\n\nChina has angered the Philippines by repeatedly harassing its navy and coast guard ships with powerful water cannons, a military-grade laser, blocking movements and other dangerous maneuvers in the high seas near two disputed South China Sea shoals. They have led to minor collision that have injured several Filipino navy personnel and damaged supply boats.\n\n\"We're under the gun,\" Philippine Ambassador to Washington Jose Romualdez told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.\n\n\"We don't have the wherewithal to be able to fight all of this bullying coming from China so where else will we go?\" Romualdez said. \"We went to the right party, which is the United States and those that believe in what the U.S. is doing.\"\n\nChina has accused the Philippines of setting off the hostilities in the disputed waters by encroaching in what it says are its offshore territories, demarcated by 10 dashes on a map. It says the Chinese coast guard and navy have been forced to take action to expel Philippine coast guard and other vessels from those areas. The Philippines has repeatedly cited a 2016 international arbitration ruling based on the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea that invalidated China's claim over virtually the entire South China Sea on historical grounds.\n\nChina did not participate in the arbitration complaint filed by the Philippines in 2013, and has rejected the ruling and continues to defy it.\n\nAfter being hit repeatedly by missile and artillery fire and bombs dropped by U.S. and Philippine warplanes during the combat drills, the mock enemy ship sank as black smoke billowed from its stern. The target ship was made in China but decommissioned by the Philippine navy in 2020 due to mechanical and electrical issues, according to the Philippine military.\n\nPhilippine military officials said the drills were not directed at any country. China has opposed military drills involving U.S. forces as well as increasing U.S. military deployments in the region, which it warned would escalate tensions and endanger regional stability.\n\nFor the first time in years, the combat exercises were staged in and near the fiercely contested Spratly Islands area, which China has closely guarded with its coast guard, navy and suspected militia flotillas.\n\nOn Monday, U.S. and Filipino marines transported by Black Hawk helicopters practiced securing an airfield in the country's northernmost town of Itbayat along the Bashi Channel near southern Taiwan. A small group of journalists, including from the AP, was invited to witness the air and ground combat maneuvers.\n\n\"They're not operating in safe areas. They're operating slightly further to the western bounds and they're doing that in order to practice in ways that they might have to work for real,\" said British Defense Attach\u00e9 to Manila Bea Walcot, who watched the ship-sinking drill.\n\nWashington and Beijing have been on a collision course over China's increasingly assertive actions to defend its territorial claims in the South China Sea, and Beijing's stated goal of annexing Taiwan, by force if necessary.\n\nIn February last year, Marcos approved a wider U.S. military presence in the Philippines by allowing rotating groups of American military forces to stay in four more Philippine military camps. That was a sharp turnaround from his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, who feared that a larger American military footprint would antagonize Beijing.\n\nChina strongly opposed the move, which allows U.S. forces to establish staging grounds and surveillance posts in the northern Philippines across the channel from Taiwan, and in western Philippine provinces facing the South China Sea.\n\nChina has warned that the deepening security alliance between Washington and Manila and their ongoing military drills should not harm its security and territorial interests or interfere in the territorial disputes. The Philippines countered that it has the right to defend its sovereignty and territorial interests.\n\n\"An alliance is very important to show China that you may have all the ships that you have, but we have a lot of firepower to sink all of them,\" Romualdez said.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

They come against the backdrop of China's increasingly assertive actions in the disputed South China Sea, where Chinese and Philippine coast guards and accompanying ships have had several increasingly tense faceoffs since last year.\n\nMore than 250 French and Australian forces are also participating, along with observers from several allied and security partner nations, led by Japan and European nations. The drills, which began April 22, end later this week.\n\nIn Monday's mock battle scenario, American and Filipino forces took positions at the airfield, ringed by low-lying hills, as three Army CH-47 Chinook helicopters landed to deliver combat supplies.\n\nMarine 1st Lt. Annie Pentaleri said there would also be aerial combat reconnaissance and counter-reconnaissance drills in the far-flung region. The Associated Press was among a small group of journalists invited to attend the maneuvers.\n\nDust envelopes USand Philippine marines as a US military helicopter takes off at the Paredes Air Station at Pasuquin, Ilocos Norte province as it carries US and Philippine troops during a joint military exercise in northern Philippines on Monday, May 6, 2024. American and Filipino marines held annual combat-readiness exercises called Balikatan, Tagalog for shoulder-to-shoulder, in a show of allied military readiness in the Philippines' northernmost town facing southern Taiwan. - AP\n\n\"We are absolutely battle-ready and that's what we train for day in and day out,\" Marine Maj. Robert Patterson said. \"It's important to enhance inter-operability with our Filipino counterparts.\"\n\nWashington and Manila say the drills are not directed at any country and are crucial for improving the response to emergencies in the Philippines, one of the world's most disaster-prone countries.\n\nHowever, this year's drills focus on territorial defence and are being staged mainly in two of the most sensitive fault lines in the regional rivalry between China and the United States: the disputed South China Sea and the Bashi Channel.\n\nThe critical waterway between Taiwan and the Philippines, an important trade conduit laden with international undersea cables, has been closely watched and guarded by Chinese and American forces. China considers Taiwant a part of its territory, to be annexed by force if necessary.\n\nIn a telephone call last month, Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed to President Joe Biden that Beijing will not tolerate separatist activities by Taiwan's independence forces, as well as \"exterior indulgence and support,\" an apparent reference to Washington's support for the island.\n\nBiden raised concerns about China's actions in the South China Sea, including efforts to impede the Philippines, which Washington is treaty-obligated to defend, from resupplying its forces on the fiercely disputed Second Thomas Shoal.\n\nThe Balikatan exercises have included live-fire drills in the disputed South China Sea during joint naval sails by the U.S., France and the Philippines. An aircraft also dropped food and other supplies on a disputed island occupied by Filipino forces as part of the maneuvers in the disputed waters.\n\nSeparately on Monday, U.S. and Philippine forces practiced repelling invading forces in the coastal province of Ilocos Norte by firing missiles and artillery rounds on floating targets at sea. The northwestern province faces the South China Sea.\n\n\"It was a huge success, the weapons were spot on,\" Marine Lt. Gen. Michael Cederholm said.\n\nIn escalating high-seas encounters in disputed areas, Chinese coast guard vessels have resorted to water cannons, blocking and other dangerous maneuvers that have left Philippine navy personnel injured and supply boats damaged. The Biden administration has repeatedly warned the U.S. is obligated to defend the Philippines, its oldest treaty ally in Asia, should it come under attack.\n\nWashington lays no claim to the contested waters but has declared that freedom of navigation and overflight and the peaceful resolution of the disputes are in its national interest.\n\nChina has strongly criticized the exercises, saying the Philippines and countries outside Asia are joining forces against Beijing, warned that the drills could lead to confrontation and undermine regional stability.\n\nAhead of the drills, China specifically opposed the transport of a U.S. ground-launched missile system to the northern Philippines. No missile was to be fired as the goal was only to familiarize military participants with the hi-tech weaponry in a tropical setting.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian expressed China's grave concern over the deployment of the missile system \"at China's doorstep.\" - AP", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "}, "authors": [],

The drills, which started April 22 and end Friday, include a scenario of a foreign invasion of the Philippine archipelago.\n\nIt's the latest indication of how the United States and the Philippines have bolstered a defense treaty alliance that started in the 1950s amid their concern in recent years over China's increasingly aggressive actions in disputed territories in Asia.\n\nMarcos has ordered his military to shift its focus to external defense from decades-long domestic anti-insurgency operations as China's actions in the South China Sea become a top concern. That strategic shift dovetails with the efforts of U.S. President Joe Biden and his administration to reinforce an arc of alliances in the Indo-Pacific region to counter China.\n\nChina has angered the Philippines by repeatedly harassing its navy and coast guard ships with powerful water cannons, a military-grade laser, blocking movements and other dangerous maneuvers in the high seas near two disputed South China Sea shoals. They have led to minor collision that have injured several Filipino navy personnel and damaged supply boats.\n\n\"We're under the gun,\" Philippine Ambassador to Washington Jose Romualdez told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.\n\n\"We don't have the wherewithal to be able to fight all of this bullying coming from China so where else will we go?\" Romualdez said. \"We went to the right party, which is the United States and those that believe in what the U.S. is doing.\"\n\nChina has accused the Philippines of setting off the hostilities in the disputed waters by encroaching in what it says are its offshore territories, demarcated by 10 dashes on a map. It says the Chinese coast guard and navy have been forced to take action to expel Philippine coast guard and other vessels from those areas. The Philippines has repeatedly cited a 2016 international arbitration ruling based on the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea that invalidated China's claim over virtually the entire South China Sea on historical grounds.\n\nChina did not participate in the arbitration complaint filed by the Philippines in 2013, and has rejected the ruling and continues to defy it.\n\nAfter being hit repeatedly by missile and artillery fire and bombs dropped by U.S. and Philippine warplanes during the combat drills, the mock enemy ship sank as black smoke billowed from its stern. The target ship was made in China but decommissioned by the Philippine navy in 2020 due to mechanical and electrical issues, according to the Philippine military.\n\nPhilippine military officials said the drills were not directed at any country. China has opposed military drills involving U.S. forces as well as increasing U.S. military deployments in the region, which it warned would escalate tensions and endanger regional stability.\n\nFor the first time in years, the combat exercises were staged in and near the fiercely contested Spratly Islands area, which China has closely guarded with its coast guard, navy and suspected militia flotillas.\n\nOn Monday, U.S. and Filipino marines transported by Black Hawk helicopters practiced securing an airfield in the country's northernmost town of Itbayat along the Bashi Channel near southern Taiwan. A small group of journalists, including from the , was invited to witness the air and ground combat maneuvers.\n\n\"They're not operating in safe areas. They're operating slightly further to the western bounds and they're doing that in order to practice in ways that they might have to work for real,\" said British Defense Attach\u00e9 to Manila Bea Walcot, who watched the ship-sinking drill.\n\nWashington and Beijing have been on a collision course over China's increasingly assertive actions to defend its territorial claims in the South China Sea, and Beijing's stated goal of annexing Taiwan, by force if necessary.\n\nIn February last year, Marcos approved a wider U.S. military presence in the Philippines by allowing rotating groups of American military forces to stay in four more Philippine military camps. That was a sharp turnaround from his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, who feared that a larger American military footprint would antagonize Beijing.\n\nChina strongly opposed the move, which allows U.S. forces to establish staging grounds and surveillance posts in the northern Philippines across the channel from Taiwan, and in western Philippine provinces facing the South China Sea.\n\nChina has warned that the deepening security alliance between Washington and Manila and their ongoing military drills should not harm its security and territorial interests or interfere in the territorial disputes. The Philippines countered that it has the right to defend its sovereignty and territorial interests.\n\n\"An alliance is very important to show China that you may have all the ships that you have, but we have a lot of firepower to sink all of them,\" Romualdez said.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The drills, which started April 22 and end Friday, include a scenario of a foreign invasion of the Philippine archipelago.\n\nIt's the latest indication of how the United States and the Philippines have bolstered a defense treaty alliance that started in the 1950s amid their concern in recent years over China's increasingly aggressive actions in disputed territories in Asia.\n\nMarcos has ordered his military to shift its focus to external defense from decades-long domestic anti-insurgency operations as China's actions in the South China Sea become a top concern. That strategic shift dovetails with the efforts of U.S. President Joe Biden and his administration to reinforce an arc of alliances in the Indo-Pacific region to counter China.\n\nChina has angered the Philippines by repeatedly repealling its navy and coast guard ships with powerful water cannons, a military-grade laser, blocking movements and other dangerous maneuvers in the high seas near two disputed South China Sea shoals. They have led to minor collision that have injured several Filipino navy personnel and damaged supply boats.\n\n\"We're under the gun,\" Philippine Ambassador to Washington Jose Romualdez told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.\n\n\"We don't have the wherewithal to be able to fight all of this bullying coming from China so where else will we go?\" Romualdez said. \"We went to the right party, which is the United States and those that believe in what the U.S. is doing.\"\n\nChina has accused the Philippines of setting off the hostilities in the disputed waters by encroaching in what it says are its offshore territories, demarcated by 10 dashes on a map. It says the Chinese coast guard and navy have been forced to take action to expel Philippine coast guard and other vessels from those areas. The Philippines has repeatedly cited a 2016 international arbitration ruling based on the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea that invalidated China's claim over virtually the entire South China Sea on historical grounds.\n\nChina did not participate in the arbitration complaint filed by the Philippines in 2013, and has rejected the ruling and continues to defy it.\n\nAfter being hit repeatedly by missile and artillery fire and bombs dropped by U.S. and Philippine warplanes during the combat drills, the mock enemy ship sank as black smoke billowed from its stern. The target ship was made in China but decommissioned by the Philippine navy in 2020 due to mechanical and electrical issues, according to the Philippine military.\n\nPhilippine military officials said the drills were not directed at any country. China has opposed military drills involving U.S. forces as well as increasing U.S. military deployments in the region, which it warned would escalate tensions and endanger regional stability.\n\nFor the first time in years, the combat exercises were staged in and near the fiercely contested Spratly Islands area, which China has closely guarded with its coast guard, navy and suspected militia flotillas.\n\nOn Monday, U.S. and Filipino marines transported by Black Hawk helicopters practiced securing an airfield in the country's northernmost town of Itbayat along the Bashi Channel near southern Taiwan. A small group of journalists, including from the AP, was invited to witness the air and ground combat maneuvers.\n\n\"They're not operating in safe areas. They're operating slightly further to the western bounds and they're doing that in order to practice in ways that they might have to work for real,\" said British Defense Attach\u00e9 to Manila Bea Walcot, who watched the ship-sinking drill.\n\nIn February last year, Marcos approved a wider U.S. military presence in the Philippines by allowing rotating groups of American military forces to stay in four more Philippine military camps. That was a sharp turnaround from his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, who feared that a larger American military footprint would antagonize Beijing.\n\nChina strongly opposed the move, which allows U.S. forces to establish staging grounds and surveillance posts in the northern Philippines across the channel from Taiwan, and in western Philippine provinces facing the South China Sea.", "source":

The exercises highlight a strategic shift towards external defense by the Philippines and the efforts of the U.S. to bolster alliances in the Indo-Pacific to counter China's actions.Military force from the United States, Australian and the Philippines launched a barrage of high-precision rockets, artillery fire and airstrikes to sink a ship Wednesday as part of largescale war drills in waters facing the disputed South China Sea that have antagonized Beijing.\n\nMilitary officials and diplomats from several countries, along with journalists, watched the display of firepower from a hilltop along a sandy coast in Laoag City on Wednesday in Ilocos Norte, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s northern home province.\n\nMore than 16,000 military personnel from the United States and the Philippines, backed by a few hundred Australian troops and military observers from 14 countries were participating in annual combat-readiness drills called Balikatan, Tagalog for shoulder-to-shoulder, which started on April 22 and will end on Friday.\n\nIt's the latest indication of how the United States and the Philippines have bolstered a defense treaty alliance that started in the 1950s.\n\nMarcos has ordered his military to shift its focus to external defense from decades-long domestic anti-insurgency operations as China's increasingly aggressive actions in the South China Sea become a top concern. That strategic shift dovetails with the efforts of President Joe Biden and his administration to reinforce an arc of alliances in the Indo-Pacific region to counter China.\n\nChina has angered the Philippines by repeatedly harassing its navy and coast guard ships with the use of powerful water cannons, a military-grade laser, blocking movements and other dangerous maneuvers in the high seas near two disputed South China Sea shoals that have led to minor collisions. Those have caused several injuries to Filipino navy personnel and damaged supply boats.\n\n\"We're under the gun,\" Philippine ambassador to Washington Jose Romualdez told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.\n\n\"We don't have the wherewithal to be able to fight all of this bullying coming from China so where else will we go?\" Romualdez asked. \"We went to the right party which is the United States and those that believe in what the U.S. is doing.\"\n\nChina has accused the Philippines of setting off the hostilities in the disputed waters by encroaching into what it says are its offshore territories, demarcated by 10 dashes on a map. This has often prompted the Chinese coast guard and navy to take steps to expel Philippine coast guard and other vessels from that area. The Philippines, backed by the U.S. and its allies and security partners, has repeatedly cited a 2016 international arbitration ruling based on the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea that invalidated China's claim over virtually the entire South China Sea on historical grounds.\n\nChina did not participate in the arbitration complaint filed by the Philippines in 2013, rejected the ruling, and continues to defy it.\n\nAfter an hour of the combat-readiness drills, black smoke started to billow from the stern of the mock enemy ship that was struck by missile fire and it started to sink ,as shown on a monitor watched by foreign military guests and journalists. U.S. and Philippine warplanes later dropped bombs on the BRP Lake Caliraya, the target ship, which was made in China but decommissioned by the Philippine navy in 2020 due to mechanical and electrical issues, according to Philippine military officials.\n\nPhilippine military officials said the maneuvers would bolster the country's coastal defense and disaster-response capabilities and claimed they were not aimed at any country. China has opposed military drills involving U.S. forces in the region as well as increasing U.S. military deployments, which it warned would ratchet up tensions and hamper regional stability and peace.\n\nWashington and Beijing have been on a collision course over China's increasingly assertive actions to defend its vast territorial claims in the South China Sea, and Beijing's stated goal of annexing Taiwan, by force if necessary.\n\nIn February last year, Marcos approved a wider U.S. military presence in the Philippines by allowing rotating groups of American military forces to stay in four more Philippine military camps. That was a sharp turnaround from his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte, who feared that a larger American military footprint could antagonize Beijing.\n\nChina strongly opposed the move, which would allow U.S. forces to establish staging grounds and surveillance posts in the northern Philippines across the sea from Taiwan, and in western Philippine provinces facing the South China Sea.\n\nChina has warned that a deepening security alliance between Washington and Manila and their ongoing military drills should not harm its security and territorial interests or interfere in the territorial disputes. The Philippines countered that it has the right to defend its sovereignty and territorial interests.\n\n\"An alliance is very important to show China that you may have all the ships that you have, but

They come against the backdrop of China's increasingly assertive actions in the disputed South China Sea, where Chinese and Philippine coast guards and accompanying ships have had several increasingly tense faceoffs since last year.\n\nMore than 250 French and Australian forces are also participating, along with observers from several allied and security partner nations, led by Japan and European nations. The drills, which began April 22, end later this week.\n\nIn Monday's mock battle scenario, American and Filipino forces took positions at the airfield, ringed by low-lying hills, as three Army CH-47 Chinook helicopters landed to deliver combat supplies.\n\nMarine 1st Lt. Annie Pentaleri said there would also be aerial combat reconnaissance and counter-reconnaissance drills in the far-flung region. The Associated Press was among a small group of journalists invited to attend the maneuvers.\n\n\"We are absolutely battle-ready and that's what we train for day in and day out,\" Marine Maj. Robert Patterson said. \"It's important to enhance inter-operability with our Filipino counterparts.\"\n\nWashington and Manila say the drills are not directed at any country and are crucial for improving the response to emergencies in the Philippines, one of the world's most disaster-prone countries.\n\nHowever, this year's drills focus on territorial defense and are being staged mainly in two of the most sensitive fault lines in the regional rivalry between China and the United States: the disputed South China Sea and the Bashi Channel.\n\nThe critical waterway between Taiwan and the Philippines, an important trade conduit laden with international undersea cables, has been closely watched and guarded by Chinese and American forces. China considers Taiwant a part of its territory, to be annexed by force if necessary.\n\nIn a telephone call last month, Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed to President Joe Biden that Beijing will not tolerate separatist activities by Taiwan's independence forces, as well as \"exterior indulgence and support,\" an apparent reference to Washington's support for the island.\n\nBiden raised concerns about China's actions in the South China Sea, including efforts to impede the Philippines, which Washington is treaty-obligated to defend, from resupplying its forces on the fiercely disputed Second Thomas Shoal.\n\nThe Balikatan exercises have included live-fire drills in the disputed South China Sea during joint naval sails by the U.S., France and the Philippines. An aircraft also dropped food and other supplies on a disputed island occupied by Filipino forces as part of the maneuvers in the disputed waters.\n\nSeparately on Monday, U.S. and Philippine forces practiced repelling invading forces in the coastal province of Ilocos Norte by firing missiles and artillery rounds on floating targets at sea. The northwestern province faces the South China Sea.\n\n\"It was a huge success, the weapons were spot on,\" Marine Lt. Gen. Michael Cederholm said.\n\nIn escalating high-seas encounters in disputed areas, Chinese coast guard vessels have resorted to water cannons, blocking and other dangerous maneuvers that have left Philippine navy personnel injured and supply boats damaged. The Biden administration has repeatedly warned the U.S. is obligated to defend the Philippines, its oldest treaty ally in Asia, should it come under attack.\n\nWashington lays no claim to the contested waters but has declared that freedom of navigation and overflight and the peaceful resolution of the disputes are in its national interest.\n\nChina has strongly criticized the exercises, saying the Philippines and countries outside Asia are joining forces against Beijing, warned that the drills could lead to confrontation and undermine regional stability.\n\nAhead of the drills, China specifically opposed the transport of a U.S. ground-launched missile system to the northern Philippines. No missile was to be fired as the goal was only to familiarize military participants with the hi-tech weaponry in a tropical setting.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian expressed China's grave concern over the deployment of the missile system \"at China's doorstep.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

American, Australian and Filipino forces launched a barrage of high-precision rockets, artillery fire and airstrikes to sink a ship Wednesday as part of largescale war drills in waters facing the disputed South China [...]\n\nLAOAG, Philippines (AP) -- Military force from the United States, Australian and the Philippines launched a barrage of high-precision rockets, artillery fire and airstrikes to sink a ship Wednesday as part of largescale war drills in waters facing the disputed South China Sea that have antagonized Beijing.\n\nMilitary officials and diplomats from several countries, along with journalists, watched the display of firepower from a hilltop along a sandy coast in Laoag City on Wednesday in Ilocos Norte, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s northern home province.\n\nMore than 16,000 military personnel from the United States and the Philippines, backed by a few hundred Australian troops and military observers from 14 countries were participating in annual combat-readiness drills called Balikatan, Tagalog for shoulder-to-shoulder, which started on April 22 and will end on Friday.\n\nIt's the latest indication of how the United States and the Philippines have bolstered a defense treaty alliance that started in the 1950s.\n\nMarcos has ordered his military to shift its focus to external defense from decades-long domestic anti-insurgency operations as China's increasingly aggressive actions in the South China Sea become a top concern. That strategic shift dovetails with the efforts of President Joe Biden and his administration to reinforce an arc of alliances in the Indo-Pacific region to counter China.\n\nChina has angered the Philippines by repeatedly harassing its navy and coast guard ships with the use of powerful water cannons, a military-grade laser, blocking movements and other dangerous maneuvers in the high seas near two disputed South China Sea shoals that have led to minor collisions. Those have caused several injuries to Filipino navy personnel and damaged supply boats.\n\n\"We're under the gun,\" Philippine ambassador to Washington Jose Romualdez told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.\n\n\"We don't have the wherewithal to be able to fight all of this bullying coming from China so where else will we go?\" Romualdez asked. \"We went to the right party which is the United States and those that believe in what the U.S. is doing.\"\n\nChina has accused the Philippines of setting off the hostilities in the disputed waters by encroaching into what it says are its offshore territories, demarcated by 10 dashes on a map. This has often prompted the Chinese coast guard and navy to take steps to expel Philippine coast guard and other vessels from that area. The Philippines, backed by the U.S. and its allies and security partners, has repeatedly cited a 2016 international arbitration ruling based on the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea that invalidated China's claim over virtually the entire South China Sea on historical grounds.\n\nChina did not participate in the arbitration complaint filed by the Philippines in 2013, rejected the ruling, and continues to defy it.\n\nAfter an hour of the combat-readiness drills, black smoke started to billow from the stern of the mock enemy ship that was struck by missile fire and it started to sink ,as shown on a monitor watched by foreign military guests and journalists. U.S. and Philippine warplanes later dropped bombs on the BRP Lake Caliraya, the target ship, which was made in China but decommissioned by the Philippine navy in 2020 due to mechanical and electrical issues, according to Philippine military officials.\n\nPhilippine military officials said the maneuvers would bolster the country's coastal defense and disaster-response capabilities and claimed they were not aimed at any country. China has opposed military drills involving U.S. forces in the region as well as increasing U.S. military deployments, which it warned would ratchet up tensions and hamper regional stability and peace.\n\nWashington and Beijing have been on a collision course over China's increasingly assertive actions to defend its vast territorial claims in the South China Sea, and Beijing's stated goal of annexing Taiwan, by force if necessary.\n\nIn February last year, Marcos approved a wider U.S. military presence in the Philippines by allowing rotating groups of American military forces to stay in four more Philippine military camps. That was a sharp turnaround from his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte, who feared that a larger American military footprint could antagonize Beijing.\n\nChina strongly opposed the move, which would allow U.S. forces to establish staging grounds and surveillance posts in the northern Philippines across the sea from Taiwan, and in western Philippine provinces facing the South China Sea.\n\nChina has warned that a deepening security alliance between Washington and Manila and their ongoing military drills should not harm its security and territorial interests or interfere in the territorial disputes. The Philippines countered that it has the right to defend its sovereignty and territorial interests.\n\n\"An alliance is very important to show China that you may have all the ships that you have, but we have a lot of firepower to sink all of them,\" Romualdez said", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com",

That strategic shift dovetails with the efforts of President Joe Biden and his administration to reinforce an arc of alliances in the Indo-Pacific region to counter China.\n\nChina has angered the Philippines by repeatedly harassing its navy and coast guard ships with the use of powerful water cannons, a military-grade laser, blocking movements and other dangerous maneuvers in the high seas near two disputed South China Sea shoals that have led to minor collisions. Those have caused several injuries to Filipino navy personnel and damaged supply boats.\n\n\"We're under the gun,\" Philippine ambassador to Washington Jose Romualdez told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.\n\n\"We don't have the wherewithal to be able to fight all of this bullying coming from China so where else will we go?\" Romualdez asked. \"We went to the right party which is the United States and those that believe in what the U.S. is doing.\"\n\nChina has accused the Philippines of setting off the hostilities in the disputed waters by encroaching into what it says are its offshore territories, demarcated by 10 dashes on a map. This has often prompted the Chinese coast guard and navy to take steps to expel Philippine coast guard and other vessels from that area. The Philippines, backed by the U.S. and its allies and security partners, has repeatedly cited a 2016 international arbitration ruling based on the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea that invalidated China's claim over virtually the entire South China Sea on historical grounds.\n\nChina did not participate in the arbitration complaint filed by the Philippines in 2013, rejected the ruling, and continues to defy it.\n\nAfter an hour of the combat-readiness drills, black smoke started to billow from the stern of the mock enemy ship that was struck by missile fire and it started to sink ,as shown on a monitor watched by foreign military guests and journalists. US and Philippine warplanes later dropped bombs on the BRP Lake Caliraya, the target ship, which was made in China but decommissioned by the Philippine navy in 2020 due to mechanical and electrical issues, according to Philippine military officials.\n\nPhilippine military officials said the maneuvers would bolster the country's coastal defence and disaster-response capabilities and claimed they were not aimed at any country. China has opposed military drills involving U.S. forces in the region as well as increasing U.S. military deployments, which it warned would ratchet up tensions and hamper regional stability and peace.\n\nWashington and Beijing have been on a collision course over China's increasingly assertive actions to defend its vast territorial claims in the South China Sea, and Beijing's stated goal of annexing Taiwan, by force if necessary.\n\nIn February last year, Marcos approved a wider U.S. military presence in the Philippines by allowing rotating groups of American military forces to stay in four more Philippine military camps. That was a sharp turnaround from his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte, who feared that a larger American military footprint could antagonize Beijing.\n\nChina strongly opposed the move, which would allow US forces to establish staging grounds and surveillance posts in the northern Philippines across the sea from Taiwan, and in western Philippine provinces facing the South China Sea.\n\nChina has warned that a deepening security alliance between Washington and Manila and their ongoing military drills should not harm its security and territorial interests or interfere in the territorial disputes. The Philippines countered that it has the right to defend its sovereignty and territorial interests.\n\n\"An alliance is very important to show China that you may have all the ships that you have, but we have a lot of firepower to sink all of them,\" Romualdez said.", "source": {"uri": "tribuneindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Those have caused several injuries to Filipino navy personnel and damaged supply boats.\n\n\"We're under the gun,\" Philippine ambassador to Washington Jose Romualdez told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.\n\n\"We don't have the wherewithal to be able to fight all of this bullying coming from China so where else will we go?\" Romualdez asked. \"We went to the right party which is the United States and those that believe in what the US is doing.\"\n\nChina has accused the Philippines of setting off the hostilities in the disputed waters by encroaching into what it says are its offshore territories, demarcated by 10 dashes on a map.

The Philippines, backed by the US and its allies and security partners, has repeatedly cited a 2016 international arbitration ruling based on the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea that invalidated China's claim over virtually the entire South China Sea on historical grounds.\n\nChina did not participate in the arbitration complaint filed by the Philippines in 2013, rejected the ruling, and continues to defy it.\n\nAfter an hour of the combat-readiness drills, black smoke started to billow from the stern of the mock enemy ship that was struck by missile fire and it started to sink ,as shown on a monitor watched by foreign military guests and journalists. US and Philippine warplanes later dropped bombs on the BRP Lake Caliraya, the target ship, which was made in China but decommissioned by the Philippine navy in 2020 due to mechanical and electrical issues, according to Philippine military officials.\n\nPhilippine military officials said the maneuvers would bolster the country's coastal defense and disaster-response capabilities and claimed they were not aimed at any country. China has opposed military drills involving US forces in the region as well as increasing US military deployments, which it warned would ratchet up tensions and hamper regional stability and peace.\n\nWashington and Beijing have been on a collision course over China's increasingly assertive actions to defend its vast territorial claims in the South China Sea, and Beijing's stated goal of annexing Taiwan, by force if necessary.\n\nIn February last year, Marcos approved a wider US military presence in the Philippines by allowing rotating groups of American military forces to stay in four more Philippine military camps. That was a sharp turnaround from his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte, who feared that a larger American military footprint could antagonize Beijing.\n\nChina strongly opposed the move, which would allow US forces to establish staging grounds and surveillance posts in the northern Philippines across the sea from Taiwan, and in western Philippine provinces facing the South China Sea.\n\nChina has warned that a deepening security alliance between Washington and Manila and their ongoing military drills should not harm its security and territorial interests or interfere in the territorial disputes. The Philippines countered that it has the right to defend its sovereignty and territorial interests.\n\n\"An alliance is very important to show China that you may have all the ships that you have, but we have a lot of firepower to sink all of them,\" Romualdez said.", "source": {"uri": "arab.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

That strategic shift dovetails with the efforts of President Joe Biden and his administration to reinforce an arc of alliances in the Indo-Pacific region to counter China.\n\nChina has angered the Philippines by repeatedly harassing its navy and coast guard ships with the use of powerful water cannons, a military-grade laser, blocking movements and other dangerous maneuvers in the high seas near two disputed South China Sea shoals that have led to minor collisions. Those have caused several injuries to Filipino navy personnel and damaged supply boats.\n\n\"We're under the gun,\" Philippine ambassador to Washington Jose Romualdez told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.\n\n\"We don't have the wherewithal to be able to fight all of this bullying coming from China so where else will we go?\" Romualdez asked. \"We went to the right party which is the United States and those that believe in what the U.S. is doing.\"\n\nChina has accused the Philippines of setting off the hostilities in the disputed waters by encroaching into what it says are its offshore territories, demarcated by 10 dashes on a map. This has often prompted the Chinese coast guard and navy to take steps to expel Philippine coast guard and other vessels from that area. The Philippines, backed by the U.S. and its allies and security partners, has repeatedly cited a 2016 international arbitration ruling based on the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea that invalidated China's claim over virtually the entire South China Sea on historical grounds.\n\nChina did not participate in the arbitration complaint filed by the Philippines in 2013, rejected the ruling, and continues to defy it.\n\nAfter an hour of the combat-readiness drills, black smoke started to billow from the stern of the mock enemy ship that was struck by missile fire and it started to sink ,as shown on a monitor watched by foreign military guests and journalists. U.S. and Philippine warplanes later dropped bombs on the BRP Lake Caliraya, the target ship, which was made in China but decommissioned by the Philippine navy in 2020 due to mechanical and electrical issues, according to Philippine military officials.\n\nPhilippine military officials said the maneuvers would bolster the country's coastal defense and disaster-response capabilities and claimed they were not aimed at any country. China has opposed military drills involving U.S. forces in the region as well as increasing U.S. military deployments, which it warned would ratchet up tensions and hamper regional stability and peace.\n\nWashington and Beijing have been on a collision course over China's increasingly assertive actions to defend its vast territorial claims in the South China Sea, and Beijing's stated goal of annexing Taiwan, by force if necessary.\n\nIn February last year, Marcos approved a wider U.S. military presence in the Philippines by allowing rotating groups of American military forces to stay in four more Philippine military camps. That was a sharp turnaround from his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte, who feared that a larger American military footprint could antagonize Beijing.\n\nChina strongly opposed the move, which would allow U.S. forces to establish staging grounds and surveillance posts in the northern Philippines across the sea from Taiwan, and in western Philippine provinces facing the South China Sea.\n\nChina has warned that a deepening security alliance between Washington and Manila and their ongoing military drills should not harm its security and territorial interests or interfere in the territorial disputes. The Philippines countered that it has the right to defend its sovereignty and territorial interests.\n\n\"An alliance is very important to show China that you may have all the ships that you have, but we have a lot of firepower to sink all of them,\" Romualdez said", "source": {"uri": "wboc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WBOC TV-16"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They come against the backdrop of China's increasingly assertive actions in the disputed South China Sea, where Chinese and Philippine coast guards and accompanying vessels have had several increasingly tense clashes since the year last.\n\nMore than 250 French and Australian forces are also participating, as well as observers from several allied and security partner countries, led by Japan and European countries. The exercises, which began on April 22, will conclude later this week.\n\nIn Monday's simulated battle scenario, U.S. and Philippine forces took up positions at the airfield, surrounded by low hills, as three Army CH-47 Chinook helicopters landed to deliver combat equipment.\n\nMarine Corps 1st Lt. Annie Pentaleri said aerial combat reconnaissance and counter-reconnaissance exercises were also planned in the remote region. The Associated Press was among a small group of journalists invited to watch the maneuvers.\n\n\"We are absolutely combat ready and that's what we train for day in and day out,\" Marine Maj. Robert Patterson said. It is important to improve interoperability with our Philippine counterparts.\n\nWashington and Manila say the exercises are not directed against any country and are crucial to improving emergency response in the Philippines, one of the world's most disaster-prone countries.\n\nHowever, this year's exercises focus on territorial defense and take place primarily in two of the most sensitive fault lines in the regional rivalry between China and the United States: the disputed South China Sea and the Bashi Channel. .\n\nThe critical waterway between Taiwan and the Philippines, a major trade channel laden with international undersea cables, has been closely monitored and guarded by Chinese and US forces. China considers Taiwan a part of its territory, which can be annexed by force if necessary.\n\nIn a phone call last month, Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed to President Joe Biden that Beijing would not tolerate separatist activities by Taiwanese pro-independence forces, as well as external leniency and support, an apparent reference to support from Washington to the island.\n\nBiden has raised concerns about China's actions in the South China Sea, including efforts to prevent the Philippines, which Washington is required to defend by the treaty, from resupplying its forces on the hotly contested Second Thomas Bank. .\n\nDerek Grossman, senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation, said the message of deterrence was important. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s decision to allow U.S. forces indefinite access to two Philippine air and naval bases in Cagayan province near Batanes as part of a 2014 defense pact would likely improve the ability of the US military to intervene in a Taiwanese contingency more effectively. in a timely manner,\" he said.\n\n\"Right now, a big concern is that the United States simply won't get there in time,\" Grossman added.\n\nThe Balikatan exercises included live-fire exercises in the disputed South China Sea during joint naval sailings of the United States, France and the Philippines. A plane also dropped food and other supplies on a disputed island occupied by Philippine forces as part of the maneuvers in the disputed waters.\n\nSeparately on Monday, US and Philippine forces practiced repelling invading forces in the coastal province of Ilocos Norte by firing missiles and artillery shells at floating targets at sea. The northwestern province faces the South China Sea.\n\nIt was a huge success, the weapons were perfect, said Marine Lt. Gen. Michael Cederholm.\n\nAs clashes on the high seas intensified in disputed areas, Chinese coast guard vessels resorted to water cannons, blockades and other dangerous maneuvers that injured Philippine Navy personnel and damaged supply boats. The Biden administration has repeatedly warned that the United States is obligated to defend the Philippines, its oldest ally in Asia, if it is attacked.\n\nChina sharply criticized the drills, saying the Philippines and countries outside Asia were joining forces against Beijing, and warned the drills could lead to confrontation and undermine regional stability.\n\nBefore the exercises, China specifically objected to the transport of a US ground-launched missile system to the northern Philippines. No missiles were to be fired, the objective being only to familiarize the military with high-tech weaponry in a tropical setting.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian expressed China's serious concern over the deployment of the missile system on China's doorstep.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType":

and Philippine forces sink ship during drills in disputed South China Sea", "body": "Military officials and diplomats from several countries watched the display of firepower from a hilltop along the coast of Laoag City.\n\nUS and Philippine forces, backed by an Australian air force surveillance aircraft, unleashed a barrage of high-precision rockets, artillery fire and airstrikes on Wednesday - sinking a mock enemy ship as part of largescale war drills in and near the disputed South China Sea that have antagonised Beijing.\n\nMilitary officials and diplomats from several countries watched the display of firepower from a hilltop along a sandy coast in Laoag City in Ilocos Norte, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s northern home province, on Wednesday.\n\nMore than 16,000 military personnel from the US and the Philippines, along with a few hundred Australian troops and military observers from 14 countries, were participating in annual combat-readiness drills.\n\nThe drills, which started on April 22 and end Friday, include a scenario of a foreign invasion of the Philippine archipelago.\n\nIt is the latest indication of how the US and the Philippines have bolstered a defence treaty alliance that started in the 1950s amid their concern in recent years over China's increasingly aggressive actions in disputed territories in Asia.\n\nMr Marcos has ordered his military to shift its focus to external defence from decades-long domestic anti-insurgency operations as China's actions in the South China Sea become a top concern.\n\nThat strategic shift dovetails with the efforts of US President Joe Biden and his administration to reinforce an arc of alliances in the Indo-Pacific region to counter China.\n\nChina has angered the Philippines by repeatedly harassing its navy and coast guard ships with powerful water cannons and a military-grade laser, blocking movements and other dangerous manoeuvres in the high seas near two disputed South China Sea shoals.\n\nThey have led to minor collisions that have injured several Filipino navy personnel and damaged supply boats.\n\n\"We're under the gun,\" Philippine Ambassador to Washington Jose Romualdez told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.\n\n\"We don't have the wherewithal to be able to fight all of this bullying coming from China so where else will we go?\" Mr Romualdez added.\n\n\"We went to the right party, which is the United States and those that believe in what the US is doing.\"\n\nChina has accused the Philippines of setting off the hostilities in the disputed waters by encroaching in what it says are its offshore territories, demarcated by 10 dashes on a map.\n\nIt says the Chinese coast guard and navy have been forced to take action to expel Philippine coast guard and other vessels from those areas.\n\nThe Philippines has repeatedly cited a 2016 international arbitration ruling based on the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea that invalidated China's claim over virtually the entire South China Sea on historical grounds.\n\nChina did not participate in the arbitration complaint filed by the Philippines in 2013, and has rejected the ruling and continues to defy it.\n\nAfter being hit repeatedly by missile and artillery fire and bombs dropped by US and Philippine warplanes during the combat drills, the mock enemy ship sank as black smoke billowed from its stern.\n\nThe target ship was made in China but decommissioned by the Philippine navy in 2020 due to mechanical and electrical issues, according to the Philippine military.\n\nPhilippine military officials said the drills were not directed at any country.\n\nChina has opposed military drills involving US forces as well as increasing US military deployments in the region, which it warned would escalate tensions and endanger regional stability.", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

That strategic shift dovetails with the efforts of President Joe Biden and his administration to reinforce an arc of alliances in the Indo-Pacific region to counter China.\n\nChina has angered the Philippines by repeatedly harassing its navy and coast guard ships with the use of powerful water cannons, a military-grade laser, blocking movements and other dangerous maneuvers in the high seas near two disputed South China Sea shoals that have led to minor collisions. Those have caused several injuries to Filipino navy personnel and damaged supply boats.\n\n\"We're under the gun,\" Philippine ambassador to Washington Jose Romualdez told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.\n\n\"We don't have the wherewithal to be able to fight all of this bullying coming from China so where else will we go?\" Romualdez asked. \"We went to the right party which is the United States and those that believe in what the U.S. is doing.\"\n\nChina has accused the Philippines of setting off the hostilities in the disputed waters by encroaching into what it says are its offshore territories, demarcated by 10 dashes on a map. This has often prompted the Chinese coast guard and navy to take steps to expel Philippine coast guard and other vessels from that area. The Philippines, backed by the U.S. and its allies and security partners, has repeatedly cited a 2016 international arbitration ruling based on the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea that invalidated China's claim over virtually the entire South China Sea on historical grounds.\n\nChina did not participate in the arbitration complaint filed by the Philippines in 2013, rejected the ruling, and continues to defy it.\n\nAfter an hour of the combat-readiness drills, black smoke started to billow from the stern of the mock enemy ship that was struck by missile fire and it started to sink ,as shown on a monitor watched by foreign military guests and journalists. U.S. and Philippine warplanes later dropped bombs on the BRP Lake Caliraya, the target ship, which was made in China but decommissioned by the Philippine navy in 2020 due to mechanical and electrical issues, according to Philippine military officials.\n\nPhilippine military officials said the maneuvers would bolster the country's coastal defense and disaster-response capabilities and claimed they were not aimed at any country. China has opposed military drills involving U.S. forces in the region as well as increasing U.S. military deployments, which it warned would ratchet up tensions and hamper regional stability and peace.\n\nWashington and Beijing have been on a collision course over China's increasingly assertive actions to defend its vast territorial claims in the South China Sea, and Beijing's stated goal of annexing Taiwan, by force if necessary.\n\nIn February last year, Marcos approved a wider U.S. military presence in the Philippines by allowing rotating groups of American military forces to stay in four more Philippine military camps. That was a sharp turnaround from his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte, who feared that a larger American military footprint could antagonize Beijing.\n\nChina strongly opposed the move, which would allow U.S. forces to establish staging grounds and surveillance posts in the northern Philippines across the sea from Taiwan, and in western Philippine provinces facing the South China Sea.\n\nChina has warned that a deepening security alliance between Washington and Manila and their ongoing military drills should not harm its security and territorial interests or interfere in the territorial disputes. The Philippines countered that it has the right to defend its sovereignty and territorial interests.\n\n\"An alliance is very important to show China that you may have all the ships that you have, but we have a lot of firepower to sink all of them,\" Romualdez said", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

ship during drills in disputed South...", "body": "US and Philippine forces, backed by an Australian air force surveillance aircraft, unleashed a barrage of high-precision rockets, artillery fire and airstrikes on Wednesday - sinking a mock enemy ship as part of largescale war drills in and near the disputed South China Sea that have antagonised Beijing.\n\nMilitary officials and diplomats from several countries watched the display of firepower from a hilltop along a sandy coast in Laoag City in Ilocos Norte, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s northern home province, on Wednesday.\n\nMore than 16,000 military personnel from the US and the Philippines, along with a few hundred Australian troops and military observers from 14 countries, were participating in annual combat-readiness drills.\n\nUS troopers in battle gear walk under the scorching sun during a joint military exercise in Laoag, Ilocos Norte (Aaron Favila/AP)\n\nThe drills, which started on April 22 and end Friday, include a scenario of a foreign invasion of the Philippine archipelago.\n\nIt is the latest indication of how the US and the Philippines have bolstered a defence treaty alliance that started in the 1950s amid their concern in recent years over China's increasingly aggressive actions in disputed territories in Asia.\n\nMr Marcos has ordered his military to shift its focus to external defence from decades-long domestic anti-insurgency operations as China's actions in the South China Sea become a top concern.\n\nThat strategic shift dovetails with the efforts of US President Joe Biden and his administration to reinforce an arc of alliances in the Indo-Pacific region to counter China.\n\nChina has angered the Philippines by repeatedly harassing its navy and coast guard ships with powerful water cannons and a military-grade laser, blocking movements and other dangerous manoeuvres in the high seas near two disputed South China Sea shoals.\n\nThey have led to minor collisions that have injured several Filipino navy personnel and damaged supply boats.\n\nA US trooper in battle during the joint military exercise (Aaron Favila/AP)\n\n\"We're under the gun,\" Philippine Ambassador to Washington Jose Romualdez told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.\n\n\"We don't have the wherewithal to be able to fight all of this bullying coming from China so where else will we go?\" Mr Romualdez added.\n\n\"We went to the right party, which is the United States and those that believe in what the US is doing.\"\n\nChina has accused the Philippines of setting off the hostilities in the disputed waters by encroaching in what it says are its offshore territories, demarcated by 10 dashes on a map.\n\nIt says the Chinese coast guard and navy have been forced to take action to expel Philippine coast guard and other vessels from those areas.\n\nThe Philippines has repeatedly cited a 2016 international arbitration ruling based on the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea that invalidated China's claim over virtually the entire South China Sea on historical grounds.\n\nPhilippine Army fires Atmos 155mm howitzers during the joint military exercise (Aaron Favila/AP)\n\nChina did not participate in the arbitration complaint filed by the Philippines in 2013, and has rejected the ruling and continues to defy it.\n\nAfter being hit repeatedly by missile and artillery fire and bombs dropped by US and Philippine warplanes during the combat drills, the mock enemy ship sank as black smoke billowed from its stern.\n\nThe target ship was made in China but decommissioned by the Philippine navy in 2020 due to mechanical and electrical issues, according to the Philippine military.\n\nPhilippine military officials said the drills were not directed at any country.\n\nChina has opposed military drills involving US forces as well as increasing US military deployments in the region, which it warned would escalate tensions and endanger regional stability.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The drills included high-precision rockets, artillery fire, and airstrikes, sinking a target ship. The exercise aims to bolster defense capabilities and deter external threats, particularly China. China has opposed the drills and accused the Philippines of provoking hostilities. Despite China's concerns, the Philippines insists on its right to defend its sovereignty. The military alliance between the US and the Philippines demonstrates their commitment to safeguarding territorial interests and countering China's assertive actions in the region.\n\nMilitary force from the United States, Australian and the Philippines launched a barrage of high-precision rockets, artillery fire and airstrikes to sink a ship Wednesday as part of largescale war drills in waters facing the disputed South China Sea that have antagonized Beijing.\n\nMilitary officials and diplomats from several countries, along with journalists, watched the display of firepower from a hilltop along a sandy coast in Laoag City on Wednesday in Ilocos Norte, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s northern home province.\n\nMore than 16,000 military personnel from the United States and the Philippines, backed by a few hundred Australian troops and military observers from 14 countries were participating in annual combat-readiness drills called Balikatan, Tagalog for shoulder-to-shoulder, which started on April 22 and will end on Friday.\n\nIt's the latest indication of how the United States and the Philippines have bolstered a defense treaty alliance that started in the 1950s.\n\nMarcos has ordered his military to shift its focus to external defense from decades-long domestic anti-insurgency operations as China's increasingly aggressive actions in the South China Sea become a top concern. That strategic shift dovetails with the efforts of President Joe Biden and his administration to reinforce an arc of alliances in the Indo-Pacific region to counter China.\n\nChina has angered the Philippines by repeatedly harassing its navy and coast guard ships with the use of powerful water cannons, a military-grade laser, blocking movements and other dangerous maneuvers in the high seas near two disputed South China Sea shoals that have led to minor collisions. Those have caused several injuries to Filipino navy personnel and damaged supply boats.\n\n\"We're under the gun,\" Philippine ambassador to Washington Jose Romualdez told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.\n\n\"We don't have the wherewithal to be able to fight all of this bullying coming from China so where else will we go?\" Romualdez asked. \"We went to the right party which is the United States and those that believe in what the U.S. is doing.\" China has accused the Philippines of setting off the hostilities in the disputed waters by encroaching into what it says are its offshore territories, demarcated by 10 dashes on a map. This has often prompted the Chinese coast guard and navy to take steps to expel Philippine coast guard and other vessels from that area. The Philippines, backed by the U.S. and its allies and security partners, has repeatedly cited a 2016 international arbitration ruling based on the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea that invalidated China's claim over virtually the entire South China Sea on historical grounds.\n\nChina did not participate in the arbitration complaint filed by the Philippines in 2013, rejected the ruling, and continues to defy it.\n\nAfter an hour of the combat-readiness drills, black smoke started to billow from the stern of the mock enemy ship that was struck by missile fire and it started to sink ,as shown on a monitor watched by foreign military guests and journalists. U.S. and Philippine warplanes later dropped bombs on the BRP Lake Caliraya, the target ship, which was made in China but decommissioned by the Philippine navy in 2020 due to mechanical and electrical issues, according to Philippine military officials.\n\nPhilippine military officials said the maneuvers would bolster the country's coastal defense and disaster-response capabilities and claimed they were not aimed at any country. China has opposed military drills involving U.S. forces in the region as well as increasing U.S. military deployments, which it warned would ratchet up tensions and hamper regional stability and peace.\n\nWashington and Beijing have been on a collision course over China's increasingly assertive actions to defend its vast territorial claims in the South China Sea, and Beijing's stated goal of annexing Taiwan, by force if necessary.\n\nIn February last year, Marcos approved a wider U.S. military presence in the Philippines by allowing rotating groups of American military forces to stay in four more Philippine military camps. That was a sharp turnaround from his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte, who feared that a larger American military footprint could antagonize Beijing.\n\nChina strongly opposed the move, which would allow U.S. forces to establish staging grounds and surveillance posts in the northern Philippines across the sea from Taiwan, and in western Philippine provinces facing the South China Sea.\n\nChina has warned that a deepening security alliance between Washington and Manila and their ongoing military drills should not harm its security and territorial interests or interfere in the territorial disputes. The Philippines countered that it has the right to defend its sovereignty and territorial interests.\n\n\"An alliance is very important to show China that you may have all the ships that you have, but we have a lot of firepower to sink all of them,\" Romualdez said.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri":

Robert Patterson said. \"It's important to enhance inter-operability with our Filipino counterparts.\"\n\nWhile the drills claimed to focus on improving emergency response in disaster-prone regions of the Philippines, this year's exercises notably emphasized territorial defense in sensitive areas, including the South China Sea and the Bashi Channel.\n\nThe Bashi Channel, vital for trade and laden with international undersea cables, has become a key area of contention. China views Taiwan as part of its territory and closely monitors the strategic waterway.\n\nThe exercises come amid escalating tensions between China and the U.S., with Chinese President Xi Jinping warning against Taiwan's independence efforts and criticizing U.S. support for the island. President Joe Biden has raised concerns about China's actions in the South China Sea, including obstructing Philippine resupply efforts.\n\nDerek Grossman, a senior defense analyst at RAND Corporation, said the message of deterrence was important. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s decision to allow U.S. forces indefinite access to two Philippine air force and naval bases in Cagayan province near Batanes under a 2014 defense pact, \"would likely upgrade the U.S. military's ability to intervene in a Taiwan contingency in a more timely manner,\" he said.\n\nAs part of the Balikatan exercises, joint naval sails by the U.S., France, and the Philippines have included live-fire drills in the contested waters of the South China Sea. During these maneuvers, an aircraft was also deployed to drop essential supplies onto a disputed island currently occupied by Filipino forces.\n\nIn a separate event on May 6, U.S. and Philippine forces conducted drills to repel potential invaders in the coastal province of Ilocos Norte, which directly borders the South China Sea. The exercises involved firing missiles and artillery rounds at floating targets positioned at sea.\n\nReflecting on the drills, Marine Lt. Gen. Michael Cederholm expressed satisfaction with the outcome, stating, \"It was a huge success, the weapons were spot on.\"\n\nThe drills have drawn criticism from China, which sees them as a concerted effort to counter Beijing's influence. China has also expressed concern over the deployment of a U.S. ground-launched missile system in the Philippines, viewing it as a provocative move.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian expressed China's grave concern over deploying the missile system \"at China's doorstep.\"", "source": {"uri": "northernirelandnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Northern Ireland News"},

Balikatan is Tagalog for \"shoulder to shoulder.\"\n\nJoint Philippines-U.S. naval drills have become an annual event. But as an expert in international relations, I believe this year's drills mark an inflection point in the regional politics of the South China Sea.\n\nFor the first time, warships taking part in the exercise ventured outside the 12-mile boundary that demarcates the territorial waters of the Philippines. This extends military operations into the gray area where the Philippines' exclusive economic zone rubs up against the territory claimed by China and designated by its \"nine-dash line.\"\n\nAlso for the first time, the U.S. deployed an advanced mobile launcher for medium-range ballistic and cruise missiles of a type that had been banned under the now-defunct Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. In addition, the Philippine navy is showing off its newest acquisition, a South Korean-built missile frigate.\n\nThe South China Sea has long been the source of maritime disputes between China, which claims the vast majority of its waters, and nations including Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. In addition, heightened tensions over the status of Taiwan - a territory that the Biden administration has pledged to defend militarily in the event of a Chinese invasion - have made the South China Sea even more strategically important.\n\nThe latest joint maneuvers come amid two developments that could go some way to influence the future trajectory of tensions in the South China Sea. First, the Philippines has grown increasingly assertive in countering China's claims in the region; and second, the U.S. is increasingly intent on building up regional alliances as part of a strategy to contain China.\n\nThe Philippines-U.S. alignment is more robust than ever. After a brief interval during the 2016-22 presidency of Rodrigo Duterte, U.S. warships and military aircraft once again operate out of bases in the Philippines.\n\nJoint naval patrols resumed in early 2023. At the same time, Manila granted U.S. troops unprecedented access to facilities on the northern Batanes islands, which have become the focus of current joint operations.\n\nMeanwhile, Washington has become more vocal in condemning challenges to the Philippines from China.\n\nU.S. officials had carefully avoided promising to protect the far-flung islands, atolls and reefs claimed by Manila for seven decades following the signing of the Mutual Defense Treaty with the Philippines in 1951.\n\nOnly in March 2019 did then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo assert that the treaty covers all of the geographical area over which the Philippines asserts sovereignty.\n\nIn February 2023, Presidents Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Joe Biden doubled the number of bases in the Philippines open to the U.S. military. That May, the two leaders affirmed that the Mutual Defense Treaty applies to armed attacks that take place \"anywhere in the South China Sea.\"\n\nFirmer ties to the U.S. have been accompanied by more combative behavior on the part of the Philippines. In May 2023, the Philippines coast guard introduced demarcation buoys around Whitsun Reef - the site of an intense confrontation with China's maritime militia a year earlier.\n\nReports circulated three months later that Philippine marines planned to construct permanent outposts in the vicinity of the hotly contested Scarborough Shoal. And a Philippine coast guard ship, with the commander of the country's armed forces aboard, approached Scarborough Shoal in November, before being forced to retreat by Chinese maritime militia vessels.\n\nThen in January 2024, the Philippines broke with its adherence to a prohibition on erecting structures on disputed territory, which was part of the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, by installing electronic surveillance equipment on Thitu Island, which sits beyond Scarborough Shoal in the heart of a cluster of disputed formations. This was followed by announced plans to put water desalination plants on Thitu, Nanshan Island and Second Thomas Shoal, making it possible to maintain permanent garrisons on these isolated outposts.\n\nManila has continued to assert its maritime rights by announcing that armed forces would escort exploration and mining activities in the exclusive economic zone.\n\nFurther acts that could be seen as provocative in Beijing followed, including the stationing of a Philippine navy corvette at nearby Palawan Island and a joint flyover by Philippine warplanes and a U.S. Air Force B-52 heavy bomber.\n\nIt is clear that the deepening of Philippines-U.S. ties has given Manila the confidence to undertake a variety of combative acts toward China. The question is, to what ends?\n\nA more assertive Philippines may end up contributing to the U.S. strategy to deter Beijing from extending its presence in the South China Sea and launching what many in Washington fear: an invasion of Taiwan.\n\nBut it is possible that heightened truculence on the part of the Philippines will goad Beijing into being more aggressive, diminishing the prospects for regional stability.\n\nAs the Philippines-U.S. alignment has strengthened, Beijing has boosted the number of warships it deploys in the South China Sea and escalated maritime operations around Thitu Island, Second Thomas Shoal and Iroquois Reef - all of which the Philippines considers its sovereign territory.\n\nIn early March 2024, two Chinese research ships moved into Benham Rise, a resource-rich shelf situated on the eastern coast of the Philippines, outside the South China Sea. Weeks later, a Philippines coast guard cutter surveying a sandbar near Thitu was harassed not only by Chinese coast guard and maritime militia ships but also by a missile frigate of the People's Liberation Army Navy, which for the first time launched a helicopter to shadow the cutter.\n\nWashington has taken no public steps to dampen tensions between Manila and Beijing. Rather, Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed full-throated support for \"our ironclad defense commitments\" during a mid-March 2024 stopover in Manila.\n\nReassured of U.S. backing, Marcos has amped up the rhetoric, proclaiming that Manila would respond to any troublemaking on Beijing's part by implementing a \"countermeasure package that is proportionate, deliberate and reasonable.\" \"Filipinos,\" he added, \"do not yield.\"\n\nSuch an approach, according to Marcos, was now feasible due to the U.S. and its regional allies offering \"to help us on what the Philippines requires to protect and secure our sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction.\"\n\nThe danger is that as the Philippines grows more assured by U.S. support, it may grow reckless in dealing with China.\n\nRather than deterring China from further expansion, the deepening Philippines-U.S. alignment and associated Filipino assertiveness may only ramp up Beijing's apprehensiveness over its continued access to the South China Sea - through which virtually all of its energy imports and most of its exports flow.\n\nAnd there is little reason to expect that Washington will be able to prevent an emboldened Manila from continuing down the path of confronting China in the South China Sea.\n\nTo Beijing, the prospect of an emboldened Philippines forging active strategic partnerships with Australia, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and - most troublesome of all - Taiwan makes the situation all the more perilous.", "source": {"uri": "military.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

In addition, heightened tensions over the status of Taiwan - a territory that the Biden administration has pledged to defend militarily in the event of a Chinese invasion - have made the South China Sea even more strategically important.\n\nThe latest joint maneuvers come amid two developments that could go some way to influence the future trajectory of tensions in the South China Sea. First, the Philippines has grown increasingly assertive in countering China's claims in the region; and second, the U.S. is increasingly intent on building up regional alliances as part of a strategy to contain China.\n\nThe Philippines-U.S. alignment is more robust than ever. After a brief interval during the 2016-22 presidency of Rodrigo Duterte, U.S. warships and military aircraft once again operate out of bases in the Philippines.\n\nJoint naval patrols resumed in early 2023. At the same time, Manila granted U.S. troops unprecedented access to facilities on the northern Batanes islands, which have become the focus of current joint operations.\n\nMeanwhile, Washington has become more vocal in condemning challenges to the Philippines from China.\n\nU.S. officials had carefully avoided promising to protect the far-flung islands, atolls and reefs claimed by Manila for seven decades following the signing of the Mutual Defense Treaty with the Philippines in 1951.\n\nOnly in March 2019 did then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo assert that the treaty covers all of the geographical area over which the Philippines asserts sovereignty.\n\nIn February 2023, Presidents Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Joe Biden doubled the number of bases in the Philippines open to the U.S. military. That May, the two leaders affirmed that the Mutual Defense Treaty applies to armed attacks that take place \"anywhere in the South China Sea.\"\n\nFirmer ties to the U.S. have been accompanied by more combative behavior on the part of the Philippines. In May 2023, the Philippines coast guard introduced demarcation buoys around Whitsun Reef - the site of an intense confrontation with China's maritime militia a year earlier.\n\nReports circulated three months later that Philippine marines planned to construct permanent outposts in the vicinity of the hotly contested Scarborough Shoal. And a Philippine coast guard ship, with the commander of the country's armed forces aboard, approached Scarborough Shoal in November, before being forced to retreat by Chinese maritime militia vessels.\n\nThen in January 2024, the Philippines broke with its adherence to a prohibition on erecting structures on disputed territory, which was part of the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, by installing electronic surveillance equipment on Thitu Island, which sits beyond Scarborough Shoal in the heart of a cluster of disputed formations. This was followed by announced plans to put water desalination plants on Thitu, Nanshan Island and Second Thomas Shoal, making it possible to maintain permanent garrisons on these isolated outposts.\n\nManila has continued to assert its maritime rights by announcing that armed forces would escort exploration and mining activities in the exclusive economic zone.\n\nFurther acts that could be seen as provocative in Beijing followed, including the stationing of a Philippine navy corvette at nearby Palawan Island and a joint flyover by Philippine warplanes and a U.S. Air Force B-52 heavy bomber.\n\nIt is clear that the deepening of Philippines-U.S. ties has given Manila the confidence to undertake a variety of combative acts toward China. The question is, to what ends?\n\nA more assertive Philippines may end up contributing to the U.S. strategy to deter Beijing from extending its presence in the South China Sea and launching what many in Washington fear: an invasion of Taiwan.\n\nBut it is possible that heightened truculence on the part of the Philippines will goad Beijing into being more aggressive, diminishing the prospects for regional stability.\n\nAs the Philippines-U.S. alignment has strengthened, Beijing has boosted the number of warships it deploys in the South China Sea and escalated maritime operations around Thitu Island, Second Thomas Shoal and Iroquois Reef - all of which the Philippines considers its sovereign territory.\n\nIn early March 2024, two Chinese research ships moved into Benham Rise, a resource-rich shelf situated on the eastern coast of the Philippines, outside the South China Sea. Weeks later, a Philippines coast guard cutter surveying a sandbar near Thitu was harassed not only by Chinese coast guard and maritime militia ships but also by a missile frigate of the People's Liberation Army Navy, which for the first time launched a helicopter to shadow the cutter.\n\nWashington has taken no public steps to dampen tensions between Manila and Beijing. Rather, Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed full-throated support for \"our ironclad defense commitments\" during a mid-March 2024 stopover in Manila.\n\nReassured of U.S. backing, Marcos has amped up the rhetoric, proclaiming that Manila would respond to any troublemaking on Beijing's part by implementing a \"countermeasure package that is proportionate, deliberate and reasonable.\" \"Filipinos,\" he added, \"do not yield.\"\n\nSuch an approach, according to Marcos, was now feasible due to the U.S. and its regional allies offering \"to help us on what the Philippines requires to protect and secure our sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction.\"\n\nThe danger is that as the Philippines grows more assured by U.S. support, it may grow reckless in dealing with China.\n\nRather than deterring China from further expansion, the deepening Philippines-U.S. alignment and associated Filipino assertiveness may only ramp up Beijing's apprehensiveness over its continued access to the South China Sea - through which virtually all of its energy imports and most of its exports flow.\n\nAnd there is little reason to expect that Washington will be able to prevent an emboldened Manila from continuing down the path of confronting China in the South China Sea.\n\nTo Beijing, the prospect of an emboldened Philippines forging active strategic partnerships with Australia, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and - most troublesome of all - Taiwan makes the situation all the more perilous.\n\nFred H.

Lawson received a Summer Writing Grant from the Charles Koch Foundation.\n\nU.S. Marines joined Filipino counterparts on May 5, 2024, for a mock battle at a telling location: a small, remote territory just 100 miles off the southern tip of the contested island of Taiwan.\n\nThe combat drill is part of the weekslong Exercise Balikatan that has brought together naval, air and ground forces of the Philippines and the United States, with Australia and France also joining some maneuvers.\n\nWith a planned \"maritime strike\" on May 8 in which a decommissioned ship will be sunk and exercises at repelling an advancing foreign army, the aim is to display a united front against China, which Washington and Manila perceive as a threat to the region. Balikatan is Tagalog for \"shoulder to shoulder.\"\n\nJoint Philippines-U.S. naval drills have become an annual event. But as an expert in international relations, I believe this year's drills mark an inflection point in the regional politics of the South China Sea.\n\nFor the first time, warships taking part in the exercise ventured outside the 12-mile boundary that demarcates the territorial waters of the Philippines. This extends military operations into the gray area where the Philippines' exclusive economic zone rubs up against the territory claimed by China and designated by its \"nine-dash line.\"\n\nAlso for the first time, the U.S. deployed an advanced mobile launcher for medium-range ballistic and cruise missiles of a type that had been banned under the now-defunct Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. In addition, the Philippine navy is showing off its newest acquisition, a South Korean-built missile frigate.\n\nThe South China Sea has long been the source of maritime disputes between China, which claims the vast majority of its waters, and nations including Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. In addition, heightened tensions over the status of Taiwan - a territory that the Biden administration has pledged to defend militarily in the event of a Chinese invasion - have made the South China Sea even more strategically important.\n\nContainment at sea\n\nThe latest joint maneuvers come amid two developments that could go some way to influence the future trajectory of tensions in the South China Sea. First, the Philippines has grown increasingly assertive in countering China's claims in the region; and second, the U.S. is increasingly intent on building up regional alliances as part of a strategy to contain China.\n\nThe Philippines-U.S. alignment is more robust than ever. After a brief interval during the 2016-22 presidency of Rodrigo Duterte, U.S. warships and military aircraft once again operate out of bases in the Philippines.\n\nJoint naval patrols resumed in early 2023. At the same time, Manila granted U.S. troops unprecedented access to facilities on the northern Batanes islands, which have become the focus of current joint operations.\n\nMeanwhile, Washington has become more vocal in condemning challenges to the Philippines from China.\n\nU.S. officials had carefully avoided promising to protect the far-flung islands, atolls and reefs claimed by Manila for seven decades following the signing of the Mutual Defense Treaty with the Philippines in 1951.\n\nOnly in March 2019 did then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo assert that the treaty covers all of the geographical area over which the Philippines asserts sovereignty.\n\nIn February 2023, Presidents Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Joe Biden doubled the number of bases in the Philippines open to the U.S. military. That May, the two leaders affirmed that the Mutual Defense Treaty applies to armed attacks that take place \"anywhere in the South China Sea.\"\n\nCausing waves, rocking the boat\n\nFirmer ties to the U.S. have been accompanied by more combative behavior on the part of the Philippines. In May 2023, the Philippines coast guard introduced demarcation buoys around Whitsun Reef - the site of an intense confrontation with China's maritime militia a year earlier.\n\nReports circulated three months later that Philippine marines planned to construct permanent outposts in the vicinity of the hotly contested Scarborough Shoal. And a Philippine coast guard ship, with the commander of the country's armed forces aboard, approached Scarborough Shoal in November, before being forced to retreat by Chinese maritime militia vessels.\n\nThen in January 2024, the Philippines broke with its adherence to a prohibition on erecting structures on disputed territory, which was part of the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, by installing electronic surveillance equipment on Thitu Island, which sits beyond Scarborough Shoal in the heart of a cluster of disputed formations. This was followed by announced plans to put water desalination plants on Thitu, Nanshan Island and Second Thomas Shoal, making it possible to maintain permanent garrisons on these isolated outposts.\n\nManila has continued to assert its maritime rights by announcing that armed forces would escort exploration and mining activities in the exclusive economic zone.\n\nFurther acts that could be seen as provocative in Beijing followed, including the stationing of a Philippine navy corvette at nearby Palawan Island and a joint flyover by Philippine warplanes and a U.S. Air Force B-52 heavy bomber.\n\nA raft of Chinese responses\n\nIt is clear that the deepening of Philippines-U.S. ties has given Manila the confidence to undertake a variety of combative acts toward China. The question is, to what ends?\n\nA more assertive Philippines may end up contributing to the U.S. strategy to deter Beijing from extending its presence in the South China Sea and launching what many in Washington fear: an invasion of Taiwan.\n\nBut it is possible that heightened truculence on the part of the Philippines will goad Beijing into being more aggressive, diminishing the prospects for regional stability.\n\nAs the Philippines-U.S. alignment has strengthened, Beijing has boosted the number of warships it deploys in the South China Sea and escalated maritime operations around Thitu Island, Second Thomas Shoal and Iroquois Reef - all of which the Philippines considers its sovereign territory.\n\nIn early March 2024, two Chinese research ships moved into Benham Rise, a resource-rich shelf situated on the eastern coast of the Philippines, outside the South China Sea. Weeks later, a Philippines coast guard cutter surveying a sandbar near Thitu was harassed not only by Chinese coast guard and maritime militia ships but also by a missile frigate of the People's Liberation Army Navy, which for the first time launched a helicopter to shadow the cutter.\n\nWashington has taken no public steps to dampen tensions between Manila and Beijing. Rather, Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed full-throated support for \"our ironclad defense commitments\" during a mid-March 2024 stopover in Manila.\n\nReassured of U.S. backing, Marcos has amped up the rhetoric, proclaiming that Manila would respond to any troublemaking on Beijing's part by implementing a \"countermeasure package that is proportionate, deliberate and reasonable.\" \"Filipinos,\" he added, \"do not yield.\"\n\nSuch an approach, according to Marcos, was now feasible due to the U.S. and its regional allies offering \"to help us on what the Philippines requires to protect and secure our sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction.\"\n\nThe danger is that as the Philippines grows more assured by U.S. support, it may grow reckless in dealing with China.\n\nRather than deterring China from further expansion, the deepening Philippines-U.S. alignment and associated Filipino assertiveness may only ramp up Beijing's apprehensiveness over its continued access to the South China Sea - through which virtually all of its energy imports and most of its exports flow.\n\nAnd there is little reason to expect that Washington will be able to prevent an emboldened Manila from continuing down the path of confronting China in the South China Sea.\n\nTo Beijing, the prospect of an emboldened Philippines forging active strategic partnerships with Australia, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and - most troublesome of all - Taiwan makes the situation all the more perilous.", "source": {"uri": "theconversation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Conversation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balikatan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Balikatan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South China Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Warship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine-dash_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nine-dash line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Vietnamese_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sino-Vietnamese War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_Defense_Treaty_(United_States\u2013Philippines)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mutual Defense Treaty (United States\u2013Philippines)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate-Range_Nuclear_Forces_Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geography of Taiwan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_commissioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ship commissioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cruise missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

particularly between China and the Philippines.\n\nThey also come just a week after a pair Chinese coast guard ships hit a Philippine coast guard vessel with water cannons in yet another confrontation in the South China Sea, causing significant damage, according to Philippine officials.\n\nThe repeated high-seas confrontations are sparking fears they could degenerate into a larger conflict that could further ratchet up tensions between China and the United States.\n\nLate in 2023, The United States issued a warning to China, saying it respects a 1951 treaty and would defend the Philippines in case of an armed attack,\n\nThe warning came after Chinese ships blocked and collided with two Filipino vessels off a contested shoal.\n\nWith files from Reuters", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fighter aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KAI_T-50_Golden_Eagle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KAI T-50 Golden Eagle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South China Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanker_(ship)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tanker (ship)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_the_Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Provinces of the Philippines"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-ship_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-ship missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coast guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilocos_Norte", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ilocos Norte"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ilocos Norte"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laoag", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laoag"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Laoag"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_waters", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International waters"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shoal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Fine-Chemical_Intermediates", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Fine-Chemical Intermediates", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Naval", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Naval", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/5/8/u-s--and-philippines-sink-ship-in-training-drill-1-6878704-1715191046748.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542952", "eventUri": "eng-9542952", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

China claims almost the entire area under its nine-dash line, which was rejected by an international tribunal in 2016.\n\nWhile the US and Philippine militaries would not name their adversaries, this year's exercises were concentrated around the northern and western shores of the Philippines -- close to the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait.\n\nParts of the drills were also staged in waters outside the Philippines' 19km (12-mile) territorial limit, and also outside Manila's exclusive economic zone, which extends for 200 nautical miles (about 370km).\n\n\"The Philippines and US have a shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific,\" US Marines Lieutenant General Michael Cederholm, commander of the Balikatan joint task force, told reporters on Monday. \"It's grounded in the seeking of peaceful solutions.\n\n\"Make no mistake, if there can't be a peaceful solution, we have an obligation to our countries to train together.\"\n\nIlocos province lies southeast of China and just south of Taiwan, near areas of the South China Sea that would probably be at the centre of any regional conflict over the disputed waters.\n\nThe US and Philippine militaries fired missiles and used howitzer guns stationed along the shore to sink five platoons standing in for amphibious warships.\n\nIn northern Batanes, an island province just south of Taiwan, US and Philippine forces simulated the recapture of Itbayat, the country's northernmost municipality.\n\nThe war games elicited a strong response from China, which managed to disrupt at least one live fire exercise in the South China Sea. The Chinese embassy in Manila did not respond to a request for comment from Al Jazeera.\n\nA Chinese warship and two other vessels were spotted near Itbayat as the exercises were held, the Philippine Coast Guard said on Wednesday. The ships left after the coastguard issued a challenge over the radio.\n\nThis year's exercises also showcased new US weapons that could be stationed in the Philippines during a conflict.\n\nFor the first time in the Asia Pacific, the US military deployed a new mid-range missile launcher, called the Typhon.\n\nFrom the northern Philippines, it is able to reach targets in Taiwan, along with Chinese bases and infrastructure in the South China Sea and mainland China.\n\nIt is the first such weapon deployed in the region since the US withdrew in 2019 from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty that barred the development of ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 2,500km.\n\nWhile the Typhon system was not fired during Balikatan, its deployment now serves to identify launch sites that can be used during a conflict, said Collin Koh, a senior fellow at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.\n\n\"During wartime, all you need to do is just go straight to these launch sites and you can set it up and fire immediately without further preparation,\" Koh said.\n\nThe US and Philippine militaries also used a hovercraft to land a HIMARS missile system on the western island of Palawan, close to contested areas of the South China Sea.\n\nLast year, the militaries tried and failed to land a HIMARS system at the main port of Batanes. This year, the US military upgraded the port, along with a warehouse and other military infrastructure, as part of an effort to develop functional seaports to offload equipment and troops.\n\n\"The longer you stay in the port, the more vulnerable you are,\" Koh said. \"When you are unloading all your equipment and your troops, that is when you are exposed essentially as a sitting duck.\"\n\nLast year, Washington and Manila announced that four military bases would be added to the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, allowing US troops to utilise a total of nine military sites in the Philippines for training, refuelling and other operations.\n\nThree of those bases are in the northern provinces of Cagayan and Isabela, both close to the Luzon Strait running between the Philippines and Taiwan.\n\nThe increasing presence of military troops in civilian areas has alarmed some civilians, worried their location puts them in the path of any future war between the US and China.\n\n\"We don't have to choose between the two,\" said Manuel Mamba, governor of Cagayan province. \"I do not like foreign forces in my province because I feel we could be dragged into a war which is not ours.\"\n\nMamba has vocally opposed the development of bases in his province for US troops and is among a small yet stubborn contingent of regional and local politicians who have resisted Manila's turn towards Washington. Marcos Jr's predecessor Rodrigo Duterte was far closer to Beijing.\n\nCagayan has received substantial investment from Chinese companies, including an ongoing effort to dredge and develop an international port in the coastal town of Aparri.\n\nThe US military builds schools and distributes humanitarian aid during its yearly Balikatan exercises, but Washington has never competed dollar for dollar with the investment promises Beijing can make to local politicians.\n\nLast month, the US and the Philippines announced a new economic investment corridor in Luzon focused on ports, railways and clean energy.\n\nSuch US investment would be welcome in Cagayan \"if it is not military in nature\", Mamba said. \"Maybe [it could be used] only by the Armed Forces of the Philippines if there's an emergency.\"\n\nIn Laoag, where live-fire exercises were held, fishermen were ordered not to sail for more than one week. The order cost some fishing boats up to $60 per day in lost income, said Arvin Mangrubang, a priest at the Laoag branch of the Iglesia Filipino Independiente church.\n\nSome communities gave relief stipends of about $9 per day to families that are registered to vote, which Mangrubang said is hardly enough to cover the cost of the exercises to working families.\n\n\"We cannot gain anything from that,\" he said. \"If China reacts to these exercises, the Filipino people will suffer.\"", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The U.S. moves dovetail with Philippine efforts to shore up its territorial defenses amid disputes with China in the South China Sea and ability to respond to frequent natural disasters.\n\nAbout 2,000 U.S. and Philippine army forces will join the dayslong combat drills backed by helicopters and artillery fire against armed adversaries in a jungle setting in the northern Philippines in June, Maj. Gen. Marcus Evans, commanding general of the U.S. Army's 25th Infantry Division, said Sunday.\n\nThe combat training will be held in the Philippines for the first time at Manila's request. It's not clear whether the longtime treaty allies would decide to turn the maneuvers into an annual exercise, Evans said.\n\nThe drills from June 1 to 10 come at the conclusion of two larger back-to-back exercises between the allied forces -- the Salaknib army-to-army exercises, which opened Monday, and the Balikatan, which will start later in April and involve about 16,000 U.S. and Philippine forces. Several countries including Japan will send observers.\n\n\"We have to be prepared to respond to humanitarian crisis, natural disaster crisis, and that is what this training affords us the opportunity to do,\" Evans told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. \"While we feel confident in our overall readiness and training path, it's something that we can never be complacent in.\"\n\nThe combat-readiness drill in June \"provides an excellent venue for us to get better in terms of our warfighting readiness, to enhance our partnership and then strengthen both our army profession by working together in a very challenging environment,\" Evans said.\n\nThe training was designed to be monitored live to show, for example, how much ammunition, batteries for two-way radios and food would be carried by U.S. and Philippine forces and how they planned for resupplies in a remote battlefield.\n\n\"It really is a way for soldiers, leaders and units to be able to see themselves during a simulated combat environment scenario,\" Evans said.\n\nSuch past combat training in Hawaii has led to better information-sharing by smaller and more agile combat units and improved combat endurance, he said. It bolstered \"the ability to sustain ourselves in a jungle and archipelago environment because there are not ground lines of communications, so we have to rely heavily on air or maritime assets to be able to move supplies.\"\n\nChina has vehemently opposed increased deployments of American forces in Asia, including the Philippines, saying such military presence was endangering regional harmony and stability.\n\nLast year, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. defended his decision to allow U.S. military presence in more Philippine military camps under a 2014 defense pact, saying it was vital to his country's territorial defense.\n\nChina had warned the increased U.S. military presence would \"drag the Philippines into the abyss of geopolitical strife.\"", "source": {"uri":

For the first time, some of this year\u2019s exercises are taking place beyond the 12 nautical-mile boundary of the Philippines\u2019 territorial waters. Fourteen other nations sent \u201cobservers\u201d.\n\nThe presence of two Chinese navy ships in the South China Sea during the group sail exercise prompted Balikatan 2024 spokesman Army Colonel Michael Logico to say on April 30: \u201cI thought there are just 14 countries that will be sending observers. Apparently, there is a 15th country that sent observers.\u201d\n\nWashington-based defence journalist Aaron Matthew Lariosa, who writes for the US Naval Institute and Naval News and has covered multiple Balikatans, said a similar island-retaking exercise during last year\u2019s event took place on an island facing the South China Sea rather than the northern Philippines.\n\nHe said this year\u2019s exercise was different from the previous one because it appeared to be in preparation for a real-world scenario \u2013 that of hostilities breaking out over Taiwan.\n\nSuch a conflict could have serious ramifications for the Philippines, even if it was not directly involved in the hostilities, he noted.\n\n\u201cGiven the Philippines\u2019 proximity, a cross-strait crisis can have very tangible spillover effects in [terms of] either refugees fleeing the conflict or military forces occupying the strategic islands for their own use,\u201d he told This Week in Asia on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt should be remembered that the Batanes [islands, which include Itbayat] were the first [areas] occupied by the Japanese in their invasion during the Pacific War.\u201d\n\nRicardo Jose, a professor of history at the University of the Philippines specialising in World War II, noted that in 21st century warfare, the Batanes islands could provide an ideal location to conceal small, mobile missile systems such as the US Army\u2019s Typhon missile launcher, which made an appearance at this year\u2019s Balikatan and has a range of 370km.\n\n\u201cThe islands are very remote, isolated, they\u2019re difficult to get to with rugged terrain and rapidly changeable weather.\n\n\u201cUnder camouflage and because they are smaller and more mobile, it\u2019s also easier to conceal [missile launchers like the Typhon]\u201d from even spy satellites, he said.\n\nThe Typhon missile system was not fired during the Balikatan, but one such system was included in the exercises to test how viable it was to deploy them on land by airlifting them in.\n\nBesides the island-retaking drill, Monday also saw a separate exercise focused on repelling an invasion force, which took place along the sand dunes of Laoag in Ilocos Norte on the northwestern tip of Luzon.\n\nThis large-scale war game included 150 Australian soldiers from the first battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment.\n\nThe climax of the 19-day war exercises will take place on Wednesday with a multilateral \u201cmaritime strike\u201d or sinking of the BRP Lake Caliraya, a 4,700-tonne Philippine navy vessel built in China.\n\nThe Philippine navy will, for the first time, fire an SSM-700K C-Star (Haeseong) anti-ship cruise missile at the Caliraya, which was towed on Tuesday to its target location beyond the 12 nautical-mile boundary of the Philippines\u2019 exclusive economic zone.\n\nThe goal of the exercise is to achieve a controlled sinking of the Caliraya. The military said the choice of the Chinese-made target was \u201cnot intentional\u201d and not meant to send a message to any particular country.\n\nIn response to questions about whether they might be provoking China, both Philippine and US military officials have insisted that this year\u2019s exercises, which also included firing rockets towards the disputed waters of the South China Sea, are not targeted at any particular country.\n\nLogico said in the same briefing that the military chose locations \u201cthat gave us the most training value, the most challenges\u201d \u2013 including tackling weather and capability issues, and \u201chow to integrate the capabilities of our treaty allies\u201d.\n\nThis year\u2019s Balikatan comes amid heightened tensions between Beijing and Manila after numerous maritime confrontations involving their vessels in the South China Sea. The Philippines has also been increasing its security ties with the US, which has a mutual defence treaty with Manila that US officials including President Joe Biden have promised is ironclad.\n\n\u201cWhat makes this [year\u2019s] exercise notable is its occurrence during the Armed Forces of the Philippines\u2019 shift to the Comprehensive Archipelagic Defence Concept, which looks to orient the country\u2019s military against external threats,\u201d Lariosa noted.\n\n\u201cHowever, due to the weakness of its forces, the Philippines still has to remind potential aggressors that its only treaty ally is prepared to help in certain contingencies.\u201d", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

This nation, among others in Southeast Asia, asserts territorial claims over portions of the sea adjacent to its shores. In response to a recent altercation near Second Thomas Shoal that resulted in injuries to Filipino soldiers and damage to vessels, President Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines declared Manila's intention to enact countermeasures against China. The leaders of Japan, the Philippines, and the United States expressed shared concerns over the People's Republic of China's (PRC) provocative actions in the South China Sea during the inaugural summit held in Washington, DC.

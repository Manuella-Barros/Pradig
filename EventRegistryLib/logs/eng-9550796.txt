In 2023, Armenia made an extraordinary opening ceremony and now everyone is thinking about how to do it even better. We believe that Armenia can organise one of the best World Championships. The 2023 Europeans were one of the best in terms of accommodation, transport and opening ceremony.\n\n\"All countries voted for Armenia to host the 2027 World Cup and it is a very strong message that the Executive Board believes - Armenia can organise the championship at the highest level,\" said Jalood in his speech.\n\nAntonio Urso went even further, describing the 2023 European Championship as the best in the last 10 years.\n\n\"The 2023 European Championship in Armenia was revolutionary in terms of organisation and I think it was the best European Championship in the last ten years. It means that Armenia is capable of organising events at a very high level. And it is a challenge because everyone is curious to see what it will be like in 2027.\n\n\"We have to consider that in 2027 we will have more than 600 athletes and more than 120 national teams at the World Championships and all the guests will feel the hospitality of Armenia,\" said Urso.\n\nAccording to him, the organising countries now want to learn from Armenia.\n\n\"Recently we were in Ningbo, China, which will host the 2026 World Cup, and they told us that they will study the organisation of the 2023 Europeans in Armenia and learn how to do it the best way. This is a good confirmation of how well the tournament was organised\".\n\nZhanna Andreasyan said that Armenia will not only try to maintain the high bar set by the 2023 European Championships, but also to raise the level.\n\n\"We will host the best teams and the best athletes at the 2027 World Championships. We have set a high bar for the organisation of the 2023 European Championships, and we must not only maintain the bar, but also improve it. We are ready to do this in cooperation with the government,\" said Andreasyan.\n\nAccording to Andreasyan, it will be a busy year for Armenian sport in 2027, when Armenia will also host the European Artistic Gymnastics Championships and the sporting events of Frankofonia.\n\nIn recent years, Armenia has hosted a number of major sporting events, and Arayik Harutyunyan noted their importance to the country, not only in terms of sport, but also in economic terms. But this is the first time that Armenia will host a world championship in an Olympic sport.\n\n\"We have great experience in organising such events in recent years - the European Boxing Championship, the World Sambo Championship, the European Weightlifting Championship, and a few days ago the final round of the Futsal Champions League took place.\n\n\"This is very important for the country economically. The 2023 European Weightlifting Championships were broadcast in more than 200 countries, while the Futsal final was broadcast in 70 countries.\n\n\"From now on we will start preparing for the 2027 World Championships. The European Championship 2023 was a real festival of sport and we want it to continue. We have promised the International Weightlifting Federation that we will at least maintain this level,\" said Harutyunyan.\n\nThe 2027 World Championships will be the biggest qualifying event for Los Angeles 2028 and Mohammed Jalood mentioned its importance.\n\n\"Armenia is one of the strongest countries in organising big events, especially in weightlifting. Armenia has good traditions in this sport, I am very proud of it and I wish that Armenian weightlifters will be able to raise the flag of Armenia in Paris 2024.\n\nThe IWF will support Armenia to organise the best qualifying tournament for Los Angeles 2028. We will make a plan with the Armenian Weightlifting Federation and the Ministry of Sports to have the best organisation,\" concluded Jalood.\n\nThe IWF President and General Secretary also met with the Prime Minister of Armenia, Nikol Pashinyan, and then enjoyed a guided tour of the historic capital of Armenia.", "source": {"uri": "insidethegames.biz", "dataType": "news", "title":

The Church has been attacked from day one, the foundations of our identity have been hit, and the last one is Genocide denial. The education system has been destroyed. Today, drugs are being distributed in our schools. And there is no control.\n\nIn foreign relations, there is no table at which Armenia has anything to say today. You are witnesses of all this. And most importantly, Artsakh no longer exists. They lose their homeland; then they say: we need to see the real Armenia. Artsakh was the real Armenia. Look at the borders of Armenia; how many hundreds of square kilometers have been captured, and the enemy is not even going to return them.\n\nSoon, we must proclaim that spiritual Armenia will conquer the new Armenia. A new Armenia will be born, with a new word, with a new victory,\" Galstanyan stated.\n\n\"I would like to extend a special greeting to our brothers and sisters of Artsakh. I say this with pain because we should have greeted you at the Revival Square of Stepanakert. But today, because of this illegal power, you are in Armenia.

Senator Portantino also helped negotiate the historic Memorandum of Understanding between California and Armenia and joined Governor Newsom in New York for its historic, official signing - formally establishing the California Trade and Service Desk in Armenia.\n\nThe California Trade and Services Desk was established to strengthen the economic partnership between Armenian and California, support efforts for mutual economic benefit, and encourage trade and investment by California and Armenia businesses. Yerevan is the first California International Trade and Services Desk to be established by the Newsom administration.\n\nBoth California and Armenia benefit from collaboration and cooperation. Armenia has a flourishing high-tech industry, robust arts community, and a digital business corridor that is underutilized. California is at the forefront of these sectors and continues to be a leader in these areas. Tourism is also a place where California would benefit from direct marketing of our modern Golden State, while also highlighting the amazing and vast historical sites and landmarks of Armenia.\n\nCalifornia has the largest population of Armenian Americans in the country, with the 25th Senate District having the largest concentration.

It will expand the areas under sustainable management, mitigate forest fragmentation, increase tree cover density, and improve the management of neglected abandoned wetlands. Additionally, the project will promote sustainable economic activities and foster the creation of environmentally sustainable jobs in selected rural communities. New and restored forests and wetlands will contribute to reduced greenhouse gas emissions and will enhance the country's resilience to the impacts of climate change.\n\n\"Armenia's beautiful landscapes are one of the country's biggest assets. This asset has been threatened by man-made deforestation and landscape degradation, fueled by unsustainable practices of communities and weak environmental oversight. The RESILAND project addresses forest degradation by providing alternative livelihoods for communities and by strengthening oversight mechanisms through improvements to the policy framework,\" said Carolin Geginat, World Bank Country Manager for Armenia.\n\nArmenia, known for its rich biological diversity, faces a unique challenge as it is a forest-poor country, with only 11.2 percent of its territory covered by forests. According to a World Bank report, Armenia's forestry sector has the potential to contribute to the country's social, economic, and cultural well-being through forest and landscape restoration efforts. Restoring existing and planting new forests, preserving wetlands, and establishing protected areas also contributes to enhanced natural assets and provide valuable services that support human well-being and the economy. Each hectare of forest is estimated to deliver on average $417 per year in total value from a number of ecosystem services (or $138 million annually).\n\nRESILAND Armenia project is part of a broader set of sustained joint efforts of the World Bank and the Government of Armenia in supporting the country's sustainable development goals and green economic transition.

According to the Election Commission of India, the BJP secured 240 seats, significantly lower than its 2019 tally of 303. The Congress, on the other hand, showed strong growth, winning 99 seats. The INDIA bloc crossed the 230 mark, posing stiff competition and defying predictions.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi secured a third term, but the BJP will need to rely on support from coalition partners, including JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar and TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu.

( Image Source :PTI )\n\nCongress MP Rahul alleged Thursday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, and Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman manipulated the stock markets on Lok Sabha election results day. He also demanded a Joint Parliamentary Committee investigation into the matter.\n\nAlleging stock market manipulation by PM Modi, Rahul Gandhi said: \"For the first time, we saw the Prime Minister, the Home Minister, and the Finance Minister comment on the stock market. The PM on 3-4 occasions told the nation that the stock market would surge. The Union Home Minister clearly said that on June 4 the stock market will skyrocket and people should buy stocks. The same message was repeated by the Union Finance Minister.\"\n\nRahul Gandhi then sought to detail the \"chronology\" of the events on which his allegations were based. Referring to a media interview by Home Minister Amit Shah, Rahul Gandhi said: \"Amit Shah on May 13 urged people to buy shares before June 4. On June 19, Narendra Modi said that stock markets will break records on June 4. He makes the same claim on June 28.\" Rahul Gandhi went on to say that media organisations released the exit polls on June 1, which showed the BJP winning a massive mandate. All exit polls were proved wrong on June 4 as the Opposition won a better-than-expected mandate.\n\n\"The BJP's internal survey, which was with their leaders, gave them 220 seats. Intelligence agencies told the government that the BJP would win 200-220 seats,\" Rahul Gandhi alleged.\n\nHe pointed out how the stock markets broke all records before crashing on June 4.\n\nReferring to a presentation made by his party, Rahul Gandhi showed that there was a massive activity surge on May 31, which was double of that in the previous few days. \"These were the people who knew there was a scam going on. Investors, including foreign investors, poured thousands of crores into the market. Then, on June 4, retail investors suffered a loss of Rs 30 lakh crore.\"\n\n\"This is the biggest scam in the history of India's stock market,\" Rahul Gandhi said. He demanded a JPC inquiry and said: \"We are absolutely convinced this is a scam and somebody made thousands of crores at the cost of Indian retail investors. The PM and HM had given an indication to buy [stocks]. This is a criminal act.\"\n\nThe Congress has now posed several questions to the BJP over the allegations of stock market manipulation:\n\n1.

We would like to know if these exit polls were actually carried out, if people were actually sent out, and we would also like to know the methodology of these polls...we would like to understand who these investors are. We have some sense of who these investors are.\n\n\"We are not just speaking out of the air, we are confident that if an investigation is done, interesting things will be revealed and we think that the Prime Minister and Home Minister are directly involved in this,\" he alleged.\n\n\"We are absolutely convinced that this is a scam. Somebody has made thousands of crores of rupees at the cost of Indian retail investors, and the Prime Minister and the Home Minister have given an indication to buy, and this is a criminal act. So, we demand today a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to investigate this,\" he said.\n\nGandhi pointed out that when the actual results were way off the mark from the exit poll claims, the market crashed leading to loss of Rs 30 lakh crores to the retail investors.\n\nThe former Congress president observed that all this was deliberately and wilfully planned and executed. He claimed that the BJP knew that its seats were not going to be more than 220 from their internal survey and the feedback received from intelligence agencies, but despite that the exit polls were made to show that the BJP was winning a large number of seats.\n\nBesides, he pointed out, the interviews were carried out by the channels \"owned by Adani\" and asked why did the PM and the home minister need to give investment advice which people are bound to take seriously, which they did, and later suffered huge losses.\n\nGandhi also posed a set of three questions, asking, \"Why did the PM and HM give specific investment advice to the five crore families investing in the stock markets? Is it their job to give investment advice to the people?\".\n\n\"Why both interviews were given to the same media house owned by the same business group, which is also under SEBI investigations for manipulating stock markets,\" he also asked.\n\n\"What is the connection between the BJP, the fake exit pollsters, and the dubious foreign investors, who invested one day before the exit polls were announced and made huge profits, at the cost of five crore families?\" Gandhi asked.\n\nHe claimed that for the first time we noted that during polls, Prime Minister Modi, Home Minister Shah, Finance Minister Sitharaman commented on the stock market.\n\n\"Why did the prime minister and home minister give investment advice to people,\" Gandhi asked and claimed \"BJP leaders had information that exit polls were wrong.\" Asked whether he was linking Adani group, Gandhi said this is a broader issue than the Adani issue.\n\n\"It is connected to the Adani issue but it is much broader. This is directly the Prime Minister of India and the Home Minister who are privy to data on the actual election results, who have the IB reports, who have their own data, and who are advising retail investors to buy stocks.\n\n\"Quite interestingly, this has never happened before that the PM has commented on the stock market. This is happening for the first time when he is saying that the stock market is going to boom,\" he claimed.\n\n\"We are interested in having a JPC to investigate the role of the Prime Minister, the role of the Home Minister, role of BJP members, and also those who have done this fake exit polls and finally we want to understand who are the people, these foreign investors who did these trades,\" he said.\n\nHe also cited the chronology of events in which Amit Shah said on May 13 that \"buy shares before June 4th\" and on May 19, Modi had said that \"stock markets will break records on June 4th\".

The stock market went down when the Congress was seen gaining in seats on the day of the poll result on June 4 but has now begun rising as the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government is set to return to office for a third consecutive term, it claimed.\n\nAddressing a press conference here, Gandhi demanded a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe into the \"scam\" and sought an inquiry into the alleged role of the prime minister, home minister and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in it, claiming they had advised retail investors to buy stock before the result, which is \"unprecedented\".\n\nGandhi also alleged that Prime Minister Modi and Shah knew how many seats the BJP was winning, but they \"artificially\" jacked up the stock prices with the help of \"fake\" and \"fictitious\" exit polls and the markets crashed when the actual result came out on June 4 leading to huge losses to retail investors.\n\n\"The common people of India lost Rs 30 lakh crore in the stock market on June 4...We demand a JPC investigation into this biggest-ever stock market scam,\" the former Congress chief said.\n\n\"This is a criminal act and we demand a JPC to investigate the involvement of the prime minister, home minister and finance minister and who are the people who made the money in this 'scam',\" he said referring to those behind the exit polls.\n\n\"I am saying that people very high up in the BJP have carried out the scam...they had partners who carried out these exit polls,\" he said, questioning whether such exit polls were actually carried out on the ground and the methodology adopted.\n\nGandhi also asked who these investors were who invested huge sums before the exit polls and made money when the stocks rose thereafter a day before the actual result.\n\nIn a quick retort, Union Minister Piyush Goyal addressed a press conference dismissing Gandhi's demand for a JPC probe into the matter as \"baseless\" and saying he keeps making useless comments.\n\nHe claimed that domestic investors in fact made money while the loss was suffered by foreign investors.\n\nGoyal said the Rs 30 lakh crore figure highlighted by Gandhi was a notional amount and did not pertain to trading.\n\n\"He (Gandhi) does not understand. That is why the people of India do not trust him,\" he said, citing the big rise in the stock market under the BJP government to assert that retail and domestic investors benefited the most.\n\n\"I think Rahul Gandhi should be concerned about the fear of investors as the market crashed when the Congress was doing better than expected. Now, people are confident that the Modi government is coming back, and the market has stabilised and is reclaiming its previous highs,\" Goyal said.\n\nThe trading value was around Rs 6,840 crore, he said, adding that when the Congress was seen gaining in seats on result day, then it fell.\n\nThe minister expressed confidence that the reforms envisioned by the government will continue at a time when the country is poised for a bright future.\n\n\"We are delighted that our allies are progressive and support reforms,\" he said. They know what is good for the people of India and that the Modi government has taken the country to new heights, he added.\n\nGandhi earlier asserted that he was not speaking out of the air, saying, \"we are confident that if an investigation is done, interesting things will be revealed and we think that the PM and home minister are directly involved in this.\" \"We are absolutely convinced that this is a scam. Somebody has made thousands of crores of rupees at the cost of Indian retail investors, and the PM and the home minister have given an indication to buy, and this is a criminal act. So, we demand today a JPC to investigate this,\" he said.\n\nGandhi claimed that when the actual result was way off the mark from the exit poll claims, the market crashed leading to loss of Rs 30 lakh crore to the retail investors.\n\nHe alleged that all this was deliberately and wilfully planned and executed. Gandhi claimed that the BJP knew that its seats were not going to be more than 220 from their internal survey and the feedback received from intelligence agencies, but despite that the exit polls were made to show that the BJP was winning a large number of seats.\n\nBesides, he said, the interviews were carried out by channels \"owned by Adani\" and asked why did the PM and the home minister need to give investment advice which people are bound to take seriously, which they did, and later suffered huge losses.\n\nGandhi also posed a set of three questions, asking, \"Why did the PM and home minister give specific investment advice to the five crore families investing in the stock markets? Is it their job to give investment advice to the people?\".\n\n\"Why were both interviews given to the same media house owned by the same business group, which is also under SEBI investigations for manipulating stock markets,\" he also asked.\n\n\"What is the connection between the BJP, the fake exit pollsters, and the dubious foreign investors, who invested one day before the exit polls were announced and made huge profits, at the cost of five crore families?\" Gandhi asked.\n\nHe claimed that it is for the first time that during polls, Modi, Shah and Sitharaman commented on the stock market.\n\n\"Why did the PM and home minister give investment advice to people,\" Gandhi asked and claimed \"BJP leaders had information that exit polls were wrong.\" \"Quite interestingly, this has never happened before that the PM has commented on the stock market,\" he claimed.\n\nAsked whether he was linking Adani group, Gandhi said this is a broader issue than Adani's. \"It is connected to the Adani issue but it is much broader. This is directly the Prime Minister of India and the home minister who are privy to data on the actual election results, who have the IB reports, who have their own data, and who are advising retail investors to buy stocks.\" He said the JPC is to investigate the role of the PM, home minister, of BJP members and also those who conducted these \"fake\" exit polls.\n\nGandhi cited the chronology of events in which Shah said on May 13 that \"buy shares before June 4\" and on May 19, PM Modi said \"stock markets will break records on June 4\".\n\nThe markets first rose on June 3 after exit polls, but crashed badly on June 4 when the actual result came.\n\nRebutting the allegations, Goyal said Gandhi was desperate after the opposition alliance failed in its bid for power and Modi is set to start his third term.\n\nHe is now hatching a conspiracy to scare domestic and foreign investors from putting their money in India when the prime minister is working to make it the third largest global economy, said Goyal.\n\nWhen the exit polls were broadcast, it was foreign investors who bought expensive stocks while domestic investors sold. When the market crashed, it was the other way round, he claimed that domestic investors made money.\n\nThe market cap has now risen to Rs 415 lakh crore from Rs 67 lakh crore when the Congress-led UPA government demitted office in 2014, he said, adding that the valuation of listed public sector firms has gone up by four times.\n\nThe share of domestic investors in the market has gone up to 84 per cent from 79 per cent 10 years ago and this shows that they are the ones who have benefitted the most under the BJP-led NDA government, he said. The size of the mutual fund industry has surged to Rs 56 lakh crore from Rs 10 lakh crore in this period, Goyal added.

Accompanied by senior Congress leaders KC Venugopal, Supriya Shrinate, and Pawan Khera, Gandhi demanded a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) investigation into what he termed as a major financial scam.\n\nAddressing the media, Rahul Gandhi highlighted unprecedented comments made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman about the stock market during the election period. \"For the first time, we noted that during the elections, the Prime Minister, the Union Home Minister, and the Finance Minister commented on the stock market,\" Gandhi said. \"The Prime Minister said that the stock market is rising at a great speed. The Union Home Minister said that on June 4, the stock market will be on the rise and you all should invest, and similar statements were made by the Finance Minister.\"\n\nGandhi pointed out specific instances where BJP leaders made investment recommendations. \"Amit Shah says buy shares before June 4. On May 19, PM Modi says the stock market will break records on June 4,\" he said, questioning the propriety and intentions behind such advice.\n\nThe Congress leader raised concerns about the unusual timing and nature of these statements, suggesting that they were aimed at benefiting a select few at the expense of millions of retail investors. \"Why did the PM and Union Home Minister give specific investment advice to the five crore families investing in the stock market? Is it their job to give investment advice?\" Gandhi questioned. \"Why were both interviews given to the same media owned by the same business group, which is also under SEBI investigation for manipulating stock?\"\n\nGandhi alleged a nexus between the BJP, fake exit pollsters, and dubious foreign investors. He claimed that these investors made significant profits by buying stocks just before the exit polls were announced, a move that disadvantaged ordinary Indian investors. \"What is the connection between the BJP, the fake exit pollsters, and the dubious foreign investors who invested one day before the exit polls were announced and made a huge profit at the cost of five crore salaries?\" Gandhi asked. \"We demand a JPC into this. We are convinced that this is a scam.\"\n\nAlso read: The Modi Era: The Prime Minister's Big Achievements\n\nRahul Gandhi asserted that the Prime Minister and the Union Home Minister's comments were not mere economic predictions but deliberate signals meant to influence the market. \"Somebody has made thousands of crores of rupees at the cost of Indian retail investors, and the Prime Minister and the Union Home Minister have given an indication to buy,\" he alleged.\n\nThe Congress party has called for a Joint Parliamentary Committee to investigate the matter thoroughly, emphasizing the need for accountability and transparency. \"We demand today a joint parliamentary committee to investigate this,\" Gandhi declared, underscoring the gravity of the allegations.\n\nThe press conference, attended by prominent Congress leaders, underscores the party's aggressive stance on the issue. KC Venugopal, Supriya Shrinate, and Pawan Khera supported Gandhi's call for a JPC, echoing concerns about potential financial misconduct and the erosion of trust in India's financial markets.\n\nAs the allegations unfold, the BJP and its leaders are expected to face increased scrutiny.

At a press conference held on Thursday, Rahul Gandhi targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, accusing them of influencing the stock market.\n\nRahul Gandhi, who was re-elected as an MP from Rae Bareli and Wayanad, claimed that the BJP leaders had prior knowledge of the market's movements. He said, \"For the first time we noticed that during the elections, the Prime Minister, Home Minister and Finance Minister commented on the stock market. The Prime Minister said a couple of times that the stock market is going to grow rapidly. His message was also taken forward by the Finance Minister and Home Minister. The Home Minister even said that shares should be bought before June 4. The Prime Minister also said the same and repeated it again on May 28.\"\n\nRahul Gandhi said that the BJP leaders knew their party would not secure an absolute majority in the elections. He said, \"The biggest leaders of BJP gave a message to retail investors. They had information that BJP will not get absolute majority. They knew what was going to happen on 3-4 June. There has been a loss of Rs 30 lakh crore. Select people have benefited by thousands and lakhs of crores of rupees. We demand an investigation against the Prime Minister, Home Minister and those who conducted the exit poll.\"\n\nThe Congress leader also raised questions about the discrepancy between BJP's internal survey and the exit polls. \"BJP's internal survey was predicting 220 seats.

Now, he is conspiring to mislead the market investors. Today, India has become the fifth largest economy. Today, the whole world accepts India as the fastest growing economy,\" Goyal said.\n\nGoyal said that Indian investors had infact made trading gains (at the cost of foreign portfolio investors) from the volatility in markets in the last few days including on election vote counting day. He noted that Gandhi was referring about loss of valuation (market capitalisation), which was different from gains or losses from the value of shares transacted on those days.\n\nRahul Gandhi's Allegations\n\nDescribing the stock market crash on vote counting day (June 4) as \"biggest ever scam in India's stock market history,\" Gandhi alleged direct involvement of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah in the scam leading to Indian retail investors losing about \u20b930-lakh crore of their wealth on that fateful day.\n\n\"We demand a JPC into this. We are absolutely convinced that this is a scam. Somebody has made thousands of crore of rupees at cost of Indian retail investors. PM and HM have given an indication to buy ahead of the polls. This is a criminal act.\n\nWe want an enquiry on the PM, HM, dubious foreign investors and the fake exit pollsters,\" Gandhi said at a press conference in the capital.\n\nGandhi said that the Prime Minister, Home Minister and Finance Minister had ahead of the polls urged retail investors to buy stocks, claiming that stocks would further rise when June 4 results would be out.\n\nOn their part, the exit pollsters had on June 1 announced a clear majority for BJP and NDA. However, the actual result trend on June 4 proved otherwise, leading to huge downturn in the stock markets and wiping out \u20b930-lakh crore of investor wealth on the day.\n\nOn the results day, the benchmark indices BSE Sensex tanked 4389.73 pts or 5.74 per cent to close at 72,079.05, and Nifty 50 ended at 21,884.50, lower by 1,379.40 or 5.93 per cent.\n\nThis sharp decline of benchmark indices came in the wake of emerging trends from the Lok Sabha election results indicating that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was substantially trailing behind the levels that pollsters had indicated and would fall short of the magical 272 mark that would have given it a single party majority in Lok Sabha.\n\n\"People very high up in BJP has carried out this scam. I am saying they had partners who carried out these exit polls. We would like to know if the exit polls were actually carried out. We would like to know the methodology of these polls. We have some idea of who these investors, who made thousands of crores of rupees are. We are not speaking out of the air.\n\nWe are confident that when investigation is done, interesting things will be revealed and we think PM and HM are directly involved in this,\" Gandhi said.\n\nRahul's questions\n\nGandhi had three main questions related to the alleged scam and demanded answers for them.\n\n(1) Why did PM and HM give specific investment advice to the five crore families investing in stock market? Is it their job to give investment advice?\n\n(2) Why both interviews were given to the same media house owned by the same business group which is also under SEBI investigation for manipulating the stock market?\n\n(3) What is the connection between BJP, fake exit pollsters and dubious foreign investors who invested one day before exit poll and made huge profit at the cost of five crore families?\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on June 6, 2024", "source": {"uri": "thehindubusinessline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "@businessline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mahatma Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piyush_Goyal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piyush Goyal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Home_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Home Affairs (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Shah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amit Shah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Finance_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Finance (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exit poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_and_Exchange_Board_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Securities and Exchange Board of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSE_SENSEX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BSE SENSEX"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/8u913g/article68259906.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/20240606130L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630171", "eventUri": "eng-9630171", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 213, "textEnd": 219, "freq": 4}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-09", "textStart": 412, "textEnd": 418}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 2622, "textEnd": 2628}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

He alleged a nexus between the BJP, exit pollsters, and certain foreign investors benefiting unjustly at the expense of millions of Indian families.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mahatma Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Shah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amit Shah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Home_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Home Affairs (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exit poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirmala_Sitharaman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nirmala Sitharaman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Finance_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Finance (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_manipulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market manipulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/05_06_2024_09_56_26_0848393.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630171", "eventUri": "eng-9630171", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 685, "textEnd": 691}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

He stated, \"During the elections, the Prime Minister, Home Minister, and Finance Minister made remarks on the stock market, suggesting rapid growth and encouraging people to invest in shares. On June 1, misleading exit polls were circulated by the media. BJP's internal survey projected 220 seats, while other agencies forecasted 200 to 220 seats. Subsequently, on June 3, the stock market experienced a significant downturn.\"\n\nRahul Gandhi questioned, \"Why did the PM advise the public to invest? Why did Amit Shah urge people to purchase shares? If there is any link between the BJP and these foreign investors, what is it? We call for a JPC investigation into this matter. The roles of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah must undergo scrutiny.\"\n\nThe Congress leader declared, \"This issue is substantial. It concerns Adani, but it's significant beyond that. It directly implicates the Prime Minister. Key figures within the BJP are implicated in this scandal. We seek to ascertain if there was any collaboration between them and the entities behind the exit polls. We believe that the Prime Minister and the Home Minister are directly implicated, hence we advocate for a JPC inquiry.\"\n\nRahul Gandhi asserted, \"The top leaders of the BJP conveyed to retail investors the message to purchase stocks.

Meanwhile, Union Minister Piyush Goyal countered Gandhi's claims, asserting that Indian investors, in fact, benefitted more, attributing the losses to foreign investors.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Shah", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amit Shah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Home_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Home Affairs (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exit poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mahatma Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Council_of_Ministers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Union Council of Ministers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piyush_Goyal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Piyush Goyal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/05_06_2024_09_56_26_0848393.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630171", "eventUri": "eng-9630171", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 867, "textEnd": 873}], "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Exit polls, in his opinion, are a swindle. He added that \"people lost thirty lakh crore rupees in the stock market as a result of the election exit polls. Recognize its timeline. We saw that the finance minister, home minister, and prime minister made remarks about the stock market for the first time during the election.

This is the biggest scam in the Indian stock market. The entire matter is criminal. Investigation should be done and action should also be taken.\" When he was asked whether he would go to court?

That's why confusion was spread through exit polls. After this, on June 3, the stock market broke the record and reached a great height. We are telling the public that a scam has happened here. The Prime Minister, Home Minister and Finance Minister are directly responsible for this.\"\n\nQuestioned about what he would do if the government refused to allow a JPC investigation, Rahul Gandhi said, \" there would be a fierce opposition in the Parliament on this. They will have to pay attention to us this time. They will be forced to accede to JPC's demand by the pressure we apply.

When results came out, and the markets fell, foreigners sold at low prices and Indian investors bought shares. Even in this period, Indians benefited. The amount Rahul Gandhi is citing is just the valuation. In trading, Indians benefited. They proved to be smart.\"\n\nAt least two former SEBI chairpersons The Indian Express spoke with said the Prime Minister and the Home Minister ought not have said this, but theirs is just one more of the many views on the markets. \"Two separate things: what ought not be said, what law doesn't allow you to say... this falls in the former category,\" said a former SEBI chairperson.\n\nIn his press conference, Gandhi referred to Shah's May 13 statement suggesting people buy stocks before June 4 - the result day -- as the market will shoot up after that, and Modi's May 19 remarks that the market will break all records after June 4.\n\nIn an interview to NDTV on May 13, when asked about market volatility, Shah had said such market moves should be linked to the elections. \"Anyway, afwahon ke karan aise hua bi hoga...to June 4 se pehle aap buy kar lena...woh shoot up karega,\" he said. On May 19, PM Modi told NDTV, \"On June 4, the day of election results... us hafte bhar mein dekhna...ki Bharat ka stock market... unke programming ke jo...order hai... programming wale thak jayenge.\n\nGoyal said foreign investors hold much less than what they held through foreign portfolio investors a decade ago. \"The market cap of India has risen from Rs 67 lakh crore to Rs 415 lakh crore under Prime Minister Modi in 10 years. Retail investors benefited the most. Foreign holding through FPIs was 21 per cent during the UPA days. Today, they hold only 16 per cent. Today, 84 per cent is held by Indians. The mutual fund industry has increased five times in size to Rs 56 lakh crore. Retail investors ensured Indian holdings are higher. The benefits are going to Indian retail investors. This is globally considered a market very well regulated by SEBI. In April and May, when markets were rising, foreigners sold and Indians bought, thus benefiting from it.\"\n\nWhen Gandhi was getting more seats than expected, the markets fell, and he should worry about this, he said. \"The very nature of stock markets is to rise and fall... We are delighted that all our NDA allies are progressive on reforms.\"\n\nIn his press conference, Gandhi said the Home Minister's comments on May 13 were a \"clear indication to retail investors and others to buy stocks.\"\n\n\"On May 19, for the first time, and repeatedly until May 28, the Prime Minister said the stock market is going to break records on June 4. Finally, on June 1, completely fictitious exit polls are released, these investors are given a completely wrong impression and on June 3 as we all know the stock markets break all records, and crash on June 4,\" he said.\n\n\"Whoever has made money has made money as the stock market rose and as the stock market crashed. We are interested in having a JPC to investigate the role of the Prime Minister, the role of the Home Minister, the role of BJP members and also those people who have done those fake exit polls, and finally we want to understand who are the people, the foreign investors, who did these trades. So, we want an investigation,\" he said.\n\nGandhi claimed that the Prime Minister and Home Minister were privy to \"data on actual election results\". They, he said, had access to Intelligence Bureau reports and internal surveys of their own party. He said they knew the exit polls were wrong and the BJP or the NDA was not going to cross either 400 or 300 seats.\n\nAsked whether he was saying it was done to benefit industrialist Gautam Adani, Gandhi said, \"What I meant was Adani could be involved... but it is much bigger than Adani. The BJP's biggest leaders have sent a message to retail investors to buy stock... they (the BJP leaders) had information that the exit polls are wrong and that the BJP is not going to get full majority and they knew what would happen on June 3 and June 4.\"\n\nGandhi's charges came a day after Trinamool Congress MP Saket Gokhle wrote to SEBI chief demanding a regulatory investigation into alleged stock market manipulation through exit polls.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

That is why people of India do not trust him,\" Goyal said, citing the big rise in stock market under the BJP government to assert that retail and domestic investors benefitted the most.\n\n\"I think Rahul Gandhi should be concerned about the fear of investors as the market crashed when the Congress was doing better than expected. Now, people are confident that the Modi government is coming back, and the market has stabilised and is reclaiming its previous highs,\" he said.\n\nThe trading value was around Rs 6,840 crore, Goyal said and added that when the Congress was seen gaining in seats on the day of the Lok Sabha poll result on June 4, then it fell.\n\nThe minister expressed confidence that the reforms envisioned by the government will continue at a time when the country is poised for a bright future. \"We are delighted that our allies are progressive and support reforms,\" Goyal said.\n\nThey know what is good for the people of India and that the Modi government has taken the country to new heights, he added.\n\nFormer Congress president Gandhi, who returned to the political centrestage after his party's better than expected show in the Lok Sabha poll, had earlier alleged that Modi and Shah were \"directly involved\" in what he described as the \"biggest stock market scam\" in which retail investors lost Rs 30 lakh crore, and demanded a JPC probe.\n\nHe said stock markets surged after \"fake\" exit polls and then crashed the day votes for the Lok Sabha polls were counted on June 4.\n\n\"The common people of India lost Rs 30 lakh crore in the stock market on June 4...We demand a JPC investigation into this biggest-ever stock market scam,\" Gandhi said.\n\nRebutting the allegations, Goyal said Gandhi was desperate after the opposition alliance failed in its bid for power and Modi is set to start his third term.\n\nHe is now hatching a conspiracy to scare domestic and foreign investors from putting their money in India when the prime minister is working to make the country the third largest global economy, Goyal said.\n\nWhen the exit polls were broadcast, it was foreign investors who bought expensive stocks while domestic investors sold. When the market crashed, it was the other way round, he claimed to assert that domestic investors made money.\n\nIt is in the nature of markets to go up and down due to various factors and one has to take a long-term view to see how it has performed, he said, noting that its valuation has crossed USD 5 trillion for the first time.\n\nThe market cap has now risen to Rs 415 lakh crore from Rs 67 lakh crore when the Congress-led UPA government demitted office in 2014, he said, adding that the valuation of listed public sector firms has gone up by four times.\n\nThe share of domestic investors in the market has gone up to 84 per cent from 79 per cent in 10 years and this shows that they are the ones who have benefitted the most under the BJP-led NDA government, he said.\n\nThe size of the mutual fund industry has surged to Rs 56 lakh crore from Rs 10 lakh crore in this period, Goyal added. The Modi government is coming back and investors have trust in India's growth story, he said.\n\nQuestioned about the comments of Prime Minister Modi and Shah on the stock market movement, Goyal said every party makes claims about its success and the Congress also did so.

Is it their job to give investment advice to the people?\"\n\n\"Why both the interviews were given to the same media house owned by the same business group, which is also under SEBI investigations for manipulating stock markets?\"\n\n\"What is the connection between the BJP and fake exit pollsters and the dubious foreign investors, who invested one day before the exit polls were announced and made a huge profit at the expense of Indian retail investors.\"\n\nWhat did Modi and HM Amit Shah say\n\nIn separate interviews given to a business channel owned by the Adani Group, Modi and Shah made bold predictions about the stock market. Modi claimed that the market will be so high that the \"programmers will get tired\". He said the markets will benefit for a week after the results come on June 4.\n\nShah, meanwhile, made a more direct remark. \"Buy stocks before June 4, it will shoot up,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Gandhi, Modi and Shah conducted a criminal act by giving an indication to buy stocks.\n\nThe exit polls that were broadcast three days before counting day had predicted the BJP-led NDA would secure more than 350 seats in the 543-member lower house. Subsequently, the BSE Sensex jumped 2,777.58 points or 3.75 per cent to hit a record peak of 76,738.89 in early trade. The benchmark finally ended at 76,468.78, registering a sharp rally of 2,507.47 points. However, the market fell sharply during the counting of votes when it emerged that Modi's party might not be able to gain an absolute majority as it did in 2019.

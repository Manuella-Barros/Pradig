REUTERS/ Lisa Marie David\n\nThe heat index in 18 areas nationwide may reach dangerous levels on Wednesday, the state weather bureau PAGASA said in its forecast.\n\nThe following areas are expected to feel up to 45\u00b0C heat index on May 8:\n\nMetro Manila residents were expected to experience a heat index of 41\u00b0C on Wednesday, which is at the \"extreme caution\" level. The nation's capital on Tuesday had a heat index of 40\u00b0C.\n\nAccording to PAGASA's scale, heat index temperatures from 41\u00b0C to 54\u00b0C are dangerous and could possibly lead to heat stroke.\n\nOn Tuesday, there were more areas (20) that experienced dangerous heat index levels, with the highest recorded in Dagupan City, Pangasinan at 47\u00b0C.\n\nHeat index refers to the measure of the temperature that the body feels, which is different from the actual air temperature. It is computed by factoring in the humidity and the air temperature.\n\nPAGASA warned that dangerous levels of heat index may likely lead to heat cramps and heat exhaustion. Heat stroke is also probable with continued exposure to heat.\n\nThe Department of Health (DOH) earlier reported 77 cases of heat-related illnesses from January 1 to April 29. Of this number, 87% or 67 of these cases were aged 12 to 21 years old.\n\nThe DOH advised the public to limit time outdoors and to drink plenty of water instead of other drinks such as tea, coffee, soda, and liquor. Strenuous activities may be scheduled at the beginning or end of the day, when it is cooler.\n\nPAGASA declared on March 22 the start of the warm and dry season.

When humidity is high, our bodies have a harder time to cool off.\n\nNational Weather Service forecasters expect increasingly high heat indices -- slightly lowering Sunday.\n\nTake a look a this weekend's feel-like temperatures:\n\nSouth Florida's western suburbs, forecasters say, could have a maximum heat index of 105F.\n\nHow to avoid heat exhaustion, strokes\n\nWith the warming trend and prolonged exposure to the elements, comes an increased risk of heat exhaustion and illness, the National Weather Service said. It happens when the body experiences an excessive loss of water and salt through sweating.\n\nThe likeliness of experiencing heat exhaustion increases Saturday, particularly in the western suburbs.\n\nSunday's lower humidity levels should help lower these risks, but people should continue to exercise caution.\n\nHere are some of the symptoms caused by heat exhaustion:\n\nIf someone is experiencing heat exhaustion, they must move to a cool place, sip water and put cool and wet cloths on their body. If they throw up of if symptoms last over an hour, call 911.\n\nHeat strokes happen when the body's temperature increases rapidly and can no longer be controlled.\n\nFor a full list of symptoms and recommendations, visit cdc.gov/disasters/extremeheat/warning.html.\n\nWill it rain?\n\nSouth Florida's rain chances will remain under 20% Friday but scattered afternoon showers and thunderstorms are expected Saturday, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nRainfall as much as a quarter of an inch is forecast for Broward and Palm Beach counties through Sunday.", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "omar_rodriguez_ortiz@miamiherald.com", "name": "Omar Rodr\u00edguez Ortiz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_exhaustion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Heat exhaustion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weather forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Palm Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Palm Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspiration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perspiration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_convection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric convection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoregulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thermoregulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broward_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Broward County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Broward County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Heating_and_Cooling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Heating and Cooling", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy_and_Forecasting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy and Forecasting", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy_and_Environment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy and Environment", "wgt": 18}], "image": "https://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/hfkjv9/picture286793190/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Spring%20Break%20Saturday%20001%20167.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546625", "eventUri": "eng-9546625", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

The most widespread impacts were felt on Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service (NWS) HeatRisk index, but the highest temperatures hit a small portion of southern Texas on Thursday, causing \"extreme\" impacts that could prove fatal.\n\nOther Southern states, including Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and Florida, also are expecting hot weather. Temperatures will remain high in Texas through Thursday, after which an approaching cold front is expected to provide some relief.\n\nTypically for this time of year, temperatures in the Brownsville region are around 89 degrees.\n\nMcGinnis urged everyone to stay in doors to stay cool, but if one has to work outside, she advised them to take regular breaks, drink lots of water and stay in the shade.\n\nThe warning also had suggestions for people, such as wearing lightweight and loose-fitting clothing and limiting exercise or any strenuous activities to early morning or evening hours.\n\n\"Take action when you see symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Heat related illnesses increase significantly during extreme heat and high humidity events,\" the advisory said. \"Death is possible to unprepared people and pets.\n\nA larger number of people are under \"moderate\" risk, and even more face a \"minor\" risk. Although the heat will begin to recede on Thursday, NWS HeatRisk shows heat worsening in the southern tip of Texas, where \"extreme\" impacts will be felt.\n\n\"This level of rare and/or long-duration extreme heat with little to no overnight relief affects anyone without effective cooling and/or adequate hydration.

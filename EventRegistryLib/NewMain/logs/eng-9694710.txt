The Brazil international has signed a 5-year contract until 30 June, 2029 with the Bianconeri,\" Juventus said in a statement.\n\n\"Now, Douglas Luiz embarks on a new adventure with Juventus after five years with Villa, where he has shown exponential growth technically, physically and tactically. Welcome to Juventus, Douglas. We can't wait to see you on the pitch!\".\n\nThe midfielder himself - who is currently on duty with Brazil at the Copa America - issued a short video message to Juventus supporters, where he stated that he was \"really happy\" to sign for the Italian giants.\n\n\"Hello Juventini, I'm really happy to be a Bianconero and I can't wait to play in the Allianz Stadium,\" Luiz said. \"See you soon, and Forza Juve!\".\n\nLuiz departs Aston Villa with a record of 22 goals and 24 assists from 204 matches since his arrival from Manchester City in the summer of 2019, playing a key role in the Lions' successful push for Champions League qualification last season.\n\nWhat about Aston Villa's double Juventus signing?\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nBefore settling on a \u00a342.4m fee, Aston Villa and Juventus were initially discussing an audacious swap deal involving Luiz, Weston McKennie and Samuel Iling-Junior, but that transaction fell through.\n\nMcKennie ended up having a change of heart, but Iling-Junior is still expected to complete a move to Villa Park in a separate deal, as will Argentinian midfielder Enzo Barrenechea.\n\nHaving confirmed Luiz's switch to Juventus by the June 30 deadline, Aston Villa can record his sale on their accounts for the 2023-24 financial year in another huge boost to their Profit and Sustainability situation.\n\nThe West Midlands giants have now made four major sales in the summer window, having also seen Morgan Sanson (OGC Nice), Omari Kellyman (Chelsea) and Tim Iroegbunam (Everton) leave the club.\n\nMeanwhile, Ian Maatsen and Lewis Dobbin have arrived from Chelsea and Everton respectively ahead of the 2024-25 Premier League season, which for Villa begins with a trip to West Ham United on August 17.\n\nID:547101:1false2false3false:QQ:: from

More info\n\nDouglas Luiz \u20ac50m move to Juventus will put Aston Villa in the clear regarding Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) with two months left of the summer transfer window remaining for Monchi and Damian Vidagany to improve Unai Emery's squad.\n\nThey have already signed two players, Ian Maatsen for \u00a337.5m and Lewis Dobbin for \u00a39m, and three more are expected to join shortly. In a separate deal with Juventus, Enzo Barrenechea and Samuel Iling-Junior will join Villa for \u20ac22m, while Ross Barkley is close to completing a \u00a35m move from Luton Town.\n\nVilla will offload more players in the coming weeks, following the departure of Tim Iroegubnam, Omari Kellyman and Luiz. Iroegubnam left for Everton in a deal worth up to \u00a313m, while Kellyman signed for Chelsea earlier this week for \u00a319m.\n\nREAD | Aston Villa's dream subs bench as Unai Emery lands reinforcements\n\nREAD | Duran sold, centre-back signs and more options - Villa's three biggest transfer jobs this summer\n\nHere is the transfer status of every player in Unai Emery's squad...\n\nEMI MARTINEZ\n\nVilla pinpointed 'untouchable' players in preparation for the summer window and surely Martinez was one of them. The world's number one.\n\nROBIN OLSEN\n\nOlsen is well-respected in the dressing room and brings a wealth of experience. There were reports suggesting Villa were in the market for another 'keeper, but Emery recognises the importance of Olsen in this department of his squad.\n\nJOE GAUCI\n\nGauci joined Villa from Adelaide United back in January. The 23-year-old is waiting to make his debut for the club.\n\nMATTY CASH\n\nThe right-back has a \u00a330m price tag this summer amid interest from a number of clubs, including AC Milan and Inter.\n\nKOSTA NEDELJKOVIC\n\nNedeljkovic signed from Crvena Zvezda in January, but stayed there for the remainder of the season on loan. At 18 years of age, another loan move is likely, but he will try to impress Emery in pre-season.\n\nKAINE KESLER-HAYDEN\n\nThe 21-year-old was recalled from a loan move at Plymouth in January, despite it coming as a surprise to club and player. Kesler-Hayden made a handful of substitute appearances last season and could depart on another loan or permanently this summer.\n\nEZI KONSA\n\nKonsa is in Germany representing England at Euro 2024. There may be interest in him considering his performances under Emery over the past 18 months, but Villa would demand a huge fee.\n\nDIEGO CARLOS\n\nVilla will listen to offers for Carlos this summer, given his age and big contract. The centre-back joined Villa two years ago under Steven Gerrard, but missed most of his maiden campaign after snapping an Achilles tendon.\n\nCALUM CHAMBERS\n\nChambers is free to leave Villa with one year left on his current contract.\n\nPAU TORRES\n\nTorres joined Villa last summer and took little time to adapt to the Premier League. He is a crucial part of Emery's squad.\n\nTYRONE MINGS\n\nMings has stepped up his recovery from an ACL injury in recent months. It is unclear when he will be able to return to full fitness.\n\nKORTNEY HAUSE\n\nHause hasn't made a competitive appearance since September 2022 while on loan at Watford. He is free to leave the club with a year left on his deal.\n\nIAN MAAATSEN\n\nThe left-back joined Villa from Chelsea earlier this week for a fee of \u00a337.5m.\n\nLUCAS DIGNE\n\nDigne was one of Villa's most consistent players last season, but there were doubts over his future before the campaign got underway. He impressed Emery enough to remain at the club as they looked to offload some of their big earners. There could be interest in Digne again this summer, and following the arrival of Maatsen, Villa could cash in if a deal suited all parties. The 30-year-old is settled and happy at Villa.\n\nALEX MORENO\n\nMoreno struggled for form last season due to injuries and could leave Villa this summer. Reports in Spain claim former club Real Betis hold an interest in him.\n\nLINO SOUSA\n\nSousa will return to Villa this summer following a loan spell at Plymouth last season. He is expected to leave on another loan having joined the club back in January from Arsenal.\n\nBOUBACAR KAMARA\n\nKamara isn't expected to return to first-team training for another few months after suffering knee ligament damage back in February, which ruled him out for the final months of the season.\n\nENZO BARRENECHEA\n\nThe 23-year-old could require some time to get used to the pace of the Premier League, but he impressed at Frosinone last season and will arrive at Villa with plenty of potential for Emery to unlock.\n\nLEANDER DENDONCKER\n\nDendoncker returns from a loan spell at Napoli and is expected to leave the club permanently this summer. Napoli had the option to buy the Belgian, but did not take it up.\n\nYOURI TIELEMANS\n\nTielemans was signed last summer as Villa started to prepare for the sale of Luiz in advance. Key man.\n\nROSS BARKLEY\n\nBarkley is set to return to Villa for a second spell after Villa agreed a \u00a35m deal to sign him earlier this month.\n\nJOHN McGINN\n\nCaptain McGinn will continue to enjoy the club's remarkable journey under NSWE.\n\nEMI BUENDIA\n\nBuendia also suffered an ACL injury last season, on the eve of the new campaign. He has plenty of competition for minutes next season, but it will be great to see him return - after all, he was the brightest player in Villa's pre-season 12 months ago.\n\nPHILIPPE COUTINHO\n\nVilla are reportedly close to terminating Coutinho's contract, which would allow him to sign for Vasco da Gama for free.\n\nJACOB RAMSEY\n\nRamsey has interest from several clubs this summer, including Tottenham. Villa do not want to sell the 23-year-old and he is also settled at his boyhood club. But that will unlikely deter Johan Lange from pursuing Ramsey this summer.\n\nLEON BAILEY\n\nBailey hit top form last season and was key to Villa's bid to finish in the Champions League places. He wanted to leave the club under Steven Gerrard, but Emery has completely changed where his career was heading at Villa.\n\nSAMUEL ILING-JUNIOR\n\nIling-Junior is a versatile left-sided player who operated as a winger or wing-back at Juventus last season.\n\nClick here to join our Villa WhatsApp Community and get headline news sent straight to your phone\n\nMORGAN ROGERS\n\nRogers joined Villa for an initial \u00a38m from Middlesbrough back in January. It was a sensational piece of business by Emery, Monchi and Vidagany. Already showing great potential.\n\nMOUSSA DIABY\n\nThe winger signed for Villa for a huge fee last summer and went in and out of form in his first Premier League season. Diaby reportedly has interest from Saudi Arabia again in this window, but only a mega offer would persuade Villa to sell.\n\nLEWIS DOBBIN\n\nDobbin scored his first Premier League goal for Everton last season and was trying to earn more minutes under Sean Dyche. Given the level of competition for places in his position, he could leave on loan.\n\nOLLIE WATKINS\n\nWatkins is untouchable, despite lots of talk about rival clubs being interest in the England striker.\n\nJHON DURAN\n\nChelsea were given permission to speak to Duran after they broadly agreed a deal with Villa for his transfer. However, a move to the Blues now appears in doubt with no progress being made. Duran has interest from elsewhere too.\n\nWho should leave Emery's squad this summer?

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nDespite losing a key player in Douglas Luiz, Aston Villa believe they'll be in a strong position come the end of the summer transfer window.\n\nThe Brazilian's \u20ac50m move to Juventus puts Villa in the clear regarding Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSRs), but he is not the only sale Villa will make in the coming weeks. Tim Iroegbunam was the first to depart Unai Emery's squad this summer, as he left for Everton in a deal worth up to \u00a313m, with Lewis Dobbin going the other way for \u00a39m.\n\nOmari Kellyman will join Chelsea for \u00a319m, following Ian Maatsen's move to Villa from Stamford Bridge for \u00a337.5m, while Samuel Iling-Junior and Enzo Barrenechea will join Villa for \u00a322m from Juventus in a separate deal to the transaction which sees Luiz join the Italian giants.\n\nREAD | The definitive inside story of Aston Villa transfers and the PSR elephant in the room\n\nREAD | Unai Emery reveals Aston Villa's 'biggest challenge' and Real Union dream\n\nRoss Barkley is also due to sign for Villa in July after they agreed a \u00a35m deal with Luton Town for his transfer earlier this month. The 30-year-old met with Emery to talk about the possibility of returning for a second spell, before accepting the move back to Villa Park following a loan spell in 2020/21.\n\nWhile he might not start every game, Barkley will have a role to play throughout the season, where Villa could play over 50 games like the last campaign. But in the final weeks of the season, tiredness appeared to catch up with Emery's squad and it was no surprise considering the many injury issues Villa had to contend with.\n\nTo compete on all fronts, towards the top of the Premier League, in both domestic cups and in the Champions League, Emery must have options he can turn to on the bench. He had a very youthful bench at the end of last season and had few opportunities to change things up on the pitch.\n\nLet's take a look at Villa's squad depth and what could be the strongest bench Emery could name with a fully-fit team...\n\nStarting in goal, Emery often named two goalkeepers on the bench, with Joe Gauci joining the club last January and competing with Robin Olsen for the back-up role behind Emi Martinez. Viljami Sinisalo is set to return to Bodymoor Heath for pre-season following an excellent spell at Exeter, but he could leave on loan or on a permanent basis this summer.\n\nAt right-back, Villa have Matty Cash, Kosta Nedeljkovic and Kaine Kesler-Hayden. While there is interest in Cash, it's likely Villa would replace him if a move were to materialise. Nedeljkovic will be assessed in pre-season, but as he is still only 18 years of age, a loan appears likely, while Kesler-Hayden only made three substitute appearances last term in the final minutes of matches against Wolves, Bournemouth and Crystal Palace.\n\nOn the opposite flank, Maatsen will be Villa's first-choice left-back following his arrival from Chelsea. Lucas Digne was excellent last season, but Alex Moreno's future is uncertain and could depart in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, Lino Sousa is not expected to stay in the first-team next term and could leave on another loan after playing for Plymouth in the second half of last season.\n\nEzri Konsa can play at right-back or centre-back, while Pau Torres is a certain starter. Villa will listen to offers for Diego Carlos this summer and will therefore be assessing the market for a replacement. Tyrone Mings suffered a serious knee injury last season and is continuing to regain his fitness. Calum Chambers will be allowed to leave the club this summer.\n\nBoubacar Kamara isn't expected back in training for another few months following his own ACL injury suffered back in February. Barrenechea is a holding midfielder but will need some time to get up to speed with Premier League football. John McGinn, Youri Tielemans and Barkley are all excellent options for Emery to pick from in the middle of the pitch. Leander Dendoncker, who returns from an underwhelming loan spell at Napoli, is available for a permanent transfer.\n\nLeon Bailey and Moussa Diaby are Emery's options from the right, while on the left, Villa have Morgan Rogers, Iling-Junior and Jacob Ramsey as exciting options. Of course, McGinn, Barkley or Tielemans are all capable of playing in more advanced roles. It is unclear whether new arrival Dobbin will be used in the first-team or if he will be sent out on loan to continue his development considering the strength in depth in his position.\n\nThe third player who sustained a knee ligament damage last season was Emi Buendia. He offers versatility across the frontline, capable of playing closer to Ollie Watkins or wider on the left or right. Meanwhile, Jhon Duran could leave Villa after the club had broadly agreed a deal to sell him to Chelsea earlier this month. However, after they were given permission to speak to the striker, the move appears to have stalled. The 20-year-old has interest from elsewhere and if he does leave, then Villa will have to replace him in their squad.\n\nWith all that said, here is a possible strongest XI with every member of Emery's squad fully-fit...\n\nVilla XI: Martinez; Cash, Konsa, Pau, Maatsen; Kamara, Tielemans; Bailey, Ramsey, McGinn; Watkins.\n\nTo fill out as stronger subs bench as possible, Emery could only name one 'keeper, while there will be injuries and suspensions to deal with as the season unfolds. There would surely only be room for one centre-back option as well as a full-back with Emery having plenty of midfield and wide options.\n\nIling-Junior, Rogers, Diaby and Buendia are all options to play in advanced roles, while Barkley and Barrenechea will likely be used in the double pivot - if Emery's continues the same system as last season - but are two different players. Villa will need an option to replace Watkins off the bench, which was Duran last season.\n\nWho knows if Villa will have every player in their squad fit and available for just one game next season, so with that in mind, here are the options Emery has on the bench. He'd have to select nine players from the below, even before any new signings are made.\n\nSubs: Olsen, Gauci, Mings, Carlos (or new CB), Digne, Iling-JR, Barrenechea, Barkley, Diaby, Rogers, Buendia, Duran (or new ST).\n\nClick here to join our Aston Villa WhatsApp Community to receive the latest news and transfer headlines.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

It's almost certain the club will add depth via the transfer market but what does its budget look like after June 30?", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Luiz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Douglas Luiz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dundee_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dundee F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juventus_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juventus F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Iroegbunam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Iroegbunam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girona_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Girona FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Spanish_Football_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Spanish Football Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CR_Vasco_da_Gama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CR Vasco da Gama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boubacar_Kamara", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boubacar Kamara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigo_De_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rodrigo De Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McGinn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John McGinn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youri_Tielemans", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Youri Tielemans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol\u00f2_Barella", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicol\u00f2 Barella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S.C._Napoli", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S.S.C.

Aside from the tour of the US and a quick trip to Borussia Dortmund for friendlies ahead of the new season, when the real stuff begins the Lions will be fighting both on the domestic front and in Europe, too, in the newly formatted Champions League.\n\nIt'll be all hands to the pump for Unai Emery, who is conducting a thorough audit of his squad currently and who is due to welcome a number of fresh faces into Bodymoor Heath. While Villa have sold Tim Iroegbunam and are well on their way to parting with Omari Kellyman and Douglas Luiz, plenty of new signings are expected imminently.\n\nIt's cliched, but Villa do have a couple of 'new signings' already within their ranks, aside from an actual new signing in Lewis Dobbin. Both Tyrone Mings and Emiliano Buendia missed practically the entirety of last season, only able to watch as their teammates lifted the Lions up into a fourth-placed finish and an adventure to the Conference League semi-final.\n\nREAD: Emery has made feelings clear on Ramsey amid Tottenham cash plus player bid\n\nREAD: Villa hatch \u00a330m Man City transfer plan for shock Champions League qualifier\n\nMings has kept his social media followers regularly updated on how his rehabilitation process - which has involved a trip to the States - has been going, while Buendia, all being well, will join the centre half in pre-season training as and when their teammates report back to Bodymoor. The Argentine especially was enjoying himself under Emery the season before.\n\nBuendia had struggled to make a significant impact towards the end of Steven Gerrard's time in charge, particularly in front of goal, but once Emery was appointed those fortunes improved somewhat and he netted important goals in victories over Leeds United, Everton and Bournemouth on the club's march up the table and onto the Conference League qualification.\n\nIt was cruel, then, that he was denied the chance to build on those Emery foundations when he suffered that devastating knee injury last summer. All Buendia could do was watch on throughout this last year, remain patient and hope that his teammates could realise their amitions in his stead. Now, he is returning - while requiring a little patience, of course - to an exciting group who are set to embark on a campaign involving football at Europe's top table.\n\nEmery, too, was beginning to find uses for Buendia as he oversaw a dramatic upturn in form in 2022-23. Shortly after his appointment, and around the time of the World Cup, Emery complimented the playmaker's form and application. \"I think Buendia's best quality is his mentality,\" he said. \"He is always pushing and sometimes I have to stop him.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

I've been speaking a lot to everybody and to Emi especially. I have used him as a second striker, as a left winger, but playing inside. I am trying to find his best position on the pitch and how he can combine best with his teammates on the pitch.\n\n\"Emi is a very good player and he has a big challenge here with Aston Villa. His career here is just starting. Fans of Aston Villa must enjoy him. His position is similar to (Lionel) Messi but they are so different - both Argentinian but very different. We want to enjoy working with him to achieve his best performance. He's doing very good work every day to do his best in the future and in the present with us.\"\n\nWhile Leon Bailey has since hit a new height and Moussa Diaby has joined the club while Buendia has been absent, he'll be returning to a squad which is on the up and in which competition for places is at an all time high. In time, though, Buendia has already proven why his return can mark an exciting re-addition to this group already packed with quality.\n\nWhat do you expect of Buendia next season?

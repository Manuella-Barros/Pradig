Former Israeli hostage Noa Argamani, who was rescued in a daring Israeli operation on Saturday, was reportedly found being held captive in the home of an Al Jazeera cameraman in Gaza, according to an exclusive report by Israel Hayom. One of the Israeli Hostages that was Rescued yesterday during the Joint-Operation in Central Gaza, 26-Year-Old Noa Argamani was being held Captive in the Home of Abdallah Aljamal, a Photojournalist and Writer/Editor for both Al-Jazeera and the Palestinian Chronicle.

In footage from the attack, she was seen desperately screaming and reaching for her boyfriend as they were both dragged to Gaza. Her anguished expression as she was driven by force on a motorcycle into captivity is one of the iconic images from the dreadful events of that day. \u05d1\u05dc\u05ea\u05d9 \u05de\u05e2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd \u05e2\u05d6\u05ea\u05d9\u05dd \u05d0\u05d5 \u05d0\u05d9\u05da \u05e9\u05d0\u05d5\u05d4\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05e7\u05e8\u05d5\u05d0 \u05dc\u05d4\u05dd ''\u05d7\u05e4\u05d9\u05dd \u05de\u05e4\u05e9\u05e2'' \u05d7\u05d5\u05d8\u05e4\u05d9\u05dd \u05d0\u05ea \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d6\u05d5\u05d2 \u05e0\u05d5\u05e2\u05d4 \u05d0\u05e8\u05d2\u05de\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d0\u05d1\u05d9\u05e0\u05ea\u05df \u05d0\u05d5\u05e8 Non-involved Gazans or as they like to call them \"innocents\" kidnap the couple Noa Argamani and Ebintan Or pic.twitter.com/7t7glThb73 \u2014 \u05d9\u05e0\u05d5\u05df \u05d1\u05df \u05d7\u05de\u05d5 \u2013 inon \u2013 \u0625\u064a\u0646\u0648\u0646 (@inonbh6) December 20, 2023 She was later seen in a short clip posted by Palestinians, sitting in captivity somewhere in Gaza. In a chilling propaganda video released by Hamas in early June, Argamani appeared to plead for help, while urging Israelis to protest against their government and accusing it of abandoning the hostages.

Numerous videos from October 7 depict a supportive response on the Palestinian street to news of the massacre. Immediately after word of the attacks spread, Palestinians at home and abroad were seen celebrating jubilantly. Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank Celebrate on October 7, Hand Out Sweets, Fire Guns in the Air, following Hamas's Invasion and Massacre in the Gaza Envelope #Palestinians #Hamas #Gaza #Israel pic.twitter.com/hox5P91DkM \u2014 MEMRI (@MEMRIReports) October 29, 2023 Photos and videos uploaded to social media show Palestinian crowds greeting the returning executioners as heroes and burning seized Israeli cars in the streets of Gaza. Others show Palestinians rallying, handing out sweets, and firing guns in the air. Ordinary Palestinian civilians were not just seen celebrating the massacre, but actively participating in it, with full mobs captured on film pouring across the breached border to take part in the killing and raping of innocents, and the looting of their property. According to IDF spokesman Jonathan Conricus, significant numbers of Palestinians unaffiliated with terror groups entered Israel and participated in the atrocities alongside the terrorists. The rescue of Argamani is part of a broader operation by Israeli forces to retrieve hostages taken during the October 7 massacre, which saw over 1,200 people killed and thousands injured in a series of coordinated attacks by Hamas terrorists. The Iranian proxy Islamist terrorist organization targeted attendees at a music festival and those in southern Israeli towns, all while thousands of rockets rained down on Israeli civilian centers. The attack was the deadliest against Jewish people since the Holocaust, involved a series of brutal acts including torture, rape, execution, and the abduction of civilians.

Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, continues to hold numerous hostages, and the situation remains tense as Israel pursues further operations to secure their release. However, the rescue efforts have been fraught with danger and complexity, as hostages are often hidden in civilian areas, complicating military operations. Al Jazeera has a history of anti-American and antisemitic programming, has been accused of promoting jihadist sentiment, and has been banned in numerous countries. Israeli authorities have criticized the international community, particularly media organizations like Al Jazeera, known for their anti-Israel news coverage, for their perceived role in the conflict. The discovery of Argamani in the home of a cameraman affiliated with Al Jazeera has intensified these criticisms, raising questions about the network\u2019s involvement or complicity in the actions of Hamas. According to Euro Med, this absolute scumbag \u201cjournalist\u201d held Israeli civilian Noa Argamani in his home hostage for Hamas. Not only is he a journalist for Al Jazeera and the Palestine Press, but also he\u2019s worked as a spokesman for Hamas\u2019 ministry of labor.

Hamas, a radical U.S.-designated Islamic terror organization, whose charter calls openly for the murder of Jews, previously presented an award to Al Jazeera, claiming the network possessed \u201chigh professionalism\u201d for defending Palestinian positions during the 2021 conflict that saw over 4,000 rockets indiscriminately fired by the Gaza terror group at Israeli population centers.

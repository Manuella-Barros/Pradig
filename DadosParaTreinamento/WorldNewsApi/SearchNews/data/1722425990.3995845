(Sony/Metro) A reader suggests that Sony would\u2019ve been better off releasing a more advanced PS4 Pro rather than start the current generation with the PS5. We\u2019ve had a lot of disgruntled PlayStation 5 owners writing in recently, but the one that caught my eye was last week\u2019s Reader\u2019s Feature about someone who said they weren\u2019t going to bother buying one, as they didn\u2019t see any point in upgrading their PlayStation 4. As someone that did make that jump I can sympathise with that, although it would mean missing out on great exclusives such as Demon\u2019s Souls, Returnal, and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. However, I have a hard time imagining that these games wouldn\u2019t be possible on a PlayStation 4. Maybe the graphics wouldn\u2019t be quite as good (probably not even that for Returnal) but they\u2019re definitely not doing anything that screams \u2018this has to be next gen!\u2019 Your mileage may vary but the point I would like to make is that I\u2019m not sure that Sony gained anything from making the PlayStation 5 and they seem to have lost an awful lot in terms of how much more expensive it is to make games now. Things were going great with the PlayStation 4 though. The games were good, fans were happy, PlayStation was easily beating Xbox\u2026 Sony were on top of their game. By the end sales were starting to fall, like they always do, but rather than make the PlayStation 5 couldn\u2019t they have just made a new model of PlayStation 4? A Super PS4 Pro or something. For such a small improvement in graphics it really doesn\u2019t seem like this generation was worth the trouble, not given all the problems it\u2019s brought and given how short it\u2019s apparently going to last. The only significant change has been the SSD but make that part of the Super PS4 Pro and you\u2019ve got a unique selling point right there. Obviously, it\u2019s too late now but I know of nothing that suggests Sony ever considered this and they\u2019ve said nothing that implies they\u2019re going to take their time with the PlayStation 6. Instead, given Xbox has already said they\u2019re working on a next gen machine, I don\u2019t imagine it\u2019ll be that long until Sony starts talking about their next console. This is stupid. There\u2019s no other word for it. Sony and Microsoft knew games would be even more expensive to make this gen, but they went ahead anyway. That would\u2019ve been okay, up to a point, if they had some sort of plan for dealing with it. But it\u2019s clear they didn\u2019t. Instead, it looks like the problem took them by surprise which is\u2026 stupid. And now they\u2019re going to go ahead and commit exactly the same mistake again and make the problem even worse. Can\u2019t wait till those next gen games take seven years to make and costs $400 million apiece! If you\u2019re reading this and thinking that purposefully holding back and not going with higher tech consoles when they are possible is the stupid thing, then consider Nintendo. They\u2019ve been doing exactly that since the Wii and last time I checked they\u2019re doing okay. They way they talk also shows they think a lot about the long term than PlayStation and Xbox ever seem to. Someone there must be strategising things out, but I\u2019d love to know what the plan is. I\u2019ve got a nasty feeling the final step is \u2018profit\u2019 and the one before that is just \u2018???\u2019 \u2013 if you know what I mean. So there, that\u2019s my solution for the games industry\u2019s current problems: buy Sony a time machine and uninvent the PlayStation 5. I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t think of anything more practical. By reader Hogie Would things be better if the PS4 was still current gen?

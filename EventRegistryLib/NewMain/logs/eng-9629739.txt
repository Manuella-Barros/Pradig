There is still space for improvement.\n\n\"We did well (considering) the conditions. We got the result that we came for and a clean sheet as well.\"\n\nFour changes\n\nArnold made four changes to the team that started in the Socceroos previous encounter, a 5-0 win over Lebanon on March 26 in Canberra.\n\nComing into the 11 were debutant Irankunda, left-back Bos, right-back Ryan Strain and goalkeeper Joe Gauci.\n\nOut went Craig Goodwin, Gethin Jones, Cameron Burgess and first-choice keeper and regular skipper Mat Ryan.\n\nDefenders Jones and Burgess dropped to the bench, while the injured Goodwin and the rested Ryan weren't named in the 25-man squad for these batch of qualifiers against Bangladesh and Palestine.", "source": {"uri": "news.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "News.com.au"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marco_monteverde@news.com.au", "name": "Marco

At least they thought they did, for about an hour. As soon as Nestory Irankunda had been revealed as a start for Australia in their World Cup qualifier against Bangladesh, which ended in a 2-0 win for Graham Arnold's side, an air of anticipation arose, waiting for the 18-year-old to announce himself on his international debut. And after 29 minutes at the Bashundhara Kings Arena in Dhaka there he was, laying off an assist for Ajdin Hrusti\u0107 to fire in from nigh-on 35-yards and give the Socceroos a lead.\n\nRelated: Bangladesh 0-2 Australia: 2026 World Cup qualifier - as it happened\n\nThat's what the historical record would have said, at least, when this game was remembered only when someone came across the '2026 FIFA World Cup qualification - AFC second round' entry on Wikipedia. That was until word came through on the coverage that Hrusti\u0107's effort was heading off target before it took a mammoth deflection of Bangladeshi defender Mehedi Hasan, leaving Mitul Marma completely wrongfooted in the goal.\n\nIn truth, even if Irankunda keeps his assist, the game that saw him become cap number 642 for Australia won't go down in the annals of history. Hope, instead, will be that it becomes a notable piece of trivia marking the commencement of what becomes a long and successful career. For much like the rest of his teammates, the teen crashed repeatedly against a packed Bengal Tigers backline on Thursday evening.\n\nTime and time again Australia came forward - they would end the opening half with 70% of the ball, which rose to 74% by the end of the game - but failed to fashion quality chances against a mass of Bangladeshi bodies. The efforts that were fashioned, meanwhile, the half-sights on goal that are so critical in games against the lowest of low blocks, weren't being pounced on. For all their dominance of possession, Arnold's outfit would manage just four shots on target across the 90, with most of their cavalcade of crosses failing to find a target or, when they did, not being re-directed on Marma's goal.\n\nUltimately, it wasn't the type of result or performance that Arnold and his side will look back fondly on. Rated 184th in the world, Bangladesh are the fifth lowest-ranked side that the Socceroos have ever played since the rankings began, with the 160-place gap between the two nations setting a new record for Australia. Of course, credit must go to the host's well-organised rearguard - Javier Cabrera's side is a different proposition at home and they took advantage of stinking hot conditions, high humidity, and a pitch dangerously degrading as the game went on.\n\n\"Terrible. It's unacceptable,\" Arnold said of a surface he said had kept him up the night before. \"We talk about player welfare and you're putting players on a field [where they] can get injured.\n\n\"The field was dangerous. I'm not passing responsibility that the field was [the reason] we only won 2-0. We had the chances to score five or six, seven. But some of the tackles, potential injuries, were stressing me out.\"\n\nRelated: 'Dream will be fulfilled': Irankunda named in Socceroos squad for World Cup qualifiers\n\nNominally restored to the left-back position - not that he needed to do much defending - Jordy Bos was Australia's best player, demonstrating why, for all the hype surrounding others, the 21-year-old might have quietly developed into one of the best prospects the Socceroos have produced in decades. He should have had a penalty minutes before halftime but eventually got his reward when he sent in a pinpoint delivery - one of the few produced by the Socceroos on the evening - for Kusini Yengi to head in for the second in the 62nd minute.\n\nIrankunda left the pitch after that goal, part of a double sub that saw he and Yengi make way for Adam Taggart and Daniel Arzani. It was a narratively appropriate change; Australia's next big thing making way for one of its former wunderkind, himself making a return to the national stage for the first time since becoming the youngest player at the 2018 World Cup. Irankunda would provide one more tease before his exit, a suburb collection of a cross-field Kye Rowles ball taking him around one defender before he beat another as he drove inside, only for his shot to get away from him.\n\n\"I could have done better with my performance but I'm really proud to obviously cap for the nation, it's a dream come true for me,\" Irankunda said.\n\nIn the end it was a dull but rather blunt win, but a win was secured. Australia will top their group. Palestine await in Perth next week. And with it hopefully a bit more panache.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestory_Irankunda", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nestory Irankunda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_qualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup qualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Graham Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehedi_Hasan_Royal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mehedi Hasan Royal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashundhara_Kings_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bashundhara Kings Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitul_Marma", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mitul Marma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajdin_Hrustic", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ajdin Hrustic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Football_Confederation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asian Football Confederation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bengal"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Bos", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Bos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kusini_Yengi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kusini Yengi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kye_Rowles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kye Rowles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestine national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Taggart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Taggart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Arzani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Arzani"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/a2bf504f6ffb33eb6fef8f72fff7b137", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629739", "eventUri": "eng-9629739", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

though it was so far off target it literally ended up in the car park.\n\nBos couldn't believe he hadn't been awarded a penalty when he was sandwiched by three Bangladesh defenders in the 39th.\n\nFour minutes later, Duke again failed to properly connect with a header.\n\nIrankunda provided a glimpse of his precocious talents in the 58th minute when he beat a defender and danced into the area.\n\nFour minutes later, Bos floated in a wonderful ball that a leaping Yengi superbly nodded home.\n\nDaniel Arzani replaced Irankunda in the 64th minute, his first cap since the 2018 World Cup, and showed exciting flashes, albeit without reward as the game petered out.\n\nThe Socceroos will head straight to Perth for Tuesday night's final qualifier against Palestine.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestory_Irankunda", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nestory Irankunda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajdin_Hrustic", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ajdin Hrustic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashundhara_Kings_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bashundhara Kings Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Duke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Duke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graham Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_qualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup qualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_rubber", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dead rubber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Header (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakib_Hossain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rakib Hossain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestine national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Arzani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Arzani"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/espn/misc_logos/500/soccer.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629739", "eventUri": "eng-9629739", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Channel 10 this is not acceptable, at all.\"\n\nOther fans suggested the network could have used one of its free-to-air channels, which include the main 10 channel, plus 10 Peach and 10 Bold.\n\nThe match is eventually being shown on 10 Bold, with a replay set for 10am AEST on Friday.\n\nSome other fans, however, said the situation reflected the current standing of Australia's national men's team.\n\nThe Socceroos impressed all by making it out of their group stage and losing to eventual champions Argentina 2-1 in the round of 16 at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nYet the team doesn't enjoy the following it once did, particularly when the likes of global names Harry Kewell, Mark Viduka, Tim Cahill and Mark Schwarzer were in their prime.\n\n\"Maybe because nobody wants to watch the socceroos at the moment given the dull boring game style we play. Kinda proves it when Matildas sell out stadiums and the socceroos couldn't fill a small suburban field,\" was one comment on X.\n\n\"Because the socceroos are second rate and no great watching when matched against lowly ranked competition,\" suggested another.\n\nDespite their lack of national coverage, the Socceroos have done all they can in qualifying to date, winning four and drawing one of their Group I games to date to already progress to the next stage.\n\nThe Socceroos finish the second round with Bangladesh and then Palestine on June 11.\n\nAustralia's journey towards the 2026 World Cup in Canada, Mexico and the United States then continues in September when the third round gets underway.\n\nIn terms of Thursday's game, there was increased interest in proceedings as Socceroos coach Graham Arnold has handed a debut to Bayern Munich-bound phenomenon, Nestory Irankunda.\n\nThe Australian side is bidding to qualify for a sixth straight World Cup finals.\n\nThe Socceroos have just taken a 1-0 lead, with a long-range strike from Ajdin Hrustic in the 29th minute finding the back of the net with the help of a wicked deflection from a Bangladesh defender.", "source": {"uri":

New Bayern Munich signing set to debut for Socceroos in World Cup qualifiers", "body": "Australian football fans and pundits have been in awe of the performances of Nestory Irankunda ever since he burst onto the scene as a 15-year old (yes, you read that right!) back in 2022.\n\nHe made a brilliant impact for hometown club Adelaide United, where he garnered a reputation of being a super-sub off the bench that could change a game in an instant.\n\nHis wonderful performance and simply stunning goals have seen him emerge as a candidate to play for the Socceroos, and has earned a move to one of the biggest football clubs in world football.\n\nAhead of his potential debut for Australia against Bangladesh on Thursday, The Sporting News profiles Australia's man of the moment.\n\nMORE: Complete guide to Socceroos 2026 World Cup Qualification\n\nNestory Irankunda is a Tanzanian-born Australian footballer who came through the ranks at his local A-League Men's side Adelaide United.\n\nHe plays primarily on the right wing, using his devastating pace and strong physical frame to get past his opponents and give them trouble; he is also one of the best natural finishes in the league, showcasing an ability to score from any angle from close range or with a thunderbolt from distance (like his outstanding free-kick against Melbourne City last season).\n\nIrankunda has just had his best season for Adelaide to date, scoring eight goals and grabbing six assists in 25 league games for the Reds.\n\nHe also started more games in the season than ever before, with 18 games in the starting 11 as coach Carl Veart has loosened previous restrictions he placed on the youngster.\n\nIn three seasons at the Reds he has played 61 times for the first team in all competitions, scoring 16 goals and assisting eight more, with Adelaide making it to the preliminary finals in two of his three season at the club.\n\nHe was the equal second top scorer for Adelaide, tied with Zac Clough and only behind Hiroshi Ibusuki.\n\nHis standout performances have ensured calls for him to be selected in the Australian national team have grown louder in the past year, and whilst he was a train on player in the March 2023 international window, he still has not made an appearance for the Socceroos.\n\nHe then stoked fears in Australian ranks when after the A-League All-Stars game in May, he claimed he was considering switching allegiances to Burundi if he continued to be snubbed by the Socceroos.\n\nHe was subsequently named in the 23-man squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Bangladesh and Palestine, with Graham Arnold then confirming on Wednesday the youngster would earn his first cap for the Socceroos during the match against Bangladesh.\n\nArnold refused to state whether he would start or be introduced off the bench, but he was insistent that the exciting winger would make the pitch at some point during the match.\n\nIrankunda's status as a breakout A-League star soon meant he was on the radar of the world's top clubs, and in November last year, his dream was realised when he signed for German powerhouse Bayern Munich from July 1st 2024.\n\nThe deal was a club record for Adelaide United, with the fee reported to be 750,000 Euros potentially rising to over 3 million Euros based on certain clauses being met.\n\nHe is not the first Australian to be at the club, with young goalkeeper Anthony Pavlesic also being on the books, and currently appearing regularly for their youth team.\n\nIt is unclear whether Irankunda will be given an opportunity in the first team or if he will have to begin in the youth team alongside Pavlesic, but he will have the pre-season to show new Bayern coach Vincent Kompany he has what it takes to compete in the German Bundesliga.",

but Jordy Bos was superb.\n\nThe roaming left-back worked tirelessly and was Australia's main creative outlet.\n\nIrankunda, the 18-year-old sensation, who is bound for Bayern Munich, had been widely expected to come off the bench in his first senior appearance.\n\nInstead, he started on the right wing as strikers Yengi and Mitch Duke started together up top and Hrustic played attacking midfield.\n\nThe Socceroos dominated possession as Bangladesh sat deep - but recorded just four shots on target from 15 attempts.\n\nIrankunda scuffed a strike wide in the 17th minute.\n\nShortly after, Duke was hacked down close to goal but his pleas for a penalty fell on deaf ears, while the striker fluffed a header in the 27th minute.\n\nAustralia finally broke through when Irankunda found Hrustic, whose long-range strike took a cruel deflection into the back of the net.\n\nBangladesh managed a shot through Rakib Hossain in the 33rd minute - though it was so far off target it literally ended up in the car park.\n\nBos couldn't believe he hadn't been awarded a penalty when he was sandwiched by three Bangladesh defenders in the 39th.\n\nFour minutes later, Duke again failed to properly connect with a header.\n\nIrankunda provided a glimpse of his precocious talents in the 58th minute when he beat a defender and danced into the area.\n\nFour minutes later, Bos floated in a wonderful ball that a leaping Yengi superbly nodded home.\n\nDaniel Arzani replaced Irankunda in the 64th minute, his first cap since the 2018 World Cup, and showed exciting flashes, albeit without reward as the game petered out.\n\nThe Socceroos will head straight to Perth for Tuesday night's final qualifier against Palestine.", "source": {"uri": "aap.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "AustralianAssociatedPress"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestory_Irankunda", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nestory Irankunda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajdin_Hrustic", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ajdin Hrustic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashundhara_Kings_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bashundhara Kings Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kusini_Yengi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kusini Yengi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Duke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell Duke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graham Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_qualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup qualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_rubber", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dead rubber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakib_Hossain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rakib Hossain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestine national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Arzani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Arzani"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Education", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Education", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www-media.aap.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/06230003/ffb95509-df18-4542-9639-73117c6ae5c5.jpg?v=1717678806", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629739", "eventUri": "eng-9629739", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

As soon as Nestory Irankunda had been revealed as a start for Australia in their World Cup qualifier against Bangladesh, which ended in a 2-0 win for Graham Arnold's side, an air of anticipation arose, waiting for the 18-year-old to announce himself on his international debut. And after 29 minutes at the Bashundhara Kings Arena in Dhaka there he was, laying off an assist for Ajdin Hrusti\u0107 to fire in from nigh-on 35-yards and give the Socceroos a lead.\n\nThat's what the historical record would have said, at least, when this game was remembered only when someone came across the '2026 FIFA World Cup qualification - AFC second round' entry on Wikipedia. That was until word came through on the coverage that Hrusti\u0107's effort was heading off target before it took a mammoth deflection of Bangladeshi defender Mehedi Hasan, leaving Mitul Marma completely wrongfooted in the goal.\n\nIn truth, even if Irankunda keeps his assist, the game that saw him become cap number 642 for Australia won't go down in the annals of history. Hope, instead, will be that it becomes a notable piece of trivia marking the commencement of what becomes a long and successful career. For much like the rest of his teammates, the teen crashed repeatedly against a packed Bengal Tigers backline on Thursday evening.\n\nTime and time again Australia came forward - they would end the opening half with 70% of the ball, which rose to 74% by the end of the game - but failed to fashion quality chances against a mass of Bangladeshi bodies. The efforts that were fashioned, meanwhile, the half-sights on goal that are so critical in games against the lowest of low blocks, weren't being pounced on. For all their dominance of possession, Arnold's outfit would manage just four shots on target across the 90, with most of their cavalcade of crosses failing to find a target or, when they did, not being re-directed on Marma's goal.\n\nUltimately, it wasn't the type of result or performance that Arnold and his side will look back fondly on. Rated 184th in the world, Bangladesh are the fifth lowest-ranked side that the Socceroos have ever played since the rankings began, with the 160-place gap between the two nations setting a new record for Australia. Of course, credit must go to the host's rearguard - Javier Cabrera's side is a different outfit at home than they are away and they took advantage of a pitch degrading heavily as the game went on.\n\nNominally restored to the left-back position - not that he needed to do much defending - Jordy Bos was Australia's best player, demonstrating why, for all the hype surrounding others, the 21-year-old might have quietly developed into one of the best prospects the Socceroos have produced in decades. He should have had a penalty minutes before halftime but eventually got his reward when he sent in a pinpoint delivery - one of the few produced by the Socceroos on the evening - for Kusini Yengi to head in for the second in the 62nd minute.\n\nIrankunda left the pitch after that goal, part of a double sub that saw he and Yengi make way for Adam Taggart and Daniel Arzani. It was a narratively appropriate change; Australia's next big thing making way for one of its former wunderkind, himself making a return to the national stage for the first time since becoming the youngest player at the 2018 World Cup. Irankunda would provide one more tease before his exit, a suburb collection of a cross-field Kye Rowles ball taking him around one defender before he beat another as he drove inside, only for his shot to get away from him.\n\nUltimately, a dull rather blunt win, but a win, was secured. Australia will top their group. Palestine await in Perth next week. And with it hopefully a bit more panache.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joey_lynch@theguardian.com", "name": "Joey Lynch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestory_Irankunda", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nestory Irankunda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Graham Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_qualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup qualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehedi_Hasan_Royal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mehedi Hasan Royal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashundhara_Kings_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bashundhara Kings Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajdin_Hrustic", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ajdin Hrustic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Football_Confederation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asian Football Confederation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitul_Marma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mitul Marma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bengal"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Bos", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Bos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kusini_Yengi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kusini Yengi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kye_Rowles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kye Rowles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestine national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Taggart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Taggart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Arzani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Arzani"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/449712a05deee298e78518788c7ceac86e7b9ee4/0_120_3415_2049/master/3415.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=5d347c889024b9d8c67fcba6a7820df1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629739", "eventUri": "eng-9629739", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

World Cup qualifiers.\n\nIn fact, the Socceroos smashed their rivals 7-0 last time they met and one wouldn't bet against a large scoreline when the Aussies take on the world No. 184 at the Bashundhara

impressing, the Leicester star may find himself dropped down the pecking order if he continues to struggle for minutes.\n\nThe contest also gives goalkeeper Joe Gauci some much-needed time between the

The team prevailed on both occasions, 2-0 and 5-0, respectively, in response to their quarter-final exit against South Korea in the AFC Asian Cup Qatar 2023.\n\nWhile Australia have been comfortable in their home ties this campaign, the toughest challenge came in their only away fixture so far against Palestine.\n\nThey edged past Palestine 1-0 that game - six days after the Bangladesh win in November - so another away day poses the Socceroos' biggest threat to extending their perfect run.\n\nBangladeshi 25-year-old forward Rakib Hossain has been selected as part of the squad for the hosts and is one of the key players to watch out for on his familiar turf.\n\nHe has proven to be a formidable attacking asset, scoring 18 goals and providing 10 assists for Bashundhara Kings in the Bangladeshi Premier League this season.\n\nAlso, youngster Mojibur Rahman Jony is in the squad for Bangladesh. The 19-year-old has enjoyed a breakout season with the Kings, scoring eight goals, and will offer the team some quality from midfield.\n\nAustralia coach Arnold faces selection headaches right across the team but most prevalently in the goalkeeper position.\n\nWith captain Maty Ryan recovering from injury, Arnold will have to ponder a team without his current longest-serving Socceroo.\n\nJoe Gauci has spent the last four months with his new club, Aston Villa, as the team secured UEFA Champions League qualification for next season.\n\nHe faces competition for the spot with experienced Western Sydney Wanderers goalkeeper Laurence Thomas and Melbourne Victory's Paul Izzo - who was one of Victory's standout players on their route to the A-League Men's grand final.\n\nIn defence, Aziz Behich returns as an option at left back while Jordan Bos has also recovered well from injury to join up with the team.\n\nSerie B champion Alessandro Circati is in the squad for the first time since the beginning of this year and will look to pick up where he left off at centre-back.\n\nArnold has some new dilemmas in the wide areas, with regulars Mathew Leckie and Martin Boyle facing new competition.\n\nMunich-bound Nestory Irankunda has made the squad for the first time, and Daniel Arzani has returned to the squad for the first time in six years.\n\nThe central striker position is also one to look out for as in-form ALM pair Apostolos Stamatelopoulos and Adam Taggart jostle with Kusini Yengi and Mitch Duke for a start.\n\nThe Socceroos will take the field against Bangladesh at 8:45 pm (AEST) on Thursday night.\n\n\"The squad itself, it's been a great few days. Of course with Kusini [Yengi] getting promoted, Cam [Burgess] getting promoted, Alessandro [Circati] getting promoted, guys like [Josh] Nisbet had an incredible season winning silverware, and Nestory [Irankunda] has his opportunity to take that next big step.\"\n\nIt's just an unbelievably exciting environment. Everyone's in such a great phase of football at the moment.\n\n\"I see it more and more when newer players come in, how quickly they adapt into the atmosphere and the culture of this group, it still surprises me how quickly players are able to adapt. It's great to see because I think that's a reflection of the type of people that we have in this team.\"\n\n\"When you come into these camps, it's an opportunity to take another step forward and continue to get better. Certain games have different bearings, but we want to break records, we want to carry on winning streaks, we want to keep clean sheets, we want to do all the things.\"\n\n\"We have to do that through playing the way that we want, to approach every single game as a team that wants to win every single game, whether it's a friendly, a qualifier or one of the best teams in the world, the mentality never really changes.\"\n\nJoe Gauci\n\n\"I'm ready to play if called upon, but every camp is another opportunity. It doesn't change with Maty in or out of camp. Every time I step into camp, it's an opportunity to show the progressions that I'm making and the development that I'm making in my game.\n\n\"I'm in camp with two other experienced goalkeepers who are probably eager to play minutes for the Socceroos as well, not probably, I know they definitely are.\"\n\n\"I think everything happened really fast for me through January, being in the Asian Cup, coming out of that, belonging to a different club, and having to transition and move to the other side of the world.\"\n\n\"Then to go straight into a team that was seriously competing in the Premier League. And also, playing in the conference league as well, and fighting for a trophy there.\"\n\nConnor Metcalfe\n\nI just come into the squad and it's the same everywhere. Wherever Arnie wants me to play, I will play and do the best I can.\n\n\"We want to win both games so we can (try and) be in pot one. Everyone wants to play and everyone wants to push to start, so it's always pretty intense during training and I'm looking forward to getting more into it.\"\n\n\"I was talking to my parents, saying that it's been less than two years since leaving Australia and St Pauli have had decent opportunities to go up but now to finally achieve it is an amazing feeling. The reason we all play is to have these moments of success. Once you get it, you want more and more.\"\n\nKusini Yengi\n\n\"[Promotion] was really special, something I hadn't experience, so I'm definitely going to remember those scenes and those moments for the rest of my career, hopefully there's many more to come. Yeah, not only me, there's quite a few other boys that experienced similar situations this season, which is amazing.\"\n\nI'm sure we're going to use that experience and that joy coming into camp to create positive vibes and hopefully help us win these next two games.\n\n\"It's going to be a bit more of a difficult game [against Bangladesh] compared to the first one. The conditions obviously, quite different for a number of players coming in to camp here. Also the weather conditions, we have no idea what the pitch is going to be like, and they're up for the fight. So we're going to have to be at our best to win this game, hopefully we will dominate and score a lot of goals like last time.\"\n\nDaniel Arzani\n\n\"I got a message from Arnie when we were on the bus going back to the airport, the day after the grand final on Sunday, that said he wanted to call me, and I was a little bit excited when I saw that. But I didn't want to get my hopes up,\" Arzani said.\n\n\"So when I got back to Melbourne, I gave him a quick call. He gave me the good news. I was absolutely ecstatic. It's something that I've been talking about and wanting for a long time. And it's always an honour to be called up to represent your country.\"\n\n\"Another World Cup would be an incredible experience. It was an honour last time, It'd be an honour, again, it would be two World Cups for me. It's something that I'm going to work hard to be able to do.\"", "source": {"uri": "socceroos.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Socceroos"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I reckon it was just my decision-making that kind of let me (down),\" he said.\n\n\"But I did do the right thing sometimes.\n\n\"Obviously there's still space for improvement and hopefully I improve soon.\"\n\nWhile Irankunda was modest about his performance, coach Graham Arnold was delighted with how the teenager fared on debut.\n\n\"Nestor was very good,\" he said.\n\n\"He's obviously got a lot to learn and a long way to go. But it was great to see him on the pitch.\"\n\nIrankunda scored eight goals and notched six assists for Adelaide United last season.\n\nIn his national team debut, he scuffed one shot just wide of the post and skewed another off target after a lovely dance into the box - in warning signs of the goal scoring prowess that could yet come.\n\n\"Wow. Yeah I'm really happy with that,\" he said.\n\n\"I've just got to keep working and the reward will come.\n\n\"Hopefully I'll get a goal and hopefully many more as well.\"\n\nIrankunda has soaked up the experience of his first full involvement with the Socceroos, after being called up as a train-on player in March 2023.\n\n\"I've learned a lot, to be honest and I can't really think of most of it right now but it's been a lot,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not my first time in camp, obviously it's the second time.\n\n\"Every time you come in, you learn something new.\n\n\"It's really different to club football and I'm really happy to be here with all the older boys.\"", "source": {"uri": "perthnow.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Perth Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestory_Irankunda", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nestory Irankunda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajdin_Hrustic", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ajdin Hrustic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_qualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup qualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Own goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graham Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_United_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adelaide United FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy national football team"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Self-Help", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Self-Help", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Education and Training", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-14938753/b1a63b2dc754cb65813566358b224cf7a32fae6c-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629739", "eventUri": "eng-9629739", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

match and after a 7-0 win in Melbourne last November, hopes were high that many more goals would be on the way.\n\nBut the home side frustrated the Australians and after a deflected own goal in the first half, the only other score came in the 63rd minute to Kusini Yengi.\n\nThe first goal arrived in the 29th minute when Irankunda served the ball up to Aiden Hrustic, who launched a long-range left-footer which ricocheted from a defender's leg to give the keeper no hope.\n\nJordy Bos set up the second goal with a superb cross which was headed into the back of the net by Kusini Yengi.\n\nIt was far from a perfect performance but the Socceroos continue to build momentum and next up will take on Palestine in Perth next Tuesday.\n\nFor the Australians, they had five shots on target with Bangladesh repaying the favour just once and of the time in dangerous attack, the Socceroos dominated with 91%.\n\nOverall they had the ball for 73% of the match but despite the lopsided statistic, two goals were all they were able to muster.\n\nThey are a perfect five from five in the qualification rounds with 17 unanswered goals.", "source": {"uri": "theroar.com.au", "dataType": "news",

And you're putting players on a field that players can get injured.\n\n\"And it's no shock to me that five or six players from Bangladesh went down with cramping, having cramps in calf muscles and hamstrings because that field is not good. I'm being honest ... the field was dangerous.\n\n\"I'm not passing responsibility. That was a field that we only won 2-0, we had the chances to score five, six, seven.\n\n\"But some of the tackles, potential injuries was stressing me out last night.\"\n\nYengi didn't hold back.\n\n\"The grass is too long, there's too much water, it's too muddy, it's patchy, the ball holds up, it's a really soft surface,\" he said.\n\n\"So, when we're running for the ball, when both teams are contesting for the ball, it's easy to slip and accidentally tackle someone, which you saw plenty of times out here.\n\n\"When it's a soft pitch, your muscles have to work a lot harder and that's the reason why you see so many people go down with cramps and things like that.\n\n\"So the surface is dangerous, not (just) for us, but for everyone and it's difficult to play the ball on.\"\n\nAjdin Hrustic's deflected long-range strike, later ruled an own goal, in the 29th minute and Yengi's header in the 62nd proved the difference.\n\nPortsmouth striker Yengi's goal - where the 25-year-old leapt and contorted his body to nod home a quality cross from Jordy Bos - underlined his quality.\n\n\"He's the first to say that he hasn't played for a good six weeks after Portsmouth won the league,\" Arnold said.\n\n\"So he's a little bit probably rusty and obviously the fitness levels weren't as high as they normally are.\n\n\"But look, overall, it was a good game to get him started back into and I'm very happy with him.\"\n\nThe Socceroos were due to fly to Perth overnight ahead of Tuesday night's game, when changes are on the cards - including starts for local centre-backs Alessandro Circati and Cameron Burgess.\n\nThey are confident Hrustic has avoided injury after he hobbled off early in the second half following two physical challenges.\n\nWorld No.24 Australia are top of group I and into the next round of qualifying.\n\nBut if they win against Palestine, and world No.23 South Korea lose or draw against China, they could leapfrog South Korea in the rankings and ensure better seeding for the next draw.\n\nPalestine played Lebanon at 2am AEST Friday in Doha, Qatar.", "source": {"uri": "au.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!7 Sport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kusini_Yengi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kusini Yengi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graham Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashundhara_Kings_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bashundhara Kings Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_qualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup qualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portsmouth F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Circati", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alessandro Circati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajdin_Hrustic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ajdin Hrustic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Burgess", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Burgess"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Own goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Header (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Time in Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch_and_Putt", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch and Putt", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/0rBluQIAjZygcQF5Vvyt0A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aap.com.au/2686aae05417e7a47a260f909075d939", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629739", "eventUri": "eng-9629739", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

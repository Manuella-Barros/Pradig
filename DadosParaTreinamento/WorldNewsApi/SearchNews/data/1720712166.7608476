In Jatusana, which was the traditional seat of his father Rao Birender Singh, he was fielded as the political heir of his family. The people here gave Rao Inderjit a strong entry into politics. After reaching Chandigarh in 1977, Singh never looked back and from here he reached Chandigarh as a member of the Haryana Legislative Assembly four consecutive times from 1977 to 1982, 1982 to 1987 and 1987 to 1991 and again from 2000 to 2004.

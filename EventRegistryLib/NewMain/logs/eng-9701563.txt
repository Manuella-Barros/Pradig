The National Executive Council (NEC) will discuss the Flagbearer's selection on July 4. The petition from the group was received by the Ashanti Regional Communications Officer of the NPP, Paul Yandoh, who assured them that it would be forwarded to the Party's leadership for the necessary action.\n\nIn a related development the former Member of Parliament (MP) for Bantama and former Chief Executive Officer of Environmental Protection Authority (EPA), Dr. Henry Kwabena Kokofu, has appealed to NPP members, supporters, sympathisers, and the general public to fully support the Bawumia/NAPO ticket for the 2024 elections.

Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh's competence on numerous occasions makes him the best choice to partner with Dr. Bawumia\", Dr Brako said on the radio.\n\nThe National Youth Wing of the NPP on its part has earlier called on Dr Bawumia to select Energy Minister and Member of Parliament for Manhyia South, Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh, popularly known as NAPO, as his running mate.\n\nAccording to the Deputy National Youth Organiser of the NPP, Isaac Jay Nii Amahtey Hyde, NAPO's track record and ability to deliver make him the best choice.

We are made up of representatives from all 47 constituencies of the Ashanti Region. As grassroots members of the party, we believe the choice of Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh as running mate to Bawumia is a bad decision for the NPP.\"\n\nHe explained, \"Dr. Bawumia is a Muslim, who is in the minority. There was a need for the party to select a recognized Christian to provide religious balance and address the perception that some Christian majorities have against Muslims. Secondly, everybody in this country knows that the Manhyia South MP, NAPO, is perceived as very disrespectful, and Ghanaians will have a lot to say about him. Let's be honest here, if NAPO speaks for 5 minutes on radio or on a campaign platform, it takes the party three months to clean up his mess. This is not the kind of running mate we need at this time.\"\n\nThe group, led by Ebenezer Nyamekye, is therefore calling on the National Council of the party, the final decision-maker of the party, to reject the nomination of the Manhyia South Constituency Member of Parliament.\n\n\"Since the establishment of the NPP, I have never seen a lobbyist as desperate as NAPO. If the party wants us, the grassroots, to campaign with Dr. Bawumia, they should get us a credible person, or they should forget about the elections. Some NPP MPs in Parliament are alleging that NAPO sponsored some individuals to unseat them, and they failed. Unfortunately, some MPs, we are told, lost their seats. This is a problem. Do you think NAPO can work with these MPs?\"\n\nThe Ashanti Regional Communications Director of the party, Paul Kwabena Yandoh, who received the petition, assured the group that their petition would be sent to the appropriate office.\n\n\"Thank you for your peaceful protest and for not adopting violence to express your disapproval of the flagbearer's nomination of NAPO as running mate.

When the then-presidential candidate Nana Akufo-Addo nominated Dr. Bawumia, he was roundly accepted by a majority of party members and Ghanaians as a whole because people didn't have much against him. That is the kind of candidate we were looking forward to. Apart from Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh, who is from the Ashanti Region, there are many competent people with equal strength and capabilities to be a running mate who will help the party secure victory in the December 7 general elections.\n\n\"We all know that Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia is a true Muslim; we are also looking for someone who is a true Christian and a true Ashanti to partner with him as a running mate.

This forms part of our humble petition submitted yesterday,\" he said in an interview on Ghana Kasa on Kasapa 102.5FM Tuesday.\n\nEbenezer Nyamekye believes the Minister for Education, Dr. Yaw Osei Adutwum, who is widely known for his humility, competence, and credibility, would make a better running mate and eventually a great Vice President.\n\n\"When it comes to humility, character, competence, and credibility, the Minister of Education, Dr. Yaw Osei Adutwum, stands tall. We believe he is an individual who fits well in the office of Vice President and will complement Dr. Bawumia. Dr. Adutwum partnering with Dr. Bawumia will not be a difficult ticket to sell to Ghanaians. We want victory on December 7, and one person we believe could help achieve this is Dr. Yaw Osei Adutwum. We have made our case and petitioned the party.

Appiah Kubi and other groups like the Patriotic Movement for Bawumia appear legitimate and are backed with evidence.\n\nThe CDD-Ghana Fellow drew parallels between the current sentiments and the 2020 Fomena rally, where Dr. Opoku Prempeh's actions allegedly caused divisions within the party.\n\nHe recounted, \"Appiah Kubi's remarks reminded me of the NPP's 2020 rally in the Fomena constituency. NAPO completely undermined the NPP's breakaway independent candidate, Andrew Asiamah, who eventually won his seat and later became Parliament's 2nd Deputy Speaker.\"\n\nHe warned that if Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh, the party's potential running mate, takes the criticism too personally, it may hinder his ability to contribute meaningfully to Dr. Bawumia's ticket.\n\n\"I believe something is amiss, but I can only advise that NAPO should not take Appiah Kubi's statements personally. He should ensure issues are resolved because, without unity in the Ashanti Region, he will add very little to the ticket,\" he cautioned.\n\nDr. Asiedu Sarpong also found it perplexing that the Member of Parliament for Manhyia South, Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh, had not made any efforts to reconcile the differences several years after they arose.\n\nHe wondered, \"Does that mean from that time in 2020 to 2024, NAPO hasn't been able to mend the rifts with the likes of Appiah Kubi and the Fomena MP?\"\n\nHowever, Dr. Sarpong acknowledged that Dr. Opoku Prempeh's professional background could complement Dr. Bawumia's, noting that their approaches to politics differed significantly.\n\n\"There are areas where you can say NAPO can complement Dr. Bawumia. He has experience in student politics, so he understands how to rally the youth. He's a medical professional, so he will probably have a deeper understanding of health issues than Bawumia. He has led the Education and Energy ministries, so maybe he will bring that experience to bear.

The only persons who will remain with Allan Kyerematen will be his confidants, like Joseph Amoah and the KNUST political science lecturer, Dr. Akwasi Amakye Boateng.\"\n\n\"The members of the Movement have already spoken extensively with us behind closed doors and told us they are excited that one of their own has been chosen to partner with Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia.

to the Asantehene, Otumfuo Osei Tutu II, for his blessing.\n\nNAPO, as he is affectionately called, will also be paraded through the principal streets of Kumasi before he arrives at Jubilee

the very name he was waiting for.\"\n\n\"The name of the flagbearer's choice was packaged and sealed in a special luxurious envelope deliberately imported from Dubai and presented to the president,\" he boasted.\n\nSources from the National Council suggest that processes to declare the NPP's Manhyia parliamentary candidacy vacant, to allow for interested persons to contest, will be finalized immediately after the council's meeting on Thursday.\n\nThe flagbearer of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), Vice President Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, has officially submitted the name of the Minister for Energy, Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh, as his preferred running mate for the December 2024 presidential election.\n\nDr. Bawumia presented him to the leadership of the NPP after holding a crucial meeting with President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo at the Jubilee House to inform him about his choice of running mate.\n\nAhead of the meeting, several names had been tipped as potential running mates, but Dr. Opoku Prempeh, the Member of Parliament for Manhyia South, emerged as the preferred candidate.\n\nThe stakes are high for both the NPP and the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC), as the NPP seeks to win a third term and the NDC aims to avoid a third consecutive defeat.\n\nWhen unveiled, Dr. Opoku Prempeh will face off with Professor Naana Jane Opoku-Agyemang, the running mate of the opposition flagbearer, John Mahama.\n\nBoth running mates have previously served as education ministers, and their records in the sector will be a focus of the campaign.", "source": {"uri":

Napo cannot hold any parliamentarian's hand and go and campaign for them,\" he said in an interview on Joy Prime's On A More Serious Note show.\n\nMeanwhile, there are thorough deliberations among NPP executives as to whether Dr. Opoku Prempeh will be the selected person to partner Dr. Bawumia and lead the party in the upcoming elections.\n\nThe National Council of the NPP is set to endorse the Energy Minister as running mate of Dr. Bawumia ahead of the December 7 elections following the completion of the necessary consultations by the flagbearer, which saw the acceptance of Napo by President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo and the Majority in Parliament.\n\nThe Majority Leader, Alexander Afenyo-Markin, said in a recent interview with Joy FM's Newsnite on Tuesday, July 2, that there have been consultations within the party to ensure that Dr. Opoku Prempeh is accepted.\n\nThe legislator said that although there were other contenders, they were engaged to get them on board.\n\nRegarding the council's evaluation of the nominee, Mr. Afenyo-Markin expressed hope that discussions on Thursday would go well.", "source": {"uri": "myjoyonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyJoyOnline.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Patriotic_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Patriotic Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Opoku_Prempeh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Opoku Prempeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napo_Province", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Napo Province"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Napo Province"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ecuador"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard-bearer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Standard-bearer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahamudu_Bawumia", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mahamudu Bawumia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Ayariga", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hassan Ayariga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_People's_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All People's Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Kwamina_Afenyo-Markin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Kwamina Afenyo-Markin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nana_Akufo-Addo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nana Akufo-Addo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Council_(Austria)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Council (Austria)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_leader", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Majority leader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/HASSAN-AYARIGA.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9701563", "eventUri": "eng-9701563", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-07", "textStart": 1669, "textEnd": 1679}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-02", "textStart": 1980, "textEnd": 1986}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

This call for alignment with the party's values demonstrates the group's deep respect for the NPP's principles and its commitment to upholding them.\n\nPaul Yandou, the NPP's Ashanti Regional Communications Officer, received the petition and assured the group that it would be promptly submitted to relevant party authorities for review and consideration, respecting the party's decision-making process.\n\nThe Patriotic Movement for Bawumia's stance underscores internal challenges within the NPP ahead of the upcoming elections, highlighting the delicate balance between party unity and voter appeal.", "source": {"uri": "newsghana.com.gh", "dataType": "news", "title": "News Ghana"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napo_(trade_union)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Napo (trade union)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Patriotic_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Patriotic Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grassroots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahamudu_Bawumia", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mahamudu Bawumia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Opoku_Prempeh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Opoku Prempeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashanti_Region", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ashanti Region"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ashanti Region"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://newsghana.com.gh/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/NPP.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9701563", "eventUri": "eng-9701563", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Being an Education Minister is a difficult job, but he survived. The energy sector is equally a difficult place with the energy crisis and such, but he survived until this point.\n\n\"I'm sure if we give him the Sahara Desert, he will manage it. You look at how successful he was at those two ministries, then you can argue that his partnership with Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia will be very successful,\" he told Nana Kwabena Agyemang on the show.\n\nAnalyzing the possible impact of NAPO on Bawumia's presidential bid, Dr. Brako noted that NAPO's strong connections with the Ashanti Region mean that the NPP could sweep the region and get the grassroots together.\n\nHe also noted that NAPO's experience as a lawmaker will come in handy for Dr. Bawumia should he become president.\n\n\"He is from the stronghold of the NPP, so he can mobilize support from home to back Bawumia, who will draw a lot of votes from the Northern Region. By picking NAPO, Bawumia is keeping with the party's tradition. The NPP has a tradition, and they trace their roots to the UGCC.\n\n\"Napo is a medical doctor who has served in two portfolios. He is also an MP, so he will be bringing all these experiences to the Bawumia campaign. Bawumia hasn't been to Parliament, so may lack in that aspect, and that is where NAPO will be helpful,\" he said.\n\nHis comments follow widespread reports that Dr. Bawumia is likely to name the Manhyia South MP as his running mate for the 2024 elections.\n\nBawumia, as per reports, has submitted NAPO's name to the National Executive Committee of the NPP, in accordance with the party's rules and regulations.\n\nThe NEC of the NPP is expected to meet on Thursday, July 3, 2024, to deliberate on the issue.\n\nEK", "source": {"uri": "ghanaweb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GhanaWeb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napo_(trade_union)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Napo (trade union)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahamudu_Bawumia", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mahamudu Bawumia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Patriotic_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Patriotic Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Education,_Winneba", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Education, Winneba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lecturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lecturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radio broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Opoku_Prempeh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Opoku Prempeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Education minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sahara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napo_Province", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Napo Province"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Napo Province"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ecuador"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Executive_Committee_of_the_Labour_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Executive Committee of the Labour Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhyia_South", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manhyia South"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grassroots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashanti_Region", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ashanti Region"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ashanti Region"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Region_(Ghana)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northern Region (Ghana)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Region (Ghana)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.ghanaweb.com/imagelib/pics/377/37753409.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9701563", "eventUri": "eng-9701563", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh. Biographically, politically, geographically, complimentarily, managerially and historically, Dr. Bawumia has chosen a vice presidential candidate who satisfies both electoral and governing dynamics.\n\nDr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh presents Dr. Bawumia with intersectional balance: geography, religion, ethnicity, and region. In an era where diversity and unity are cherished ideals for national cohesion, a ticket of such considerable balance offers not just inter-sectional harmony but substantial electoral advantages.\n\nDr. Opoku Prempeh will present Dr. Bawumia with a dogged, experienced, self-assured, tireless, competent, no-nonsense doer with a direct, brash yet fabled operational ability to get tasks accomplished. The fact that he is well grounded in the political tradition of the party and well-connected to the grassroots enables the candidate to not just solidify but rouse the base.\n\nHis national credentials are substantial. On a national level, Dr. Opoku Prempeh wields one of the greatest qualities necessary for the VPship: readiness to be president. In both conventional vice presidential scholarship and practical terms, the Vice President must be seen as someone ready to act as president when the president travels or is absent.\n\nNapo as he's popularly called has extensive experience within Ghana's political, legislative, ministerial and executive landscape to step up in a moment's notice. He, therefore, crosses the first and hugely significant measure: the presidential bar.\n\nThe verdict on NAPO is clear: bullish but folksy; resolute yet warm; no-nonsense serious-minded yet generous. In Ghana he has been adjudged Minister of the Year by the well-established Ghana Ministers of State Excellence awards.\n\nThe verdict may still be out there on the FREE SHS programme and there's no doubt that every policy will need renewal but there's no denying NAPO's place in history as the Minister responsible for the successful implementation of the most consequential and grandiloquent policy decision not just in Ghana's educational sector but in the nation's contemporary history.\n\nAs Education Minister, his zealousness and can-do attitude enabled the government to successfully implement its banner head legislation, free senior high school education. Today, thanks to this flagship programme, enrolment has leaped to a record-breaking figure of 1.2million (up from about 800,000) providing teeming young people, so many of who would have fallen through the cracks, an educational lifeline and a chance at life, no matter how challenging.\n\nHis tenure at the ministry demonstrated his leadership capabilities leading the ministry to implement several curriculum reforms, teacher-based initiatives and moving vocational education to the forefront of the educational system. It is also a thing of legion that NAPO's effective stakeholder engagement helped in the smooth running of the ministry leading to muted strikes and kerfuffle.\n\nHis zeal and sense of single-minded focus may rub off some the wrong way, but in-depth interviews and available research demonstrates his geniality, generosity, empathy and popularity among the party rank and file.\n\nThe Energy Ministry continues to remain a challenging one but we can all largely agree that he's maintained a stolid and dependable leadership at the ministry for His Excellency the President of the Republic.\n\nHe is named sixth out of 100 inspiring individuals in Africa by the African Regional Journal in a list that includes the globally respected Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director-General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Prof. P.L.O Lumumba and emerging leaders such as President Andry Rajoelina, one of Africa's youngest presidents.\n\nHe also has a long legislative experience as the Member of Parliament for Manhyia South which should help in serving as a useful link between the people's representatives and the executive arm. On the whole Dr. Prempeh has a good understanding of Ghana's political landscape, problems and challenges.\n\nHon. Matthew Opoku Prempeh will undoubtedly offer the presidential candidate, party and nation strong leadership; something that aligns with Bawumia's persona as a transformative, bold, courageous and forward-thinking leader.

Parliament for Manhyia South, Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh (NAPO), as his preferred running mate for the upcoming 2024 elections.\n\nAccording to a report by Joy News, the NPP flagbearer presented NAPO to the National Executives of the party on Monday, July 1, 2024, at the party's headquarters in Accra.\n\nThe Vice President also met with the Majority Caucus of Parliament earlier on Monday and officially informed them of his decision to pick the energy minister as the party's vice-presidential candidate.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with Joy News, the Deputy General Secretary of the NPP, Haruna Mohammed, confirmed that the Vice President has presented NAPO as his running mate to the National Executives.\n\nHe said that the next National Executive Council of the party is to approve NAPO's nomination.\n\nThe executive is expected to meet on Thursday, July 4, 2024, to confirm or otherwise Bawumia's choice of NAPO as his running mate.\n\nBAI/\n\nWatch the latest episode of Everyday

Dr\n\nMatthew Opoku Prempeh. Biographically, politically, geographically, complimentarily,\n\nmanagerially and historically Dr Bawumia has chosen a Vice-Presidential candidate who\n\nsatisfies both electoral and governing dynamics.\n\nDr Matthew Opoku Prempeh presents Dr Bawumia with intersectional balance: geography,\n\nreligion, and ethnicity and regionally. In an era where diversity and unity are cherished ideals for\n\nnational cohesion, a ticket of such considerable balance offers not just inter-sectional harmony\n\nbut substantial electoral advantages. Opoku Prempeh will present Dr Bawumia with a dogged, experienced, self-assured, tireless, competent, no-nonsense doer with a direct, brash yet fabled\n\noperational ability to get tasks accomplished. The fact that he is well grounded in the political\n\ntradition of the party and well-connected to the grassroots enables the candidate to not just\n\nsolidify but rouse the base.\n\nHis national credentials are substantial. On a national level, Dr Prempeh wields one of the\n\ngreatest qualities necessary for the VPship: readiness to be president. In both conventional Vice-\n\npresidential scholarship and practical terms, the Vice President must be seen as someone ready to\n\nact as president when the president travels or is absent. Napo as he's popularly called, has\n\nextensive experience within Ghana's political, legislative, ministerial and executive landscape to\n\nstep up in a moment's notice. He therefore crosses the first and hugely significant measure: the\n\npresidential bar.\n\nThe verdict on NAPO is clear: bullish but folksy; resolute yet warm; no-nonsense serious minded\n\nyet generous. In Ghana he has been adjudged Minister of the year by the well-established Ghana\n\nMinisters of State Excellence awards. The verdict may still be out there on the FREE SHS\n\nprogram and there's no doubt that every policy will need renewal but there's no denying\n\nNAPO's place in history as the Minister responsible for the successful implementation of the\n\nmost consequential and grandiloquent policy decision not just in Ghana's educational sector but\n\nin the nation's contemporary history. As Education Minister his zealousness and can-do attitude\n\nenabled the government to successfully implement its banner head legislation, free senior high\n\nschool education. Today, thanks to this flagship program, enrolment has leaped to a record-\n\nbreaking figure of 1.2million (up from about 800,000) providing teeming young people, so many\n\nof who would have fallen through the cracks, an educational lifeline and a chance at life, no\n\nmatter how challenging.\n\nHis tenure at the Ministry demonstrated his leadership capabilities leading the Ministry to\n\nimplement several curriculum reforms, teacher-based initiatives and moving vocational\n\neducation to the forefront of the educational system. It is also a thing of legion that NAPO's\n\neffective stakeholder engagement helped in the smooth running of the ministry leading to muted\n\nstrikes and kerfuffle.\n\nHis zeal and sense of single-minded focus may rub off some the wrong way, but in-depth\n\ninterviews and available research demonstrates his geniality, generosity, empathy and popularity\n\namong the party rank and file. The energy ministry continues to remain a challenging one but we\n\ncan all largely agree that he's maintained a stolid and dependable leadership at the Ministry for\n\nHis Excellency the President of the Republic.\n\nHe is named sixth out of 100 inspiring individuals in Africa by the African Regional Journal in a\n\nlist that includes the globally respected Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweaka, Director-General of the World\n\nTrade Organization (WTO), Prof. P.L.O Lumumba and emerging leaders such as President Andy\n\nRajoelina one of Africa's youngest presidents. He also has a long legislative experience as the\n\nmember of Parliament for Manhyia South which should help in serving as a useful link between\n\nthe people's representatives and the executive arm. On the whole Dr Prempeh has a good\n\nunderstanding of Ghana's political landscape, problems and challenges.\n\nHon. Matthew Opoku Prempeh will undoubtedly offer the presidential candidate, party and\n\nnation strong leadership; something that aligns with Bawumia's persona as a transformative,\n\nbold, courageous and forward-thinking leader. As someone who has been a consequential Vice\n\nPresident himself, an remains an exemplar of revolutionizing the very institution of the vice\n\npresidency, no one is better placed to make this choice than Dr Mahamudu Bawumia.\n\nHe has chosen a man of substance with the credentials, governing ability, political skills, energy,\n\npolicy chops, gravitas and can-do mindset to complement the flagbearer on what has been\n\nchristened a journey of possibilities.", "source": {"uri": "thenewcrusadingguideonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Crusading Guide Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahamudu_Bawumia", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mahamudu Bawumia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Opoku_Prempeh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Opoku Prempeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napo_(trade_union)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Napo (trade union)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethnicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Honourable", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Honourable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Patriotic_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Patriotic Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grassroots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minister of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhyia_South", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manhyia South"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director-General_of_the_World_Trade_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Director-General of the World Trade Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Lumumba", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrice Lumumba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excellency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Excellency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocational_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vocational education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curriculum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Trade Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baptism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://thenewcrusadingguideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9701563", "eventUri": "eng-9701563", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

MATTHEW OPOKU PREMPEH AS THE PARTY'S VICE-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE ON JULY 4, 2024\n\nGood evening, ladies and gentlemen of the Press\n\nThe National Council of the NPP, which is the second highest decision-making body of the party met today, July 4, 2024, to consider the nomination of Hon. Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh by H.E. Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, the party's Presidential Candidate, as his Running Mate for the 2024 general elections.\n\nThe meeting, which ended a few minutes ago, did in fact, consider the said nomination which forms part of the constitutionally mandated processes for selecting the party's Running Mate as per Article 13(3)(1) of the NPP Constitution.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Article 13(3)(1) of the Constitution provides as follows:\n\n\"The Party's Presidential Candidate shall, in consultation with the National Council, nominate the Vice-Presidential Candidate\".\n\nI am happy to report that after the necessary consideration, the National Council of the party UNANIMOUSLY ENDORSED the Presidential Candidate's nomination of Hon. Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh, Member of Parliament for Manhyia South and Energy Minister, as his Vice-Presidential Candidate pursuant to Article 13(3) of the Party Constitution.\n\nThis significant milestone marks the completion of the presidential ticket of the NPP for the 2024 general elections, and therefore, sets the stage for the party to fully engage the Ghanaian electorates comprehensively with our message of transformation.\n\nI wish to, at this juncture, say something little about our vice-presidential candidate, focusing primarily on what he brings to the NPP presidential ticket since he is not a stranger to the body politics of our country. Hon. Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh is a 56-year old medical doctor, a devoted Christian and a consummate politician.\n\nHe is a product of Prempeh College and the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, both in Kumasi, as well as the Erasmus University in The Netherlands. It was at KNUST that he made his first appearance as a leader, after he won the position as the local National Union of Ghana Students (NUGS) President, a position he held from 1991 to 1992.\n\nAfter working with the National Health Service in the United Kingdom for some time, he returned to Ghana in 2005 to pursue a career in business and more importantly in politics. He successfully became the Member of Parliament for Manhyia in 2009. Ahead of the 2012 elections, the constituency was divided into two, and in those elections, he won the newly-created Manhyia South constituency, which he retained in 2016 and 2020.\n\nOwing to his passion for education, President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo appointed him as Minister of Education during his first term. As Education Minister, Napo, as he is affectionately called, spearheaded the implementation of the famous Free Senior High School policy, Under Dr. Prempeh, the successful implementation of the government's flagship Free Senior High School (FSHS) policy saw the country's SHS population leap from 800,000 in 2016 to 1.2 million by January 2021.\n\nIt is instructive to note that Napo ensured that this policy was rolled out within the first year of the Akufo-Addo government when he was appointed as Education Minister. He didn't ask for honeymoon. I repeat, he didn't ask for honeymoon. It will be recalled that at the time he announced that he was going ahead to implement the policy, many people, including some from civil society organizations (CSOs) and some senior members of the government thought it was too early.\n\nBut, typical of Napo, would have none of that. He showed boldness and decisiveness when it mattered most, and went on with the policy, which is by far, the biggest social intervention in the nation's education sector since Independence. Today, posterity has vindicated him. Ghana certainly needs leaders who are bold and decisive, because that is the only way we can achieve results.\n\nIt is also worthy to note that throughout his 4-year tenure as Minister for Education, there was significant industrial harmony and stability in the education front. He ensured that the concerns of teachers and other players in the education sector were adequately attended to. This therefore confirms that Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh has an incredible interpersonal and negotiation skills. He is arguably the only Minister of Education in this Fourth Republic to have achieved this feat.\n\nHaving delivered at the Ministry for Education, the President appointed him during his second term to head the Ministry of Energy, where he again, demonstrated his stellar leadership qualities. He worked very hard to KEEP THE LIGHTS ON, even during the\n\ntimes of unprecedented global economic crisis when every sector of the economy was virtually in \"darkness\", gasping for breath.\n\nWe however concede that in the last couple of weeks and months, some parts of the country did face some power challenges. But, the good news is that, unlike in the past particularly under H.E John Dramani Mahama, where we slept in darkness for over four(4) years, Dr. Prempeh ensured that the recent power challenges we experienced did not last beyond three (3) months. He is indeed results-oriented, and there is absolutely no debate about that.\n\nIn recognition of his leadership skills, his contribution towards education in Ghana, particularly in respect of his role in the implementation of the government's flagship Free SHS programme and other transformational policies in education, Dr. Prempeh has been honoured by the University of Education Winneba, the University of Cape Coast and the University of Professional Studies, Accra with the conferment on him with honourary doctorate degrees.\n\nIn July 2021, he was invited to join the Mission 4.7 High-Level Advisory Group, a joint initiative of UNESCO, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, the Ban Ki-Moon Center for Global Citizens and the Center for Sustainable Development (CSD) at Columbia University.\n\nIn conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, if you were to ask me what Dr. Matthew Prempeh brings to the NPP presidential ticket, I will tell you he brings decades of political astuteness, trustworthy leadership, confidence, decisiveness, grassroots mobilization, charisma, patriotism and demonstrable incorruptibility.\n\nAgain, Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh shares Dr. Bawumia's vision of bold solutions for our country that are responsive to the needs, opportunities and challenges of the 21st century. In this respect, he complements our flagbearer in many significant ways and the two enjoy a warm, personal relationship anchored on deep mutual respect.\n\nMore importantly, Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh has a great working relationship with our Presidential Candidate, H.E Alhaji Dr. Alhaji Mahamudu Bawumia. The synergy between these two great leaders on our presidential ticket, coupled with their proven track-record and transformational campaign message would help the New Patriotic Party to secure a resounding third consecutive electoral victory on the 7th of December 2024, by the grace of Almighty ALLAH.", "source": {"uri": "newsghana.com.gh", "dataType": "news", "title": "News Ghana"},

He described that decision as very bad, and that it will invariably cause the Vice President's doom.\n\n\"He who the gods want to kill, they first make mad. The Vice President is his own man. He chose NAPO himself, even against the advice of his supposed \"puppet master\", the President. This is a bad choice, and it will invariably cause his doom.\"\n\nHe also mentioned that the minute NAPO is announced as the NPP's Vice Presidential Candidate, the party is one comment away from defeat\n\n\"We have to understand that, the minute that NAPO is mentioned as the Vice Presidential Candidate, the NPP is one comment away from losing the election. On any given day, one disrespectful comment away from losing the election. One ethnocentric comment away from losing the election. One misguided ignorant comment away from losing the election. Because they have chosen NAPO\"\n\nDescribing NAPO as someone with a bad reputation for being arrogant and making misguided utterances, he continued,\n\n\"NAPO is the kind of personality who will dirty even Mother Teresa's hands. Because every time he is talking, you are scared. Every time he opens his mouth, you're worried about who he is going to offend. Because he has absolutely no sense of awareness of who he is in the grand scheme of things. He thinks he is the hero of all of our stories, and that we just wake up in the morning with the yearning desire to hear what nugget of wisdom will fall out of his mouth today. That's who he thinks he is in our lives. Only a person with such a god complex, such a misguided god complex, will do and say the things he does and says, even to school children and the people of Keta\".\n\nDescribing NAPO further, he said the Energy Minister cannot even control himself as he is arrogant to the core, and that Ghanaians will always be in that expectant mood of waiting to see how NAPO will screw the NPP campaign. He goes on to state that, Ghana may wake up one day to another Rawlings-Arkaah episode in the event the NPP wins power with this pair.\n\n\"It is uncontrollable.

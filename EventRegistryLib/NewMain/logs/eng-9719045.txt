Bringing a loaded handgun to our checkpoints isn't the way to do it.\"\n\nThe Mohnton man was cited by police Monday after Transportation Security Administration officers detected a firearm among the man's carry-on items at one of the airport security checkpoints. The .45-caliber pistol was loaded with 11 bullets, including one in the chamber, the agency said.\n\n\"The proper way is to pack your unloaded firearm in a locked hard-sided case. Then take the case to your airline check-in counter and declare that you want to travel with it,\" Spero has for what could best be described as numerous times. \"The airline will make sure it is transported in the belly of the plane so that nobody has access to it during the flight. It's a fairly simple process. Instead, this individual ... faces a federal financial civil penalty in addition to having to deal with the criminal citation issued by the police.\"\n\nIt wasn't clear whether Philadelphia or Tinicum Township police were involved.\n\nLast year there were 45 people stopped with firearms at checkpoints at the airport. This year is somewhat behind that pace.\n\nPhiladelphia International has the highest number of firearms seizures of any airport in Pennsylvania, but the TSA statistics show even those numbers pale in comparison to the numbers of seizures at airports in the South.\n\nMore from the TSA:\n\nThe agency has details on how to travel with a firearm and ammunition posted on its website. Firearm possession laws vary by state and locality and passengers should do their homework to make sure that they are not violating any local firearm laws. Travelers should also contact their airline as they may have additional requirements for traveling with firearms and ammunition.\n\nBringing a gun to an airport checkpoint carries a federal civil penalty because TSA reserves the right to issue a civil penalty to individuals who have guns and gun parts with them at a checkpoint. Civil penalties for bringing a gun into a checkpoint can stretch into thousands of dollars, depending on\n\nmitigating circumstances. This applies to individuals with or without concealed gun carry permits because a concealed carry permit does not allow a firearm to be carried through a checkpoint. The complete list of civil penalties is posted online. Additionally, if a traveler with a gun is a member of TSA PreCheck, that individual will lose their TSA PreCheck privileges.\n\nUnsure if an item should be packed in a carry-on bag, checked bag, either or neither?

The country they're traveling to may prohibit traveling with firearms and could impose \"significant criminal penalties.\"\n\nMost guns found by TSA officers were either found in passengers' hand luggage or on their persons, according to the agency.

That brings the yearly total to July 8 at 3,435 firearms seized so far this year, in stark contrast with a reported total of 1,508 gun seized by April last year.\n\nPekoske reminded air travelers that, in order to carry a firearm through TSA checkpoints, there are procedures in place.\n\nPassengers are permitted to travel on airplanes with a gun, subject to other foreign country travel restrictions. But in the United States, to travel with a firearm it must be: secured in the passenger's checked baggage, packed unloaded, locked in a hard-sided case and declared to the airline when first checking the bag at the airline ticket counter.\n\n\"Do not bring it to the checkpoint,\" TSA's administrator said. \"It is costly and delays you and everyone else traveling in the same lane with you.\"\n\nFirearms are not allowed at security checkpoints, in the secure area of an airport or passenger cabin of an aircraft -- even if a passenger has a concealed carry permit or is in a constitutional carry jurisdiction, TSA said. It pointed out that the federal agency does not \"confiscate or seize\" firearms, rather brings in outside law enforcement to take possession of andy weapons.\n\nThe issue of guns, ammunition and air travel has been a noteworthy one of late.\n\nIn June, an American tourist from Oklahoma, looking at the possibility of up to 12 years in prison, avoided jail time in the Turks and Caicos islands by paying a $2,000 fine for bullets found in his luggage in April at Howard Hamilton International Airport while on a trip to celebrate the birthday of several friends.\n\nIn the first two weeks of 2024, TSA officials reported gun-related incidents at Frederick Douglass Rochester International Airport in Virginia, New York's LaGuardia Airport and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Va.\n\nA woman in December was stopped with a loaded handgun before boarding her Christmas Eve flight at Reagan Washington National Airport after it was detected in her carry-on items, and she now is facing a civil penalty of up to $15,000.\n\nLast year, even two elected officials faced travel issues related to guns in their own cases.\n\nIn May, ex-Rep. Madison Cawthorn, R-N.C., plead guilty to bringing a loaded gun through security at North Carolina's Charlotte Douglas International Airport. Cawthorn, a hard right Republican, made the guilty plea to a third-degree misdemeanor charge of possession of a dangerous weapon on city property and paid a $250 fine.\n\nThat was followed in October when a Republican state Senator from Washington got arrested and charged with possession of an unregistered firearm in Hong Kong after it was discovered in his carry-on luggage on his way home, though his office claimed it was registered in Washington.\n\nThe total number of guns taken at American airports appear to consistently keep rising.\n\nIn January, TSA said it hit a record the year before after it had seized more than 6,700 guns at airport security checkpoints throughout the United States in 2023, beating 2022's record of 6,542 guns seized at American airports.\n\nAt the time, Pekoske said he was particularly concerned about the growing number of loaded guns, which pose \"an unnecessary risk to everyone at the TSA checkpoint,\" he said in January.", "source": {"uri":

If a passenger brings a firearm to the security checkpoint, either on their person or in their carry-on luggage, an officer will contact police to unload the weapon and take possession of it.\n\nPolice may also arrest or cite the passenger, and the TSA may fine passengers up to nearly $15,000 for bringing a gun to a security checkpoint.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "landon_mion@foxnews.com", "name": "Landon Mion", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_checkpoint", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Security checkpoint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_Security_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Transportation Security Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Airport security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grenade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pekoske", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Pekoske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_carry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional carry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_luggage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hand luggage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_law_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gun law in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concealed_carry_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Concealed carry in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Aviation_Authorities", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Aviation Authorities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/12/1024/512/TSA-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719045", "eventUri": "eng-9719045", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 502, "textEnd": 509}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

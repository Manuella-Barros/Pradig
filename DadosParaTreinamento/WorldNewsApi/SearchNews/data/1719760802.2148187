{"id": 225054524, "title": "New research raises hopes of exhuming foreign Spanish civil war dead", "text": "Researchers in Catalonia have identified 522 members of the International Brigades, including 286 American and 86 British volunteers, who died or disappeared in the region during the Spanish civil war, raising hopes their remains could be found and buried with dignity nine decades after they perished. About 35,000 people from 50 countries travelled to Spain between 1936 and 1938 to join the brigades to help defend Spain\u2019s democratically elected government against Gen Francisco Franco\u2019s military coup. Almost 10,000 foreign volunteers died in Spain and many still lie in unmarked mass graves. Since 2022, the Catalan regional government\u2019s Democratic Memory department, which is tasked with identifying and exhuming the victims of the civil war and the subsequent Franco dictatorship, has been working to narrow down the places where foreign volunteers disappeared and to seek out their living relatives. After two years of trawling civil registries, International Brigade databases and the Russian state archive for political and social history, the department has confirmed the identities of 286 American brigade members, 96 Canadian members, 86 British members, six Irish members and 48 members from other countries. By tracking troop movements and poring over hospital records, the historian leading the project, Jordi Mart\u00ed, established that most of the brigade members died or disappeared on the Ebro front in 1938, which was the scene of the longest and largest battle of the war. \u201cWe weren\u2019t trying to find new people,\u201d Mart\u00ed said. \u201cWhat we were trying to do was find exactly where the people we knew had come to fight disappeared in Catalonia. \u201cWe wanted to narrow down the areas where they disappeared because some of the information we had wasn\u2019t very precise.\u201d Although the department has exhumed the remains of 900 people since 2017, only 30 people \u2013 none of them a brigade member \u2013 have been identified. Mart\u00ed hopes the new research will help lead to the recovery and exhumation of some of the brigade members who died in north-eastern Spain. \u201cIf we can determine the area in which these people disappeared, then when we come to exhume a mass grave in that area, we can hypothesise about who could be in that grave,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will allow us to pass that information on to families. And if we have DNA from relatives, then we have a greater possibility of identifying them.\u201d Mart\u00ed and his colleagues are appealing for people whose relatives died fighting in the International Brigades to get in touch and provide them with the DNA samples that could help identify some of the foreign fighters. \u201cWe must have exhumed the remains of some brigade members but we don\u2019t know who they are because we don\u2019t have the DNA for comparisons,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that some of them were buried in cemeteries near the hospitals where they died but in other cases, if we know what part of the Ebro front they disappeared in and if we have family DNA, then when we open a mass grave in that area, we\u2019ve got more options.\u201d Alfons Aragoneses, the director general of the Catalan Democratic Memory department, said his priority was affording some belated dignity to the dead. \u201cThe important thing is to get these remains out of the mass graves because the graves could be damaged by a flood or a fire, and rebury them in a cemetery,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not right that remains are still turning up in mass graves and we urgently need to exhume them and bury them with dignity in cemeteries.\u201d The research has been welcome by International Brigade experts. \u201cWhen combined with up-to-date DNA analysis, it should lead to the identification of many presently lying in unmarked graves,\u201d said Richard Baxell, a historian of the Spanish civil war. \u201cWhile it clearly has enormous value for historians, its real value is to the descendants of those killed in Catalonia, some of whom may finally be able to discover \u2013 and visit \u2013 their relative\u2019s final resting place.\u201d Jim Jump, the chair of the UK\u2019s International Brigade Memorial Trust, said it was \u201can impressive, groundbreaking piece of research\u201d and echoed the hope that it could help find those still lying in unmarked graves. He also contrasted the Catalan regional government\u2019s support for democratic memory projects with the revisionist attitude displayed by the authorities in neighbouring Arag\u00f3n, which is governed by a coalition of the conservative People\u2019s party (PP) and the far-right Vox party. The governments of Arag\u00f3n, Valencia and Castilla y Le\u00f3n, all of which are run by the PP and Vox, have been criticised by UN experts, historical memory associations and the Spanish government, who have accused them of seeking to introduce legislation that would \u201cwhitewash\u201d the crimes and human rights abuses of the civil war and the dictatorship. Mart\u00ed said the search for the missing was a simple service to the dead, to their descendants, and to Spain\u2019s history. \u201cEven if 85 years have passed, the disappearance of a family member often leaves a hole in that family,\u201d he said. \u201cKnowing what happened, even three or four generations later, can really mean a lot to the families \u2026 Then there\u2019s the matter of properly explaining what happened. \u201cWe need to understand history \u2013 and, at the end of the day, looking for the people who disappeared is also a way of explaining what happened.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Catalan authorities ask relatives to provide DNA to help identify 522 members of International Brigades from US, Canada, Britain and Ireland</p><p>Researchers in Catalonia have identified 522 members of the International Brigades, including 286 American and 86 British volunteers, who died or disappeared in the region during the Spanish civil war, raising hopes their remains could be found and buried with dignity nine decades after they perished.</p><p>About 35,000 people from 50 countries travelled to Spain between 1936 and 1938 to join the brigades to help defend Spain\u2019s democratically elected government against Gen Francisco Franco\u2019s military coup.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/29/new-research-raises-hopes-of-exhuming-foreign-spanish-civil-war-dead\">Continue reading...</a>", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/29/new-research-raises-hopes-of-exhuming-foreign-spanish-civil-war-dead", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83e8b7bfccd9324cbaef24c972ff91f4e693b4fa/0_34_3513_2107/master/3513.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVm", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:03:31", "author": "Sam Jones", "authors": ["Sam Jones"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.461}

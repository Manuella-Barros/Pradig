The 64-year-old was at the 2024 amFar Gala when she spoke about how important it is for family members to support one another. Speaking with PEOPLE magazine, the former wife of Prince Andrew said \"forgiveness\" was the most important part of maintaining good family relationships. \"I think family unity is key... I think the key to life is that we all support each other,\" she said. \"And also forgiveness is a great thing. I think forgiveness of yourself and forgiveness of others.\" Her comments came as she was asked if she was supporting King Charles and Kate Middleton as they receive cancer treatment. Fergie herself was treated after being diagnosed with breast and skin cancer in recent months. Royal author and expert Tom Quinn told The Mirror that the duchess' comments were a \"clear reference to Meghan and Harry's ongoing feud with Prince William and King Charles\". Quinn adds: \"But the Duchess has her own well-publicised family difficulties to deal with she has never stopped trying to persuade the senior royals to rehabilitate her former husband Prince Andrew and when she talked about unity and the need for forgiveness, she no doubt also had her husband in mind. \"The Duchess of York is only too well aware from her own life in the Royal Family that anger and bitterness ultimately lead nowhere. She has always felt that Harry needs to pull himself together and try to forget about the past for the sake of the family. She feels Harry is just taking things too far.\" King Charles has since returned to public duties following his diagnosis at the beginning of the year, however, the Princess of Wales remains out of the public eye after beginning her treatment in March. The forms of cancer each has been diagnosed with have not been revealed. Prince William however recently told the public she was \"doing well\" while on a recent engagement. Fergie, who has undergone a mastectomy to treat her breast cancer, stated that she's \"put cancer in the corner.\" \"I think a lot of people get very frightened to talk about these things,\" the Duchess of York expressed. \"I'm very happy with my mastectomy and my breasts and just to talk about it.\" Get the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.

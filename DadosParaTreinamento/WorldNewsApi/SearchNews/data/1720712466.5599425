Yesufu, Co-founder of the Bring Back Our Girls Movement, made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Lagos. She was reacting to calls in some quarters that the country should jettison the bicameral legislature(two-chamber National Assembly) and adopt a unicameral legislature to reduce the cost of governance. The activist said Nigeria could, alternatively, consider the re-introduction of the parliamentary system of government to reduce the heavy funds spent on the National Assembly. According to her, until something is done about the cost of running the government and corruption, Nigerians will not feel the dividends of democracy. \u201cWe need to really and critically examine our democracy and look at what fits us and serve the ordinary people and the masses. The one that will not be too expensive. \u201cWhat we have now is too expensive. We need to cut costs and not just continue what we have that has not been working for Nigerians. \u201cI totally support the call for us to have a unicameral legislature and scrapping the Senate, it is very important because the kind of governance that we are practising is very expensive. \u201cAs a country, we really don\u2019t have that kind of money. Apart from this, the fact is that both the Senate and House of Representatives end up duplicating functions in terms of what they do,\u201d Yesufu said. She said the Senate had been turned into \u201da retirement home for a lot of incompetent and failed governors who didn\u2019t do anywhere well for the people in their state.\u201d She said that Nigerians had continued to bear the brunt of the resources annually allocated to these political \u2018retirees\u2019 in the Senate. Yesufu added: \u201cIt (Senate) is a joke ground, we cannot say what the Senate does is in a real sense different from what the House of Representatives do. \u201cThey (Senators) do nothing special and at the end of the day, they are paid a humongous amount of our money and such huge allowances for doing nothing different. \u201cWe found out that a good number of them, especially those that are former governors, while they get this humongous salary, are collecting pension from their respective states. \u201cThere is no way democracy can work for the masses with this kind of waste of public funds that could have been directed to put happiness to the face of the common man.\u201d According to her, Senegal is practising a unicameral legislature, after abolishing the Senate for the second time in September 2012. She said: \u201cThe House of Representatives is enough for it to be able to take care of the law-making aspect of the nation, oversight and other things that the legislative arm of government does. \u201cUnicameral legislature should be adopted in Nigeria because bicameralism is too expensive apart from the fact that it slows down the business of lawmaking. \u201cIt is not working for us, we don\u2019t have the kind of money to run it and maintain this, especially at a time when the masses are suffering. \u201cHaving a single legislative arm will pay us better in terms of reduction of cost of governance,\u201d she said. Yesufu decried that Nigeria had not in a real sense been practising a true federal system of government. The activist further said the country could also adopt the parliamentary system of government to reduce the cost of governance. She said that Nigeria could no longer sustain the current presidential system of government. \u201cThis will also pay us in terms of reduction of the cost of governance because whoever is leading the country is the one that is first among equals. \u201cMinisters in this system are selected from members of the parliament that are elected. \u201cSo, that reduces the cost of governance drastically and better than what we have now where separate people are brought in as ministers,\u201d she said. The activist said that both the bicameral legislature and presidential system of government had brought a lot of pressure on the nation's resources. \u201cWe can have a parliamentary system of government, we shall be reducing the cost of governance drastically. \u201cThe Prime Minister would not be this powerful and exercise control over everything, including the appointed ministers, because ministers are also members of the parliament,\u201d she said.", "summary": "<img width=\"981\" height=\"543\" src=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-12-7.42.24-PM.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-12-7.42.24-PM.jpg 981w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-12-7.42.24-PM-300x166.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 981px) 100vw, 981px\" /><p>A renowned rights activist, Aisha Yesufu has called for the scrapping of the Nigerian Senate to reduce the cost of governance.

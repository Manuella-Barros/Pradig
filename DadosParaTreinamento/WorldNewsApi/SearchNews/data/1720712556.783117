{"id": 232046052, "title": "EU Elections Will Not Drastically Change Status Quo in Brussels: Expert", "text": "Predictions that right-wing groups gain significantly more seats in the current European Parliament elections won\u2019t necessarily translate into a \u201cdefinite change in the direction of European policy,\u201d said Marcin Kedzierski, assistant professor at the department of international relations at the Cracow University of Economics in Poland. The elections began on June 6 and wrap up late June 9. Right-wing parties, commonly called Euroskeptisc, can count on winning about 25 percent of the vote depending on the turnout, Mr. Kedzierski predicts. \u201cThe lower the turnout, the better the results for those Euroskeptics, because [their voters] are more mobilized to go to the polls,\u201d he told The Epoch Times. In most countries, European elections draw fewer voters than national elections, Mr. Kedzierski said. Even in a scenario in which right-wing candidates get 30 percent of the vote, they will not form a governing coalition in the European Parliament, Mr. Kedzierski said. \u201cBecause this coalition will be formed, as always, by the center-right from the European People\u2019s Party, the center-left from the Social Democratic Party,\u201d the liberals from [Renew Europe,] and the Greens, he said. The European Union\u2019s laws are jointly made by the European Parliament\u2014whose members are voted in\u2014and the Council of the European Union, composed of the national ministers from each government of the bloc\u2019s 27 member nations, Mr. Kedzierski explained. These two institutions must reach an agreement on specific law provisions, he said. In the past, the European Parliament acted only as an opinion-giving body and did not make any decisions, Mr. Kedzierski said. But its role evolved from election to election and the parliament gradually gained more and more influence. The election results may indicate any new trend direction of EU integration, according to Mr. Kedzierski. The EU has been through periods of accelerated integration and slowdowns in the integration process since its inception, he said. Slowdowns were usually caused by crises that plagued Europe such as the oil crisis of the 1970s, the global financial crisis in 2008, the Greek debt crisis after entering the eurozone, the illegal immigration crisis in 2015, and the war in Ukraine, Mr. Kedzierski said. \u201cIt is clear that this period of crises is somehow coming to an end and we are entering that moment when it will be possible to give a new impetus, a new acceleration, to the European integration,\u201d he said. \u201cThis election will tell us a little bit whether it will succeed or fail.\u201d The key countries of Germany and France \u201chave always decided about the shape of the European integration process,\u201d Mr. Kedzierski said. However, the policies of both countries differ, he said. The French policy is that \u201cwhat is good for France must be good for the European Union,\u201d Mr. Kedzierski said. The German policy is that \u201cwhat\u2019s good for the Union is good for Germany\u201d but what\u2019s good for the Union is determined by Germany. Political union means de facto fiscal union for EU members, he said. \u201cThe Germans know that it\u2019s not the French, it\u2019s the Germans that will have to pay.\u201d The concept assumes that different member states integrate at different paces into the Union. For example, member countries may be at different levels of integration within the eurozone or the border-free Schengen area. \u201cFor now, we have two unofficial categories of memberships,\u201d Mr. Kedzierski said. \u201cThere are more integrated [countries] and less integrated countries.\u201d If Ukraine joins the EU, it may mark the beginning of a third category, he said. The question of whether to strengthen the EU by deepening the integration between members or by enlarging the union by admitting new member states has been debated for a long time. Mr. Kedzierski said it\u2019s possible to have both. In February, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on \u201cDeepening EU integration in view of future enlargement.\u201d Charles Michel, President of the European Council, said in November 2023 that the European Union must be ready to welcome Ukraine by 2030. \u201cThis does not mean that Ukraine will then enter the Union, but [the EU] is to be ready to admit Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Kedzierski said. He said, quoting World Bank economist Branko Milanovic, that \u201cglobalization has admittedly made many people in the world richer, but the group that has lost the most is the middle class in developed countries.\u201d Much of the voter base in EU countries like Germany, France, Italy, or Spain have the perception \u201cthat things are not going in the right direction,\u201d Mr. Kedzierski said. Young people in their twenties and thirties firmly believe that they will be worse off than their parents, he said. \u201cThere is a belief that the European Union has solved the problems of Europeans over the years and raised the standard of living. [But] today there is a public perception in Europe, especially in Western Europe, that the European Union is not so much improving opportunities as worsening them.\u201d Young people, not seeing the EU addressing their problems, have started to look for solutions in their nation states, Mr. Kedzierski said. \u201cThis is behind this renaissance of national parties\u2014whether in Germany, France, Italy, or other countries in the old Europe.\u201d", "summary": "Even if right-wing parties win 25 percent of the vote, they won't have enough to form a governing coalition in the European Parliament, the expert predicts.", "url": "https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/eu-elections-will-not-drastically-change-status-quo-in-brussels-expert-5665256", "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/05/24/id5656460-GettyImages-2154087259-300x180.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:29:03", "author": "Ella Kietlinska", "authors": ["Ella Kietlinska"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.108}

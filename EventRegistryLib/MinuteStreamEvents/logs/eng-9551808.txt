To make the error once on a commemorative jersey is bad but too maek speling errers twice is imforgivable.\n\nThe Roosters should be too strong for the Warriors while the Titans and Cowboys is no sure thing for North Queensland even though they are favourites.\n\nHere's how the experts see Round 9 unfolding.\n\nDolphins, Panthers, Broncos, Tigers, Dragons, Storm, Roosters, Cowboys\n\nA few big guns return for the Dolphins for their clash with a furious Manly team that threw two competition points away last weekend. Get on the Farnworth train, with Kodi Nikorima pulling the strings at Suncorp Stadium. Penrith too good for the Dogs on Friday and I'm tipping a Bronco win later that evening, despite thinking the Eels are a real shot at home.\n\nThe Tigers showed plenty against the Dogs early and the Knights finally found some respectable form in Round 9. This should be a good one and Scully Park might be in for a treat. Tigers, I think?\n\nThe Dragons and Bunnies at Kogarah on Saturday? Seriously, who cares? Two teams on the slide and if the Dragons lose this one, I'm not sure how the coach could possibly excuse the performance.\n\nThe Storm and Cronulla looks like a belter and a real audit of where the Sharks are at. Melbourne at AAMI is tough to tip against and Munster will dominate from the start. It is a little tough to get a read on the Roosters, so hot and cold they have been.\n\nThe Warriors are in free-fall, can they find form? I think they can but the Roosters halves will be too controlling for them and manage the contest well.\n\nThe Cowboys need to find some consistency and a good starting point\n\nwould be a win against the Titans. Set to be a dangerous proposition\n\nfor the remainder of the year, Gold Coast will challenge but the\n\nquality at six and seven for North Queensland will be enough to get\n\nthem home.\n\nDolphins, Panthers, Broncos, Knights, Dragons, Storm, Roosters, Titans\n\nThe Dolphins will be glad to be back at home and with Kenny Bromwich also back, I think they'll take that critical win in Townsville with them and build on the result. While the Sea Eagles have had ok form the last few weeks, I feel they haven't been firing as much as they could be, and it could come back to bite them here.\n\nSorry Doggies. I've been enjoying Canterbury's resurgence this year but Penrith is gonna trash them at home. Nathan Cleary is back too, just forgot to mention.\n\nSo, how is my favourite past-time side doing? Ya good? Ya enjoy the bye. Here's the bloody Broncos straight off the bat!\n\nThis should be a belter in Tamworth, hope the Country folks turn out in droves. Reckon this will be a closer game than expected but with Jacob Saifiti and Tyson Frizell back, the Knights should get home.\n\nIf you had told me that I'd be tipping the Dragons over the Bunnies at the start of the season, I'd have asked you if I was under the influence of something when I did it. But here we are. Latrell Mitchell is a key return but it won't be enough at Jubilee Stadium.\n\nMatch of the round by a mile, maybe even a contender for the match of the regular season. Both sides look menacing, physical and aggressive, even without several key players. I'm going Melbourne, but based purely on home-field advantage. If it was the Shire I'd be right back the other way. A thriller by less than a try.\n\nMy heart wanted to go for the Wahs, but that was until my head pointed out to it that the Chooks are welcoming back Spencer Leniu, Jared Waerea-Hargreaves, Daniel Tupou and Victor Radley. It should be a good match, but the home side should get it done.\n\nThis will be a very close match to close out the weekend, and I think the Titans are an improving side since this corresponding fixture in Round Five. The Cowboys have fallen off, despite the opposition - yeah there have been some tough fixtures in there, but there have also been some games they really should have put away. It's a good time to strike if you are Des Hasler, and with the Titans at home, there should be enough of a reason for them to get up for this.\n\nDolphins, Panthers, Eels, Knights, Dragons, Storm, Roosters, Cowboys\n\nThat Wayne Bennett guy can coach so I'll be taking the Dolphins in an upset while Penrith have too many big guns for the Bulldogs.\n\nNewcastle are closer to Tamworth than the Tigers so they'll win there and St George Illawarra are due for a good performance after a couple of down weeks.\n\nThe Eels are refreshed after having the week off and Adam Reynolds' absence will be tough for Brisbane to overcome while the Storm at home should just have enough oomph to get past the Sharks.\n\nThere's something brewing at the Roosters and the Warriors are going backwards and in the last game it's a 50-50 proposition so I'll take the Cowboys with not much confidence.\n\nSea Eagles, Panthers, Broncos, Tigers, Dragons, Sharks, Roosters, Titans\n\nManly need to get their act together - they can't seem to string more than a couple of good performances together and need to lift on their second-half effort last week against Canberra or the Dolphins will continue their encouraging sophomore campaign.\n\nPenrith have the knowledge of knowing the playing style of half the Canterbury team of ex-Panthers while the Broncos' lack of a halfback won't be as bad as Parra's lack of a halfback and fullback.\n\nWests Tigers have Api Koroisau back so their flamboyant style will outscore Newcastle's grinding methods.\n\nCronulla have a chance to kinda show they can beat a top team although the Storm have Ryan Papenhuyzen and Jahrome Hughes out so it won't count as much as it normally would.\n\nThe Roosters could put a big score on the Warriors judging by the recent form of both teams while the Titans somehow are going better than the Cowboys over the past month. Scary.\n\nDolphins, Canterbury, Brisbane, Newcastle, St George Illawarra, Melbourne, Roosters, Titans\n\nTime to swing for the fences, kids. Let's get some upsets in here and make things interesting. Follow along if you're not cowardly!\n\nDolphins will get Manly because they've got an unpredictable attack. Bulldogs will get Penrith because they'll be up for this game like no other (and there's inside knowledge plus better players now). Brisbane will stumble past the Eels, Newcastle will be able to defend the Tigers and the Dargons should be able to handle South Sydney, but this one might be closer than we reckon.\n\nStorm over Sharks, Roosters over Warriors and I think the Titans finally get themselves back in shape with a horrible looking win over the feckless Cowboys.\n\nDolphins, Panthers, Broncos, Knights, Dragons, Sharks, Roosters, Titans\n\nWe're returning to the reverse psychology for Manly this week, who are favourites to beat the Dolphins but are prime candidates to instead beat themselves and thus lose. They'll probably win but I'm tipping Redcliffe to cover my Beaches backside.\n\nPenrith are playing Penrith-lite and thus will win relatively easily. Alamoti for a cathartic try, too.\n\nThe Bronx are missing a few, Parra are missing more. I'll take Brisbane on the assumption that Parra will gift them points.\n\nThe Tigers are down plenty and I can already see Kai Pearce-Paul striding over the top of Bud Sullivan. Knights by a few.\n\nSouths have Latrell back but 17 more players out, so unless he's worked on multiplying himself across multiple bodies in the last month, the Dragons will win.\n\nIs the Sharks winning in Melbourne an upset? It might not be given the lack of options for the Storm and how Cronulla have been playing. I'm pushing the boat out and tipping them right now.\n\nThe Wahs have been going like busteds, the Roosters have been racking up points. Easy tip for Easts.\n\nThe Cowboys can't defend and the Titans, though they haven't been winning, have performed less terribly that usual. They'll get over the line here.", "source": {"uri": "theroar.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Roar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphins_(NRL)",

'can't keep winning' theory", "body": "Brad Fittler has picked the absence of workhorse Manly hooker Lachlan Croker and impact forward Nathan Brown to tip Thursday night's round 10 opener against the Sea Eagles, as they visit the Dolphins on a road trip that is becoming a huge challenge in 2024.\n\nWayne Bennett's team is in the top four and flying, defying the expectations of most experts who expected them to still be a season or two from contending for finals positions.\n\nDespite their strong form, there is still a sense in the general rugby league population that the bubble will eventually burst for the second-year club, who are the bookmakers' outsiders for their clash with Manly, discounting the recent formline.\n\nSpeaking on Wide World of Sports' Freddy and The Eighth's Tips, Fittler was puzzled by the continued narrative that the Dolphins are due to tail off, while the Sea Eagles, just one point behind them in fifth, are considered by many to be a hot top four chance.\n\n\"When you look at Manly, they're losing their hooker, Croker, who's been integral to them,\" Fittler said.\n\n\"[Also] Brown, who has a lot of their impact and obviously [Haumole] Olakau'atu's out for another week.\n\n\"I think the Dolphins are one of those sides where you keep on saying, 'they can't keep winning, they're not going to win this' ... what they are, they're fast.\"\n\nCroker was concussed in Manly's capitulation against the Raiders last week, ruling him out of the Dolphins clash due to the NRL's concussion protocols, while Brown injured his hip flexor against Canberra.\n\nOlakau'atu is serving the second week of a two week ban for his role in a dangerous tackle against the Eels in round eight.\n\nWatch the 2024 NRL premiership live and free on Nine and 9Now.\n\nOn the flipside, the Dolphins are edging back towards full strength, with the Bromwich brothers both named in the 17 and gun centre Herbie Farnworth making his return from injury.\n\nFittler's argument didn't convince Queensland great Darryl Brohman, who made a case for the Sea Eagles as the fill-in on the couch for Andrew Johns.\n\n\"Manly should be too good for them, I think they're a better side than them,\" he said.\n\nScroll below for the current leaderboard and Round 10 tips by all Nine's expert tipsters!\n\nAndrew Johns: Sea Eagles, Panthers, Eels, Knights,

Even when they're not at their best, they can pile the points on.\n\nEasily the match of the round, the Storm will welcome the Sharks to AAMI Park in a battle of 2nd vs 1st.\n\nBoth teams have lost just one match this year, but Cronulla's impressive points differential has them sitting at the summit.\n\nThere has been plenty of commentary around the Sharks' \"easy\" draw to begin 2024, so Saturday marks the perfect opportunity to prove themselves as the real deal.\n\nThey have a good chance of knocking over Craig Bellamy's side, with the home team missing Ryan Papenhuyzen at fullback, Jahrome Hughes at halfback and Xavier Coates on the wing.\n\nHowever, the Storm have won their last five matches against the Sharks in Melbourne, with Cronulla's last win in Victoria's capital coming in 2018.\n\nEven with a weaker roster, we're predicting the Storm to edge out this one and continue their trend of narrow, hard-fought victories.\n\nThe Roosters come into this clash in steaming hot form, having piled on 100 points across their last two matches.\n\nIt's a different story for the Warriors, though, who are without a win since early April.\n\nThe Tricolours' form is simply too hard to ignore, and they should be able to comfortably outscore their opposition.\n\nWe know the Warriors are a talented team, but it just hasn't clicked for them in 2024 (yet).", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parramatta_Eels", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parramatta Eels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronulla-Sutherland_Sharks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brisbane Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphins_(NRL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dolphins (NRL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rugby_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Rugby League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Arthars", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Arthars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_Gutherson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clinton Gutherson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Rectangular_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melbourne Rectangular Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Coates", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xavier Coates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Papenhuyzen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Papenhuyzen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahrome_Hughes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jahrome Hughes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullback_(rugby_league)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fullback (rugby league)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Roosters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sydney Roosters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Bellamy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Craig Bellamy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2023-07/Nicho%20Hynes%2007162023.jpg?itok=MUJPB9fZ", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551808", "eventUri": "eng-9551808", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Even with this game there is the outside chance that all of the former Panthers will rise up against their old club and pull an upset out of the bag. But looking through the round, this game, at Penrith, seems the most certain to me.\n\nThe Bulldogs came from behind to beat the Tigers in the second half last week, but it was a very scrappy performance against one of the lesser sides in the competition. The Panthers were shocked early by the enthusiastic Rabbitohs, but once they settled into their grove they were able to run away with the game after half time. They piled on a mountain of points without star halfback Nathan Cleary who returns this week to face the Bulldogs.\n\nThe Panthers, at their professional best, at home in front of their adoring fans, are still a class or two above the Bulldogs. The Bulldogs may eventually catch them, but not this year. They will be severely punished for any errors they make in attack and defence. The Panthers just don't waste too many opportunities.\n\nRound 10 sure thing: Panthers\n\nMelbourne Storm vs. Cronulla Sutherland Sharks, AAMI Park, Saturday May 11, 7:35pm (AEST)\n\nThe Sharks sit comfortably atop the NRL ladder, but have only played one Top 8 team so far this year and that was the Bulldogs, who they beat in Round 2. Things are about to get real as they face the Storm, Roosters, Panthers. Eels, Broncos and Dolphins in the coming weeks, before a well-needed bye. It's not their fault that they are playing the lower clubs, they can only take on what the draw puts before them and they have been quite convincing in their victories.\n\nHaving watched the way the Storm have meticulously picked apart teams so far this season, I would have been quite comfortable in suggesting that they are a class above the Sharks and would win this one at home. That was before they lost both Ryan Papenhuyzen and Jahrome Hughes to injury last week. The loss of those two superstars of the game really brings the Storm back to the field. Enough for me to be convinced that the Sharks will win this one? Well, no, not really convinced.\n\nStorm coach Craig Bellamy is a master of making the players at his disposal work to a plan to match any team. Sure they will be weakened but I'm still not prepared to completely write them off. The Sharks are full of confidence, but they have been the high school kids bullying the primary school students. This will be a real toss of the coin game, which I think the Sharks just might nab, thanks to the slick combinations they have been building this year and because the Storm won't be at their best..\n\nToss of the coin game winner: Sharks\n\nGold Coast Titans vs. North Queensland Cowboys, Cbus Stadium, Friday May 3, 6pm (AEST)\n\nThanks to the Raiders' come-from-behind effort against the Sea Eagles last week, the roughie section of this column has been correct three weeks running. So the pressure is on to spot another potential upset this weekend.\n\nThe Cowboys are a tough teams to get a gauge on, they really should have beaten the Dolphins last week and they seem to fade in and out of games, particularly with their defensive efforts. The Titans have been disappointing all year, but are slowly starting to find some cohesion in whatever it is Des Hasler is trying to impart on them. They gave the Storm a good run last week, and I think at home this week, they could upset the Cowboys.\n\nRound 10 roughie: Titans", "source": {"uri": "espn.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury-Bankstown_Bulldogs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronulla-Sutherland_Sharks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrith_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Penrith Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rugby_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Rugby League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Time in Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrith_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penrith Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphins_(NRL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dolphins (NRL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Cleary", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nathan Cleary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bye_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bye (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parramatta_Eels", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parramatta Eels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_league_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rugby league positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brisbane Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Rectangular_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melbourne Rectangular Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melbourne Storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Papenhuyzen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Papenhuyzen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahrome_Hughes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jahrome Hughes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Des_Hasler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Des Hasler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Queensland Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold Coast Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Bellamy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Craig Bellamy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Words_and_Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Words and Trivia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0502%2Fr1327757_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551808", "eventUri": "eng-9551808", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 349, "textEnd": 355}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 1630, "textEnd": 1636}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 3222, "textEnd": 3227}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

They weren't at their best, but Craig Bellamy's side have a habit of stepping up when it matters and getting the job done. Cameron Munster marked his 200th game in style with a try and nearly 100 run metres. Unfortunately, the Storm lost luckless fullback Ryan Papenhuyzen to an ankle fracture and his replacement Sua Fa'alogo to injury in the same game and Nick Meaney might have to again step up and fill the void. The Storm face the top of the table Sharks in Round 10, which will provide a great marker for where both sides are at.\n\nAnalysis: The Panthers started slowly to trail 12-0 before producing 42 unanswered points to bury South Sydney. Luke Garner was excellent with two tries, while Lindsay Smith continues to impress up front. Penrith's back five are the envy of any side in the competition and they won't miss a beat with Izack Tago suspended, with Paul Alamoti ready to step up and fill the void. The Panthers also get Nathan Cleary back after he was rested against Souths for their clash with the Bulldogs on Friday night, which could see them jump back to the top of the Power Rankings.\n\nMORE NRL NEWS\n\nRESERVES WRAP: Souths gun set for recall; exiled Bulldog 'ecstatic' after shock switch\n\n'LACKING FOOT SOLDIERS': Players Bennett will target to rebuild Souths revealed\n\nAnalysis: The Sharks are flying on top of the table after their fifth straight victory in a 20-10 result against arch rivals the Dragons. Nicho Hynes is steering the ship in style with another two try assists, while Daniel Atkinson has stepped up in the absence of Braydon Trindall, with his running game giving the Sharks a new dimension in attack. The Sharks pack led by Oregon Kaufusi and Cameron McInnes has a real edge about it and they get a great chance to make a title statement in their away clash with the Storm on Saturday night.\n\nAnalysis: The Roosters completed a regular season sweep of the Broncos with a 40-18 hammering on their own soil. Angus Crichton is back to his best after a classy double against Brisbane, while Terrell May also grabbed a double off the bench in a superb display. James Tedesco put in a masterclass with 250 metres and two try assists, while Joey Manu continued his hot run of form. If their pack can continue to set the platform up front, the Roosters have the backline that can take them all the way to a first title since 2019.\n\nAnalysis: The Broncos lost their second on the trot to the Roosters in a 40-18 loss at home that was compounded by injuries to key players. Skipper Adam Reynolds is out for 12-14 weeks with a torn bicep in a huge blow to their title hopes, while Jesse Arthars also suffered a broken jaw. The challenge now is for Reece Walsh and Ezra Mam to step up in Reynolds' absence and get the Broncos to the end of the season with enough wins in the bank to make a run at the premiership when Reynolds returns. The Broncos can get back to their winning ways in a clash with the Eels on Friday night.\n\nAnalysis: The Dolphins showed real grit and character to beat the Cowboys 28-26 in a thriller, given the stars they have sidelined through injury. Jamayne Isaako was superb with four linebreaks and three tries in his 20-point haul, while Kodi Nikorima continued his hot run of form with four try assists. Wayne Bennett is inspiring the team with a \"next man up\" mentality as the Dolphins sit in the top four and they could even stay there when they get some troops back on deck. A clash with the Sea Eagles to open Round 10 will give them another great test of their title credentials.\n\nAnalysis: The Sea Eagles looked in control against the Raiders before surrendering to give the visitors a 26-24 comeback victory. Reuben Garrick continued his strong form at centre with a classy double, while Tom Trbojevic was electric at the back with a try and a try assist. Manly still need more from their pack with only Taniela Paseka and Josh Aloiai running over 100 metres against the Raiders, while Anthony Seibold will be doing plenty of work on their defence this week. Manly face a huge test against the Dolphins at Suncorp on Thursday night.\n\nAnalysis: The Bulldogs are showing signs they have turned the corner after a 22-14 victory over the Tigers cemented their spot in the top eight. Matt Burton has rediscovered his running game and has put his hand up for a Blues Origin recall in recent weeks, while Drew Hutchison is playing his role at No.7. Bronson Xerri is proving one of the buys of the year after scoring another try against the Tigers to go with over 100 run metres. The Bulldogs are sweating on an injury to Viliame Kikau who sets the tone for the side, but with all their role players playing their roles they can be a finals team this season. They get another chance to prove it against the Panthers in Round 10.\n\nAnalysis: The Raiders produced a brilliant comeback win to down the Sea Eagles 26-24 in a thriller at Brookvale. Elliott Whitehead was superb with two tries as he gets back to his best following his injury lay-off, while Hudson Young continued his red hot form with another try-scoring display. Kaeo Weekes might not be a traditional halfback, but his running game is giving the Raiders a point of difference in the absence of Jamal Fogarty. Sebastian Kris was also strong in his switch to fullback and Ricky Stuart is likely to stick with the move going forward. The Raiders have a bye in Round 10, before opening Magic Round against the Bulldogs on May 17.\n\nAnalysis: The Knights have now had two upset wins since Kalyn Ponga went down injured with their 14-8 victory over the Warriors keeping them in the hunt for the top eight. Daniel Saifiti led the way for the Knights with 95 metres and a try, while Tyson Gamble and Jackson Hastings are starting to rediscover their combination from last year's finals run as they had a try and two try assists between them. However, Adam O'Brien would have been most impressed with his side's defence to hold a pre-season title contender to eight points. The Knights can make it three straight wins with a victory over the Tigers on Saturday Afternoon.\n\nAnalysis: The Warriors are not the team that finished one game short of a grand final last year after they were beaten 14-8 by the Knights. Dylan Walker was a rare bright spot off the bench with 90 metres and a try, while Tohu Harris was at his consistent best with 94 metres and a try assist. However, the Warriors need to show far more enterprise in attack and the pressure is on Te Maire Martin to take the heat off Shaun Johnson carrying the lion's share in attack. The time might be near to move Roger Tuivasa-Sheck to fullback and Charnze Nicoll-Klokstadd to the centres to save their season. Things don't get any easier against the red hot Roosters next up.\n\nAnalysis: The Dragons fought hard, but ultimately fell short in a 20-10 loss to arch rivals the Sharks. Jaydn Su'A seems to be carrying the Dragons pack on his way to a potential Maroons' Origin recall, but he needs more help with Jack de Belin the only other forward to run for over 100 metres. Mikaele Ravalawa scored a classy double and Ben Hunt was at his consistent best, but the Dragons still look short on class to match the elite teams in the NRL. However, they get a great chance to get back in the winners circle when they face the depleted Rabbitohs on Saturday night.\n\nAnalysis: The Cowboys slumped to their fourth straight loss in a 28-26 defeat to he Dolphins. Jeremiah Nanai scored a classy double and Reuben Cotter was also strong in the back row. Tom Dearden stepped up in the absence of the injured Chad Townsend, but the Cowboys still need more consistency from their captain. The Cowboys need to address their defensive woes and they get a great chance to break their losing streak against the struggling Titans in Round 10.\n\nAnalysis: The Eels had the bye in Round 9 after their 32-18 loss to the Sea Eagles. Parramatta have now lost skipper Clint Gutherson for five weeks after knee surgery, which further compounds their injury woes. The Eels can't get Mitchell Moses back from injury soon enough, as their season went off the rails when he went down and Parramatta are hopeful he could be back for Magic Round or the game after. The pressure is intensifying on Brad Arthur to turn the club around amid reports Wayne Bennett is interested in the Eels job if it becomes available.\n\nAnalysis: They may have gone down in a thriller, but the Titans' performance in their 22-20 loss to the Storm was probably their best of the season given the quality of the opposition. AJ Brimson was again superb with 136 metres, a try and a try assist, while Kieran Foran controlled proceedings at halfback. However, the loss of Tanah Boyd to a dislocated wrist could mean another reshuffle for Brimson, with Jayden Campbell due back from injury in the next couple of weeks. The Titans have been building over the last month and get a real shot to land their second win against a Cowboys side that have lost four straight in Round 10.\n\nAnalysis: The Tigers were again brave, but ultimately they are not scoring enough points to win games in the NRL, after their 22-14 loss to the Bulldogs. Benji Marshall has his side singing from the same hymn sheet in defence, but they look clunky and lost at times in attack. Adding to their woes with ball in hand, halfback Aidan Sezer is now suspended for a month and Latu Fainu is battling a hamstring injury. The pressure is on Jayden Sullivan and rookie half Lachlan Galvin to create more try-scoring opportunities when they clash with the Knights in a must win game in Round 10.\n\nAnalysis: The Rabbitohs started life under interim coach Ben Hornby in style to lead 12-0, but they came crashing back to earth to go down 42-12 in the end. Adding to the horror result that sees them anchored to the bottom of the ladder and the Power Rankings is a horror injury toll that claimed four more victims this week. Skipper Cameron Murray (hip), Jye Gray (ankle), Dean Hawkins (quad) and Isaiah Tass (ankle) are all set for stints on the sideline, with Souths struggling to field a backline at the moment. Luckily, Latrell Mitchell is back from suspension for their clash with the Dragons on Saturday night, but given their horror injury toll the star fullback will have to produce a miracle as Souths look on track for the wooden spoon.", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Brown's 45 points would be equivalent to 50 in the modern day.\"\n\nThe 1935 Roosters won 15 of 16 games during the regular season before going on to claim the first of three successive premierships, averaging 38.47 points per game in the process.\n\nWind the clock forward nine decades and the 2024 Roosters lead the NRL in points per game with 28, just ahead of the Sharks (27), Broncos (26), Sea Eagles (26) and Dolphins (26).\n\nAnd in an ominous warning for an out of sorts Warriors side who confront the Roosters on Sunday, Robinson believes there is still plenty of room for improvement in his team's attack.\n\n\"There's definitely more to come, we can see the areas where have improved and other areas we still want to add to,\" he said after the win over Brisbane.\n\n\"We are very clear about how we are playing and how we're attacking - both out of yardage and in good ball, but there's constant refinement to that.\n\n\"I really liked the balance between the hardness that we played with and also the freedom.\"\n\nIt's eerily similar to the coach's summation of a rollicking 59-0 demolition of the same opponent back in Round 4, 2020 as the NRL returned from the enforced COVID-19 shutdown.\n\nThe Roosters hit the ground running after the 10-week lay-off, winning five games on the bounce and tallying 101 points across Round 4 and 5 against Brisbane and the Bulldogs (42-6).\n\n\"We don't get too carried away, we're two games in [after COVID return], we've got 16 games to go, we're just getting started, we're not going to be jumping for joy on the way home,\" Robinson told the assembled media on May 4, 2020 at Suncorp Stadium.\n\n\"We're going to be content about our performance and seeing some things that we improved on last week that was really good, but you don't rise and fall with those performances each week otherwise you don't build what you want to build.\"\n\nThe Roosters and Rabbitohs were the only teams to score 100 points or more in successive games during the 2020 season before some key rule changes led to more free-flowing football in the ensuing three seasons.\n\nDuring 2021 there were six instances of teams racking up a century across two games, in 2022 it occurred four times and last season three times, courtesy of the Sharks, Cowboys and Knights.\n\nThe biggest tally across two weeks was 105 points by the Cowboys, who beat the Rabbitohs 31-6 in Round 17 before putting the cleaners through Wests Tigers to the tune of 74-0 in Round 18.\n\nThe Sharks' ton came via a 48-10 win over the Bulldogs in Round 16 and a 52-16 defeat of the Dragons in Round 18 with a bye in between.\n\nThe Knights hit their straps late in the season as they strung together 10 wins on the trot, including a 66-0 hammering of the Bulldogs in Round 18 and a 34-18 win over Wests Tigers.\n\n\"The prevalence of teams compiling a century in two weeks has accelerated since 2020, a by-product of the six-again rule which has tilted the balance in favour of attacking football and has led to more points being scored in general,\" Middleton said.\n\n\"The number of points per game has increased from 39.3 per game in 2019 to 43.9 after nine rounds of the 2024 season.\"\n\nSo buckle up for a wild ride of attacking football across the rest of the 2024 season as more centuries are raised, but don't expect Mr Brown and his Class of '35 to be knocked off their perch any time soon,", "source": {"uri": "nrl.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Rugby League"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martin_lenehan@nrl.com", "name": "Martin

The Dolphins are certainly down on man power, but have continued to fight, scratch and claw for everything in the last couple of weeks.\n\nThat potentially suits up a game that may not overly suit the Sea Eagles, who showed last week that when the going gets tough they have the tendency to fold - not for the first time this season either.\n\nIf the Dolphins can make this a tough middle third game, they may well emerge as winners with home ground advantage, but there isn't much in it.", "source": {"uri": "zerotackle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Tackle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphins_(NRL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dolphins (NRL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manly_Warringah_Sea_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manly Warringah Sea Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rugby_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Rugby League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Roosters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sydney Roosters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lang_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lang Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra_Raiders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canberra Raiders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Bennett_(rugby_league)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wayne Bennett (rugby league)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Time in Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiso_Tabuai-Fidow", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Flegler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Flegler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Queensland Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury-Bankstown_Bulldogs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold Coast Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parramatta_Eels", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parramatta Eels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brisbane Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nine Network"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.zerotackle.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2124475091-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551808", "eventUri": "eng-9551808", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 205, "textEnd": 210}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Darren's editorial journey included stops at AOL|7, Wide World of Sports and Sportsfan.\n\nToday we take a look at Phil Gould's run-in with the NRL over his views on the state of the game, whether or not the Sharks are fake leaders, and David Fifita's move to Sydney.\n\nRead on as we tackle some of the big talking points in this week's NRL Real or Not.\n\nGould needs to make a career choice\n\nREAL: Love him or hate him, there are few sharper minds in the game than the one belonging to Phil Gould. Whether it be in administration where he is currently rebuilding the Bulldogs or as a member of the media where he can be found airing his opinions during game commentary or on Nine's panel show 100% Footy. He arguably does a great job at both, but the question is, should he be allowed to do both?\n\nThe NRL have rules that state that club officials are not allowed to say anything that is considered detrimental to the game.\n\n\"We welcome constructive criticism and passionate opinions,\" NRL CEO Andrew Abdo said.\n\n\"But registered officials cannot overstep the mark and make comments that are considered detrimental to the game or NRL competition.\n\n\"Destructive attacks on the game itself will not be tolerated.\"\n\nSo unless Gould and his legal team can successfully argue against the rules by which he is registered as a club official, he really should give one of his two jobs away. He can not in all seriousness continue in the media, walking on egg shells for fear of upsetting the sensibilities of Abdo. He will lose all media credibility of he starts behaving like a coach asked a difficult question at a post-match media conference, dodging and ducking his true feelings to avoid reprimand.\n\nOn top of the fine line he treads when criticising the NRL, there a many that feel he has obvious conflict of interests anyway. He's never going to be openly critical of the Bulldogs and could be seen to be advocating in their favour with some of his passionate rants.\n\nPerhaps the time has come for the game to move onwards with a little less Phil Gould.\n\nIt is unfair that David Fifita has ended up at the Roosters\n\nNOT REAL: And so it is, David Fifita will depart the Titans and head to Sydney to join the Roosters. Is it fair that the Titans should lose one of their best players? Well no, not really, but the Roosters, and Panthers, who also courted the star back-rower, have every right to throw money at him.\n\nThe salary cap is in place to ensure that the best teams are not able to hoard all of best the talent, especially at times of great success. The Panthers have won the last three Premierships and salary cap pressures have cut a wide path through their talent stocks during that time. When it comes to forwards, they have lost Kurt Capewell, Vilame Kikau, Api Koroisau, J'maine Hopgood, Spencer Leniu, Jaeman Salmon and Paul Momirovski, and next year they will lose James Fisher-Harris. Apart from Luke Garner who they gained from the Tigers and Zac Hosking who came down from the Queensland Cup, all other forward replacements have been home grown.\n\nIn that same period the Roosters have lost Isaac Liu, Freddy Lussick, Matt Lodge, Siosiua Taukeiaho, Nathan Brown and Paul Momirovski. They have Penrith's Spencer Leniu joining them next year, but clearly have cap space, with some key backs leaving, and spots to fill in their pack.\n\nFifita has to do what is best for himself and his family. He has given his all to the Titans cause and now feels it is time to enjoy the fruits of his labour at another, more successful club. You can't expect the best clubs to pass up the opportunity to welcome him aboard.\n\nSharks are false NRL ladder leaders\n\nREAL: The Sharks sit atop the NRL ladder after Round 9 and have not taken to kindly to criticism that they have enjoyed a soft draw. The draw of course is out of their control, but it clearly hasn't been a tough start to the year. So far this season they have beaten the Warriors and Bulldogs, were well beaten by the Tigers, before going on to defeat the Raiders, Rabbitohs, Cowboys, Raiders again, and the Dragons.\n\nBefore the season started the Warriors, Rabbitohs, Cowboys and Raiders were expected to be very competitive, but things have not panned out that way. In fact of the clubs the Sharks have played so far this season, only the Buldogs are currently in the Top 8. Tigers game aside, the Sharks have looked sharp in both attack and defence. They have used the start of the season to fine tune their combinations and will now have a difficult period to truly test their mettle.\n\nThey take on the Storm this weekend, before facing the Roosters, Panthers, Eels, Broncos and Dolphins. If they can make it through that lot with a few wins under their belts, then perhaps they will finally silence the skeptics.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title":

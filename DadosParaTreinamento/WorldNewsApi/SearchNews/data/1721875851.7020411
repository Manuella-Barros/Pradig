To see how the drive that once fuelled him on the roads led him, many years later, to spiral towards a dangerous edge. When Tommy Hughes decided his running days were done, that obsession, that addiction, was never going to go gently into the night.

Olympians, more than most, lead binary lives, seesawing between long blocks of bare asceticism and short windows of unbridled blowouts. Denial and indulgence. Yin and yang. That\u2019s only amplified for marathoners. Those who centre their lives on running themselves into the ground for two and a bit hours have many strengths \u2014 patience, resilience, immense pain tolerance \u2014 but the great weakness of many endurance athletes is an inability to moderate.", "summary": "<p>At this stage in life, it\u2019s easy to connect the dots.

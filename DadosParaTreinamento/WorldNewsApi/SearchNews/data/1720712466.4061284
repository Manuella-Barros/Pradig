Johnson fulfilled his end of a losing bet with Edmonton mayor Amarjeet Sohj. Johnson donned an Oilers jersey and posted a rally video on X in order to fulfill the terms of the losing bet he made with Sohi over which team would prevail in the NHL\u2019s Western Conference Final. Edmonton won in six games to advance to the finals against Florida, where they lost Game 1 3-0 Saturday night in Sunrise, Fla. \u201cNow I know what you may be thinking,\u201d Johnson said on X. \u201cWhy is the mayor of Dallas wearing an Oilers jersey? \u201cWell, to be honest, I\u2019d prefer not to be wearing this, but a bet\u2019s a bet,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I promised the mayor of Edmonton, Amarjeet Sohi, that if the Oilers beat the Dallas Stars I would wear an Oilers jersey and record a good luck video. \u201cOn that note,\u201d he said, continuing, \u201cI want to extend my best wishes to the mayor of Edmonton, and the entire city of Edmonton as the Oilers gear up to face the Florida Panthers in the NHL Stanley Cup finals. \u201cEdmonton Oilers!\u201d Johnson added. \u201cConsider this your official Texas-sized pep talk! \u201cGo out there,\u201d he said, \u201cgive it your all and good luck in the Stanley Cup finals.\u201d Premier wants to bet Fla. governor Alberta premier Danielle Smith reached out on social media Saturday to propose a friendly, boozy bet with Florida governor Ron DeSantis on the outcome of the finals, with Alberta craft whisky on the line for Smith and Florida craft rum coming north if the Oilers win. So far, mum's the word from DeSantis, who is not known to be much of a hockey fan. CTV News has reached out to DeSantis\u2019 office for comment, but hasn\u2019t heard back yet. The most recent post on DeSantis\u2019 Instagram page is preparation advice for hurricane season, including a \u201cdisaster preparedness sales tax holiday\u201d that started June 1 and continues through June 14. Sunrise mayor wants to bet Sohi has already accepted a friendly bet with Sunrise, Fla. Mayor Mike Ryan, who said he will send Sohi a Panthers jersey to wear at a public meeting if Florida defeats the Oilers in the finals. Sohi, who was in Calgary Friday attending a conference for Alberta mayors, wasted little time in trash-talking the Sunrise mayor back on X. \u201cNow there\u2019s only one team between us and the Cup,\u201d said Sohi. \u201cFlorida Panthers, the Oilers are coming for you, and you\u2019re not just facing off against Edmonton. We have all of Canada behind us, and I\u2019m here today with mayors from across Alberta who will be cheering hard for another Alberta win. \u201cI have heard that mayor Mike Ryan of Sunrise wants to make a bet. Well Mayor Ryan, I accept your terms. A lot of mayors are wearing Oilers jerseys today \u2013 and you are next!\u201d Game 2 is Monday night in Sunrise. Puck drop is scheduled for 6 p.m. MST.", "summary": "The Oilers got a Texas-sized pep talk Friday, when Dallas mayor Eric L.

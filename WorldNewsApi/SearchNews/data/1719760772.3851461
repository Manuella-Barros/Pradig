Clark, a seasoned healthcare executive who took up his post on April 2, laid out plans to address pressing issues and ensure \u201ccitizens receive the quality care they deserve\u201d. A key priority is improving the long-troubled accident and emergency (A&E) department, which Clark acknowledged had been blighted by overcrowding before its recent expansion. \u201cIt was very cramped, very tight. It didn\u2019t look good. It didn\u2019t feel good. Too many patients waiting, family members with them,\u201d he said. \u201cWorking in that department must [have been] extremely stressful for the staff.\u201d But Clark insisted enlarging A&E alone would not solve the systemic problems. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about having the A&E department the right size. What happens in the A&E is a consequence of a whole system, a whole healthcare system.\u201d The CEO said he intends to work with polyclinics, private clinics and the Ministry of Health to educate the public and reduce unnecessary A&E visits. \u201cA&E departments are for accidents and emergencies. Not all the patients in the A&E department are accidents or emergencies,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of those emergencies could have been avoided \u2026 people\u2019s strokes, people\u2019s heart attacks, and people\u2019s chronic conditions could be managed better, stop them coming into the hospital when they\u2019re acutely ill.\u201d Clark outlined a \u201cholistic approach\u201d to improving patient flow from admission to discharge, calling for coordinated efforts across departments like pathology and radiology to optimise operational efficiency. He also plans to review procedures for dealing with escalating A&E demand. Lengthy waiting times for outpatient appointments and diagnostics are another \u201cchallenge\u201d, Clark said, citing a lack of centralised data collection. But he revealed a new health information system will be implemented later this year to identify and address bottlenecks. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a health information system, so it\u2019s quite hard sometimes to capture information on the waiting times,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should be going out for tender for that system this summer, so we can bring in a system that will help us then gather the information to make sure that we\u2019re very clear on where the pain points are.\u201d Clark also plans to closely scrutinise the functioning of the hospital\u2019s wards to ease bottlenecks preventing patients from being transferred out of A&E. \u201cIf the A&E department\u2019s full because it can\u2019t move patients from the department onto a ward, upstairs into the medical beds, we need to make sure that the wards are functioning as efficiently and as effectively as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve already started some work with the medical leads and how we can maybe manage the medical beds slightly differently to improve flow through those inpatient beds.\u201d At the other end of the care pathway, Clark said he must collaborate with external parties to ensure discharged patients have appropriate places to go, highlighting the need for \u201cwhere will the elderly for care patients go and what are the different options\u201d. To drive these ambitious reforms, the new CEO has introduced \u201cbalanced scorecards\u201d to identify top priorities and risks. He has also tasked the chief operating officer with developing \u201cplans for how we\u2019re going to tackle some of those areas\u201d including outpatient waits, theatre delays and cancellations, and A&E waiting times. Clark insisted data analysis would be central, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve already requested and redirected the chief operating officer to focus on what I call patient flow, how patients flow through the system and quality outcomes.\u201d The CEO, who has hit the ground running just weeks into his tenure, projected confidence that the QEH can turn around its fortunes despite long-standing issues. \u201cAs a team of people, we can find solutions to this and I\u2019ve seen that done in different places before,\u201d Clark affirmed.

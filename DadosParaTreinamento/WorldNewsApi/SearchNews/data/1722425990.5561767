Pe\u00f1a was involved in an interview with Apple TV+ just before New York\u2019s Jeff McNeil popped up toward the shortstop area with one out in the bottom of the second inning. Pe\u00f1a was shaded toward the second base bag against the left-handed hitting McNeil and ranged to his right and was on the edge of the outfield grass close behind third baseman Alex Bregman. Neither Pe\u00f1a not Bregman put their glove up to make the play on the pop up and the ball landed between them. \u201cHoly \u2026,\u201d Pe\u00f1a said as the ball bounced once before he grabbed it and tossed it back to the infield. Pe\u00f1a and Bregman appeared to glance briefly at one another. McNeil was credited with a hit, and was picked off first base by pitcher Ronel Blanco two pitches into Harrison Bader\u2019s at-bat. Bader struck out to end the inning. Pe\u00f1a is the second player in the last three weeks to misplay a ball while conducting an in-game interview with Apple TV. Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez was speaking with Dontrelle Willis in the second inning on June 7 when a grounder by the New York Yankees\u2019 Gleyber Torres hit Hern\u00e1ndez on his bare right hand and ricocheted off his body. Hern\u00e1ndez recovered and threw to first, but Torres beat the throw and Hern\u00e1ndez was charged with an error. Torres didn\u2019t score and the Dodgers won, 2-1, in 11 innings. Afterward, Hern\u00e1ndez said he didn\u2019t blame the error on being distracted because the ball \u201c\u2026 had a weird hop.\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said he wouldn\u2019t reconsider whether to do in-game interviews in the future. \u201cNo, because we\u2019re getting paid,\u201d he said. \u201cI like money.\u201d Baseball\u2019s collective bargaining agreement calls for a player to receive a $10,000 stipend for wearing a two-way microphone for at least one inning of a regular-season game. The amount rises to $15,000 in the postseason. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2FzdHJvcy1nYW1lLWludGVydmlldy1hcHBsZS1hMjAzYzk3MDQwMmQ3YjIyOGVlNzZlY2I0M2YwNGIxMNIBAA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Astros shortstop Jeremy Pe\u00f1a misplays pop fly while taking part in an in-game TV interview</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">The Associated Press</font>", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/astros-game-interview-apple-a203c970402d7b228ee76ecb43f04b10", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/1edeeda/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6335x3563+0+330/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F3e%2Fc2%2Fb45e8c45d157c331329dd4166fe4%2Fb18d23ab9edb4d099c1e99289db7dbd6", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:04:25", "author": "Jerry Beach", "authors": ["Jerry Beach"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.707}

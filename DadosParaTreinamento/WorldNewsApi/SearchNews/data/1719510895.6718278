{"id": 223813350, "title": "Hundreds of victims in infected blood scandal to sue UK health secretary", "text": "Hundreds of people in the UK infected with contaminated blood and relatives of those infected are going ahead with plans to sue the health secretary for damages, having been left dissatisfied with the government\u2019s announcement on compensation. A group claim by about 500 people against the government alleging it breached a duty to take reasonable care to prevent personal injury or loss, amounting to misfeasance in public office, began in 2017 but was paused pending the inquiry into the scandal, which published its final report on Monday. Explaining the reason for looking to reinstate the lawsuit despite the government\u2019s announcement of a compensation framework, Des Collins, of Collins Solicitors, said: \u201cThe reason we\u2019ve done that is we started the week off on a high with the [Sir Brian] Langstaff report saying pretty much everything we\u2019ve said for seven years. \u201cThen we went on to Rishi [Sunak] and his abject apology in the House [of Commons] on Monday afternoon, the announcement of a compensation framework on Tuesday, but it wasn\u2019t until we got the first draft of paperwork on that compensation recovery programme that we realised that there are holes and gaps in it.\u201d He said the headline figures for the government scheme, which suggested that some people could get more than \u00a32.5m in compensation, were not all that they seemed and that his clients felt \u201cbounced into settlement\u201d. The death toll, which already stands at 3,000, is rising weekly among the 30,000 or so people who were infected with hepatitis C, HIV or both from the 1970s to the early 90s, either from receiving transfusions during surgery or through blood plasma products imported from the US to treat haemophiliacs. One of the issues concerning people about the compensation framework is the end of support schemes under which people have received monthly payments but will be superseded by the announced plans. Collins said the government should have sat down with those affected before announcing its compensation scheme. Separately, survivors and relatives of people who died in the infected blood scandal are suing a school where they contracted hepatitis and HIV after being given experimental treatment without informed consent. Langstaff\u2019s report found that children at Treloar college \u2013 a specialist school in Hampshire for haemophiliacs \u2013 had been used as \u201cobjects of research\u201d while the risks of infection were ignored. He said that only 30 pupils remain of the 122 who attended the school, calling it \u201cunconscionable\u201d. Richard Warwick, 58, who was infected with HIV and hepatitis C at Treloar\u2019s and is part of the group action, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve no intention of bankrupting the school or anything like that, it\u2019s just a matter of getting some sort of recognition from them. \u201cThey just seem to be sat on their hands, denying any responsibility for what we know factually went on at the school. If you read the second half of volume two [of the inquiry report], Sir Brian is so critical of what happened there, what went on there and the way the children were treated. Things that went on there shouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d The action against Treloar\u2019s was lodged in 2022 but, like the claim against the health secretary, was paused pending conclusion of the inquiry. The former pupils are also calling for the college\u2019s headteacher at the time, Alexander MacPherson, to return his OBE. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that he did down there that was honourable as far as we\u2019re concerned, certainly with regards to the haemophiliacs,\u201d said Warwick. \u201cI think that would be the right thing for him to do.\u201d The Guardian attempted to reach Treloar\u2019s for comment. In a statement released on Thursday, the school said: \u201cWe sincerely apologise to our former students and their families who were so devastatingly infected and affected by the infected blood scandal. \u201cWe apologise too for the criticisms contained in the report. The treatment by clinicians of pupils at Treloar\u2019s in the 1970s and 1980s was unethical and wrong. \u201cThe way in which the diagnosis of infection was communicated was insensitive and wrong. In other cases, failure to communicate positive tests for HIV at all was unconscionable and wrong.\u201d The government said it did not comment on legal cases while they were in progress.", "summary": "<p>Group of about 500 people to reinstate 2017 lawsuit against government due to \u2018holes and gaps\u2019 in compensation framework</p><p>Hundreds of people in the UK infected with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/contaminated-blood-scandal\">contaminated blood</a> and relatives of those infected are going ahead with plans to sue the health secretary for damages, having been left dissatisfied with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/may/21/infected-blood-scandal-victims-to-get-compensation-payments-before-end-of-year\">government\u2019s announcement on compensation</a>.</p><p>A group claim by about 500 people against the government alleging it breached a duty to take reasonable care to prevent personal injury or loss, amounting to misfeasance in public office, began in 2017 but was paused pending the inquiry into the scandal, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/may/20/infected-blood-scandal-cover-up-inquiry-concludes\">published its final report on Monday</a>.", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/may/26/hundreds-of-victims-in-infected-blood-scandal-to-sue-uk-health-secretary", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/968fa491763e29f3ec771c3b7c489092843f8f5a/154_245_6789_4074/master/6789.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZ", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:32:37", "author": "Haroon Siddique", "authors": ["Haroon Siddique"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.678}

It dropped its final conference series at Auburn, taking one of three games vs. the Tigers. The Crimson Tide's lone SEC series victory this season came in a sweep over Ole Miss in April.\n\nHere are five things to know about Alabama softball heading into the SEC Tournament:\n\nAlabama softball from the circle\n\nAs a whole, Alabama's pitching staff ranks third in the conference in ERA (2.06). However, we saw an Alabama pitching staff allow seven runs against an Auburn team that ranks last in the conference in runs scored (188), hits (283) and RBIs (171).\n\nSo far this season, Kayla Beaver has emerged as the No. 1 pitcher for the Crimson Tide, making 25 starts in 31 appearances and currently sitting at 16-8 with three saves. Beaver has been dominant from the circle this season, but we have seen a few shaky appearances from her as of late. Beaver has pitched 155\u2153 innings allowing 52 runs, 39 earned, off of 116 hits with 156 strikeouts and 56 walks. She has a team-leading ERA of 1.76.\n\nJocelyn Briski has emerged as the No. 2 pitcher for Alabama after suffering from injury earlier in the season. Briski started two out of three of Alabama's games vs. Auburn last weekend, and has gone 7-4 from the circle through 70\u2154 innings pitched. Briski has an ERA of 2.48 and has allowed 31 runs, 25 of them earned, off of 66 hits, striking out 58 batters and walking 22.\n\nPitching will be key for Alabama moving forward in the postseason, as will limiting walking batters, especially the leadoff. When pitching is on from the Crimson Tide, it is on; however, when Alabama struggles from the circle, it tends to struggle as a whole.\n\nStruggles in the run column\n\nAlabama ranks 12 out of 13 in the SEC in runs scored (202), hits (305) and RBIs (193). It has been shut out seven times this season, marking the most amount of games Alabama has been held scoreless in a season since 2017 when it was shut out eight times.\n\nSince its Arkansas series April 19-21, Alabama has scored 11 runs while allowing 24 across those nine games. This doesn't mean the Crimson Tide have been without chances though, but their comeback efforts typically fall short and come too late in the game. They nearly pulled off a comeback vs. Auburn on Thursday night, scoring three runs in the top of the seventh inning, but they came up one run short of tying the game.\n\nNICK SABAN COMMEMORATIVE BOOK: Relive Nick Saban's epic Alabama football coaching career with our special book! Preorder here.\n\nAUBURN TAKEAWAYS: Alabama softball loses SEC series vs. Auburn to end regular season: Takeaways, observations\n\nAlabama showing it can outlast opponents\n\nMany of Alabama's games have come down to pitcher's duels, with one or two runs making the difference. This was the case in Saturday's 11-inning, 2-0 win over Auburn when Kenleigh Cahalan hit a clutch two-run single. It marked Alabama's longest game played this season.\n\nAlabama has only played in five extra-inning games this season, dropping all of them except for Saturday's win at Auburn. The 11-inning win came at a good time for Alabama heading into the postseason.\n\nAlabama batting leaders\n\nKenleigh Cahalan has started in all 49 of Alabama's games this season at shortstop. Cahalan, who has been in the leadoff spot for the Crimson Tide as of late, is batting .291 to go with a team-high 44 hits. Jenna Johnson has been in the one or two spot of the Alabama batting order for majority of the season, batting .270 to go with 31 hits and 24 RBIs. Abby Duchscherer has a team-leading 30 RBIs but has been out of the lineup as of late.\n\nKristen White has also come up clutch this season, hitting an RBI single in the 1-0 win vs. Tennessee last weekend to break Alabama's previous 27 inning scoreless streak. Overall, White is batting .313 with 21 hits and two RBIs. As a team, Alabama is batting .254, ranking 11th in the SEC.\n\nMissing from the lineup\n\nCatcher Marlie Giles has not been in the lineup since March 30, when she was hit by a pitch vs. Kentucky. Over the Auburn series, Giles made appearances as a defensive replacement at catcher in all three games but did not reenter the batting order.\n\nPrior to her injury, Giles was batting .286 making 24 starts in 31 games played. She has 16 hits and 10 RBIs. Riley Valentine has entered the lineup in Giles' absence and is hitting .185 with 15 hits and 11 RBIs.", "source": {"uri": "eu.tuscaloosanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Knoxville News

In the grander scheme, however, the message represents a rallying cry for a Missouri program that has faced skepticism all season long.\n\nTabbed to finish 11th in the Southeastern Conference preseason coaches' poll, the Tigers defied those odds with their second-highest conference finish since 2015, including their first top-five conference finish since 2021.\n\nMissouri, which will enter the SEC Tournament as the No. 5 seed, began the season as one of just four SEC teams not ranked ESPN.com/USA Softball Collegiate Top 25 preseason poll. After a 40-14 regular season, though, the Tigers will enter the postseason as a consensus top-15 team and in line to host a Regional.\n\nIt's quite the success story for a Missouri team that underwent a significant turnaround to put itself back on the map as a perennial softball power this season.\n\nJust one season ago the Tigers finished dead last in the SEC, posting a 35-26 record with a 7-17 mark in conference play. MU won just one conference series in last year's campaign and was shut out six times in league games.\n\nThe performance came on the heels of a disappointing end to the 2022 season, in which the Tigers were eliminated from their own Regional. So, entering this year, all eyes were on Anderson to see if Missouri would return to prominence or sink to the SEC cellar.\n\nFifty-four games later, the Tigers have responded with a roar.\n\nMissouri's expedition toward the mountaintop of SEC excellence continues Wednesday.\n\nThe fifth-seeded Tigers find themselves in the thick of a loaded conference that includes at least 11 teams with NCAA Tournament aspirations. A pair of teams on the outside of most projections -- No. 12 seed Kentucky and 13th-seeded Ole Miss -- will battle it out at 6 p.m. Tuesday in the opening game of the SEC Tournament in Auburn, Alabama.\n\nMU will face the winner of that matchup in its opening game of the tournament at 4 p.m. Wednesday. From there, the Tigers will advance as long as they keep winning.\n\nA rematch against fourth-seeded Arkansas, which received a double bye as a top-four seed, awaits Missouri in the quarterfinals if the Tigers prevail in their opening contest. No. 1 seed Tennessee, eighth-seeded LSU and No. 9 seed Alabama represent potential semifinal matchups for Missouri.\n\nOn the opposite side of the bracket, seventh-seeded Georgia and No. 10 seed Auburn will match up for an opportunity to play second-seeded Florida, which suffered its only SEC series loss of the season to the Tigers. No. 3 seed Texas A&M awaits the winner of sixth-seeded Mississippi State against No. 11 seed South Carolina.\n\nAs a No. 5 seed, Missouri finds itself in a unique spot. Florida won the SEC Tournament as the sixth seed in 2019, Ole Miss won as the eighth seed in 2017 and Georgia earned a title out of the No. 5 spot in 2014 (only No. 5 seed to win since 2006). However, a top-three seed has won each tournament since 2019.\n\nThe Tigers, in particular, have had mixed success in SEC Tournament play. They have never won a title but did advance to the championship game in both 2022 (No. 7 seed) and 2014 (No. 3 seed). Since joining the SEC, MU has appeared in three semifinals ('14, '21, '22).\n\nMissouri comes into the tournament with victories in five of its past six games, including its first sweep and road series win of the season. The Tigers are also just two wins shy of matching the highest win total they've had under Anderson (2021 -- 42 wins).\n\nLed by its pitching staff, MU's key to obtaining SEC glory will actually come down to its offensive production. Of the Tigers' 11 conference losses, all of them occurred in games that they did not score more than three runs. The pitching staff allowed four or fewer runs in eight of those games as well, meaning MU was just a handful of runs from an even more successful season.\n\nThe Tigers' first opponent, either Ole Miss and Kentucky, will enter with a bottom-three ERA in the league. Neither of the two present many challenges, but the Wildcats have shown an ability to power themselves to wins, ranking fourth in the conference in home runs and doubles.\n\nA pair of teams MU will likely have to face in a run -- Arkansas and Tennessee -- both rank among the conference's top five in earned run average. Each of those teams also won a series against the Tigers, with the Volunteers sweeping a three-game set in Knoxville, Tennessee, and the Razorbacks taking two of three in Fayetteville, Arkansas (though they were outscored 15-12).\n\nMeanwhile, the opposite side of the bracket is jam-packed with offensive-minded teams with only one team ranking in the top six of ERA. Missouri earned series wins against four of these teams with exceptions being Georgia (lost two of three) and Texas A&M (did not play).\n\nThus, when looking at the full picture, the Tigers' key to success will be consistency. It's easier said than done, especially for a team that finished just 1-7 in SEC series finales, but Missouri is peaking at the right time and boasts a pitching staff that can will itself to wins.\n\nThe next step will be sustaining that success, a process that'll likely require the Tigers to enact revenge on teams who bested them already this season. As a team that has already shown an ability to defy expectations, Missouri seems prepared to do just that again.\n\nThe \"Columbia Regional\" has a nice ring to it.\n\nFor the third time in four years, Mizzou Softball Stadium seems like an odds-on favorite to host a regional tournament with MU extremely unlikely to drop below a top-16 seed the rest of the way.\n\nFor a fanbase that consistently showed out this season, the opportunity for MU to host a regional would be a welcome sight. Mizzou Softball Stadium averaged 2,520 fans per home game, fourth-most in the nation, and set multiple attendance records this season.\n\nOf particular interest to many, though, is Missouri's chances of hosting a Super Regional like it did in 2021.\n\nThe simplest way to securing that spot is earning a top-eight seed and advancing through the Regional, a path that could become more of a possibility for the Tigers beginning with a strong showing this week.\n\nMissouri -- which is ranked No. 15 ahead of the Week 13 rankings -- would likely need to win three games, or hope for early exits from Arkansas, Texas A&M, Georgia and LSU, in the SEC Tournament to be considered for a top-eight seed. Three straight wins would vault the Tigers into the SEC Tournament championship game, a run that would likely include a pair of key victories over a pair of top-four SEC teams.\n\nThe other path for the Tigers in pursuit of hosting a Super Regional involves a bit of luck.\n\nIf Missouri does not earn a top-eight seed, it can host as long as the higher-seeded team in the quadrant that is projected to play them in the Super Regionals suffers a loss.\n\nAlthough it's a rarer occasion, this happened last season when 15th-seeded Utah hosted a Super Regional following a Regional loss by No. 2 UCLA. A similar-style upset combined with a win for MU in the Regional round would suffice.\n\nEither way, the main ingredient to a Columbia Super Regional is to win, and Missouri will have an opportunity to start that process Wednesday in Auburn, Alabama.", "source": {"uri": "rockmnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rock M Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brandon_haynes@rockmnation.com", "name":

It ended with a nonconference loss at home to Liberty on Sunday, but the Tigers now can turn their attention to the postseason.\n\nNo. 10 LSU is eyeing the SEC tournament, where it can bolster its resume before the NCAA tournament begins.\n\n\"It's nice to be 0-0 again, get a little restart here,\" LSU coach Beth Torina said after Sunday's 3-1 loss to Liberty. \"It's almost like a free week with the SEC tournament. It can only help you. Hopefully we can go there and make a case for ourselves and be (in) that top eight.\"\n\nThe case is strong. LSU remains at No. 3 in the RPI, the highest-ranked SEC team and behind only No. 1 Texas and No. 2 Oklahoma. Yet LSU finished eighth in the conference and will play No. 9 seed Alabama in the first round Wednesday at 10 a.m. at Auburn's Jane B. Moore Field. The winner will play regular-season SEC champion Tennessee.\n\n\"It could be a huge weekend for us and just kind of getting back on track,\" LSU pitcher/designated player Kelley Lynch said. \"We can definitely win (the SEC tournament title). I have no doubt about that.\n\n\"Every season has highs and lows. It's all about who peaks at the right time, so I'm super excited to get the postseason started and to see what this team's really made of.\"\n\nThe Tigers (38-14) started the season 24-0 but finished 8-10. The RPI is rewarding the Tigers for that start and for playing each of the top four teams in the SEC. LSU went 6-6 in those games.\n\nLast year, LSU was 40-15 going into the NCAA tournament and received a No. 10 national seed.\n\n\"We're definitely hosting a regional. I don't think that's in question,\" Torina said. \"I think the question is whether we're going to be in the top eight or not. I don't know if there's been a three in RPI that hasn't been a top eight (seed).\"\n\nLSU didn't play Alabama (33-16, 10-14 SEC) in the regular season but will be facing a team with a similar narrative. The Crimson Tide started the season 18-0 but has lost eight of its last 11.\n\nAlabama is third from the bottom of the SEC in team batting average (.254) but rode the pitching of ace Kayla Beaver all season. Beaver went 16-8 with a 1.76 ERA. In 155\u2153 innings she struck out 156 batters and held opposing hitters to a .206 collective batting average. She threw 13 complete games and seven shutouts.\n\nOffensively, Alabama is led by shortstop/leadoff hitter Kenleigh Cahalan, who is batting .291. Outfielder Jenna Johnson is batting .270 with six homers and 20 RBIs.\n\n\"Every day in the SEC is going to be a battle,\" Torina said. \"She's (Beaver) going to be good. She locates well, she throws hard. We'll have our work cut out for us. It will be a short turnaround, and we'll have to get prepared quickly for them.\"", "source": {"uri": "theadvocate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Advocate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jim_kleinpeter@theadvocate.com", "name": "Jim Kleinpeter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEC_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SEC men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liberty University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LSU Tigers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beth_Torina", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beth Torina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Softball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auburn_Tigers_softball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Auburn Tigers softball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shutout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Complete game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/09/30925526-d151-5d83-afd8-9b5e54615a08/661a06d2e0b93.image.jpg?crop=1644%2C863%2C0%2C198&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543408", "eventUri": "eng-9543408", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

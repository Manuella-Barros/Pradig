{"id": 223670024, "title": "Mercedes Mon\u00e9 enters AEW Double or Nothing out to reclaim everything injury nearly took away", "text": "It wasn\u2019t 100 percent that Mercedes Mon\u00e9 would get to this moment after she suffered a severe ankle injury when she lost her footing on the top rope and fell to the outside during a match against Willow Nightingale for the inaugural NJPW STRONG women\u2019s championship last May. The 32-year-old Mon\u00e9 \u2014 formerly WWE\u2019s Sasha Banks \u2014 said her doctors told her the injury was potentially career-ending, but she was \u201cready to recover the moment I got hurt.\u201d A little more than a year later, Mon\u00e9 will return to the ring for the first time since in her AEW debut match against Nightingale for the TBS Championship at Double or Nothing at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on Sunday (8 p.m, Bleacher Report, Triller). \u201cThis was almost all taken away from me and I couldn\u2019t imagine where I would be if I didn\u2019t have wrestling. I would be so, so lost,\u201d Mon\u00e9 said. \u201cSo for me, it\u2019s really putting my heart, my soul, my body all out there all over again and not being afraid of getting hurt. That\u2019s the biggest thing about having an injury is not being afraid of hitting these moves you hit before. You don\u2019t want to get hurt again. I\u2019m ready to put my body on the line. I\u2019m ready to put my heart out there.\u201d Getting to that point wasn\u2019t easy for Mon\u00e9, who said she enlisted the best doctors and physical therapists to ensure her return. She said the first week after surgery was the \u201cmost pain I\u2019ve ever felt in my whole life.\u201d Mon\u00e9 couldn\u2019t walk on the injured foot for months and said it was \u201cso hard to learn how to do things without a lot of people\u2019s help while hobbling on one leg.\u201d It taught her a lot about patience and the power of the human body, something she needed when it was time to get back in the ring as well. The fear of injuring herself took a little while to go away and she thanked Tyler Breeze, a former WWE star and one of her training buddies, for helping her get there. \u201cWhen I first started to train, just running ropes hurt and that scared me,\u201d Mon\u00e9 said. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018No way I\u2019m going the path to feel this pain my whole life.\u2019 Finally, it got better and little things stopped hurting and finally Breeze pushed me to do some of my moves that I was gonna do like double knees and going off the top rope. I hit them, so the fear was gone. Everything felt back to normal and I\u2019m ready.\u201d Mon\u00e9 said she spent the past year training in every wrestling school in the Orlando area. That included working out with the former Scrypts in WWE, Lince Dorado and former Ring of Honor women\u2019s champion Sumie Sakai, among others to be exposed to many styles and teachings as possible. She was medically cleared to wrestle in December and believes she\u2019s in the best shape of her life for her AEW debut. Mon\u00e9 said AEW president Tony Khan delayed things to \u201cmake sure that everything was lined up perfectly\u201d for one of his three big free-agent signings this year, along with Will Ospreay and Kazuchika Okada. She debuted with the company in her hometown of Boston at TD Garden on March 13 and now will finally have her first match at a show that celebrates AEW\u2019s five-year anniversary. Her return bout against Nightingale, 30, brings her full circle. Mon\u00e9, who now uses the \u201cCEO\u201d moniker, praised her opponent\u2019s strides and success as a performer since their first match. Nightingale has been on quite the run as she also won the women\u2019s Owen Hart Cup tournament along with her belts in New Japan and AEW. \u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing growth to watch,\u201d Mon\u00e9 said. \u201cThe moment she beat me it was like a star risen. Her eyes lit up. Her career has taken off ever since then\u2026 It\u2019s been amazing to see and I can\u2019t wait to take it all away from her on Sunday.\u201d Mon\u00e9 doesn\u2019t see going after the TBS Championship as trying to win a secondary title to the AEW Women\u2019s World Championship held by \u201cTimeless\u201d Toni Storm. Bringing the TBS Championship home is just the first step in what Mon\u00e9 hopes is a run of belt collecting. \u201cSecondary championship? It\u2019s the face of TBS,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be the No. 1 championship once I hold it. Don\u2019t be worried, not only am I going to get that one, I\u2019m gonna get another one. I\u2019m gonna get all the championships. There is no No. 1, No.2, No. 3, it\u2019s just titles. It\u2019s all a collection just for me.\u201d She doesn\u2019t view the match as one that needs to be a tone-setter for her time in AEW, believing fans are already familiar with her history of tremendous work in the ring \u2013 touting herself as the \u201cgreatest women\u2019s wrestler of all time.\u201d \u201cFor me, it\u2019s just knowing. It\u2019s not proving, it\u2019s knowing that I\u2019m the best,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s knowing that I\u2019m the greatest. It\u2019s knowing all of the hard work I\u2019ve been through to get here. It\u2019s showing the fans this Sunday all of that.\u201d Outside the ring, joining AEW has allowed Mon\u00e9 to work in a different creative environment than in WWE \u2013 and it\u2019s given her a greater level of input. She said she enjoys having a direct line of communication and \u201cgreat partnership\u201d with Khan to hash out ideas. Mon\u00e9 also helped bring in Emmy-winning writer/producer Jennifer Pepperman \u2013 whom she worked closely with in WWE \u2013 as AEW\u2019s new VP of Content Development. \u201cNot to say bad things about WWE, but to have writers before who just did not hear my voice, had no idea how to write for my voice, was so hard for many many years and I never really got to have promos until Jennifer came to WWE,\u201d the multi-time women\u2019s world champion said of her bond with Pepperman. \u201cI remember her handing me a promo and I almost cried because I finally had a writer who heard my voice and gave me words that fit my character and ever since then me and her were just like peanut butter and jelly.\u201d She also praised Pepperman\u2019s efforts in fighting for women and getting things done for them backstage in WWE. It\u2019s why she wanted her as part of the team in AEW and said \u201cchanges have been made since she\u2019s been here.\u201d With Pepperman around, Mon\u00e9 didn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s considering a change in approach to her character and promos now that she\u2019s in AEW where writers are generally relied on less than WWE and performers to tap even more into their real-life selves in their presentation. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like that makes it really wrestling, right? Wrestling is larger than life,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the characters and excitement and telling a story. I feel like people need help telling a story. What\u2019s better if you are telling a story than having a writer help you write that story. \u201cI work with Jennifer fairly closely so we go back and forth with what to say. It\u2019s not people handing out scripts saying, \u2018Hey, say this.\u2019 It\u2019s really coming from the heart. She\u2019s really helped me find my voice. And I think that\u2019s what makes AEW so cool, it\u2019s that the wrestlers can go to the writers that we do have here and speak from the heart and work with him and figure out what they want to say with their characters.\u201d Mon\u00e9 has already seen how working with Pepperman has had a positive effect on Nightingale. \u201cI\u2019ve seen just how she\u2019s talked to Willow and make her excited and tell her how she is a champion and how she should have confidence and belief in herself and to see how the structure and Willow\u2019s energy changes,\u201d Mon\u00e9 said. Another familiar face in AEW is Saraya \u2013 formerly Paige in WWE. It\u2019s a match and storyline wrestling fans have been intrigued by since Saraya returned in September 2022 from what at the time was considered a career-ending neck injury suffered on a simple kick delivered by Mon\u00e9 during a WWE live event in 2017. When she returned, Saraya told The Post she was open to doing whatever Mon\u00e9 was \u201ccomfortable\u201d with. Mon\u00e9 sounds more than open to the two squaring off at some point, but the story would need to \u201ccreate something bigger\u201d than just bringing up what happened in WWE that some AEW fans may not know about. \u201cI\u2019m here to face everybody, every woman here,\u201d Mon\u00e9 said. \u201cSo if she [Saraya] wants to be on the list, she\u2019s more than welcome to wrestle me. She\u2019s not gonna get any of my titles that\u2019s for sure.\u201d For now, Mon\u00e9 is focused on bringing her story with Nightingale full circle at Double or Nothing. When asked about friend Bayley\u2019s WWE women\u2019s championship win at WrestleMania 40, she joked she has to win now Sunday, \u201cso we can have our champion picture together.\u201d Doing so will mean Mon\u00e9 is completely back from an injury that threatened to take her career away and in the place she believes she belongs. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna mean everything to me to be back in the spotlight I deserve, the face of AEW and the face of TBS and to just give back wrestling,\u201d Mone said. \u201cI want to wrestle. I\u2019m so excited for this next chapter because it\u2019s not what it used to be. It\u2019s something brand new and different and something I can really help control.\u201d", "summary": "The 32-year-old Mon\u00e9 said her doctors told her the injury was potentially career-ending, but she was \u201cready to recover the moment I got hurt.\u201d\u00a0", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/05/26/sports/mercedes-mone-talks-aew-double-or-nothing-match/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/newspress-collage-dtddhpmi1-1716528670659.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1716514590&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:00:00", "author": "Joseph Staszewski", "authors": ["Joseph Staszewski"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.283}

{"id": 231444042, "title": "Vaughan Gething wants new start after no confidence vote loss", "text": "Mr Gething said \"there is a choice now whether the country can function, whether government can function, whether the Senedd can function\". \"Are we prepared to stop the whole institution from working based on the immediate politics of the general election? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right thing to do.\" Tom Giffard, Conservative MS for South Wales West , accused Mr Gething of \"ignoring\" what the Senedd, and the Welsh people, were saying to him, describing it as \"very arrogant\". He said the Labour group was \"weak and divided\", adding Mr Gething could not control it, likely leading to legislation not being passed. \"There\u2019s two ways we can break the impasse. Either Vaughan Gething has to resign, or we should call a Senedd election,\" he said. But Mr Giffard said the Conservatives would not rule out working with Mr Gething in the future, particularly when it came to passing budgets. \"I think it\u2019s unlikely that we would work \u2013 even find agreement quite frankly \u2013 on most issues,\" he said, adding the Conservatives were \"always happy to work for the betterment of the people of Wales\". Plaid Cymru\u2019s Mabon ap Gwynfor, MS for Dwyfor Meirionydd, accused Mr Gething of acting with \"contempt\" towards the Senedd. \"The Senedd elects the first minister, and in this instance the first minister has lost the confidence of the Senedd, therefore he should respect that. \"His refusal to step down shows contempt to the Senedd and to the people of Wales and he should consider his position,\" he said. But Mr ap Gwynfor said Plaid Cymru would also consider cooperating with Labour \"on a case-by-case basis\" for passing budgets and legislation.", "summary": "The first minister says he will not resign, accusing opposition parties of \"political opportunism\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckrrm391nd0o", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/229d/live/fbf68580-25aa-11ef-8b8c-51da4a2ef232.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:51:05", "author": "Catrin Haf Jones", "authors": ["Catrin Haf Jones"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.321}

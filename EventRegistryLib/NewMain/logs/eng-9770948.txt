This is 25C across most of the UK, but can reach 28C in London and surrounding areas, where temperatures are typically higher.\n\nTemperatures in London (PA) can reach 32 degrees.\n\nMr Partridge said there was a very real chance this heatwave would actually become an official heatwave, as previous heatwaves had failed to meet all the criteria.\n\nIf not, you will feel the heat anyway if you are nearby, out and about, or a normal person, because the weather will only get more humid and humid throughout the night.\n\nTemperatures are expected to reach 27C in some areas on Sunday, 29C on Monday and 32C in southeast England on Tuesday.\n\nThe hottest day so far this year was recorded on July 19, when a temperature of 31.9C was recorded in St James' Park in central London.\n\nIn many parts of the country, forecasters say temperatures will be four to five degrees warmer than they were at this time in July. Only the far north-west of Scotland and parts of Northern Ireland will see cloud and rain on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nHowever, this summery weather could end abruptly on Wednesday, with heavy rain expected, although it is unclear whether this will only fall in southern England or elsewhere in the UK.\n\nDespite the sudden showers, temperatures are expected to remain high through the first week of August.\n\nMr Partridge said: Usually after these storms pass, everything gets a lot cooler and fresher, but it will be a little bit cooler over the weekend, but it will still be where we need to be. It could be a degree warmer. So it looks like summer is coming a little bit.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_East_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South East England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_James'_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St James' Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.imgur.com/AoyxWyw.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770948", "eventUri": "eng-9770948", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 1577, "textEnd": 1584}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Advanced weather maps indicate that today's (July 31) temperatures could once again rise above 30C, with southern and central England expected to be the warmest regions.\n\nAs usual, this spike in heat also brings the risk of thunderstorms. A yellow Met Office warning is in place across south-eastern and southern England today, and another more widespread warning across England, including the whole of Lancashire and most of the North West, tomorrow (August 1).\n\nREAD MORE: Heat health warnings issued and 32C on the way before major change\n\nSome areas could see as much as a month's rainfall in a few hours on Thursday which could cause flooding, the Met Office warned. Despite the anticipated thundery breakdown leading to cooler temperatures across the UK by the weekend, weather forecasters are now predicting a second heatwave to follow in August.\n\nExacta Weather forecaster James Madden stated that this \"major heat surge\" should hit the UK \"for in and around August 10 to August 15\". He warned: \"This could bring the hottest temperatures of the summer to date, with overall values rising into the low to mid 30Cs at the very least once again.\"\n\nMr Madden added that there is even a \"more extreme possibility\" for this second heatwave - \"[we] could even see temperatures reaching into the mid to high 30Cs in the hottest parts of the country during this developing period\".\n\nIf these temperature predictions are accurate, this six-day spell will constitute an official heatwave, the Mirror reports. The Met Office defines a heatwave as when \"a location records a period of at least three consecutive days with daily maximum temperatures meeting or exceeding the heatwave temperature threshold\". That threshold varies from 25C to 28C depending on your county.\n\nAs for today, Met Office meteorologist Clare Nasir said this morning: \"[There will be] strong sunshine through the afternoon, allowing temperatures to rise very quickly across England and Wales - it's another hot day, also humid. Temperatures across Wales [will hit] 26C to 28C, 30C to 32C across the far south of England. But a pleasantly warm 20C to 21C across Scotland and Northern Ireland.\"\n\nThe Met Office said Thursday afternoon could see 50 to 100mm of rain in a few hours in some spots, which is more than a month's worth of rainfall. The heat is not set to last into next weekend as temperatures are expected to return to the mid-20s in the south as a band of rain moves through the country on Saturday.\n\nTo cope with warm evenings, the Met Office has urged Britons to keep their homes as cool as possible. Official advice said: \"Overnight temperatures are going to be very high so it's quite hard to cool houses down in that situation because you don't have the relief overnight and temperatures dropping.\n\n\"If you can open your windows at night, try to let some of the cooler air in and keep curtains or blinds shut during the day.\"\n\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter LANCS LIVE NEWS and get all the biggest stories from across Lancashire direct to your inbox", "source": {"uri": "lancs.live", "dataType": "news", "title": "accrington"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jon_macpherson@lancs.live", "name": "Jon Macpherson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meteorologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kew_Gardens", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kew Gardens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow_Airport", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heathrow Airport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North West England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Weather forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lancashire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lancashire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_Nasir", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clare Nasir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_England", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Counties of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29647643.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_met-office.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770948", "eventUri": "eng-9770948", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-10", "dateEnd": "2024-08-15", "textStart": 1290, "textEnd": 1312}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 200, "textEnd": 207}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 368, "textEnd": 375}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 775, "textEnd": 783}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Nearer to average for Northern Ireland and Scotland. Breezy across the Highlands.\"\n\nTemperatures are expected to reach highs of 29C on Monday and 32C on Tuesday, both in south-east England. Only the far north-west areas of Scotland and parts of Northern Ireland will see some cloud and possibly rain on Monday and Tuesday. Simon Partridge, forecaster at the Met Office, said: \"There is certainly potential that it could become an actual official heatwave, because in the spells you've had before it hasn't actually met all the criteria.\n\n\"If there's not, it's very close to it, and if you're out and about and a member of the public then it's going to feel like a heatwave anyway, because also overnight things are going to turn a little bit more humid and muggy day-on-day as well.\" But the summery spell could end abruptly on Wednesday with some heavy thundery rain expected. The Met Office said there is an \"increasing risk of thunderstorms towards the southeast\" with \"very warm and humid\" conditions.\n\nThere is uncertainty remains over this will be just across the south of England or other parts of the UK. Despite the sudden showers, temperatures are expected to stay high heading into the first week of August. The hottest day of the year so far saw a temperature of 31.9C recorded at St James's Park in central London on July 19. Many parts of the country will see temperatures four to five degrees warmer than average for this time in July, the forecaster said.\n\nMr Partridge said: \"Usually you get these thunderstorms come through and then everything's a lot cooler and fresher, but although it will be a bit fresher at the end of the week, it will still be about where we should be, if not a degree or so warmer. So a bit of summer is on the cards.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benjamin_lynch@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Benjamin Lynch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Met Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_East_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South East England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Highlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Highlands"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_James's_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St James's Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central London"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time_Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Part-Time Employment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33345571.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_5am-weather-UK-weather-Brit-to-roast-in-30C-heatwave-in-days-but-risk-of-Thunderstorms-could-fo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770948", "eventUri": "eng-9770948", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 1854, "textEnd": 1861}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

It depends where you are, these are the threshold temperatures that we need to hit for at least three consecutive days. Now that's 28C for London and parts of southeast England, 27C for much of England and Wales, we've already seen one day above that and actually over the next few days in parts of the Midlands, southern, southeast England we could well see those threshold temperatures exceeded for a heatwave.\n\n\"Through the day on Tuesday, lots of dry, sunny weather, areas of cloud just floating around for parts of northern England, Northern Ireland and at times Scotland so you could just see a light passing shower here. Further south, long clear spells of blue skies lifting temperatures up to between 28C to 32C in the south east. Typically the high teens or the low 20Cs as we head further north.\"\n\nThe blue skies are not set to last though and while it is expected to remain warm, thundery showers are set to move in on Wednesday while there is a Met Office yellow warning on Thursday for thunderstorms for much of England and Wales.

The Met Office said much of central and southern England will be getting \"hot and humid\" conditions this afternoon, with cooler temperatures in the north.\n\n\"There is a big temperature contrast from north to south this week,\" the weather agency said. \"Much of central and southern UK will feel hot and humid with temperatures around 30C likely in some towns and cities. Further north, temperatures are closer to average and remain in the high teens or low 20s.\"\n\nThe split in temperatures is expected to continue into this evening with central and southern areas expecting a \"warm and muggy night\", while in Scotland it will be \"much cooler\". Some rural areas may even see some spots of grass frost, the Met Office said.\n\nSunseekers will be disappointed to learn that the warm and pleasant weather looks set to be over before the week comes to an end. Two yellow weather warnings for thunderstorms have been issued, the first of which comes into force across London and the south-eastern coast of England from midday on Wednesday. Forecasters have warned that \"some isolated flooding and disruption from thunderstorms\" is possible.\n\nThen, on Thursday, a second warning covering the majority of England and Wales will come into force from 1am and remain in place for 23 hours. The Met Office warns: \"Multiple rounds of heavy showers and thunderstorms are forecast on Thursday, and may lead to some disruption.\"\n\nSome areas could see as much as a month's rainfall - between 50 and 100mm - in a few hours on Thursday. Brits are being warned that sudden flooding could lead to difficult driving conditions, while lightning strikes could affect train and bus services and power cuts may also occur.\n\nMeteorologist at the Met Office, Becky Mitchell: \"The heat and humidity we've got across England and Wales is going to spark off some thundery showers on Wednesday and Thursday so we've got some yellow weather warnings in force.\"\n\nTemperatures are due to return down to the mid-20s in the south as a band of rain moves through the country on Saturday.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fionnula_hainey@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Fionnula Hainey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kew_Gardens", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kew Gardens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow_Airport", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heathrow Airport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_East_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South East England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flash flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mercury (element)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meteorologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frost", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_strike", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lightning strike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_outage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Power outage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29645394.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS273603329.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770948", "eventUri": "eng-9770948", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 500, "textEnd": 507}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

But despite the heat, waterways are still cold enough to put a person into cold water shock which can affect anybody, no matter their fitness.\n\n'It can cause panic, anxiety, disorientation, and loss of muscular control, which causes a person to gasp for air - inhaling water as a result.'\n\nHe urged anyone caught in a dangerous situation to 'float to live', which involves tilting your head back and submerging your ears; trying to relax and breathe normally; gently moving your hands to help you stay afloat if you need to; and spread your arms and legs out to improve stability. Once your breathing is under control, you should then call for help or swim to safety.\n\nMr Carter added that he was urging people not to take disposable barbecues with them to open spaces because they can cause grass fires, especially in hot weather when the ground is dry.\n\nSeparately, a study has found dogs are being made to walk on hot roads, pavements and plastic grass in the heat.\n\nThe survey by Burns Pet Nutrition also found half of dog walkers make no change to their walking routine when the weather is hot.\n\nThe poll of 2,000 pet owners also revealed 38 per cent believe temperatures of up to 29C is too hot for walkies, while 34 per cent feel 24C heat is too much for a dog.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"},

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nThe Met Office says that Monday will be a \"very warm day\" for Wales with plenty of sunshine and highs of 27\u00b0C. Conditions across the UK are turning increasingly warm, or even hot in some areas.\n\nTemperatures on Monday could reach 32\u00b0C in some parts of England, BBC Breakfast weather presenter Carol Kirkwood predicted, while long-term forecasts remain warm despite the chance of thunderstorms during the week.\n\nThe warm surge is down to a wave of high pressure across the country and warm air rising from the south, creating dry, fine and sunny conditions and bringing temperatures up. The Met Office says that some areas of central, southern and eastern UK could reach heatwave criteria.

Simon Partridge, forecaster at Met Office, said: \"There is certainly potential that it could become an actual official heatwave, because in the spells you've had before it hasn't actually met all the criteria. If there's not, it's very close to it, and if you're out and about and a member of the public then it's going to feel like a heatwave anyway, because also overnight things are going to turn a little bit more humid and muggy day-on-day as well.\"\n\nThe Met Office forecast for Monday in Wales says: \"Another very warm day with plenty of sunshine, though perhaps turning somewhat cloudier from the northwest through the afternoon, with the sunshine possibly becoming hazier as a result. Sea breezes developing, but winds remaining light in most areas. Maximum temperature 26 \u00b0C.\n\n\"Plenty of late-evening sunny spells before a calm night with some prolonged clear spells, where a few pockets of mist may form in the countryside. Another mild night to come. Minimum temperature 14 \u00b0C.\"\n\nThe temperatures in Wales today:\n\nThe outlook for the rest of the week is good with the Met Office forecast for Wales predicting: \"Another fine, settled day on Tuesday with lots of very warm sunshine. Patchy cloud in the northwest, and a build-up of high cloud may turn skies a little hazy at times elsewhere. Maximum temperature 27 \u00b0C.\n\n\"Very warm sunshine again on Wednesday, though a chance of showers developing, which could turn thundery. Showers should clear eastwards on Thursday. Fresher on Friday with bright spells and showers.\"\n\nDerek Brockway has listed the forecasted highs for Wales this week:\n\nMonday - 27\u00b0C\n\nTuesday - 28\u00b0C\n\nWednesday -28\u00b0C\n\nThursday - 25\u00b0C\n\nFriday -22\u00b0C\n\nSaturday - 20\u00b0C\n\nHow long will the mini heatwave last? The good news is that the Met Office long-range UK forecast into the start of August is showing that it will tend to be \"drier and brighter much of the time\", although there is also the small possibility of some thundery showers spreading in from Europe.\n\nThe forecast up to August 11 says: \"There are signs that a more widely settled period becomes more probable towards mid-August. Temperatures during this period will probably be close to or slightly above average overall, with the likelihood of some very warm conditions developing in the south and perhaps parts of the east at times.\"", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cathy_owen@walesonline.co.uk", "name": "Cathy Owen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Weather presenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Kirkwood", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carol Kirkwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Breakfast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC Breakfast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Brockway", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derek Brockway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Cymru_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC Cymru Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_breeze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sea breeze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article29630955.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_RJS_280724_barry14JPG.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770948", "eventUri": "eng-9770948", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-11", "textStart": 3473, "textEnd": 3482}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Friday should bring rain, which will move westward.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency has issued yellow heat health warnings for all areas of England, except the North East and North West, until 9am on Friday.\n\nIt warned the expected hot weather may have 'significant impacts' on the health and social care sector across the south east and London, with minor impact elsewhere.\n\nConditions are likely to impact the 'vulnerable', such as the elderly and those with multiple health conditions.\n\nThe Met Office said a warm snap is considered a heatwave if a location records at least three consecutive days with maximum temperatures exceeding a designated value - 25C for most of the UK, rising to 28C in London and its surrounding area, where temperatures are typically higher.\n\nThe hottest day of the year so far saw a temperature of 31.9C (89.4F) recorded at St James's Park in London on July 19.\n\nBut while many enjoy the heat, Met Office deputy chief meteorologist David Oliver issued a warning for southern areas to prepare for a wild and wet end to the week.\n\n'There's a chance of some thundery showers across some southern areas of England on Wednesday, then on Thursday there is a signal for some potentially very heavy thunderstorms to develop,' he said.\n\n'There are still details to confirm during this period, but in any event there is a chance of some impacts on each day, especially Thursday.'\n\nHe added: 'The heaviest showers on Thursday could result in 20-30mm of rain within an hour, with daily totals possibly reaching as high as 90mm if multiple showers impact the same location. Lightning and hail present additional hazards, with disruption likely for some.\n\n'This is a developing element of the forecast, so it's important to stay up-to-date with the latest outlook in the coming days.'\n\nThe average August rainfall in England is 75mm (2.95 inches) - meaning more than a month's rain could fall in one day.\n\nForecasters said in the thunderstorms warning, which runs from midday to midnight on Thursday, that there could be road closures, train delays and power cuts.\n\nIt has also said there is 'a small chance that homes and businesses could be flooded' and cause 'a danger to life.'", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meteorologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Health_Security_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UK Health Security Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_East_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South East England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_East_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North East England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North West England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_James's_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St James's Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_outage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Power outage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Trade_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Trade Shows", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/30/07/87930279-13687197-image-a-6_1722321949783.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770948", "eventUri": "eng-9770948", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 2663, "textEnd": 2670}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

So a bit of summer is on the cards.'\n\nMeanwhile the UK Health Security Agency has issued a yellow heat health alert for the South and East of England, the Midlands and Yorkshire and Humber regions.\n\nThis runs from 9am today until 11pm on Wednesday and warns of the 'potential for significant impacts to be observed across the health and social care sector due to the high temperatures'.\n\nThis includes 'observed increase in mortality across the population likely, particularly in the 65+ age group or those with health conditions, but impacts may also be seen in younger age groups'.\n\nIt also says that 'increased demand for remote healthcare services' is likely, and internal temperatures in care settings such as hospitals and care homes 'may exceed recommended threshold for clinical risk assessment'.\n\nFinally, the alert warns of the 'impact on ability of services to be delivered due to heat effects on workforce possible and many indoor environments likely to be overheating, leading to increased risk to vulnerable people living independently in the community as well as in care settings'.\n\nThe turnaround in conditions follows a very wet start to July - with East and South East England seeing about a month's worth of rainfall in just the first week.\n\nAlso today, the London Fire Brigade urged parents and carers to explain the risks of jumping into water and open water swimming to children.\n\nCraig Carter, the LFB's assistant commissioner for prevention and protection, said: 'It's a sad statistic that the risk of drowning in England increases as children reach their teenage years, and that teenage boys are the most likely group to accidentally drown.\n\n'It can be tempting to cool off from the heat by going for a swim. But despite the heat, waterways are still cold enough to put a person into cold water shock which can affect anybody, no matter their fitness.\n\n'It can cause panic, anxiety, disorientation, and loss of muscular control, which causes a person to gasp for air - inhaling water as a result.'\n\nHe urged anyone caught in a dangerous situation to 'float to live', which involves tilting your head back and submerging your ears; trying to relax and breathe normally; gently moving your hands to help you stay afloat if you need to; and spread your arms and legs out to improve stability. Once your breathing is under control, you should then call for help or swim to safety.\n\nMr Carter added that he was urging people not to take disposable barbecues with them to open spaces because they can cause grass fires, especially in hot weather when the ground is dry.\n\nSeparately, a study has found dogs are being made to walk on hot roads, pavements and plastic grass in the heat.\n\nThe survey by Burns Pet Nutrition also found half of dog walkers make no change to their walking routine when the weather is hot.\n\nThe poll of 2,000 pet owners also revealed 38 per cent believe temperatures of up to 29C is too hot for walkies, while 34 per cent feel 24C heat is too much for a dog.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"},

Here some locations will witness torrential downpours, large hail and frequent lightning.\"\n\nSpray and sudden flooding could lead to difficult driving conditions and some road closures, the Met Office said. It added that fast flowing or deep floodwater causing a danger to life is also possible.\n\nThe break in weather follows the hottest day of the year on Tuesday when temperatures soared to 32\u00b0C at Kew Gardens and Heathrow.\n\nTemperatures will remain high at 30\u00b0C or above into Wednesday and Thursday, with thunderstorms expected in the South East on Wednesday and across much of England on Thursday.\n\nMet Office meteorologist Becky Mitchell said: \"The heat and humidity we've got across England and Wales is going to spark off some thundery showers on Wednesday and Thursday so we've got some yellow weather warnings in force.\"\n\nThere is a risk of flooding on Thursday afternoon in some parts of the country, but the thunderstorms will be \"quite hit and miss\".\n\nThe yellow weather warnings for thunderstorms are in place across the South East on Wednesday, spreading up through the North to cover the entire of England on Thursday.\n\nThe Met Office said Thursday afternoon could see 50 to 100mm of rain in a few hours in some spots, which is more than a month's worth of rainfall.\n\nIn Scotland, temperatures will reach highs of 21\u00b0C on Wednesday amid sunny intervals, and 23\u00b0C on Thursday after spells of rain and cloud in the morning.\n\nNorthern Ireland will mirror much of Scotland's conditions, with slightly cooler highs of 20\u00b0C expected on Wednesday.\n\nThe heat is not set to last into next weekend as temperatures are expected to return to the mid-20s in the south as a band of rain moves through the country on Saturday.\n\nTo cope with warm evenings, the Met Office has urged Britons to keep their homes as cool as possible.\n\nIt said: \"Overnight temperatures are going to be very high so it's quite hard to cool houses down in that situation because you don't have the relief overnight and temperatures dropping.\n\n\"If you can open your windows at night, try to let some of the cooler air in and keep curtains or blinds shut during the day\".", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emilia_randall@inews.co.uk", "name": "Emilia Randall", "type": "author",

People in the south of England will start to see showers from Wednesday evening, with a yellow warning for rain in place for central and southern areas of the country on Thursday.\n\nMet Office Deputy Chief Meteorologist David Oliver said: \"There's a chance of some thundery showers across some southern areas of England on Wednesday, then on Thursday there is a signal for some potentially very heavy thunderstorms to develop. There are still details to confirm during this period, but in any event there is a chance of some impacts on each day, especially Thursday.\n\n\"The heaviest showers on Thursday could result in 20-30mm of rain within an hour, with daily totals possibly reaching as high as 90mm if multiple showers impact the same location. Lightning and hail present additional hazards, with disruption likely for some. This is a developing element of the forecast, so it's important to stay up-to-date with the latest outlook in the coming days.\" Cooler temperatures of around 24C are forecast for the weekend, dropping to around 20C in the north of England and Scotland.\n\nUK weather forecast Tuesday:\n\nGenerally dry with plenty of sunshine and light winds.

After a warm day on Monday it is likely to be even more so today with forecasters predicting it be the hottest day of the year with the mercury rising to 32C.\n\nSo far the hottest day of the year was 31.9C in St James' Park in central London on July 19 but a high pressure system over the UK and the positioning of the jet stream to the north of the country allowing in warm air from the Continent, means we could see it go even warmer.\n\nAnd there is also the chance of an official heatwave this week where the mercury threshold is met or exceeded for three consecutive days. But this also depends on which part of the UK you live as the threshold is higher in London and parts of the southeast where the mercury needs to reach 28C, as opposed to 27C in much of the south and central England, while it is 26C in another band that also covers parts of north west England. The lowest band is 25C that covers parts of southwest England, northern England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

The threshold varies by UK county and so far this week, nowhere has reached three days in a row of the threshold, although this is expected to change over the coming days.\"\n\nThe blue skies are not set to last though and while it is expected to remain warm, thundery showers are set to move in on Wednesday while there is a Met Office yellow warning on Thursday for thunderstorms for much of England and Wales. The Met Office forecast for Thursday to Saturday reads: \"Dry with sunny spells, increasing risk of heavy thundery showers across the south on Thursday.

All areas of England - except the North East and North West - have been included.\n\nThe heat alert came into place at 9am this morning (Monday) and will last until 11pm on Wednesday. The UKHSA has warned that hot weather may have 'significant impacts' on the health and social care sector, particularly across the South East and London where the mercury could climb to almost 30C.\n\nREAD NEXT: Temperatures to soar to 28C today as 'mini heatwave' hits Greater Manchester\n\nMet Office forecasters previously said 'it is possible' that some places in the UK 'may reach heatwave criteria' over the coming days. The warmer weather sweeping in is due to a change in the jet stream, with higher pressure bringing more dry, settled and sunnier weather.\n\nDavid Hayter, deputy chief meteorologist at the Met Office, said: \"As we go through the weekend, the jet stream will weaken to the west of the UK generating an area of high pressure that will slowly move in across the UK. High pressure means the air is sinking from higher in the atmosphere and that brings drier, settled and sunnier weather.\n\n\"Temperatures will rise too, becoming widely above average. We could see maxima of 27C in the south and 25C in the northeast by Sunday. There's a bit more in the way of patchy cloud in Northern Ireland, south and west Scotland and the northern isles, so temperatures will be lower there.\"\n\nLooking at this week, the Met Office said: \"Conditions look to turn increasingly warm, or even hot, in central, southern and eastern areas early next week and it is possible some places may reach heatwave criteria. It's uncertain how long this warmer weather will last though, with a possible breakdown from mid-week.\"\n\nIn Greater Manchester, today is set to be the hottest day in our region as temperatures reach highs of 28C this afternoon. Sunny spells are predicted, with some cloudy intervals during the late afternoon.\n\nTomorrow is set to be another hot day as temperatures climb to 26C during the afternoon. More bright and sunny conditions are forecast.\n\nOn Wednesday the mercury is set to reach highs of 27C, while highs of 25C are forecast on Thursday and 24C on Friday.\n\nRead more of today's top stories here", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashlie_blakey@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Ashlie Blakey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Health_Security_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UK Health Security Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Met Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jet stream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_East_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North East England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North West England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meteorologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hayter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Hayter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mercury (element)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greater Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greater Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29632390.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JMP_MEN_300523BLACKPOOL_09JPG.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770948", "eventUri": "eng-9770948", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Ms Kirkwood continued: \"There will be a lot of dry weather, a fair bit of sunshine, windy across the far north of the country, especially Shetlands, here too we could catch the odd shower but temperature-wise we are looking at 21C in Aberdeen, 20C in Belfast, 26C in Birmingham and potentially 31C or 32C in the southeastern quarter.\"\n\nMet Office forecaster Simon Partridge said that the hot weather could also mean an official heatwave. \"There is certainly potential that it could become an actual official heatwave, because in the spells you've had before it hasn't actually met all the criteria,\" he said. \"If there's not, it's very close to it, and if you're out and about and a member of the public then it's going to feel like a heatwave anyway, because also overnight things are going to turn a little bit more humid and muggy day-on-day as well.\"\n\nBut the blue skies could end abruptly on Wednesday with some heavy thundery rain expected. The Met Office said there is an \"increasing risk of thunderstorms towards the southeast\" with \"very warm and humid\" conditions. Mr Partridge added: \"Usually you get these thunderstorms come through and then everything's a lot cooler and fresher, but although it will be a bit fresher at the end of the week, it will still be about where we should be, if not a degree or so warmer.

It's worth staying protected if you are heading to the beach or outside for a prolonged period of time.\"\n\nHowever, the Met Office warned that there is a chance of thunderstorms as the week progresses.\n\n\"In the middle of the week, hot and humid air moves up from the south - giving an increasing risk of some thunderstorms,\" Mr Dewhurst said.\n\n\"There is an increasing chance of thunderstorms Wednesday and Thursday - particularly in England and Wales before we have a fresher end to the week.\"", "source": {"uri": "sussexexpress.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "SussexWorld"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_pole@sussexexpress.co.uk", "name": "Sam Pole", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastbourne", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eastbourne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Eastbourne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_England", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Counties of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussex", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sussex"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crawley", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crawley"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Crawley"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hastings", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hastings"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hastings"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsham", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horsham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Horsham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meteorologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ultraviolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Celsius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northern England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Instrumentation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Instrumentation", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Reviews", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://www.sussexexpress.co.uk/webimg/b25lY21zOjJkZmM0YTJkLTViMTktNDliYS1hYzgyLWRjNmQwY2JlNGY3Nzo2YjYwYWNiOS05ODBjLTRiMDgtOWVmYy0wN2U2ZDY1YWVmMjU=.jpg?width=640&auto=webp&quality=75&crop=3:2,smart&trim=", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770948", "eventUri": "eng-9770948", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 376, "textEnd": 383}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

It's uncertain how long this warmer weather will last though, with a possible breakdown from mid-week.\"\n\nThey explained that the UK heatwave threshold is met when a location records a period of at least three consecutive days with daily maximum temperatures meeting or exceeding the heatwave temperature threshold - which is 25C degrees for Yorkshire - meaning that the county could experience its own heatwave, before conditions change towards the end of the week.\n\nThe Met Office weather outlook for Yorkshire from Tuesday, July 30, to Thursday, August 1, is: \"Largely dry and fine Tuesday and Wednesday. Increasing amounts of cloud with showers, potentially thundery, on Thursday. Feeling warm and increasingly humid, with light winds.\"\n\nGet all the latest and breaking news in Yorkshire by signing up to our newsletter here.", "source": {"uri": "examinerlive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "huddersfieldexaminer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "yasmin_wakefield@examinerlive.co.uk", "name": "Yasmin Wakefield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yorkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yorkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "County"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Met Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Weather forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bradford"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bradford"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheffield"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sheffield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://i2-prod.examinerlive.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/article29616668.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_sheffieldjfif.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770948", "eventUri": "eng-9770948", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 628, "textEnd": 635}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 1864, "textEnd": 1871}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 1886, "textEnd": 1894}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Kent and East Sussex are expected to bear the brunt of the scorching weather with temperatures predicted to reach 28-29C from Wednesday onwards.\n\nLondon and Essex are not far behind with highs of 27C, while Norfolk and Suffolk will experience temperatures between 26C and 27C. The East Midlands, eastern parts of Devon, and the Greater Manchester area will see warmer air coming in but will remain in the low 20s. In Yorkshire, places like York in North Yorkshire will see a 24C boost this afternoon, compared to 25C in Leeds and Huddersfield will also see 25C temperatures by 4pm.\n\nREAD MORE Strictly dream for ballroom dancing champion - just six years old\n\nOn Monday, Brits enjoyed sizzling highs of approximately 28C-29C as warm southern breezes swept across the country, and Tuesday is expected to ramp up the heat to a scorching 32C. Forecasters are optimistic that the heatwave criteria could soon be met, with blistering hot weather expected to dominate much of the week ahead.\n\nFrank Saunders, the Met Office's Chief Meteorologist, stated: \"Much of the UK is entering a warm or even hot interlude of weather, with some places in England and Wales likely to meet heatwave criteria in the coming days. Temperatures are likely to peak at around 32C in southeast England on Tuesday and Wednesday, with much of the UK experiencing dry, fine and warm conditions in the first half of the week.\"\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency has issued a Yellow Heat Health Alert for parts of England, urging vigilance as the elderly and vulnerable face serious risks due to the increasing heat.\n\nPeople eager to revel in the warm weather should be wary, however, as meteorologists forecast a shift towards wetter and \"unsettled\" conditions as the weekend approaches. Come Wednesday night, heavy showers are predicted to sweep across southern England, with a yellow rain warning poised for central and southern areas on Thursday.\n\nMet Office Deputy Chief Meteorologist David Oliver highlighted the impending weather drawing near the weekend. Showers are expected to drench the south of England beginning Wednesday night, accompanied by a yellow rain warning for central and southern regions on Thursday.\n\nHe said: \"There's a chance of some thundery showers across some southern areas of England on Wednesday, then on Thursday there is a signal for some potentially very heavy thunderstorms to develop. The heaviest showers on Thursday could result in 20-30mm of rain within an hour, with daily totals possibly reaching as high as 90mm if multiple showers impact the same location.\n\n\"Lightning and hail present additional hazards, with disruption likely for some. This is a developing element of the forecast, so it's important to stay up-to-date with the latest outlook in the coming days.\" He also pointed out that the weekend will see cooler temperatures of around 24C, with the mercury dipping closer to 20C in northern areas.\n\nGet all the latest and breaking news in Yorkshire by signing up to our newsletter here.", "source": {"uri":

which could bring surface water flooding and gusty conditions.\n\nYellow heat health warnings have also been issued across most of England by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA).\n\nAll areas of England, except the North East and North West have been included in the warning, which is in place until Wednesday.\n\nThe UKHSA warned that expected hot weather may have \"significant impacts\" on the health and social care sector across the South East and London, with minor impact elsewhere.\n\nMet Office spokesperson Nicola Maxey said plenty of sunshine was expected across England and Wales on Monday, with temperatures hitting mid to high 20s in many areas.\n\nShe said: \"We could see temperatures reaching around 30C in the London area and South East, while it will be a little bit cooler near the coast.\n\n\"Through the evening a weather front starts to push its way in to the far North West, but it weakens as it moves, bringing some cloud and light patches of rain over the highest ground further north in Scotland and north-west England.\"\n\nMs Maxey said Tuesday was expected to reach 30 to 31C with sunny dry days in the South East.\n\nShe added: \"As we move into the middle of the week we start to see an increasing risk of thunderstorms developing, particularly in parts of England and Wales, and the rain is such that it could cause some local disruption.\n\n\"This is the sort of rainfall that could cause surface water flooding and heavy rain that takes a while to clear away.\n\n\"There could also be some lightning potential for hail and gusty conditions.\"\n\nMost of southern England, the Midlands and much of the north of England are covered by the alert, which comes into force at 12am on Thursday and ends at 11.59pm.\n\nHeatwave thresholds could be met across some areas from tomorrow, but Ms Maxey said a change of weather type was expected with a return to cooler temperatures by next weekend.\n\nThe threshold is met when a location records at least three consecutive days with maximum temperatures exceeding a designated value, according to the Met Office.\n\nThis is 25C for most of the UK, but rises to 28C in London and its surrounding area, where temperatures are typically higher.\n\nThe hottest day of the year so far saw a temperature of 31.9C recorded at St James's Park in central London on July 19.", "source": {"uri":

However, we won't quite reach the scorching levels seen in south-east England where mercury levels could hit 32C.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued yellow heat health warnings for all areas of England, except the north west and north east, until Friday (August 2). It states that expected hot weather may have \"significant impacts\" on the health and social care sector across the south east and London, with minor impact elsewhere.\n\nREAD MORE: Lancashire thunderstorm warning as heatwave prediction made\n\nChief meteorologist Frank Saunders said large swathes of the UK will feel the heat up to the middle of the week. In lancashire, temperatures could soar to highs of 26C on Wednesday before dipping to 23C on Thursday, 24C on Friday and then 20C over the weekend..\n\nHe said: \"Temperatures are likely to peak at around 32C in southeast England on Tuesday and Wednesday, with much of the UK experiencing dry, fine and warm conditions in the first half of the week.\"\n\nWhile the warmth will carry on for Wednesday, there is a chance of summer thunderstorms in Lancashire on Thursday with a 24-hour warning being issued by the Met Office for the whole of the county. Up to 40mm in one hour are \"possible\" while some areas could see a \"small risk of over 60mm in 2-3 hours\" along with \"frequent lightning at times\".\n\nDavid Hayter, deputy chief meteorologist at the Met Office, said: \"As we go through the weekend, the jet stream will weaken to the west of the UK generating an area of high pressure that will slowly move in across the UK. High pressure means the air is sinking from higher in the atmosphere and that brings drier, settled and sunnier weather.\n\n\"Temperatures will rise too, becoming widely above average. We could see maxima of 27C in the south and 25C in the northeast by Sunday. There's a bit more in the way of patchy cloud in Northern Ireland, south and west Scotland and the northern isles, so temperatures will be lower there.\"\n\nLatest 5-day Met Office forecast for the region:\n\nTuesday:\n\nSome cloud in coastal regions and across Cumbria first thing this morning, but otherwise a mostly sunny day to come. Feeling very warm in the sunshine with light winds though somewhat breezier later. Maximum temperature 27C.\n\nTonight:\n\nAfter a fine and warm evening, it will stay dry overnight with largely clear skies. A warmer night for some, particularly in urban areas. Minimum temperature 13C.\n\nWednesday:\n\nAnother dry day with variable amounts of cloud and occasional sunny periods. Soon becoming very warm through the morning and feeling hot and humid by the afternoon. Maximum temperature 29C.\n\nOutlook for Thursday to Saturday:\n\nHot and humid on Thursday with thunderstorms possible in places, perhaps with torrential downpours and hail. Turning fresher thereafter with a mixture of cloud, sunny intervals and a few showers.\n\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter LANCS LIVE NEWS and get all the biggest stories from across Lancashire direct to your inbox", "source": {"uri": "lancs.live", "dataType": "news", "title": "accrington"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jon_macpherson@lancs.live", "name": "Jon Macpherson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lancashire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lancashire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Health_Security_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UK Health Security Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_East_England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South East England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meteorologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Met Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mercury (element)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hayter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Hayter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jet stream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-pressure_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High-pressure area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Urban area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumbria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cumbria"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cumbria"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29640527.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_blackpool-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770948", "eventUri": "eng-9770948", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-02", "textStart": 553, "textEnd": 561}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

This can cause you to gasp for air and inhale water.\"\n\nCharities have also issued warnings as the heatwave spreads, with Shelter advising it could pose a \"big risk for people who are homeless on

The Met Office has predicted extremely high, unseasonably warm temperatures, even warning there may be a heatwave.\n\nSouth West forecasters at the Met Office have warned that areas of the south and central England may experience temperatures which reach heatwave criteria. With temperatures soaring to the very high 20s, Bristol will bake through the start of the week.\n\nHowever, the Met Office did add that it is unclear how long the warm weather will last. It added that it is possible for things to begin to cool off as we head towards the weekend.\n\nRead more:\n\nFamily 'traumatised' as 40 Jet2 passengers 'turn flight into party' Tens of babies born addicted to drugs in Bristol\n\nToday (Monday, July 29) Bristol will see highs of 29\u00b0, with temperatures reaching 25\u00b0 by midday. As the day progresses, clear skies and bright sun will send the mercury soaring to the high 20s by 2pm.\n\nThe heat will peak at 29\u00b0 at 4pm and will remain until 7pm this evening. It will remain clear all evening, but temperatures will drop slightly to the low 20s at 10pm.\n\nTomorrow (July 30) will see similar weather, with clear skies from 6am and temperatures starting in the high teens. It will progressively get warmer, until the heat reaches 28\u00b0 at 3pm. It will remain slightly hotter tomorrow, with lows not dropping below 21\u00b0.\n\nFrom the middle of the week, a front of high pressure will move up from Europe, bringing a band of wet weather, which may cause some thunderstorms. Temperatures are expected to return to seasonal average towards the end of the week, as things begin to cool off, dropping to 26\u00b0.\n\nHowever, before the plume of high pressure forces the sun to sizzle out, the next few days will feel like summer. While warning of the possibility of a heatwave, the Met Office said: \"Heatwaves are most common in summer when high pressure develops across an area. High pressure systems are slow moving and can persist over an area for a prolonged period of time, such as days or weeks.\n\n\"They can occur in the UK due to the location of the jet stream, which is usually to the north of the UK in the summer. This can allow high pressure to develop over the UK resulting in persistent dry and settled weather.\"\n\nSouth West weather forecast:\n\nToday (Monday, July 29): Any early morning mist or fog patches soon clearing to leave another very warm day with plenty of sunshine, though perhaps a little patchy cloud developing later on in the day. Sea breezes developing, but winds remaining light for most. Maximum temperature 27 \u00b0C.\n\nTonight: Plenty of late-evening sunny spells before a calm night with some prolonged clear spells where a few pockets of mist may form in the countryside. Another mild night to come. Minimum temperature 14 \u00b0C.\n\nTuesday: Another fine, settled day with lots of very warm sunshine, though starting to feel more humid.

This can cause you to gasp for air and inhale water.\"\n\nCharities have also issued warnings as the heatwave spreads, with Shelter advising it could pose a \"big risk for people who are homeless on

Simon Partridge, forecaster with the Met Office, said: \"There is certainly potential that it could become an actual official heatwave, because in the spells you've had before it hasn't actually met all the criteria.\n\n\"If there's not, it's very close to it, and if you're out and about and a member of the public then it's going to feel like a heatwave anyway, because also overnight things are going to turn a little bit more humid and muggy day-on-day as well.\"\n\nLatest Stoke-on-Trent forecast\n\nStarting with the Met Office, and that service says it's going be warm today (July 29) with temperatures slowly rising through the day before a high of 27C at around 4pm. It will sit in the mid-to-high teens overnight.\n\nA similar story tomorrow with plenty of sunshine where the high will be 25C before getting back up to 27C on Wednesday. Thursday and Friday will then see highs of 24C before it cools slightly over the weekend - where it'll get to between 19C to 20C.\n\nThe BBC however reckons from Wednesday it'll rain every day through to next Thursday. The Beeb thinks this week's high will be 24C.\n\nMet Office UK long-range forecast\n\nAugust 2 - August 11: \"Into early August the weather will typically be dominated by a northwest-southeast split. Northwestern areas will probably experience rather breezy conditions with cloud and some outbreaks of rain or drizzle as weakening Atlantic frontal systems push eastwards across the UK.\n\n\"Toward the south and east it will tend to be drier and brighter much of the time, although there is also the small possibility of some thundery showers spreading in from the nearby continent. There are signs that a more widely settled period becomes more probable towards mid-August.\n\n\"Temperatures during this period will probably be close to or slightly above average overall, with the likelihood of some very warm conditions developing in the south and perhaps parts of the east at times.\"\n\nAugust 12 - August 26: \"No single weather type is expected to dominate through this fortnight. Spells of dry, settled weather slightly more likely, although these will alternate with wetter, cloudier conditions at times. The wettest conditions will probably be in the northwest, with the southeast tending to be driest. Through the period as a whole, warmer than average conditions are more probable away from the northwest, perhaps with some hotter spells to the southeast.\"\n\nSign up to our main daily newsletter here and get all the latest news straight to your inbox for FREE", "source": {"uri": "stokesentinel.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dave_knapper@stokesentinel.co.uk", "name": "Dave Knapper", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_of_Stoke-on-Trent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federation of Stoke-on-Trent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoke-on-Trent", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stoke-on-Trent"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stoke-on-Trent"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meteorologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drizzle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drizzle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_front", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Weather front"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.stokesentinel.co.uk/incoming/article9443475.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAS_STO_040421parks_026jpgc.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770948", "eventUri": "eng-9770948", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-02", "dateEnd": "2024-08-11", "textStart": 2142, "textEnd": 2162}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-12", "dateEnd": "2024-08-26", "textStart": 2937, "textEnd": 2958}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 1581, "textEnd": 1588}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

By 6pm, when the map's predictions stop, a high of 24C is still predicted in the city.\n\nThe glorious sunshine, however, is set to make way for some thunderstorms on Wednesday in some parts as the Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning. The East of England, London and the South East as well as South West England are all set to be hit from noon until late on Thursday. And on Thursday, East and West Midlands, North East and North West England, Wales and even more of the South West will be drawn into the heavy downpours from noon until midnight.\n\nThe forecaster said people can expect sudden flooding which could lead to difficult driving conditions and some road closures and there is a slight chance that power cuts could happen and other services to some homes and businesses could be lost.

The weather forecasters have predicted that over the next few days, some areas of Devon and the region could see the mercury rise to 29\u00b0.\n\nThe Met Office further stated that the criteria for a heatwave might be met as the week progresses with the rising temperatures. For an official heatwave to be declared, the temperature needs to reach between 25\u00b0-26\u00b0 for three consecutive days.\n\nIt is anticipated that the south west will experience temperatures above 26\u00b0 until Friday.\n\nRead more:\n\nExploding gas canisters ignited by huge blaze at garage - in pictures West Country man alerted to his car being driven 1,000 miles away\n\nAs the region braces for soaring temperatures, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has put out a yellow heat-health alert for the South West. This alert was activated yesterday morning and will remain in effect until Friday (August, 2) at 9am.\n\nIn the coming days, the south west is expected to endure extremely high temperatures, posing a potential risk to the most vulnerable. Warnings have been issued across all of England, excluding the North West and North East.\n\nThe UKHSA warning indicates that there is \"potential for significant impacts to be observed across the health and social care sector due to the high temperatures\". It also noted an \"observed increase in mortality across the population likely, particularly in the 65+ age group or those with health conditions, but impacts may also be seen in younger age groups\".\n\nThere could be a surge in demand for healthcare services, warns the UKHSA, as there's a risk of indoor environments overheating, posing a threat to vulnerable individuals.\n\nIn addition to the heat health alert, thunderstorm warnings are in place for Thursday (August 1) from midday until 11.59pm. Heavy showers and thunderstorms are anticipated to develop on Thursday, potentially causing some localised disruption.\n\nSouth West weather forecast\n\nToday: Any lingering mist will clear rapidly after dawn, paving the way for another fine, often sunny day that will quickly become very warm. It may be somewhat cloudier than yesterday with areas of higher level cloud at times, but it will still feel hot. Winds will be mostly light. Expect a maximum temperature of 30 C.\n\nTonight: The evening will remain particularly warm, followed by a generally dry night with clear periods. There's a small chance of a thundery shower later. It will be a warmer night for some, especially in urban areas. The minimum temperature will be 15 C.\n\nWednesday: Yet another mostly dry day is expected with variable amounts of cloud and hazy sunny periods. Thundery showers may break out, these are more likely in southern coastal regions. It will feel hot in the sunshine.

"The Met Office has said to expect the early part of this week to be hot, with temperatures reaching around 30C in London and an official heatwave possible by Tuesday.\n\nHowever, yellow weather warnings are in place for thunderstorms for much of the UK starting Thursday, which could bring surface water flooding and gusty conditions.\n\nYellow heat health warnings have also been issued across most of England by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA).\n\nAll areas of England, except the North East and North West have been included in the warning, which is in place until Wednesday.\n\nThe UKHSA warned that expected hot weather may have \"significant impacts\" on the health and social care sector across the South East and London, with minor impact elsewhere.\n\nMet Office spokesperson Nicola Maxey said plenty of sunshine was expected across England and Wales on Monday, with temperatures hitting mid to high 20s in many areas.\n\nShe said: \"We could see temperatures reaching around 30C in the London area and South East, while it will be a little bit cooler near the coast.\n\n\"Through the evening a weather front starts to push its way in to the far North West, but it weakens as it moves, bringing some cloud and light patches of rain over the highest ground further north in Scotland and north-west England.\"\n\nMs Maxey said Tuesday was expected to reach 30 to 31C with sunny dry days in the South East.\n\nShe added: \"As we move into the middle of the week we start to see an increasing risk of thunderstorms developing, particularly in parts of England and Wales, and the rain is such that it could cause some local disruption.\n\n\"This is the sort of rainfall that could cause surface water flooding and heavy rain that takes a while to clear away.\n\n\"There could also be some lightning potential for hail and gusty conditions.\"\n\nMost of southern England, the Midlands and much of the north of England are covered by the alert, which comes into force at 12am on Thursday and ends at 11.59pm.\n\nHeatwave thresholds could be met across some areas from tomorrow, but Ms Maxey said a change of weather type was expected with a return to cooler temperatures by next weekend.\n\nThe threshold is met when a location records at least three consecutive days with maximum temperatures exceeding a designated value, according to the Met Office.\n\nThis is 25C for most of the UK, but rises to 28C in London and its surrounding area, where temperatures are typically higher.\n\nThe hottest day of the year so far saw a temperature of 31.9C recorded at St James's Park in

Parts of western Scotland and Northern Ireland will have a more unsettled afternoon on Monday but elsewhere, heat will build in the coming days, with good amounts of sunshine for many.\n\nMet Office Chief Meteorologist Frank Saunders said: \"Much of the UK is entering a warm or even hot interlude of weather, with some places in England and Wales likely to meet heatwave criteria in the coming days. Temperatures are likely to peak at around 32C in southeast England on Tuesday and Wednesday, with much of the UK experiencing dry, fine and warm conditions in the first half of the week.\"\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency, which looks specifically at potential impacts on the health and social care sector, has issued a Yellow Heat Health Alert for parts of England.\n\nUV levels are likely to be high for many in the coming days. An official heatwave has occurred when a specific temperature threshold is met or exceeded for three consecutive days. The threshold varies by UK county.\n\nWhile warmth will remain for many on Wednesday, there's a chance of some thundery showers developing in southern areas for a time, before a more widely unsettled day on Thursday with some potentially impactful thunderstorms at times. A Met Office warning for thunderstorms has been issued from Thursday afternoon, highlighting potential disruption to travel, as well as the chance of some flooding where thundery outbreaks merge.\n\nMet Office Deputy Chief Meteorologist David Oliver said: \"There's a chance of some thundery showers across some southern areas of England on Wednesday, then on Thursday there is a signal for some potentially very heavy thunderstorms to develop. There are still details to confirm during this period, but in any event there is a chance of some impacts on each day, especially Thursday.\n\n\"The heaviest showers on Thursday could result in 20-30mm of rain within an hour, with daily totals possibly reaching as high as 90mm if multiple showers impact the same location. Lightning and hail present additional hazards, with disruption likely for some. This is a developing element of the forecast, so it's important to stay up-to-date with the latest outlook in the coming days.\"\n\nThursday's thundery breakdown heralds a shift to a more unsettled weather regime for the UK later in the week and into the weekend, with a westerly weather regime likely to bring outbreaks of rain at times, albeit with some drier interludes.", "source": {"uri": "bristolpost.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bristol Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "neil_shaw@bristolpost.co.uk", "name": "Neil Shaw", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Met Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Health_Security_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UK Health Security Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meteorologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_East_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South East England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_England", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Counties of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Pest_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Pest Control", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.bristolpost.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/article9443976.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1656821425.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770948", "eventUri": "eng-9770948", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

The Met Office forecast for Wales says that Monday will be \"generally fine and very warm during the next few days\".\n\nThe warm surge is down to a wave of high pressure across the country and warm air rising from the south, creating dry, fine and sunny conditions and bringing temperatures up.

All areas of England, except the north east and north west have been included in the warning, which is in place until Wednesday.\n\nThe UKHSA warned that expected hot weather may have \"significant impacts\" on the health and social care sector, particularly across the south east and London.\n\nThe Wales forecast for Monday says: \"Another very warm day with plenty of sunshine, though perhaps turning somewhat cloudier from the northwest through the afternoon, with the sunshine possibly becoming hazier as a result. Sea breezes developing, but winds remaining light in most areas. Maximum temperature 26 \u00b0C.\n\n\"Plenty of late-evening sunny spells before a calm night with some prolonged clear spells, where a few pockets of mist may form in the countryside.

London set to bask in 32C temperatures this week", "body": "London is set to bask in 32C temperatures this week, as forecasters predicted that a heatwave could sweep across the UK.\n\nThe Met Office has forecast \"very warm, locally hot weather\" for the capital in the coming days. Tuesday could be the hottest day of the year so far, as temperatures could reach 32C.\n\nThe forecaster has predicted continuous sunshine until Friday evening, with temperatures remaining in the high 20s throughout the week.\n\nThe warm surge is due to a wave of high pressure across the country and warm air rising from the south, creating dry, fine and sunny conditions and bringing temperatures up.\n\nSimon Partridge, a forecaster at the Met Office, said: \"There is certainly potential that it could become an actual official heatwave because in the spells you've had before it hasn't actually met all the criteria.\n\n\"If there's not, it's very close to it and if you're out and about and a member of the public then it's going to feel like a heatwave anyway, because also overnight things are going to turn a little bit more humid and muggy day on day as well.\"\n\nSo with what might well be a heatwave in the capital on the way, what is the technical definition?\n\nWhat is a heatwave?\n\nAn official UK heatwave takes place when a location records at least three consecutive days with daily maximum temperatures meeting or exceeding the heatwave temperature threshold.\n\nThis varies across the country and in London that temperature is 28C.\n\nWhat causes heatwaves?\n\nThe Met Office says heatwaves are primarily caused by prolonged high-pressure systems, also known as anticyclones. These systems create a dome of heat that traps warm air in a particular region. The high pressure suppresses cloud formation and precipitation, leading to clear skies and increased sunlight, which raise temperatures further.\n\nUK Weather: Summer Heatwave 2022\n\nAnother contributing factor is the position and strength of the jet stream. When this becomes weaker or shifts its usual path, it can lead to stagnant weather patterns, allowing the high-pressure system to remain over an area for an extended period.\n\nAdditionally, heatwaves can be exacerbated by the urban heat island effect, which makes cities hotter than surrounding areas due to human activities and built-up surfaces.\n\nDuring one of the UK's last heatwaves in July 2022, the country experienced record-breaking temperatures. Some areas exceeded 40C (104F) for the first time. This led to significant strain on health services, disruptions to travel and increased incidences of wildfires.\n\nHow does hot weather affect those who are working?\n\nWhile hot weather offers many opportunities for fun in the sun, it can also pose challenges for people trying to be productive.\n\nAs well as ensuring you have a fan, here are your rights when working in the heat.\n\nWhat is the legal maximum working temperature in the UK?\n\nThere is no legal maximum working temperature specified by law in the UK. However, employers have a legal duty to ensure their employees' health, safety and welfare at work, including managing the temperature in the workplace.\n\nWhat should employers do if it's too hot inside the office?\n\nEmployers in the UK have a legal duty under the Health and Safety at Work Act to ensure their employees' health, safety and welfare. This includes providing a comfortable working environment, particularly when temperatures are high. According to the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992, the temperature in all indoor workplaces should be reasonable during working hours.\n\nIf the office becomes too hot, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) advises employers to take action to reduce the temperature or mitigate its effects on employees. The Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw) and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) have advocated a legal maximum indoor temperature to provide clear guidelines for employers and workers on when action should be taken.\n\nUsdaw specifically recommends implementing cooling measures when the workplace temperature reaches 24C. This includes ensuring there is air conditioning, adequate ventilation and cooling drinks and breaks. The TUC underscores the importance of employers assessing risks associated with high temperatures and implementing necessary measures to manage or prevent these risks.\n\nUsdaw suggests opening windows, using fans, allowing more frequent breaks, relaxing dress codes and adjusting policies on face coverings. If these measures prove insufficient and the workplace remains uncomfortably hot, employers should consider whether employees can work in those conditions.\n\nCan you stop working if it gets too hot and work from home?\n\nIn the UK, if your working environment becomes unreasonably hot and poses a health risk, you have the right to stop working to protect yourself. This is based on the principle that employers must provide a safe working environment under the Health and Safety at Work Act.\n\nIf you cannot work from home or make adjustments to mitigate the heat, such as cooling measures, and you believe continuing to work would endanger your health, you are within your rights to cease work.\n\nIf your employer penalises you if you stop working due to excessive heat - such as by taking disciplinary action or reducing your pay - you can make a claim at an employment tribunal. The law protects employees from retaliation for raising health and safety concerns or refusing to work in unsafe conditions, including extreme heat that could harm their wellbeing.\n\nWhat are the recommendations for those working outside?\n\nWorking outdoors during very high temperatures can significantly strain the body. Usdaw says employers should ensure that outdoor workers have adequate sun and heat protection. This includes access to shade whenever possible to help workers cool down.\n\nAdditionally, employers should supply sun cream for skin protection, appropriate clothing to shield themselves from the sun's rays, and ample drinking water to prevent dehydration.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nBritain is set to sizzle in a scorching 32C heatwave on Tuesday, with the Met Office forecasting peak temperatures for London. Despite Monday's highs of 30C, the mercury will continue to rise, reaching 29C on Wednesday before cooling slightly to 24C by Friday.\n\nAs the nation prepares for the sweltering 32C heat on Tuesday, experts are warning against the use of fans during such extreme weather conditions. While it may seem like a sensible solution, fans can actually make the heat worse.\n\nThe design of British homes, with their heavy-duty bricks, insulation, double or triple glazing and thick roof tiles, is intended to retain heat. This can become problematic during a heatwave, especially as most UK homes do not have air conditioning.\n\nREAD MORE Brits set for the hottest day of the year today with 32C sizzler\n\nThe current heatwave is predicted to push temperatures up to 32C in some areas, although cooler weather is expected to return by Friday. Contrary to common belief, a fan is not the best solution in these circumstances. The Government's own heatwave plan states that electric fans are only effective in temperatures below 35C, and even then, they do not cool rooms down, reports the Express.\n\nWhile fans may provide temporary relief from the heat, they do not actually lower the room temperature; they simply circulate the air within it. This can create a misleading sense of coolness, which could lead people to believe they are cooler than they actually are. This false sense of security can result in heatstroke or dehydration.\n\nFor those seeking respite from the blistering heat, experts recommend an approach that combines ample ventilation with shading open as many windows as possible while keeping curtains and blinds drawn to block out the sun. It's also crucial to maintain a cool body temperature by staying hydrated and taking cold showers if necessary, all while minimising time spent in direct sunlight.\n\nThe government has released guidance noting: \"Climate change is already causing warmer temperatures in the UK. All of the warmest years on record in the UK have occurred since 2002, and in July 2022 temperatures exceeded 40C for the first time on record. It is estimated that 2,803 people aged 65 years and over died due to the heat in England in 2022, and it is predicted that the number of heat-related deaths per year may triple by 2050.\"\n\n\"Hot weather can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, lung problems and other diseases. Older people, babies and young children are more likely to be unwell from hot weather because their bodies are less able to regulate temperature. People with underlying medical conditions can also be vulnerable to the effects of hot weather.\"\n\n\"Many of the harms linked to heat exposure are preventable if a few simple actions are taken. During the summer, UKHSA will work with the Met Office to issue alerts alongside the weather forecast if the weather is so hot that it has the potential to affect people's health, and will help you to take steps to protect yourself and others.\"", "source": {"uri": "examinerlive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "huddersfieldexaminer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_evans@examinerlive.co.uk", "name": "Alex Evans", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "tom_kershaw@examinerlive.co.uk", "name": "Tom Kershaw", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roof_tiles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roof tiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_insulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thermal insulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extreme weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Met Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulated_glazing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insulated glazing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weather forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mercury (element)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Room temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dehydration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoregulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thermoregulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(architecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ventilation (architecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hydrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myocardial infarction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunlight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Cleaning_and_Stains", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Cleaning and Stains", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Plumbing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Plumbing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://i2-prod.examinerlive.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/article29646858.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_summer-sunshine-in-the-city-of-bath-spa-somerset-england.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770948", "eventUri": "eng-9770948", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nThe UK faces its FINAL 30C day of the summer next month - with the exact date predicted. WX Charts, which uses Met Desk data, shows the forecast for the eighth month of the year and it appears the UK could bask in 30C heat one final time.\n\nAfter low temperatures throughout June and July, the UK now faces a three day 32C heatwave. It could trigger further heat in August with the dates for skyrocketing temperatures and stifling conditons revealed by WX Charts in its maps and charts.\n\nLondon, Luton, Southampton, Worcester, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Cardiff, Stoke, and Liverpool could experience highs 30C-31C on August 13. Discussing this week's weather forecast, James Madden, from Exacta Weather, said: \"Temperatures may have fallen just short of hitting 30\u00b0C today, with some of the hottest parts of the country exceeding a hot 29\u00b0C.\n\nREAD MORE Foreign Office warns over Greek 'cultural difference' that'll get Brits arrested\n\n\"However, tomorrow should go that step further and produce even hotter maximum temperatures of at least 32-35\u00b0C under the strength of the strong summer sunshine, plus with hot to very hot conditions elsewhere.\"\n\nHe said: \"A few days ago, when our forecast for hot weather was still in question for this period, the BBC and Met Office weather apps were only indicating maximum temperatures of just 24\u00b0C (over 5\u00b0C out from in reality temperatures throughout today!).\"\n\nThe Met Office forecast for August 4 to August 13 explains: \"Low pressure is likely to broadly remain close to northwest Scotland through much of this period, with occasional spells of rain spreading southeastwards across the UK, perhaps somewhat erratically due to frontal waves slowing its progress while also occasionally pepping the rain up in places.\n\n\"Between these periods of rain, occasional ridging into southern areas will provide some dry and bright conditions, with showers likely continuing in the northwest where it may also be rather breezy or windy at times. Temperatures overall are likely to be close to or just slightly below the average for early August, however there is the chance of some rather warm conditions developing in parts of the south and east periodically.\"", "source": {"uri": "birminghammail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Birmingham Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_rodger@birminghammail.co.uk", "name": "James Rodger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcester,_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Worcester, England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign,_Commonwealth_and_Development_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Met Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luton", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Luton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southampton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southampton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoke-on-Trent", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stoke-on-Trent"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stoke-on-Trent"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Plumbing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Plumbing", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/article29642939.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_heatwave6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770948", "eventUri": "eng-9770948", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "dateEnd": "2024-08-13", "textStart": 1583, "textEnd": 1604}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-13", "textStart": 765, "textEnd": 774}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

Early predictions show a blast of hot weather sweeping the country around August 14 in a major blast.\n\nThe eighth month of the year will see the mercury skyrocket in a major boost to Brits who have felt starved of pleasant weather so far in the summer. But not everywhere will be hit by the balmy conditions, which could rise to the high 20s and even 30C mark.\n\nMaps and charts from WX Charts show temperatures won't hit dizzying heights in the north west of England, or Scotland or Ireland either. Other places set to miss out include Greater Manchester, the North East of England- including major cities like Manchester and Newcastle.\n\nREAD MORE Foreign Office warns over Greek 'cultural difference' that'll get Brits arrested\n\nYorkshire including Leeds could also miss out. It comes as high pressure is the dominant force for the UK's weather at present, though parts of western Scotland and Northern Ireland will have a more unsettled afternoon on Monday.\n\nElsewhere, heat will build in the coming days, with good amounts of sunshine for many. The early Met Office forecast for August 3 to August 17 explains: \"No single weather type is expected to dominate through this period.\n\n\"Periods of dry, settled weather will probably alternate with some wetter, cloudier interludes at times. The wettest conditions will likely be in the northwest, with the southeast tending to be driest. Through the period as a whole, warmer than average conditions are most likely, perhaps with some hot spells in the southeast.\"\n\nIn the short-term, any early morning mist \"will soon clear, leaving much of England and Wales dry with lots of very warm or hot sunshine\" today, the Met Office said.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nEVERY date a heatwave could roast the UK in August has been revealed. The current charts and maps from WX Charts shows that the mercury levels could hit a heatwave threshold on August 1, 2, and 10 during the eighth month of the year.\n\nWX Charts uses Met Desk data and projects daily weather maps and charts. It comes as the country faces a UK heatwave in the coming days with the mercury skyrocketing to 32C - the new hottest day of the year - on Tuesday July 30.\n\nIn August, everywhere from the south of England to the east, including capital city London, could swelter in highs in the mid-to-high 20s as well as the Midlands and beyond. James Madden from Exacta Weather said: \"Temperatures could still reach as high as the mid- to high 20s in parts of the northern half of the country in this developing period, and 30\u00b0C or more still can't be ruled out in certain parts.\n\nREAD MORE Foreign Office warns UK tourists who AREN'T staying in 'large hotels' on holiday\n\n\"However, parts of the southern half of the country and particularly parts of central and southern England could see the hottest temperatures extending into the mid- to high 30s (extreme) at the peak of this from the mid- to end of the next working week. Overnight temperatures will also struggle to go below or even stay above 20\u00b0C in places within this period.\n\n\"After this next period of major heat and from later next week, it is becoming more favourable for a brief run of somewhat cooler and more unsettled conditions prior to the next heat surge for in and around August 10 (10-15). This projected unsettled period is something that requires further analysis over the coming days and isn't something I completely trust due to an underestimation of the current strength of the jet stream and high pressure intensification across our shores for this period.\n\n\"However, there are some repeated indicators for this scenario to occur or have some kind of influence that simply can't be discarded as of yet and is something I have been caught out with before within my old forecasts, hence a bit of caution from myself. Again, a few more days of analysis are required, and I feel this less favourable weather scenario will become somewhat more diluted as the major high pressure build begins and intensifies across our shores from this weekend and into next week.\n\n\"However, we must take nothing away from the types of hot to extreme temperatures that we can now fully expect to develop over the next 5-6 days at the very least, as it's going to get very hot for many and much hotter than the current app and TV forecasts, which are now rising on cue day by day.\"", "source": {"uri": "birminghammail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Birmingham Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_rodger@birminghammail.co.uk", "name": "James Rodger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mercury (element)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_map", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weather map"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign,_Commonwealth_and_Development_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midlands", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midlands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jet stream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Plumbing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Plumbing", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/article29632525.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_heatwave7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770948", "eventUri": "eng-9770948", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 321, "textEnd": 329}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 599, "textEnd": 606}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-10", "textStart": 1684, "textEnd": 1693}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

after weeks of an extraordinarily disappointing summer.\n\nBut for those over 65, the warm weather can be hard to cope with, especially in a country where air conditioning is scarce.\n\nThe Government is preparing for a spike in heat-related deaths, as bodies must work harder to stay at a safe temperature, making heart attacks and strokes more likely.\n\nThis effect begins to kick in above 25\u00b0C or 26\u00b0C, with around 2,000 deaths in hot weather each year on average in England.\n\nYellow alerts for 'significant impacts' from heat are in place for London, the South East, South West, East of England, West Midlands, East Midlands, and Yorkshire and The Humber.\n\nGreen alerts for minor impacts are in place for the North East and North West.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency warned of the yellow areas: 'Significant impacts are possible across the health and social care sector due to the high temperatures.'\n\nIncreased deaths are 'likely', they said, particularly for the elderly and for those with health conditions, 'but impacts may also be seen in younger age groups'.\n\nThere would likely be increased demand for remote healthcare services, while temperatures in hospitals and care homes could go above the threshold recommended in clinical risk assessments.\n\nMany indoor areas are likely to 'overheat' making it more difficult for people to work.\n\nThis could lead 'to increased risk to vulnerable people living independently in the community as well as in care settings'.\n\nIf you have family, friends or neighbours who are isolated or may be at an increased

Without water, young trees can't survive a heatwave, making our efforts fruitless. A tree without water is like a lung without air.\"\n\nMillions of saplings have been planted by councils in recent years under schemes designed to improve air quality and reduce emissions. But reports suggest many of the trees are not adequately cared for, with thousands dying off in the months after planting.\n\nIn one scheme, Wyre Council reported that 6,000 young trees that were planted on a disused tip site in the council control died during the \"exceptional heat\" in 2022.\n\nExperts say a survival rate of 90-95 per cent should be expected if tree-planting schemes are well planned and have adequate aftercare.\n\nMet Office chief meteorologist Paul Gundersen said: \"The warm or even hot weather is continuing for many, with some places in England and Wales likely to meet heatwave criteria in the coming days.\n\n\"Temperatures are likely to peak at around 32\u00b0C in south-east England on Tuesday and Wednesday, with much of the UK experiencing dry, fine and warm conditions in the first half of the week.\n\n\"There is a chance of some thundery outbreaks for some in the South and East from later on Wednesday, which will be the first signs of the UK's transition to a more unsettled regime, with warnings issued to highlight potential impacts.\"\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued yellow heat health warnings for all areas of England, except the North East and North West, until Friday.\n\nIt warned that expected hot weather may have a \"significant impact\" on the health and social care sector across the South East and London, with minor effects elsewhere.\n\nA heatwave is officially declared when there have been three consecutive days around a specific temperature, which is between 28\u00b0C in London down to 25\u00b0C in the north

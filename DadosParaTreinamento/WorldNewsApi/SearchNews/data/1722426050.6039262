And they didn\u2019t stop there. After using a six-run rally to take the lead in the sixth, the Yankees blew the doors off with a seven-run ninth inning to snap their season-high four-game losing streak in emphatic fashion with a 16-5 win over the Blue Jays at Rogers Centre. Putting together the kind of full-lineup outburst that they sorely needed, the Yankees (53-31) won for just the third time in their last 12 games to even the series entering the weekend. Every member of the starting lineup recorded at least one hit and six of them had multi-hit nights as the Yankees pounded out 18 hits in total. Some frustration had begun to boil over in the bottom of the fifth, when the Blue Jays (37-44) broke a 1-1 tie to take a 3-1 lead thanks in part to Vladimir Guerrero Jr. beating out a double play that infuriated Marcus Stroman. The right-hander appeared to be upset with Gleyber Torres, whose throw to first was too late on what would have been a tough twin killing, as the go-ahead run scored from third base on the play. But in the top of the sixth, the Yankees had an immediate response. No. 9 hitter and DH Jahmai Jones, who enjoyed a three-hit night, led off the inning with a single before Anthony Volpe dropped down a perfect bunt single. Juan Soto then got the green light on 3-0 against left-hander Yusei Kikuchi and clobbered a fastball into the right-field seats to put the Yankees ahead 4-3 \u2014 their first lead since Saturday. That chased Kikuchi from the game and then the Yankees piled on against righty reliever Nate Pearson. Aaron Judge ripped a bullet off the left-field wall for a single, which J.D. Davis followed with his first hit as a Yankee, an RBI double to the gap to make it 5-3. Torres, who sat out the last two games for a \u201creset\u201d and entered the inning 2-for his last-31, turned on an inside fastball for a two-run shot that pushed the lead to 7-3. The Blue Jays got within 7-5 on home runs by Isiah Kiner-Falefa and Guerrero, but the Yankees created more breathing room late. Alex Verdugo, who entered the eighth inning 4-for his last-41, drilled an RBI double and DJ LeMahieu added his first extra-base hit of the season, another RBI double that made it 9-5. For the second straight night and third time in their last four games, the Yankees fell behind in the first inning. Stroman got himself in trouble by walking leadoff man Bo Bichette, which came back to hurt two outs later when Justin Turner and George Springer shot back-to-back singles through the infield, putting the Blue Jays up 1-0. The Yankees came back to tie it in the fourth, thanks to some heady baserunning by Judge and Soto. Judge was on first and Soto on second with one out when Davis hit a chopper to second baseman Spencer Horwitz. Judge stopped in his tracks, then took a few steps back toward first, at which point Horwitz just threw to first to get Davis. Guerrero then ran Judge halfway back to second, which allowed Soto to break for home and dive in safely ahead of the throw.", "summary": "Nearly a week\u2019s worth of frustration came pouring out of the Yankees\u2019 bats in the sixth inning Friday night.

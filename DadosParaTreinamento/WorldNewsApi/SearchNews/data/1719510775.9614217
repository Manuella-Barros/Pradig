{"id": 223679516, "title": "Opinion: Finding meaning and hope on Memorial Day", "text": "Like many Americans, I put far too little thought into the meaning of Memorial Day. For most of my life, I\u2019ve spent the day with friends at beaches and pools, anticipating the rest of summer. But this year, I\u2019m committing to change. Amid alarming assaults on our democratic traditions and values, honoring Americans who sacrificed their lives feels more urgent. The more depressing and disorienting the news, the more I feel the need to show my appreciation for those who stood up to threats against our democracy. Thanks to a family research project, I\u2019ve discovered that finding personal connections to history can make that appreciation more meaningful. For me, the link came from a remarkable but little-known abolitionist Quaker from Philadelphia. Norwood Penrose Hallowell, or \u201cPen,\u201d as he was known, was the son of Morris Longstreth Hallowell, a prominent Philadelphia businessman, an acquaintance of Abraham Lincoln, and, as I\u2019ve recently learned, a distant kinsman of mine. Pen\u2019s story is not unknown to historians. His friendship with fellow Harvard classmate and Union veteran Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. (who would become a Supreme Court justice) featured prominently in The Metaphysical Club. And his letters, speeches and papers are maintained by the Massachusetts Historical Society. But he\u2019s far from a household name. Pen\u2019s service in the Civil War alone makes that hard to believe. At Ball\u2019s Bluff, an early disaster for the Union, he swam across the Potomac and constructed a makeshift raft to rescue wounded men in Confederate territory. After being seriously wounded at Antietam, where he witnessed the staggering loss of life, he returned to the battlefield to serve as lieutenant colonel of the first all-black regiment and later as colonel of the second. Even after the war, Pen never gave up the fight. In the face of efforts to rewrite history and roll back racial progress, he forcefully supported racial equality and paid tributes to Black soldiers in speeches, articles and even a book. His Memorial Day address in 1896, before Harvard\u2019s graduating class commemorating Memorial Hall, was typical of his post-war rhetoric. At the time, the Lost Cause ideology\u2014which sought to distort the history and meaning of the Civil War\u2014was gaining traction even in the North. Indeed, another prominent Ivy League institution would soon erect a Civil War memorial honoring both sides. As historian David Blight recounts in his new book, \u201cYale and Slavery, A History\u201d, Yale\u2019s monument was part of \u201cAmerica\u2019s tragedy of Civil War memory that exalted the martial virtues of soldiers but did not face the reasons and consequences for they fought.\u201d Pen resisted attempts to whitewash history, arguing Harvard\u2019s Memorial Hall should stand for those who fought for liberty, not slavery. Emphasizing the need for mental and moral clarity, he warned against equating the convictions held on both sides, noting that not all convictions are equal. After all, slavery and polygamy were convictions, he noted. \u201cWar, horrid war, waged for its own sake is ignoble,\u201d he noted. \u201cBut when waged in defense of convictions which deserve to prevail then indeed may war be glorified and sanctified by the sufferings and lives of its victims.\u201d Learning more about Pen has reminded me that during our current democratic crisis\u2014with attempts to deny or downplay January 6 and to spread lies about election results\u2014the American experiment is never finished. It has also reminded me of the mental and moral clarity required by regular Americans to carry out the radical ideas that our democracy was founded upon. \u201cHe despised cowardice and had the faith that conquers fear and the courage that comes with true faith, enabling him to do his duty under all circumstances,\u201d wrote a fellow Union commander in a tribute to Pen after he died in 1914.

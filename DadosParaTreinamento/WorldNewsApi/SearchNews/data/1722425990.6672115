San Diego Superior Court Judge Daniel Goldstein said that after presiding for years over the first-of-its-kind case alleging an antifa conspiracy, he was left with no doubt as to the existence of antifa as an organization. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s as structured as a criminal cartel,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cI think it pops up fairly fast \u2026 But it does appear they have funding, and they have an ability to make contact and morph into other things very quickly, in many different jurisdictions.\u201d The judge did not say what kind of funding he believes the group has. Extremism experts consider antifa to be a leaderless group of like-minded, left-wing activists. A 2020 Congressional Research Service report described the U.S. antifa movement as \u201cdecentralized, consisting of independent, radical, like-minded groups and individuals\u201d who often \u201cecho the principles of anarchism, socialism, and communism\u201d and among other things \u201cmay also support environmentalism, the rights of indigenous populations, and gay rights.\u201d But Goldstein said that on Jan. 9, 2021, in Pacific Beach, antifa members \u201csought to crush, through the use of violence, the First Amendment rights of others.\u201d On that day, supporters of then-outgoing President Donald Trump held a \u201cPatriot March\u201d in the coastal neighborhood, some of them falsely claiming that the 2020 presidential election had been stolen. Other rallygoers that day were members of the \u201cProud Boys,\u201d an organization the Southern Poverty Law Center has designated a hate group and the Anti-Defamation League has designated a right-wing extremist group. At least five people present in Pacific Beach had been at the storming of the U.S. Capitol three days earlier. Goldstein said none of that mattered. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt for any minute that the Trump supporters were offensive to the defendants and actually others in Pacific Beach that day,\u201d the judge said. \u201cBut that\u2019s the nature of political speech. That does not mean that individuals with offensive speech cannot assemble, congregate and protest.\u201d Though reporters and bystanders also documented violence committed by the pro-Trump rallygoers \u2014 one video showed a group attacking a barefoot man in a George Floyd T-shirt, including one man who spit on him and sucker punched him \u2014 the District Attorney\u2019s Office has maintained that most of the violence was carried out by the left-wing counterprotesters. The judge said it\u2019s natural for individuals to have ideological differences, but \u201cyou can\u2019t resort to physical violence when you believe the other team is wrong.\u201d Despite the judge\u2019s harsh criticism of the defendants\u2019 actions, he handed out relatively light punishments Friday. The longest custody sentences were given to Jeremy Jonathan White and Brian Cortez Lightfoot Jr., the two defendants who took their cases to trial in April. The judge sentenced both White, 41, and Lightfoot, 27, to two-year prison terms that they\u2019ll be able to serve in county jail. Later in the hearing, after sentencing a different defendant, the judge said he would have given White a longer sentence, if possible. Goldstein said that White, who was convicted by the jury on one count of conspiracy to riot, was a \u201cringleader\u201d of the group unlike many of the other defendants who joined because they were followers who were looking to fit in. White\u2019s attorney told reporters in May after the verdict was read that White intends to appeal his conviction. \u201cIf Mr. White was the brains, Mr. Lightfoot was the fist,\u201d Deputy District Attorney William Hopkins told the judge Friday. Lightfoot faced up to five years and four months in prison after the jury convicted him on one count of conspiracy to riot and five counts of use of tear gas not in self-defense. The jury was hung on nine counts of assault. Goldstein said the probation department recommended a maximum prison term for Lightfoot. \u201cBut \u2026 unlike Mr. White, you\u2019re expressing remorse,\u201d the judge told him in handing down the two-year sentence. Lightfoot\u2019s attorney said his client has been training to become a wildland firefighter. Goldstein said he would recommend that Lightfoot be able to serve part of his term in one of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation\u2019s conservation camps, where inmates learn firefighting skills and help battle wildfires, though the judge acknowledged his sentence was likely not long enough to qualify for such a camp. The six other defendants who were sentenced Friday had pleaded guilty to various charges, some of them nearly two years ago. The judge sentenced each of them to what is technically probation, though as a term of their probation they each must serve custody terms in county jail. He sentenced Alexander Akridgejacobs, 33, to 270 days in custody; Joseph Austin Gaskins, 23, to one year; Ruchelle Ogden, 26, who was previously known as Samuel Howard Ogden, to one year; Bryan Rivera, 22, to 180 days; Faraz Martin Talab, 29, to one year; and Christian Martinez, 25, to 180 days. Goldstein previously sentenced Jesse Merel Cannon to five years in prison and Nikki Yach, previously known as Erich Louis Yach, to four years and eight months in prison. Goldstein said Friday that Cannon and Yach, like White, were leaders of the group. The final defendant, Luis Francisco Mora, pleaded guilty shortly before he was set to go to trial with White and Lightfoot. He agreed to a sentence of two years and eight months in his plea agreement.", "summary": "A San Diego judge said that on Jan. 9, 2021, in Pacific Beach, antifa members \"sought to crush, through the use of violence, the First Amendment rights of others\" during a pro-Trump rally", "url": "https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2024/06/28/san-diego-judge-sentences-8-defendants-in-pacific-beach-antifa-conspiracy-case/", "image": "https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SUT-L-684903-trump-protest-ncc-014.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:09:10", "author": "Alex Riggins", "authors": ["Alex Riggins"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.015}

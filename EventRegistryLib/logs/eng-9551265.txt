We still spoke on the phone and FaceTimed a little bit, but there were no more visits. Eventually, the phone calls petered out, and I stopped hearing from him entirely. I was heartbroken. In May of 2017, I was in Vegas filming when I got a call. It was a weirdly cold night for Vegas in the spring, and I shivered when I answered It was a nurse from the hospital in Chico calling to tell me that my dad was dying.\"", "source": {"uri": "intouchweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "In Touch Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_hammer@intouchweekly.com", "name": "Mike Hammer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Darwish", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiffany Darwish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Haddish", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiffany Haddish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_&_Co.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiffany & Co."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chico_Marx", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chico Marx"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tiffany-haddish-book-revelations-from-i-curse-you-with-joy.jpg?crop=0px%2C44px%2C3000px%2C1576px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551265", "eventUri": "eng-9551265", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Tiffany Self and Anthony Self have been charged with three counts of Manufacture and Delivery of a Controlled Substance. Additionally, Anthony has been charged with Aggravated Assault Causing Serious Bodily Injury.\n\nAccording to an Odessa Police Department report, around 5:15 a.m. on May 3, officers were called to Odessa Regional Medical Center's emergency room to investigate after a woman, later identified as Tiffany, visited the hospital for treatment from a gunshot wound. Investigators said Tiffany was seriously injured but was also uncooperative with them as they tried to question her about her injuries.\n\nInvestigators said they knew that Tiffany often stays at Odessa Motor Inn, located at 2021 E 2 Street, so they visited the motel to try and find out what happened. At the scene, they said they found a blood trail leading to a particular motel room. There, officers made contact with Tiffany's husband, identified as Anthony. Anthony told investigators that he and Tiffany heard a knock on the door earlier that morning and, upon answering the door, an unknown man shot Tiffany and left the scene.\n\nInside the couple's motel room, officers said they found a spent cartridge case and more blood; in a dumpster just outside the motel room, investigators said they found several firearms, a jail bond receipt bearing the names Tiffany and Anthony, as well as a \"large amount\" of ecstasy tablets and methamphetamine.\n\nInvestigators then obtained a search warrant for the couple's motel room, which led to the seizure of drug paraphernalia, more than three pounds (1467 grams) of ecstasy, 10.5 grams of methamphetamines, and 92 grams of cocaine, along with multiple scales and baggies typically used to distribute narcotics.\n\nFollowing the execution of that search warrant, officers interviewed Anthony again. In that interview, Anthony said that he thought he heard someone trying to break into his motel room, so he grabbed a gun, but then tripped and shot his wife in the arm. While Tiffany again refused to speak with the police, Anthony allegedly admitted to selling illicit drugs out of the motel room.\n\nBoth Tiffany and Anthony were arrested and taken to the Ector County Law Enforcement Center where they remained as of Monday morning. Bond for Tiffany has been set at a combined $75,000, while Anthony faces a combined $125,000 bond and a US Marshal hold.", "source": {"uri": "yourbasin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yourbasin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odessa,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Odessa, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Odessa, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPEJ-TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KPEJ-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KMID_(TV)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KMID (TV)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emergency department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illegal drug trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Methamphetamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MDMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seizure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seizure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marshals_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Marshals Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Weighing scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Search warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_paraphernalia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drug paraphernalia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ector_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ector County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ector County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Investigators", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Investigators", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 9}], "image": "https://www.yourbasin.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/78/2023/12/arrest-2-2-1.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551265", "eventUri": "eng-9551265", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 521, "textEnd": 526}], "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

{"id": 239753846, "title": "Review: Freewill Shakespeare Festival's The Tempest brings wonder outdoors", "text": "Ardern and O\u2019Donnell deliver their lines with clarity and conviction while they stumble about the stage, getting progressively more inebriated as the play moves along. By the end, the pair are a mess, and their drunken antics had the entire audience in stitches. Brett Dahl slinks and slithers around the stage with just enough sliminess to sell his monstrous form, but joins in on the clowning to form one of the funniest trios on an outdoor hockey rink stage. The set design for The Tempest is sparse bordering on paltry. A large scaffolding draped in green netting stands in for the island, with a few bales of plastic as adornment. The minimalist set makes sense for a show that will have four different homes over the course of a month, durable enough to stand up to multiple moves and versatile enough to fit in different locations. But it would have been nice to see just a touch more \u2026 something. Where the summer colours truly pop are the wonderful and varied props and costume design, the splashes of colour and material standing out brilliantly against the covered scaffolding. Whether it\u2019s giant spirit masks of flowing plastic or the terrifying angler scaring the island\u2019s unwanted guests, the props bring wonder and amazement to the outdoor show.", "summary": "Edmonton's Freewill Shakespeare delights in their latest offering, making its way to a community league near you", "url": "https://edmontonjournal.com/entertainment/review-freewill-shakespeare-festivals-the-tempest-edmonton", "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/edmontonjournal/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/fw_tempest_bjang32.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 00:55:03", "author": "Justin Bell", "authors": ["Justin Bell"], "language": "en", "source_country": "CA", "sentiment": 0.757}

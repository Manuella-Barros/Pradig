{"id": 223714402, "title": "Sergio P\u00e9rez Crashes Out of 2024 F1 Monaco Grand Prix on 1st Lap in Scary Video", "text": "It was a 2024 Monaco Grand Prix to forget for Sergio P\u00e9rez. An opening-lap wreck ended the Red Bull driver's day. It wasn't just him, as Haas drivers Kevin Magnussen and Nico Hulkenberg were also eliminated from Sunday's race because of the crash. Magnussen and Perez made contact, which sent the latter into the wall and created a chaotic scene that Hulkenberg was unable to escape. While there was a lengthy suspension for the race on a red flag, none of the three drivers were able to participate upon the reset. That wasn't the only incident on the opening lap, as Ferrari's Carlos Sainz went off because of a front-left tire puncture. However, he was able to restart in third place given the timing of the red flag for the crash involving P\u00e9rez. What's more, Alpine teammates Pierre Gasly and Esteban Ocon collided. The latter was unable to continue in the race. As for the crash involving P\u00e9rez and the Haas drivers, ESPN's Nate Saunders noted there was a bit of controversy in the stewards' decision that there would be no further investigation into the incident. The decision was notable since Magnussen is just two penalty points away from a one-race ban. P\u00e9rez's elimination was the most important development, as he is in third place in the drivers standings with 107 points. While he is well behind teammate Max Verstappen's 161 points, he entered Sunday's race just six points behind Ferrari's Charles LeClerc for second. Red Bull also leads the constructor standings over Ferrari by 56 points but may see that gap close without one of its two drivers. P\u00e9rez was coming off an eighth-place finish at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix and crashed out of Sunday's race, so he will be firmly under the spotlight as he looks to bounce back in the Canadian Grand Prix on June 9.", "summary": "It was a 2024 Monaco Grand Prix to forget for Sergio P\u00e9rez.

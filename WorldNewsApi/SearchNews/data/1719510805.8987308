{"id": 223686074, "title": "Nicki Minaj fans criticise \u2018absolutely ridiculous\u2019 short notice axing of gig", "text": "Fans of Nicki Minaj have said cancelling her gig at Manchester\u2019s Co-op Live at short notice was \u201cabsolutely ridiculous\u201d following her arrest. The rapper and singer, 41, was detained at Amsterdam\u2019s Schiphol Airport on Saturday and says she spent around six hours in custody before leaving the Netherlands for the UK. Fans were let into the Co-op Live Arena for her show at around 7pm on Saturday, before the promoter Live Nation announced at around 9.40pm that it would be postponed. Alvin Christie told the PA news agency he was waiting from 9am to attend the concert. The 29-year-old, from Liverpool, did not blame Minaj and says fans want her to be \u201cin a good place\u201d and \u201cwere just more concerned that she was okay\u201d. He said: \u201cI would say it was very poorly managed. When we arrived into the event, they were actively telling fans that she had arrived and that everyone was going to dance tonight. \u201cFor a lot of people that were asking those questions, that\u2019s obviously (keeping) people\u2019s hopes up. I understand that maybe they wanted to get people into the arena for health and safety risks to stop people being outside. \u201cBut I think most importantly, they maybe could have advised people as soon as they\u2019ve known that the show was postponed and we should be turned away when we\u2019re outside the arena, rather than holding loads of people in the arena.\u201d Eileen Allardyce, 32, a hotel manager from Edinburgh, spent around \u00a32,500 on tickets, travel and hotel costs and says she will not be able to make a rescheduled date. Ms Allardyce said that since Co-op Live announced its first delay in April to an event, where comedian Peter Kay was due to perform, she has been \u201con eggshells\u201d along with her friends who also had tickets for Minaj. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s not Co-op\u2019s fault what happened in Amsterdam, and it\u2019s not Nicki\u2019s fault either, like, obviously, no blame for her at all,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as I say, I just feel like the way they (the venue) handled it was just absolutely ridiculous. They have no clue, absolutely no clue. I don\u2019t think they were prepared for anything, to be honest.\u201d She and Mr Christie also claimed there were no toilets outside the arena for fans to use while queuing, and felt more facilities are needed at the new venue. Mr Christie, who went to the hotel in the city centre where Minaj addressed disappointed fans, contrasted his experience at Co-op Live with Manchester\u2019s AO Arena, where he said there are \u201cgeneral public facilities and coffee shops\u201d. In a message on social media site X, Minaj said she had arrived at her hotel in Manchester early on Sunday after spending \u201c5-6 hours\u201d in a cell and a delay to her flight from Amsterdam. Minaj invited her fans, known as Barbz, to her hotel in the centre of the city and according to videos on social media she then spoke to the crowds outside. She told them: \u201cI wanted to honestly tell you that I love you.\u201d On X, she wrote the venue was \u201cwilling to go past 11pm\u201d, and she pointed the finger at unidentified figures who she said had \u201csucceeded at their plan to not let me get on that stage tonight\u201d. She said a new date for the show would be announced on Sunday. She wrote: \u201cOne July option & one June option is currently being discussed. \u201cI\u2019ll find a way to not only make up the date with the performance but I\u2019m going to create an added bonus for everyone that had a (ticket) for this show. Promise.\u201d Minaj said she will continue with her other scheduled shows, including in Birmingham on Sunday and a second night at the Co-op Live Arena on Thursday. A statement from Live Nation said on Saturday: \u201cDespite Nicki\u2019s best efforts to explore every possible avenue to make tonight\u2019s show happen, the events of today have made it impossible. \u201cWe are deeply disappointed by the inconvenience this has caused.\u201d Trinidad-born Minaj, who grew up in the US and is known for the songs Starships, Super Bass and Anaconda, livestreamed being arrested and claimed that drugs were found in her luggage, which did not belong to her. Dutch police said a woman, 41, was arrested on Saturday after allegedly trying to take what it described as \u201csoft drugs\u201d from Schiphol Airport to another country. An update from the force at around 9pm said it had released the \u201csuspect and she can now move on\u201d after paying a fine. This is the latest postponed gig at Co-op Live Arena, which has been plagued by issues since trying to open in April, and having to reschedule its first official gig several times. US rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie moved his performance to rival AO Arena over the delays, and Co-op Live began having live music shows from May 14, when British rock band Elbow took to the stage. Co-op Live, Minaj and Live Nation have all been contacted for additional comment.", "summary": "Fans were let into the Co-op Live arena for her show but were later told it had been cancelled.", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/music/nicki-minaj-fans-live-nation-schiphol-airport-liverpool-b1160308.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/05/26/12/727bc202aa1dcd7839e7b2c2e00b271fY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE2ODA5NTc0-2.67847092.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:55:39", "author": "Charlotte McLaughlin", "authors": ["Charlotte McLaughlin"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.488}

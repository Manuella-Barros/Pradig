{"id": 225039258, "title": "Colombia lawmakers pass bullfighting ban", "text": "Colombia\u2019s Congress has passed legislation banning bullfighting. Lawmakers passed the bill 93-2 on Tuesday. Activists have spent many years seeking to prohibit the controversial blood sport, which is a centuries-old colonial tradition in the country. The ban will be phased in over a three-year period, during which the state would be required to help find alternative employment options for the tens of thousands of people directly or indirectly dependent on the sector. Reporting from Bogota, Al Jazeera\u2019s Alessandro Rampietti said the bill had been greenlighted after \u201cyears of strenuous political battles\u201d. The once popular tradition, introduced by Spanish colonisers, had been \u201closing fans in recent years\u201d and had turned into a \u201cpastime for a small elite\u201d, he said. Juan Carlos Losada, a lawmaker with the Liberal Party, told Al Jazeera that the ban would enable the country to re-evaluate the \u201cculture of violence\u201d it had inherited. \u201cThe next generations will grow up in a country where culture will define things much more creatively than torturing animals for the amusement of a few insensitive people,\u201d he said. However, bullfighting aficionados described the ban as an assault on the freedoms of minorities, as well as a problem for cities where these events draw thousands of visitors. Matador Johan Andres Paloma said his calling was \u201ca symbol of identity\u201d for many Colombians. Bullfighting was once a popular event in Colombia, broadcast live by multiple television networks. But the tradition has come under increased scrutiny as views change about animal welfare, and many find it unacceptable to see an animal suffer for entertainment\u2019s sake. In 2018, the Constitutional Court recognised bullfights as part of Colombia\u2019s cultural tradition. But the capital Bogota \u2013 one of the oldest bullfighting cities in the Americas \u2013 has since outlawed the injuring or killing of bulls. The city of Medellin also imposed restrictions. Still, the practice remains popular in cities like Cali and Manizales. According to Paloma, some 300 events are held annually at about 70 locations in Colombia. Bullfighting originated in the Iberian Peninsula and is still legal in seven other countries \u2013 Ecuador, France, Mexico, Peru, Portugal, Spain and Venezuela. Other countries in the region, including Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Guatemala, have banned the blood sport.", "summary": "Blood sport a \u2018symbol of identity\u2019 for many, but was losing spectators in recent years amid animal welfare concerns.", "url": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/29/colombia-lawmakers-pass-bullfighting-ban?traffic_source=rss", "image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24128730962387-1716980259.jpg?resize=1200%2C675", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:20:16", "author": "Al Jazeera,Apps Support", "authors": ["Al Jazeera", "Apps Support"], "language": "en", "source_country": "QA", "sentiment": -0.162}

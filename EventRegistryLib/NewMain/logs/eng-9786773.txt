SPOILERS about Mayor of Kingstown season 3, episode 10 ahead.\n\nSummary Milo's quip in Mayor of Kingstown season 3's finale showcased he perfectly knew what was Mike's character flaw. Mike's struggles with women that forced him into the role of protector were highlighted before Mayor of Kingstown season 3. Mayor of Kingstown season 3's finale also highlights Mike's growth and acknowledgment of past mistakes in his question to Iris so that she could choose what to do between staying and killing Konstantin or running away.\n\nThe season 3 finale of Mayor of Kingstown included various killer sentences worthy of being remembered, but one line from Milo in his final confrontation with Mike perfectly summed up one of Mike's long-standing problems. If Milo's return in Mayor of Kingstown season 3, episode 9's ending only hinted at his involvement in many of Mayor of Kingstown season 3's biggest events, the season 3 finale precisely revealed which operations were executed by the Russian mobster who cheated death twice. Milo and Mike's vicious exchange gave them a chance not to leave anything about Mayor of Kingstown season 3 unexplained.\n\nThe two new gang leaders in Mayor of Kingstown season 3 and their attempts to build up their presence made it easier for chaos to reign in Kingstown, and Milo fully took advantage of it. Having a hand in both the bombing at Mariam's funeral of Mayor of Kingstown season 3's premiere and the shocking bus tragedy of season 3, episode 7, Milo made sure to use such events in his favor, only reappearing when he knew he could have had the upper hand against Konstantin. However, Milo's plan revelation also included a biting retort highlighting Mike's worst character flaw.\n\nRelated Mayor Of Kingstown Season 3 Proves Mike Finally Learned From His Past In A Surprising Way\n\nOne peculiarity of Mike's plan to re-establish order in Kingstown shows how much he learned from his mistakes in Mayor of Kingstown season 2.\n\n1 Milo's Question About The Bus Tragedy Victims In Mayor Of Kingstown Season 3 Proved Mike's Issue Women Were Always A Blind Spot For Mike Close\n\nMike made a point to highlight how Milo's actions went past a point of no return because he bombed his mother's funeral and pushed a busload of underage girls off the bridge only to hit Konstantin, to which Milo quipped, \"What bothers you more, Mike? Their gender or their age?\" Albeit entirely unsympathetic, Milo's quip proved a point that Mayor of Kingstown made time and time again, as Mike either underestimated women or wanted to protect them and be their knight in shining armor.\n\nMike's issue with women appeared repeatedly in Mayor of Kingstown season 3. Mike took Anna's case because she reminded him of his mother, which consequently caused him to ignore the many warning signals that hinted at her willingness to kill her son's murderer had Mike been unable to help. Similarly, Mike denied Iris's agency when she wanted to help him with Konstantin, only agreeing to her mission because Iris forced his hand by going to Cavo alone without him knowing. Finally, Mike killed Milo because Milo highlighted how Mike was unable to protect Mariam and was the reason she died.\n\nMike's Question To Iris Hints He Acknowledged Her Agency Mike Let Iris Choose What To Do With Konstantin Close\n\nMilo already noticed Mike's weakness in Mayor of Kingstown season 1, as he realized he couldn't manipulate him by sending Iris to seduce him, but he was successful in doing so if he hurt Iris. Even the reason why Mike was pushed to become mayor following Mitch's death in Mayor of Kingstown's series premiere had something to do with a mother in difficulty who asked for the mayor's help. Throughout the seasons, Mayor of Kingstown hinted at Mike's issue, but no one called it out until Milo in Mayor of Kingstown season 3.\n\nHowever, Mike's choice as Milo and Konstantin pushed Iris to kill Konstantin may have hinted at his change of heart. While Milo only offered Iris two options, to die or do his bidding by killing Konstantin, Mike actually asked Iris what she wanted to do. While a small detail, it could suggest Mike understood his mistake, pointing to Mike finally facing his problem after Mayor of Kingstown season 3.\n\nMayor of Kingstown season 3 is now streaming in its entirety on Paramount Plus.\n\nMayor of Kingstown 3.5 ThrillerDramaCrime Where to WatchSeasonAllSeason 1Season 2 streamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nstreamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nstreamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\n*Availability in US\n\nMayor of Kingstown is a drama-thriller series starring Jeremy Renner as Mike McLusky, who takes over for his brother as the head of the family.

Mayor of Kingstown season 3 explores how Kareem and Iris struggle to move on from their past traumas in a toxic environment. Kareem's and Iris's tragic deaths in Mayor of Kingstown emphasize the impossibility of escaping Kingstown's violence.\n\nMayor of Kingstown has long highlighted how difficult life is in Kingstown, but two deaths in the season 3 finale drove the point home, especially considering the hopelessness of their stories' ends. Mike's voiceovers throughout Mayor of Kingstown's three seasons painted a bleak picture, showing how nobody in Kingstown could escape the prisons' violence, whether because they were inmates, relatives of inmates, or had to face the brutality of such a system every day due to their working there. However, Mayor of Kingstown season 3's finale extended Mike's grim analysis to characters who had seemingly moved past their worst days.\n\nMayor of Kingstown seasons 1 to 3 explored the impact of the prison riots on Kareem, who had earned a promotion to warden but also felt the full weight of what he had to go through in the riots. While Kareem's approach throughout Mayor of Kingstown changed, first choosing revenge before embracing the rehabilitation aspect the prison complex should have made possible, Kareem seemed worryingly resigned to his fate toward Mayor of Kingstown season 3's ending. Similarly, Iris finally got her freedom from Milo and Konstantin in season 3's finale, and yet the end of her story was senselessly tragic.\n\nKareem & Iris's Deaths Prove That Nobody Can Escape What Happens In Kingstown Kareem Did Not Know How To Deal With Getting Fired & Iris Could Not Move On Close\n\nKareem and Iris both had to deal with what they survived in Mayor of Kingstown season 2, seemingly being in a better headspace at the beginning of season 3. However, their problems quickly worsened, with Kareem facing the consequences of the prison riots on his family and Iris being exposed daily to Konstantin's violence and not feeling any kind of fear for her life despite Konstantin's violent bouts. The last straw was the threat of being fired as warden for Kareem and Milo's return for Iris, but even after facing that, they both had options.\n\nRelated Mayor Of Kingstown Season 3 Proves Mike Finally Learned From His Past In A Surprising Way\n\nOne peculiarity of Mike's plan to re-establish order in Kingstown shows how much he learned from his mistakes in Mayor of Kingstown season 2.\n\n1\n\nHowever, Kareem and Iris both seemed resigned to their fate. The pervasiveness of Kingstown's violence didn't let them move on, even when they had the chance to start again, Kareem in another profession and Iris with her brand-new identity and life. Kareem choosing to go into the yard knowing the AB convicts would have killed him proved his intentions and that he knew what he was choosing, making his story's end show how he could not see past what happened to him, just like Iris felt stuck for so long amid Kingstown's violence before being pushed out of the town.\n\nMany Of Mayor Of Kingstown's Discussions Always Echoed This Sentiment Mike & Bunny's Exchanges Discussed This At Length And Even Tracy & Kyle Did Close\n\nMayor of Kingstown always focused on Kingstown's toxicity, and the drama exemplified it consistently with Mike's clients and Mariam's approach when she had to deal with KPD or the prisons' system. However, Mayor of Kingstown season 3 doubled down on the topic, being discussed by various characters. Mike and Bunny explored Kingstown's grim reality of gang wars and inequality after Rhonda's death in Mayor of Kingstown season 3, with the two thinking about how privileged some in Kingstown were, living till their old age to die peacefully in their sleep when such a kindness wasn't extended to those they knew.\n\nMayor of Kingstown never shied away from showing how some characters had all cards stacked against them, while others continued to run unencumbered, causing chaos and bringing pain to those in Kingstown.\n\nEven Tracy and Kyle discussed why they continued to live in Kingstown where it was always burdensome to try and do the right thing, choosing to serve their community just like Mariam did her whole life in Kingstown, and Tracy's own fight for justice proved it in Mayor of Kingstown season 3. Mayor of Kingstown season 3 ending with Kareem and Iris dead thus makes Kingstown's grim reality more evident and impossible to deny, letting no glimmer of hope come out from any of the storylines tackled in Mayor of Kingstown's third outing.\n\nMayor of Kingstown season 3 is now streaming in its entirety on Paramount Plus.\n\nMayor of Kingstown 3.5 ThrillerDramaCrime Where to WatchSeasonAllSeason 1Season 2 streamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nstreamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nstreamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\n*Availability in US\n\nMayor of Kingstown is a drama-thriller series starring Jeremy Renner as Mike McLusky, who takes over for his brother as the head of the family.

It also contains discussion of suicide.\n\nThe best word to describe Mayor of Kingstown Season 3 is turbulent. There's been even more chaos on-screen, but the episodes themselves have also been up and down. Season 3, Episode 10, \"Comeuppance\" takes all of that craziness and pulls it together into one final hour that is as great of a finale as the TV show can pull off. However, fans will definitely have a lot to argue about.\n\n\"Comeuppance\" addresses the return of Milo Sunter and focuses on Mike McLusky's plan to restore the natural order of Kingstown. However, in a way, Mike is just a passenger in the proceedings, because several of the most important plot developments have little to do with him. One of the themes in the series has always been how everything ends up on Mike's shoulders, but the end of Season 3 reminds viewers that the world does not orbit around him.\n\nMayor of Kingstown Finishes Mike and Milo's Rivalry\n\nSeason 3, Episode 10 Is a Definitive Ending\n\nRelated\n\nStephen King Praises 'Badass' Jeremy Renner's Paramount+ Series\n\nLegendary author Stephen King highly praises Jeremy Renner for his work on the Paramount crime drama from Taylor Sheridan.\n\nIt was an odd choice to bring Milo Sunter back in Season 3 -- not only because Mayor of Kingstown had found new villains, but because the show waited until its next-to-last episode to confirm Milo was alive. For all the screen time and energy spent on Merle Callahan and going into his history with Mike McLusky, Callahan was quietly arrested in Season 3, Episode 9... and so this once-imposing bad guy doesn't even make an appearance in the finale. Instead, \"Comeuppance\" spends a fair amount of time on the Russians, with Mike, Milo, Konstantin and Iris stuck together on Konstantin's boat.\n\nMike McLusky: There's a point of no return, and I think we crossed it.\n\nThe finale confirms that Milo is the mystery figure responsible for several major events in Season 3, including the bomb set off near Mariam McLusky's funeral in the season premiere. It makes sense to have the mastermind be a character that viewers know instead of making up some new villain out of thin air, but it also feels a little bit like a deus ex machina because Milo was reintroduced so late. If the writers were always planning on bringing him back -- which it seems like they were given the hints dropped at the end of Season 2 -- it would have been even more effective to simply continue with Milo as a regular character instead of investing time into not one, but two new opponents for Mike.\n\nAt least \"Comeuppance\" definitively ends the battle between Mike and Milo. Mariam is once again a presence despite her death, because it's Milo's comments about Mike's mother that get Mike to finally pull the trigger -- not once but twice. It's clear Milo doesn't survive two shots at that close range. While there's less drama because the episode begins with a shot of Mike leaving the boat, therefore making it obvious that there's no reason to fear for his life, at least he finally gets closure. Almost as importantly, so do viewers who have been following this back and forth for three seasons.\n\nWho Dies in the Mayor of Kingstown Season 3 Finale?\n\nSeason 3, Episode 10 Kills Off Four Major Characters\n\nRelated\n\n'Iris Is in Love With Mike': Mayor of Kingstown's Emma Laird Explains Which Side She's On\n\nMayor of Kingstown star Emma Laird tells CBR where Iris' loyalties lie after Season 3's big twist - and if Paramount+ fans should worry about her.\n\nWith the amount of deaths on Mayor of Kingstown, audiences knew to expect a body count in the Season 3 finale. Milo and Konstantin's deaths are actually the least shocking -- Milo has to go because his storyline is played out, and Konstantin's time was already running out. The biggest surprise is that it's Iris who shoots the latter, ordered to do so by both Milo and Konstantin himself, with the latter pushing her over the edge by using her real name of Hannah. But the real shocks come from the deaths of Iris and Kareem Moore, both of whom die by suicide.\n\nIris finally seems to turn her back on Kingstown, after Mike makes her promise never to see him again. But when she gets on the bus out of town, \"Comeuppance\" shows her taking two pills and a later scene depicts the bus driver finding her deceased. Her choice is tragic, and if there is a Season 4, the series should address how Mike reacts to the news (however he finds out). But it fits with the narrative because it's her choice. Everything that Iris has done in the back half of Season 3 has been her decision, even though all the other characters around her keep telling her what to do. She didn't want to leave Kingstown and didn't want to leave Mike, so she chose not to move on.\n\nMilo Sunter: She's been in love with Mike since I sent her.\n\nKareem has been struggling over several episodes, with Season 3, Episode 8, \"Captain of the Sh*t Out of Luck\" showing his wife speaking to him about their daughter's troubles and Episode 9 presenting him with the ultimatum of resigning or being fired. Episode 10 begins in part with Kareem contemplating suicide before going to work, which is a bit of painful foreshadowing. He doesn't want to see his life without Anchor Bay because, as he pointed out in Episode 9, it's his family's livelihood and something he's earned. Once he learns that Kevin Jackson is a mole for Bunny Washington, that seems to be the last straw. Kareem phones in a fake \"prisoner down\" call before letting himself into the area where the Aryan Brotherhood congregates, and they beat him to death.\n\nThis sequence is by far the most shocking and intense in the finale as the audience can see it coming and can do nothing to stop it, and Michael Beach does phenomenal work as Kareem, too, chooses his own way out. The losses of Beach and Emma Laird will certainly be felt if the TV show continues, while at the same time, the characters' deaths tie up these storylines that had largely run their course. Iris had confronted her past and was still enmeshed in the Russian mob story that's now pretty much over, while Kareem had been written into a corner. Some fans may be upset at losing Kareem and Iris, but the plot twists are true to the characters.\n\nMayor of Kingstown Cleans up Its Unfinished Business\n\nSeason 3 Finale Leaves the Door Open for Season 4\n\nRelated\n\n'Nobody Is Safe': Mayor of Kingstown's Taylor Handley on Kyle's Season 3 Battle\n\nMayor of Kingstown star Taylor Handley tells CBR how Season 3 raises the stakes of the Paramount+ show for Kyle McLusky, his wife Tracy and their son.\n\nWhat's particularly impressive about Mayor of Kingstown Season 3, Episode 10 is that it makes that concerted effort to finish up the things that need to be finished, while also looking ahead to Season 4. So many current TV show finales are more focused on spectacle and/or trying to lay pipe for the following season than coming up with a satisfying conclusion to the story that already exists. \"Comeuppance\" kills off all three of the key characters in the Russian mob storyline. It should have made the final reference to Mariam's death after the show used that as a motif all season. And it addresses the whole problem with Robert -- in a way that opens the door to a whole other plot point.\n\nA large portion of the episode involves a full-blown shootout between the warring factions on the Sixth Street Bridge, which necessitates the arrival of the SWAT team. One of the weaknesses of the episode is that this takes place at night, making it hard to keep up with who's where and what happens to whom. But Robert's violent behavior is also something the show needed to address, and it does so through Kyle, who turns his gun on his boss when Robert is poised to shoot an innocent man just because he sees a gun. Truthfully, the show might not have lost much if Robert had died, simply because he's the one character who hasn't grown much in three seasons. But the episode reveals Robert is alive (for now; remember that Mariam passed between seasons) and puts Kyle on the hook for attempted murder.\n\nMike McLusky: You're the only thing good left in this town, Kyle.\n\nKyle's whole arc in Season 3 has been about protecting people -- but after his wife Tracy telling him that she didn't want to involve him in her battle against Will Breen, he feels like he's failed at that. His stepping up to stop Robert somewhat handles Robert (by sidelining the character) but it also changes Kyle's character forever. And he's not the only one; this plotline makes good use of both Evelyn and Ian, two characters who are often more in supporting roles. Ian, in particular, is now in a world of hurt as Evelyn pursues him. By starting this new plotline, the series has more room for all of its characters to roam. The Mayor of Kingstown Season 3 finale is an episode that makes the best out of the season's dissonant parts, and justifies the show's unrelentingly bleak tone. This is still TV's hardest show to watch, but \"Comeuppance\" proves that such a thing still exists.\n\nAll ten episodes of Mayor of Kingstown Season 3 are now streaming on Paramount+.\n\nMayor of

Milo's return complicated Mike's plan to rid Kingstown of Konstantin's men, but it also concluded several storylines. Iris and Kareem's tragic fates highlighted the idea Mayor of Kingstown often presented that nobody leaves Kingstown unscathed.\n\nThe twists leading up to Mayor of Kingstown season 3, episode 10 made sure the explosive finale simultaneously found its resolution and introduced new, interesting stories in case Mayor of Kingstown season 4 is confirmed. Mayor of Kingstown season 3, episode 9's ending revealing that Milo had never died, instead faking his death to plan his comeback and take over Konstantin, guaranteed he would have been one of the season 3 finale's focal points. Even if the reason for his return was not exactly solid, Milo's comeback concluded various storylines in Mayor of Kingstown season 3, including Iris's and Konstantin's.\n\nAnother key storyline, which Mayor of Kingstown developed throughout season 3, involved Evelyn's investigation into Robert. Evelyn's wish to see him in jail for his actions in the riots never wavered, but Ian killing Charlie in Mayor of Kingstown season 3, episode 9 offered her the missing link between Morrissey's murder and Ian, who was always close to Robert. However, Evelyn's investigation into Robert became less important after the shootout on the bridge saw Kyle targeting Robert to protect civilians and being arrested for having opened fire on him, setting up one of Mayor of Kingstown season 4's biggest storylines.\n\nRelated Mayor Of Kingstown Season 3 Proves Mike Finally Learned From His Past In A Surprising Way\n\nOne peculiarity of Mike's plan to re-establish order in Kingstown shows how much he learned from his mistakes in Mayor of Kingstown season 2.\n\n1 How Mike Solved The Russian Problem Mike & Bunny's Plan Worked Up To A Point Close\n\nMike had crafted the perfect plan that would have simultaneously rid Kingstown of Konstantin's men and Bunny's military-grade weapons, while he was supposed to take care of Konstantin. Milo's resurfacing nonetheless made Mike's plan more difficult, as his wish to see Konstantin dead and set up a new deal with Mike greatly changed how everything was supposed to go down. While Milo's admissions revealed Mike's double-cross to Konstantin, in the end, he forced Iris to take care of Konstantin, making Mike only worry about setting the score with Milo, as Iris had already killed Konstantin.\n\nBunny's men opening fire before they brought Konstantin's men to the isolated destination greatly aggravated the situation. Their shootout on the bridge created a multiple-vehicle collision, endangering civilians and forcing the involvement of SWAT, which caused another set of problems the moment Robert killed someone who surrendered and almost killed a civilian. Although Konstantin's men and the Crips effectively wiped each other out, they also created a massive incident that should have never involved civilians and the KPD.\n\nMilo Was Responsible For The Bus Tragedy In Mayor Of Kingstown Season 3 Mariam's Funeral Bombing & The Bus Tragedy Were Milo's Doing Close\n\nMike's and Milo's reunion also revealed who was responsible for Mayor of Kingstown season 3's bus tragedy. Mike attributing the two accidents to Milo as Milo admitted that he \"needed an accelerant,\" which was the reason for the bombing of Mariam's funeral, officially revealed the culprit behind much of the senseless violence hitting Kingstown in season 3. By asking Mike whether it bothered him more the age or the gender of Konstantin's girls whose bus Milo pushed off the bridge, Milo also admitted to that atrocity, solving many of Mayor of Kingstown season 3's mysteries.\n\nHowever, the reason for Milo's return was less clear. Milo admitted he wanted Konstantin killed and to re-establish a \"cross-border pipeline,\" but that seemed farfetched even with Konstantin's death. After all, faking his death meant Milo had not only escaped Konstantin but also Konstantin's bosses, failing to fulfill his mission, making it unlikely for the \"fathers\" to forgive him and let him live, had Mike not killed him. This made Milo's return a bit patchy, as it explained various mysteries from Mayor of Kingstown season 3, but his reasons did not nonetheless have a leg to stand on.\n\nMilo's return solved many of the unexplained mysteries of Mayor of Kingstown season 3, including the bus tragedy and the funeral bombing, but his reasons were all but solid as he didn't explain how he would have won over Konstantin's bosses.\n\nWhy Kyle Shot Robert On The Bridge Kyle Was Going Through A Lot & Wanted To Protect The Family Close\n\nThe father on the bridge being unable to drop his gun had already been a problem for Kyle, who was fit for duty and identified him as not a threat. However, Robert approaching their car put Kyle in front of a dilemma: acting against Robert would be betraying someone on his side, but Kyle had also just seen Robert execute someone surrendering. Coupled with Kyle's sense of powerlessness having just learned Tracy had asked Mike for protection, Kyle felt he needed to do something in that moment.\n\nRelated Mayor Of Kingstown's Taylor Handley On Kyle's Turn To SWAT In Season 3 & Season 4 Chances\n\nMayor of Kingstown star Taylor Handley discusses Kyle's transition to the SWAT team in season 3, as well as the chances of season 4 being made.\n\n1\n\nKyle shooting at Robert on a bridge with multiple witnesses, including his coworkers, sealed his fate but also was the only thing Kyle knew would have stopped Robert. After all, Robert repeatedly ignored his calls, he had proven all but reliable in the field, and he had just subtly asked Kyle whether he would have known who to choose between Mike and his SWAT family, had Mike continued to oppose permanently shutting up Evelyn. This makes Kyle's situation extremely fragile in Mayor of Kingstown season 4, even with Robert surviving the bullets.\n\nIris's Tragic Fate In Mayor Of Kingstown Season 3's Finale Explained Mayor Of Kingstown Has Long Made The Point That Nobody Leaves Kingstown Unscathed Close\n\nNo matter how many times Mike pushed Iris toward leaving Kingstown, she always refused. Iris staying in Kingstown and spying on Konstantin greatly helped Mike, but with Konstantin dead and Milo willing to let her go, Iris's story in Kingstown had come to its natural end. Mike making her promise not to look back ensured Iris would not have returned to Kingstown, but her story's end brutally highlighted how Iris might have left Kingstown, but Kingstown stayed with Iris.\n\nMayor of Kingstown season 3 didn't clear up whether Iris intended to kill herself or it was just fate after the many drugs she did with Konstantin, but it mercilessly highlighted yet again how nobody leaves Kingstown unscathed. What happened in Kingstown hurt Iris to the point she did not fear death, hinting more than once at the fact she was not willing or maybe able to move on. Iris's tragic fate after she had definitely left Kingstown behind proved the ruthless point that leaving Kingstown did little for her well-being, as Kingstown and what it represented never left Iris.\n\nWhy Mike's Voiceover Kept Being Repeated In The Mayor Of Kingstown Season 3 Finale Mike's Morality Was Never Questioned As Much Before Close\n\nMike repeatedly thinking about what Mariam told him when she visited him in jail and returning to his family as he left the prison was evident in Mike's identical voiceover throughout season 3's finale. Mike never saw himself as good in Mayor of Kingstown, taking on the role of mayor as if it was penance, with Mariam never understanding why he would choose such a thankless role when it didn't give him anything. However, ruminating over it in Mayor of Kingstown season 3's finale might finally point Mike to an alternative to being mayor just as a form of penitence.\n\nRelated Anna's Story Proves Mike Forgot About His Original Mayor Of Kingstown Mission\n\nMike's inability to help Anna or recognize her wish for revenge shows how disconnected he is from his regular clients in Mayor of Kingstown.\n\n1\n\nAfter all, two people reminded Mike of his goodness in Mayor of Kingstown season 3's finale, and yet Mike never questioned it more, especially after Milo's speech about him and Mike being the same and Mike killing Milo in cold blood. Whether Mike sees his ability to do good along with evil, his confusion can point to an interesting story involving him, where Mike can finally move past working as mayor just because of his belief he deserved such a terrible fate, instead choosing to do so in service of good as a way to give back to Kingstown.\n\nWhat Kareem Meant When He Spoke To Kevin Kareem Had Already Decided His Fate But Wanted Kevin To Avoid It Close\n\nKareem had long felt directionless in Mayor of Kingstown season 3, even stopping his fight with Mike's decisions, just agreeing with everything he suggested and obeying him. Those in charge of Kingstown's prisons wanting him to resign otherwise they would have fired him came as his mental health was already struggling. Between how the prison riots still plagued his family and the consistent attacks in Anchor Bay, Kareem felt he could not control much. While Kareem decided against killing himself before going to work, his choice to enter the yard where AB prisoners were proved he hadn't changed his mind.\n\nKareem's decision prompted him to impart important lessons to his loved ones, but among them, also Kevin, who Kareem had just discovered to be at fault for notifying the sniper who attacked Anchor Bay. Kareem's message to Kevin was his final gift, reminding Kevin how nobody would have covered for him, delivering a message that stemmed from Kareem feeling utterly alone, as he believed Anchor Bay should have supported him instead of pushing him aside. Kareem's fate in Mayor of Kingstown season 3 thus planted the seeds for Kevin's change, hopefully leading him to believe in Kareem's prison mission.\n\nHow Mayor Of Kingstown Sets Up Season 4 Mayor Of Kingstown Season 3's Finale Set Up Various Big Stories For Season 4 Close\n\nMayor of Kingstown season 3's finale concluded Milo, Konstantin, Iris and Kareem's stories, but it also left others wide open. Indeed, from Mike's internal debate over his goodness to Kyle's arrest, Mayor of Kingstown season 4 would have plenty of disparate themes to explore. Focused as Mike was on his Russian problem, Mike overlooked Callahan, making him an even bigger problem potentially now that Callahan knew Mike never acted protecting his interests, instead sending Raphael to the hospital to kill him.\n\nMayor of Kingstown season 3's finale also didn't conclude Robert's story, sending him to the hospital due to Kyle's bullets, but leaving him at the center of Evelyn's investigation, who now wanted answers from Ian too, after Evelyn learned about Ian bringing Charlie to the dentist the day Morrissey was killed. All these storylines set up a compelling Mayor of Kingstown season 4, where Mike would have to fight for his family and the new possible gangs taking Konstantin and Milo's places, hinting at a potentially very different story for Mike in Mayor of Kingstown season 4.\n\nMayor of Kingstown season 3 is now streaming in its entirety on Paramount Plus.\n\nMayor of Kingstown 3.5 ThrillerDramaCrime Where to WatchSeasonAllSeason 1Season 2 streamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nstreamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nstreamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\n*Availability in US\n\nMayor of Kingstown is a drama-thriller series starring Jeremy Renner as Mike McLusky, who takes over for his brother as the head of the family.

This makes him perhaps the only person capable of handling such a dangerous environment as this one. The show's third season is almost over, so now is a good time to look back at the best episodes.\n\n10 \"Along Came a Spider\"\n\nSeason 1, Episode 7\n\n\"That's the thing with problems, Mike. You can leave them as long as you want, and still be there when you get back.\" In \"Along Came a Spider,\" the tension in Kingstown escalates as a Milo (Aiden Gillen) continues his dark schemes. He's almost like a supervillain, orchestrating elaborate hits from behind bars. In a standout scene, Mike even goes to see Milo in prison. Gillen excels at these kinds of Machiavellian characters, channeling his Littlefinger energy with skill.\n\nHis appearance also creates another link between the show and The Wire (though thankfully he doesn't attempt an American accent this time). Meanwhile, Mike's mom Miriam (Dianne West) also has some good scenes, particularly the lesson she delivers at the prison about human competition and cooperation. As usual, Miriam's monologue has thematic significance for the episode. In terms of the subplots, there's also growing unrest in the prison which the authorities handle poorly. Their mistakes go on to have apocalyptic consequences.\n\n9 \"Orion\"\n\nSeason 1, Episode 5\n\n\"I'm stronger than you think.\" This episode sees Mike negotiating with various factions, including the prison gangs and local law enforcement, to broker a fragile peace. His brother, Kyle (Taylor Handley), grapples with the moral implications of their family's involvement in the town's criminal underworld. Meanwhile, Iris (Emma Laird), a young woman entangled with the local crime syndicate, seeks Mike's help to escape her dangerous situation.\n\nMike has an intense scene where he gets into a brawl during an ice hockey game, swinging a hockey stick like Excalibur. He's there to watch Hakim, a teenager that Mike feels protective of. They have some sweet scenes together where Mike acts almost fatherly. It's a pity that the relationship between them isn't explored more over the course of the show. On the visual side, this episode also gets creative. For example, there's a memorable sequence where shots of new prisoners being processed at the prison are intercut with shots of a pitbull being neutered.\n\n8 \"Simply Murder\"\n\nSeason 1, Episode 3\n\n\"Every once in a while it's nice to remind them they're the prisoners, not us.\" This brutal episode begins with meth head Kenny (Billy Lush) accidentally leaving a lit ciagrette in his trailer. It causes a massive explosion that kills the young boy in his care. The police launch a manhunt for Kenny, but they want him dead rather than alive. Kenny turns to Mike for help, leading to a quietly fantastic scene between the two of them.\n\nKenny asks Mike if he can trust him. Mike says no, but promises that he will tell him the truth. He advises Kenny to turn himself in, await execution, and beg God's forgiveness. Kenny obliges, only for the police and prison guards to orchestrate his murder in custody. It's a shocking scene that underscores the lawlessness of these authorities. This bleak storyline is bookended by Miriam's speeches on the nature of slavery. They ring uncomfortably not only of America's past but also Kingstown's present.\n\n7 \"The Mayor of Kingstown\"\n\nSeason 1, Episode 1\n\n\"Every member of my family fights this fight in one way or another.\" The series opens with the introduction of Mike McLusky and his family, who hold significant sway in the titular town. Kingstown is a place where the prison industry dominates, and the McLuskys act as intermediaries between the inmates, the authorities, and the various factions that vie for power. The episode jumps straight into the action, with the murder of Mike's brother Mitch (Kyle Chandler) early on.\n\nThe episode does a good job of setting the scene and cuing the viewer into this violent world, marked by crime, incarceration, addiction, and despair. It's also effective in the way that it introduces the main characters separately and only later reveals the connections between them. Plus, it tells us a lot about Mike's character. For example, there's an important scene where he says he has one inviolable rule: never break a deal with anyone, ever.\n\n6 \"Little Green Ant\"\n\nSeason 2, Episode 10\n\n\"He's gearing up for a goddamn war.\" The Season 2 finale brings Mike and Milo together for an incendiary finale showdown. Milo's schemes reach new heights of villainy, but Mike matches them with his ingenuity and nerves of steel. This builds up to an intense shootout in Kyle's house, where Kyle accidentally shoots their mom. The two brothers have a tender scene together where Mike comforts Kyle and tells him not to blame himself.\n\nFrom there, the episode just continues to escalate, firing on all cylinders with the action and shock plot developments. The climactic sequence is fittingly fiery and intense, with Milo taking Iris hostage on his boat. Milo comes aboard with a bag of bonds, agreeing to exchange them for Iris's safety. Milo obliges, only for the boat to explode in a ball of fire minutes later. Mike had hidden explosives in the bag, proving that he truly was the most formidable figure in Kingstown.\n\n5 \"Staring at the Devil\"\n\nSeason 2, Episode 2\n\n\"Nothing stays hidden in a town.\" Season 2, Episode 2 opens with a hail of gunfire as gang members unleash a mass shooting on their enemies. It's the deadliest shooting in Kingstown's history, with dozens of bodies littering the house. Mike and the police desperately try to understand who ordered it and why. (At times, the brutality of the town is a little over-the-top, but the believable performances usually keep it grounded.)\n\nThe shooting leads Mike to reprise his role as mediator, attempting to strike a deal between the gangs and prison authorities. He even comes up with a 'so wild it might just work' plan to put some gang leaders behind bars so they can restructure their gangs from within. Meanwhile, Kyle is straining under the pressure of his job, and Iris has a fateful meeting with Milo. In other words, the episode mostly sets up future drama, but does so skillfully and with a bang.\n\n4 \"Every Feather\"\n\nSeason 1, Episode 6\n\n\"Way to make us an accessory, Mike.\" This episode places Mike in a bind, with Iris's club managers abusing her on Milo's behalf. Milo's vast criminal network closes in around him, eliminating his allies and leaving him with few options. Despite being in prison, Milo has the power to have even federal agents killed with just a word. This episode is thus Mike at his weakest point, with few cards to play. However, he demonstrates his quick-thinking, courage, and skill for bluffing in order to come out on top.\n\nFor example, he tricks two police officers into coming with him when he beats up one of Iris's managers, giving his enemies the impression that he has the full power of the police behind him. It shows Mike's understanding of perceptions, that power resides where people believe it to hide. His scrappiness only gets him so far, however, and the episode ends on a devastating cliffhanger.\n\n3 \"The Lie of the Truth\"\n\nSeason 1, Episode 9\n\n\"Inmates are immune to our lies, and they're immune to our threats.\" 'The Lie of the Truth' alternates between quiet scenes and intense ones. On the one hand, there are sweet moments of bonding between Iris and Mike in his cabin. Their dynamic is slow, cautious, with neither quite sure where the other stands nor what they want. But their connection is undeniable, with Iris seeing Mike as her protector and Mike perhaps seeking redemption through helping her. As Milo memorably says, Mike sees his salvation in Iris.\n\nThe episode then switches gear with a prison riot that utterly upends the balance of power. The inmates take charge of the prison, killing guards, and demanding better conditions. Mike steps in as a negotiator, but this crisis is beyond even his consdierable skills. The riot sequences are well done and believable, an orgy of mayhem and stabbing. The inmates are soon faced with SWAT teams, making this perhaps Mayor of Kingstown's most chaotic episode.\n\n2 \"This Piece of My Soul\"\n\nSeason 1, Episode 10\n\n\"Every decision in this place is the lesser of two evils.\" The Season 1 finale continues to deal with the fallout from the massive prison riot. In the chaos, Milo manages to slip free, in a devastating turn of events for Mike. It's also revealed that the riot stemmed from the prisoners feeling that the authorities did not follow through on their end of the bargain after the inmates killed the meth head Kenny several episodes back. It shows how everything is connected to everything in Kingstown.\n\nThis is a trying situation, but Mike and Kyle manage to make it out alive, if just barely. The odds are against them, but they live to fight another die. After these hard-hitting, action-packed sequences, there's a quieter moment between Mike and Iris. She talks about the way her experiences have forever damaged her, wondering aloud, \"What if your soul can grow back?\" This is the show's central question and the one that motivates Mike, as well.\n\n1 \"The Devil Is Us\"\n\nSeason 1, Episode 8\n\n\"Mike, if you fall in it, don't drag us down there with you.\" This episode further demonstrates the scope of Milo's scheming, with the mastermind leading Mike to find a school bus buried in a patch of wilderness. It contains two dozen dead bodies, making it the criminal find of the decade - but also the only one that places Mike under law enforcement scrutiny.\n\nMeanwhile, this episode inflicts even greater hardship upon Iris, who is sold from one abusive owner to another. Mike resolves to save her, busting her out and killing her erstwhile captors in cold blood. One of them was even one of Mike's allies while he was in prison. Iris remarks that many men have said they would die for her, but Mike is the first to kill for her. He disagrees, seeing he didn't kill them for her, but rather because they deserved it. It's yet more proof of his gray moral compass, warped by his life in such a harsh environment.\n\nKEEP READING: The 10 Most Underrated 'Family Guy' Episodes, Ranked", "source": {"uri": "collider.com",

Let me tell you, this wait is going to be extra excruciating too, because the finale left me with three major questions about the Jeremy Renner-led show that have to be answered if the series is renewed.\n\nFor a quick overview, the episode centered around the fallout of Milo's return, a massive bridge shootout, major power shifts in the prison, Iris eventually leaving and major tragedies. In a season that's been all about the characters compartmentalizing their grief, things bubbled up in the finale, making it so they had to face it all (or not face it)...and there's going to be consequences.\n\nAfter a scary moment where it seemed like Kareem was about to take his own life at his home in Mayor of Kingstown, he ended up losing his life at the prison.\n\nAt the end of Season 3, after a somber call with his family, Kareem was stabbed by a group of prisoners with shivs. He called in on the radio that a prisoner was down (there wasn't) before going through the gate, he entered the prison yard willingly, and eventually, he was killed. He didn't fight back.\n\nThis will likely totally shake up the power structures in Kingstown. While Kareem wasn't the warden for the entire show, he was a vital part of the system. With him gone, it's unclear who will take his place, and how this tragic event will shake up the balance of control in the town.\n\nI imagine it will really change things for Mike as Mayor too. Not only will he have to grieve this loss, but he'll have to establish a new relationship with the warden and work on figuring out the new system if the show gets renewed. However, as sad, tragic and game-changing as this development is, it's only one of three massive loose ends we're dealing with at the end of Season 3.\n\nThis whole season, Evelyn Foley, the assistant D.A., has been trying to impose consequences on those who practice unnecessary violence in Kingstown. Specifically, Robert and the S.W.A.T. team have been a point of focus for her, especially in the finale.\n\nDuring the shootout on the bridge, Robert was yelling at an armed bystander to put his gun down. There was a kid in his backseat, and as far as everyone could tell the driver was innocent. But, it seemed like Robert was about to shoot him, despite Kyle yelling at him to stop, and eventually Kyle ended up shooting his co-worker.\n\nBetween Kyle's wife's terrifying moment and the fact that his son was born right after his mom died, emotionally he's been carrying a lot. It's all been bottled up all season, and when he took on his new role in SWAT, I was wondering when something big and dangerous would happen to him.\n\nWhile I do understand Taylor Handley's character's thought process here, because Robert - a known ultraviolet man - was about to kill an innocent man without repercussions, I also think this act was a breaking point.\n\nOne of the final shots of the season showed Kyle being taken away in a cop car. Mike was told that his brother was under arrest and that people were saying it was \"attempted murder,\" plus Evelyn told Renner's character:\n\nMike left saying they couldn't hold his brother, but Ian told him to calm down.\n\nUltimately, the story ends there, and we don't know if Kyle will get out. I'm positive Mike will do everything to free him. However, it's not looking good. Between the desperation Renner's character feels and the rage that is likely coursing through Robert, things will get ugly as they fight for Kyle's future.\n\nAfter finding out that Aidan Gillen's Milo was alive and orchestrating many of the attacks in Kingstown, there was a terrible fight between him and the troubled trio of Mike, Konstantin and Iris. Ultimately, it ended with Iris shooting Konstantin in the head, Mike killing Milo for good this time, and Iris leaving town.\n\nHowever, things got even worse when Iris boarded the bus to finally leave Kingstown. After sitting down, she opened up her little pill box, and she took a few white pills. When the bus stopped for a break, the driver found her unconscious with her eyes and mouth open in her seat. To be frank, she looked dead.\n\nIris has been through hell every season, but this one ended the worst because, in a matter of minutes, she shot Konstantin in the head per Milo's order and had to leave Mike. I think it's safe to say her life reached the lowest of low points.\n\nNow, I don't think she's dead. While it's certainly possible that she is, I mean she looked it at the end of the season, I have a hunch she'll live. I think that if the show is picked up, this overdose will lead to her returning to Kingstown, and being stuck there...again.\n\nAll around, it's not good news for Iris, and Mike will likely be beside himself when he learns about what's happened.\n\nThe episode ends with Mike's voice-over, talking about when he got out of prison years ago. He questions if he's good or evil, and wonders if he could become a better person. However, two of the people he cares about most - Iris and Kyle - were taken away from him in ways, and the power is clearly shifting in Kingstown with the death of the warden.\n\nSo, if Mayor of Kingstown gets renewed for a fourth season, there are a lot of tragic loose ends to investigate, and Mike will have his work cut out for him. As we learn more about the future of the show and its story we'll be sure to keep you posted.", "source": {"uri": "cinemablend.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CINEMABLEND"}, "authors": [{"uri": "riley_utley@cinemablend.com", "name": "Riley Utley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_3)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 3)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Kingstown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Kingstown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(mythology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iris (mythology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shootout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shootout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingstown", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kingstown"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kingstown"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saint Vincent and the Grenadines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_warden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prison warden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiv_(weapon)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shiv (weapon)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.W.A.T._(2017_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S.W.A.T.

This may easily be the biggest episode that the show has ever done in terms of dramatic plot swings.\n\nSo, where do we start? Well, a natural place is just noting first and foremost that there is not just one, but two and perhaps even three major deaths to chronicle here.\n\nFirst and foremost, Mike has finally taken care of Milo -- or, at the very least, we tend to think so. We all thought he was dead last season, but we do honestly think that he's gone this time around thanks to Jeremy Renner's character. Meanwhile, Iris finally got her revenge on Konstantin, though it also feels like she may have died on her way out of town. Of the three characters in here, we tend to think Iris is the one with the best opportunity to survive. It feels like high time for Konstantin and Milo to go and for Mayor of Kingstown to move in some other directions if it does come back -- also, characters do need to die sometimes in order for a story to work.\n\nIf there is another season of the series now, they could need a new Big Bad; also, Mike also may have his hands full having to help Kyle, who seems like he's being arrested. There were game-changers across the board in the finale and honestly, that's what this show needed after feeling perhaps a little bit too stagnant as of late. This gives the show a chance for some significant resets, and there is something we appreciate about that.\n\nStill, it's now a bummer to think we could be waiting for a long time to see whatever is coming up next...\n\nRelated - Be sure to learn more about Iris' apparent death in the Mayor of Kingstown finale now\n\nBe sure to let us know right now in the attached comments!

EP explains", "body": "We know that following the end of the Mayor of Kingstown season 3 finale, there may be a rather hefty number of questions. Take, for example, whether or not Iris is really dead. Emma Laird's character is one of a few notable casualties from the final episode, and certainly the most notable given that she was a huge part of the series from the start.\n\n(Also, remember that for a good chunk of this season, it actually looked like Milo was dead in the first place.)\n\nSo are we looking towards some sort of massive fake-out when it comes to the character's future? It does make some sense to wonder, especially given the Milo situation. Yet, showrunner Hugh Dillon confirms to Variety that the plan is for these deaths to stick:\n\nYes. If we did anything else, that would be corruption. Creative corruption. Because that is the end. So to come back and say, \"Oh, she was just sleeping...\" They are dead. This is what happens. It's a tragedy. We know these people, and we understand. To pretend it didn't happen would be a disservice to all of us.\n\nWhile there is no fourth season of Mayor of Kingstown officially ordered, it does make sense for a lot of questions to be around how Mike moves forward. He tried so hard to help Iris over the years, and he could be reeling from this tragedy. Even if Milo and Konstantin are now out of the picture, this hardly means that everything is going to be smooth sailing from here on out. There is a chance that we end up seeing some new threats, and we already know that there is a bit obstacle that Mike is going to have to clear now when it comes to Kyle.\n\nRelated - Read more here on some of the other major deaths from the Mayor of Kingstown finale\n\nGo ahead and let us know in the comments!

Why in the world wouldn't they be? Just remember for a moment here that this show has a big audience, a huge star in Jeremy Renner, and an apparent plan behind the scenes to go on for a few more years. So, what in the world is going on here? Well, the answer to this is perhaps a little bit more complicated.\n\nFor now, what we tend to think is happening is that the folks at Paramount+ are working behind the scenes to look at the ratings and see when and how to order more of the show; meanwhile, they may also be having more conversations with Renner. He has been outspoken at times about what he went through to prepare for another season as Mike after his near-fatal snowplow accident. It was not easy for him to be able to jump back into this part, though he did find a way in order to make it happen over time. We believe that moving forward, his primary goal is going to be just ensuring that he can continue to have a work - life balance that makes sense for where he is now.\n\nUltimately, the biggest reason for a lack of a Mayor of Kingstown renewal is simply that there may not be too much of a reason to rush it.

She's been stuck in Kingstown for quite a long time, having to deal with trauma after trauma. She was also stuck almost constantly under Konstantin's thumb. Now, there is an irony to the idea where once she finally got away, she may have suffered an overdose and this could 100% be the end.\n\nOf course, this is where we really should remind you that in the world of Mayor of Kingstown, someone appearing to be dead does not mean that they actually are. We went through this with Milo for most of the season and yet, he turned up still alive. Yet, there also needs to be consequences to certain actions and you can only fake out viewers for so long. We should note that as of this writing, nobody has confirmed that Laird is 100% gone from the series. She did get a certain measure of revenge in taking out Konstantin, and maybe that is the bittersweet victory here?\n\nIf the character is in fact gone, then there may be some out there who lament the fact that she never got an opportunity to be with Mike. However, that was a conscious decision on Jeremy Renner and the show's part to not have this be some prototypical romance, instead reminding us that a lot of these relationships can be layered and surprising in a handful of different ways.

Even if they're bad people or they've done bad things, you have to be able to see the humanity and excavate that and bring it to the forefront.\"\n\nThe actor also appreciates how the show tells an entertaining story while spotlighting important issues like crime, addiction and the prison industrial complex.\n\n\"We are all human beings, regardless of private sector corporations and how they kind of numerify the worth of any individual,\" he said.\n\n\"Human beings [are] perpetuating these acts and it's also human beings suffering the consequences of them. These are human issues and I am always interested in human issues.

Is it going to happen? Or, are we really at the end of the road for the Jeremy Renner drama?\n\nWell, we suppose that the first thing we really should do is speak to where things are, at least at present, on a fairly technical level. Nothing has been confirmed as of yet when it comes to the future of the Jeremy Renner series. However, at the same time, we are certainly confident that more of the series is coming. How can we not be given that the show is popular, Paramount has a good thing going with executive producer Taylor Sheridan, and you also have a big-name star front and center who is viewed as a huge inspiration to a lot of people.\n\nSo why is there no renewal yet? We consider it mostly just the streaming service being patient because they can be. While creatively the door is open for more Mayor of Kingstown, they may be waiting to see more of the overall numbers for the season. Also, filming potentially would not begin for a while and they have time to render a verdict here.\n\nAt this point, perhaps one of the most compelling cases for a renewal is just due to Sheridan's winning streak -- almost every single one of his shows has been renewed continuously until the end of the story. Yellowstone is ending with season 5, but there are many reasons for that. (Yes, we understand that Hugh Dillon is actually the day-to-day showrunner here, but Taylor is still involved.)\n\nOur feeling, at least for now, is that we will hear more about a Mayor of Kingstown season 4 by the end of the fall. That would allow production to potentially start early next year and the series to come back later in 2025.

Mike opened and closed the episode with emotional dialogue, admitting his misdeeds and how prison changed him.\n\nIn this Mayor of Kingstown Season 3 Episode 10 review, we have a lot of trauma to unpack if we want closure. Especially since we haven't gotten word of a fourth season. That ending may be all there is to the story.\n\nBe sure to let us know in the comments how you think the series measured up for the third season compared to the first two. Did you find the ending satisfactory enough for that to be it?\n\nThings did end pretty messed up, with unexpected deaths and tested loyalties. I was hoping that Mike would find a happy-for-now with Evelyn. But that isn't likely to happen after she arrested Kyle.\n\nHow messed up is it that the only good brother is the one who is going to jail?\n\nI've been rooting for Ian and Robert to see the other side of the justice system all season. Just when we thought we would see Evelyn pursue Ian for the death of a CI, she turned her eyes on Kyle instead.\n\nRelated: Dennis Quaid to Star as Infamous Serial Killer in Paramout+ Series Happy Face\n\nBut at least Evelyn is onto the trail of Ian's corruptness. I'm still holding out hope for another season so we can see justice for the death of serial killer Charlie (Kenny Johnson).\n\nYes, I sympathized with a serial killer. Hate me. We all have our thing.\n\nBut Evelyn also knows what a narcissistic psychopath Robert is, and it seems like she wants him more than Ian.\n\nSo, will Mike be able to use that in Kyle's favor? Fact -- Kyle did an illegal thing. He shot his brother. Also, fact -- he's a hero.\n\nBecause Robert is crazy, it's guaranteed that he would have shot that terrified innocent man and possibly his kid.\n\nWe fully expect to see some leftover emotional trauma from that necessity. And would Robert try to retaliate, since we know he survived?\n\nThere were plenty of deaths throughout the episode to distract us from Kyle's survival. The war on the bridge wiped out a good portion of Bunny's Crypt gang and many Russians.\n\nBut will that matter for them with all their leaders crossing into Hell? We saw Milo return in Mayor of Kingstown Season 3 Episode 9. He was holding Roman, Konstantin's number two, hostage.\n\nThings did not go well for him, revealing a deep, sadistic, evil nature in Milo worthy of Criminal Minds. I'd love to read his BAU profile.\n\nThe ick factor was the perfect farewell note for a series going off right as we start to get Fall Fever. Is anyone else ready for all things spooky?\n\nRelated: Criminal Minds: Evolution Renewed For Third Season at Paramount+\n\nSpeaking of gore, there's a noticeable trend toward streaming series that are more graphic and mature in their content. This has this viewer questioning the psyche of the different generations.\n\nWe're no longer triggered by watching a traumatized, drugged-out female blow the back of her captor's head off. Because we can justify the death as a way for her to earn her freedom and a favor to humanity. She killed a bad, bad man.\n\nIt's a bit depressing that despite all of Mike's efforts and crimes to save Iris, she burns herself out to the point of OD'ing on a bus out of town.\n\nWill Mike ever find out her fate? He told her to leave and never look back. To forget him and all of Kingstown.\n\nHow ironic that the pills that she took to end her life first belonged to Mike's dead mom, who also tried helping Iris before she died.\n\nIf the brain explosion of Konstantin's death didn't rock you, it's likely that you cheered when Mike went Tyson on Milo after Ian took off with Iris.\n\nAnother bad guy's death brought justice. But his death also toes the fine line that Mike discusses throughout the episode.\n\nLike Kyle, he did a bad thing for a good reason. Although it wasn't as justified as Kyle's shooting of his brother. But Mike's revenge killing of the evil Milo brought us a peace that we wouldn't have gotten if he'd only gone to prison.\n\nThe justice system is too messed up to leave his fate to a flawed court system. If he had any useful information, he could trade it for his freedom. His death is the only way it could have ended for a peaceful ending.\n\nRelated: Dexter: Original Sin: Where to Watch, Cast & Everything We Know So Far\n\nEspecially after Mike promised to put a bullet in him. Gotta love it when a man sticks to his word. But seeing him shoot Milo after he mentioned Mike's mom does explain why we saw him with blood on his shirt.\n\nIt's a surprise Evelyn didn't ask about it when they talked after she arrested Kyle. It seems that those closest to Mike have a bad fate.\n\nHow messed up would it be if Mike was the only one not in prison if there happened to be a Season 4? The ex-con is free, while the three former police officers go to prison.\n\nIt's possible that, with the war on the bridge and the deaths of Milo, Konstantin, and Roman, we won't see much more between the Russians and the Crypts.\n\nBut we didn't get a resolution on Bunny's storyline. He and Mike are on the outs, but Mike is double-crossing him by pretending to be good with him to appease the Aryans in prison.\n\nMike put down the Russian threat, who was in cahoots with the Aryans. Does that mean they'll back down? Or will they continue assaulting Bunny's business under a new leader?\n\nWe know Bunny got away with a lot of guns. So he's still armed and prepared for a war, even if he lost some soldiers. He was smart to send an empty truck on the bridge. The police won't be able to charge him for anything.\n\nWe'll have to wait and see Washington's next move. With Kareem gone at the prison and the mole still in place, the prison is ripe for control.\n\nCan Mike regain his legacy as Mayor of Kingstown and get control of everyone? Or will he go down in disgrace like the mayor before him?\n\nRelated: 13 Characters Who Hit Rock Bottom\n\nWhat's left for him if all of his brothers are in jail (or dead, because does anyone really believe Robert could survive in prison)? His relationship with Evelyn is burnt, and Iris is dead.\n\nEven his tedious alliance with Kareem is over now that the warden committed suicide by inmates. How will Mike react when he finds out about Kareem's death? He sensed something was up but didn't pursue it.\n\nAnd who is up next to become warden with Kareem's passing? It would work in Mike's favor if it were his inside man. But it would be a smarter move for the prison to recruit from outside.\n\nAfter all his losses this season, Mike could use a win in his category. Especially if it's someone who would work with him instead of bringing him problems to fix like his brothers.\n\nDid anyone else get annoyed AF at how Ian and Robert constantly want Mike to fix their screw-ups? We'd expect the behaviors from the unstable Robert, especially after he and Kyle had their confrontation in the last episode.\n\nBut Ian is toeing the line of crossing into Robert-crazy territory with his recent murder of Charlie to cover his own butt.\n\nThe Mayor of Kingstown left me with some unresolved feelings and a dark optimism about its inhabitants' potential future.\n\nIf the show were to end like this, it would work in my favor. As is, I can imagine my own future for the characters. It would likely look different than what the show would do if it returned for another season.\n\nBut if Renner and his f'ed-up family return for another round, I'll enjoy revisiting Kingstown for more drama and conflicting joys of illegal justice.\n\nHow about you, readers? How did the third season finale leave you mentally? Do you hope for another season to get answers?

Read David Grann's 2004 New Yorker article \"The Brand\" (collected in his book The Devil and Sherlock Holmes). Grann digs into the history and pervasiveness of the Aryan Brotherhood, covering the efforts of federal law enforcement to control a violent criminal organization operating inside the U.S. penal system -- a place where, perversely, it's harder to get intel about what they're up to.\n\nWhat has allowed the AB to flourish is their utter disregard for any consequences. They're already in prison (often for life), so the threat of more prison is no deterrent. Guards don't scare them. Other prisoners don't scare them. They embrace violence as a first resort.\n\nSo in the Mayor of Kingstown season-three finale, \"Comeuppance,\" it's pretty obvious what will happen to Warden Kareem Moore when he tries to break up a gathering of Aryans in the yard without any backup. Earlier in the episode, we see Kareem sitting alone in his house with a pistol, and when the scene moved to the outside, I waited for the inevitable sound of a gunshot (like in so many other movies and TV shows, where characters shoot themselves just offscreen). Instead, Kareem waits until he goes into work, where he chooses suicide by white supremacist. He knows these goons won't listen to him when he tells them to disperse. He's expecting -- rightly -- to get shanked.\n\nThis is the first big death in \"Comeuppance.\" It's not the last.\n\nThough this finale is the longest episode of the season, it moves fleetly. Like the best Mayor of Kingstowns, it has the kind of narrow focus that aids narrative drive. The story is simple: Mike is ready to execute the second part of his \"settle all business\" plan, which involves steering the Russians into an ambush and then leaving control of Kingstown's criminal activity to Bunny and the Crips (so long as they promise never to stray outside the borders). Most of the action revolves around the Crips, KPD, and Mike springing that trap.\n\nJust like last week's bungled scheme to have Raphael murder Merle, complications ensue.\n\nFor one thing, although Mike doesn't know it yet, Milo is back; and he's executing his own plan of sabotage and power-consolidation. (He announces his presence with a little mind-game by having a disemboweled Roman hang from a railroad trestle, leaving the KPD to guess who's responsible.) There's also this: Evelyn has connected the dots on the dates when Ferguson checked the serial killer Charlie out of prison and has realized that one of them corresponds to the date the SWAT whistleblower Ben Morrissey was murdered.\n\nThe Charlie/Morrissey/Evelyn/Ferguson subplot may seem like a minor digression from the major power struggle going on in the Kingstown streets, but it actually has a huge impact on how that battle plays out. As soon as Ferguson comes clean to Mike, Kyle, and Sawyer about what he did and what Evelyn knows, panic sets in. Sawyer knows that Evelyn's digging could expose a lot of his past malfeasance, and Kyle knows that if he stands against his colleagues, he could be killed, too.\n\nEvelyn's story also cuts to the core of what Mayor of Kingstown has been about this season -- and maybe since season one. Mike has all these lies he tells himself to justify his life: that all kinds of evil are equally bad and that the inevitability of evil means that a practical man who wants to \"watch over those who can't take care of themselves\" has no choice but to decide which terrible person is the most trustworthy. But Evelyn, who grew up in Kingstown, is tired of these compromises. Crime is crime; and she's an ADA. She has the power to do something about a situation that has become untenable.\n\nAll of this has to be on Kyle and Sawyer's minds as they play their part in Mike's Russian/Bunny/ambush plot, zooming through Kingstown traffic with guns blazing to help wipe out the Russians. The op goes haywire (of course ... this is Kingstown, after all), and before long, Kyle finds himself watching in horror as an enraged Sawyer is shooting anyone who doesn't immediately comply with his commands, whether or not they're criminals. Kyle shoots Sawyer to stop him -- but he doesn't kill the man, and because the shooting was witnessed by other SWAT team members and multiple cell phone-wielding civilians, this season ends with Kyle being taken into custody on Evelyn's orders.\n\nIt's useful to think of Sawyer's rampage and Ferguson's extrajudicial assassination of Morrissey in the context of the Aryan Brotherhood's approach to solving problems. As cops, the KPD has what the Supreme Court has recognized as \"qualified immunity,\" which means that they have reason to believe that they can kill without repercussions, provided that they can come up with a good enough story for the courts.\n\nBut while this may be true to life, the freedom to murder doesn't always make for great drama. The best crime shows -- The Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad, Boardwalk Empire -- typically keep the body count as low as possible for as long as possible, because it's more exciting to watch people who violently oppose each other try to coexist. It's always bothered me that Mayor of Kingstown (like Yellowstone) is so quick to send inconvenient characters to an early grave.\n\nThat said, I have no problem with the three other big deaths that close out this episode and this season. When Milo finally reemerges, he calls Mike to Konstantin's yacht for a meeting, where he tells Iris that she can have the freedom Konstantin promised her, so long as she shoots the old Russian dead. This kind of ultimatum is silly, frankly. (If the goal is to end Konstantin's life, just go ahead and end it. Turning it into a test just wastes time and proves little.) But the result is righteous. Iris kills Konstantin and then tries to kill Milo -- who doesn't give her enough bullets to do so.\n\nMike then kills Milo when the creep starts talking about returning to his role as the head of the Russian mob and keeping Bunny consigned to his former turf. Mike's not going back to dealing with a man who would kill a busload of teen girls -- and who needles Mike by saying he's ultimately responsible for Mariam's death.\n\nOh, and on her way out of town, Iris ODs on pain pills. That's the final big death in this finale. We end the season with the KPD in disarray, the Russians depleted and leaderless, the Aryans still strong, and Bunny perhaps feeling inclined to seize this moment to expand his operation (despite Mike's orders).\n\nWhat does this all mean? Here's where \"Comeuppance\" hits its marks well, in smaller, quieter scenes, where the characters grapple with their goals and ideals. The episode opens and closes with another one of Mike's \"Gunsmoke voice-overs,\" where he recalls (while talking to the imprisoned Anna, as it turns out) how Mariam told him to do whatever he needed to do to survive in prison and then never looked at him the same when he came out.\n\nThere's a lot in this episode about the choices these characters have made in their lives and whether they really \"chose\" at all. Iris -- before numbing herself to oblivion -- insists she wanted to stay in Kingstown and be a bartering chip between Mike and Konstantin. And Konstantin -- before Milo tells him that their Russian mob bosses have no respect for him -- considers himself to be a good and loyal soldier. Fools, all of them.\n\nBut the most haunting moment in this episode comes before Kareem confronts the Aryans and ends his own life. While reviewing security cam footage from the day of the grenade attack, he realizes his protege Kevin helped facilitate the whole operation, and he warns the young man that Bunny is not his friend and that doing him favors won't end well. \"It's a sin to profit off punishment,\" Kareem says. To which Kevin -- who may be green but isn't naive -- replies, \"Ain't that what the whole system's based on, sir?\"\n\n* The eye-rolling look on Mike's face when he gets a call from Iris and hears Milo's voice on the line is something else. In an instant, he realizes he's never actually been two steps ahead of his rivals, as he had assumed.\n\n* One last question as we wrap up this season: Is Mayor of Kingstown still a Taylor Sheridan show? He didn't have any writing or directing credits in season three. Granted, this doesn't mean he was a non-presence. He could've been doing writing passes on scripts and giving input in the writers' room and on the set. Television as a medium is so collaborative that it resists the kind of auteurist reading critics like to bring to art (although some big personalities like Sheridan do assert themselves as the authors of their work). Ultimately, because I wasn't there when this season was being made, I can't speak to anyone's individual contributions. I will note, though, that Dave Erickson is the credited screenwriter of season three's premiere and finale, which is usually a position reserved for the writer-producer who's actually running things. I'll also say that Mayor of Kingstown strikes me as a punchier, pulpier, less soapy show than Yellowstone.

With that, why not look towards the next question? We are of course curious to learn when a hypothetical future season could premiere, and there is quite a lot to get into there!\n\nFor starters, let's make it quite clear that this show, like many others on Paramount+, can actually be turned around in a fairly short amount of time. As for the reasoning behind it, let's just say that it has a lot to do with what sort of show that this is! We're not looking at a special-effects laden event like House of the Dragon or The Boys. Also, many of the episodes vary dramatically when it comes to their length, which means you are not having to churn out constant hour-long installments.\n\nIn theory, you could argue that the next season of Mayor of Kingstown could be ready to go by the summer of next year. As for whether or not that will actually happen, it's a totally different story. A lot obviously is going to depend on when a renewal happens, and then also the schedule of course of Jeremy Renner. He's someone who has certainly gone through a lot ever since his near-fatal accident and with him in particular, we tend to think that everything needs to be at his pace.\n\nAs for how many seasons theoretically this show could go on for, it certainly feels like the journey is far from over. We know that the original idea was for there to be far more than four seasons, but we'll have to wait and see if that happens.\n\nRelated - See an even larger discussion on the future of Mayor of Kingstown now\n\nBe sure to share right now in the attached comments!

As is par for the course with the dark world of the fictional Michigan city, there was a lot of bloodshed and death as well as characters questioning their respective futures. Not too shabby for a show that found itself in a very real, fragile position last year when star Jeremy Renner, who plays beleaguered Mike McLusky, was injured in a snowplow accident that left him with blunt chest trauma and 38 broken bones.\n\nBut, like the heroes he's known for playing in much of his career, Renner was determined to recover and get back to his \"Mayor of Kingstown\" character, who is the center of the corrupt and dangerous world in the Paramount+ series created by Taylor Sheridan (\"Yellowstone\") and Hugh Dillon, who also stars in the series as morally challenged detective Ian Ferguson.\n\nFollowing the finale (with no word yet on a fourth season pick-up) Dillon talked to us about what he did to get the recovering Renner excited to return to work, as well as Dillon's own connection to the world portrayed in the series. Also, since the episode saw the deaths of the villainous Milo Sunter (Aiden Gillen), as well as more tragic ends for long-time characters Iris (Emma Laird) and Capt. Kareem Moore (Michael Beach), the question is: Are these characters gone for good? Dillon clued us in on that, and a potential fourth season.\n\nYou really packed a lot into the finale, with so many big moments and threads left dangling for a potential next season. How was it to pull together, especially after the past year or so for Jeremy Renner?\n\nYou know, it isn't just a show, and Taylor has given us all this opportunity to tell these stories. This season was really just about empowering Jeremy from what he was coming back from. I talked to his mom, and it really drove us to say \"OK, you're going to go from wheelchair to walkers, and we hope we get there.\" Then we realize we're shooting in winter in Pittsburgh, and he's got two tons of titanium in him, so now that's a bit of a problem. It was just dodging all these bullets. I wanted Jeremy and his mom to read these scripts so they aren't thinking about their problems, but thinking, \"I want to get going!\" We all had a common call, which was support Jeremy.\n\nAnd with these actors, you want them to have something that is real and not just pedestrian. so they bring it and they leave everything on the field. There is something that is just beautiful about the human experience, and to watch Jeremy -- in the beginning, he was worried. His mom was worried. You know, if you want to do this, commit. We're going to dig in. And [Jeremy] was like, \"I think I'll get there.\" He had mobility issues, but he worked every single day after we shot. We had a gym put in for him. He worked so fucking hard.\n\nLet's talk about some of the big moments in the finale starting with your character, Ian. After he killed Charlie (Kenny Johnson) in last week's episode, there are questions coming up now about what happened. Will this haunt him moving forward?\n\nIt's a thing! There's no doubt about it. I have a friend of mine who is a prison guard, and sometimes you take [a prisoner] out to look for stuff and sometimes you bond with them. I will say that to get Kenny Johnson to work on this show it's, again, one of those things I am just so grateful to be a part of that -- and then to have that twist.\n\nIt wasn't \"Oh, we're going to do this\" -- the setup was two years coming, and that's what Taylor taught me. These are movies, they're films. Let them breathe, let them play out. They don't have to be tied up in one episode. Christoph Schrewe, our director, is so dialed in, and he really helped shape that scene cinematically.\n\nAnd then there are a number of big deaths in the episode. Kareem walking into the prison yard knowing he'll be killed, and then Iris committing suicide by taking those pills on the bus. Are we saying goodbye to these characters for good? It's a season finale, so you never know.\n\nYou should say goodbye. Taylor taught me this, and this is how we operate. This is about life. The opium epidemic. I grew up in a prison town, and no one is safe and nothing is sacred. And if you grasp that, it can be a grief-driven experience, but you have to put those real-life markers in, or else it's just a show. Those are real things that people deal with. I'm from a prison town, so I've been dealing with these things for years. And I've had a very close relationship with suicide -- like friends who have committed suicide, and opiates. And you've got to mine those experiences. You can't just gloss over them, and that's what I bring. I understand this world and these people, and it's our job to go deep and hit hard and not gloss over it.\n\nSo, just to confirm, we're saying goodbye to those characters?\n\nYes. If we did anything else, that would be corruption. Creative corruption. Because that is the end. So to come back and say, \"Oh, she was just sleeping...\" They are dead. This is what happens. It's a tragedy. We know these people, and we understand. To pretend it didn't happen would be a disservice to all of us.\n\nLet me ask you about shooting that massive shootout on the bridge at night. How long did that take to shoot?\n\nWell, we prepped and prepped for that. We thought about that [scene] long ago. Taylor Sheridan dropped that in early. Taylor just knows. Last year, he called me: \"You know, the Kenny Johnson thing? Yeah, I like that. I got some great ideas. Here's what I'm thinking, then if you can get us there, we'll retrofit the bridge.\" And then we figured out the Kyle and the Robert thing [where Kyle shoots Robert on the bridge].\n\nTaylor also knew Christoph Schrewe, the German filmmaker, who killed it, and shot [the scenes] like \"Apocalypse Now.\" He can dial in emotion and action, and is just a great human being. And then we got this great team in Pittsburgh and people said, \"This is too ambitious' or \"You can't do that.\" Ambition is a code for \"We don't think we can do it.\"\n\nBut this is Jeremy Renner and Taylor Sheridan. You want them to look at their work and what their names are on, and how they've enabled us to succeed.\n\nNot everything is tied up in a nice bow at the end of the season. Will we get answers to all the stories left dangling? A fourth season hasn't officially been announced, but I can't imagine it wouldn't happen, right?\n\nIt's a bit clich\u00e9, but from your mouth to God's ears.\n\nAssuming the stories continues, what does the future hold for Mike? He talks a lot in the finale about evil and forgiveness, and returning to himself. Is that anything that's possible in this world?\n\nI think it's a thing that we all hold onto, so we don't just give up. So many of us and the characters are predisposed to their darker impulses, and they're very desensitized. But you've got to have hope. That's what it is. It's going back to hoping that Iris can make it out. And hoping that Kyle [Taylor Handley] can have a better life than [his brother] Mike has. It's all those family issues, and how do you absorb loss and defeat and compromise?

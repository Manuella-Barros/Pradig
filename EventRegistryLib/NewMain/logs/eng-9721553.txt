The full-back spent six years in the academy before making his senior debut back in 2018.\n\nIn 2021, he was sold to Rayo Vallecano where he got a proper taste of first-team football and was then re-signed by the club last summer.\n\nThe 24-year-old has been in and out of the starting XI under Carlo Ancelotti and has been linked with the likes of Brentford and Bournemouth this summer.\n\nMayoral was in the Real Madrid system for 15 years, but only made a total of 33 appearances for the club before he left in 2022.\n\nHe spent most of his time out on loan, but eventually left on a permanent basis to join Getafe a couple of years ago.\n\nHaving bagged 15 goals in La Liga last season, Jude Bellingham was the only Real Madrid player who outscored Mayoral in 2023-24.\n\nLienhart only spent a short time in the Real Madrid academy, but still manages to qualify for this list because of his market value today.\n\nSince leaving Spain in 2018, Lienhard has settled down at SC Freiburg where he still plays today. He's also racked up 27 appearances for Austria in that time too.\n\nREAD: Where are they now? The 11 players who left Real Madrid alongside Cristiano Ronaldo in 2018\n\nNow playing on the opposite side of Madrid, Morata has enjoyed quite the career. As a kid, he spent time in both the Real Madrid and Atletico academies before turning pro in 2010.\n\nImpressively, he's Spain's fourth-highest-scoring player of all time and currently captains the national team too.\n\nHe's also come back to haunt Real Madrid on multiple occasions. In 12 appearances against his former employers, he's managed to bag six goals.\n\nThe Argentine playmaker spent one year in the Real Madrid academy before he was picked up by Getafe in 2010.\n\nHe unfortunately missed the entirety of last season due to a serious knee injury, but he'll hopefully be back in the fold for Aston Villa next season.\n\nREAD NEXT: Where are they now? The 13 players Carlo Ancelotti sold during his first stint as Real Madrid boss\n\nTRY A QUIZ: Can you name every player to score 5+ Champions League goals for Real Madrid?\n\nBarrios spent his formative years in the Real Madrid academy before he made the switch across the city back in 2017.\n\nNow a fully-fledged Atletico Madrid player, the 21-year-old made 35 appearances last season and looks to have a bright future ahead of him.\n\nHaving impressed for Girona over the last couple of years, Real Madrid look set to re-purchase Gutierrez this summer via the buy-back clause that they inserted into the deal.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that Manchester United are reportedly keen on signing the left-back this summer and the likes of Borussia Dortmund, Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal have also been linked. Watch this space.\n\nAfter spending the last five years at Atletico Madrid, Hermoso now finds himself on the free agents pile upon his contract at the Metropolitano Stadium expiring last month.\n\nAs of writing, Inter Milan appear to be in pole position to land the 29-year-old on a free transfer.\n\nLlorente was on the books at Real Madrid from 2008 to 2019, but these days his name is synonymous with their local rivals instead.\n\nSince leaving to join Atletico Madrid in 2019, he's racked up over 200 appearances for the club and is one of the first names on the teamsheet under Diego Simeone.\n\nHakimi joined the Real Madrid set-up back in 2006 at the age of eight. He spent a total of 14 years at the club and managed to make 17 appearances before he was sold in 2020.\n\n\"Obviously, when you join Madrid for the first time and you come from playing for the Castilla, it is normal that the club doesn't bet on you so much because you're a young player,\" Hakimi told Marca in 2022.\n\n\"When I left for Inter, as part of the deal there was also a purchase option from Madrid and they didn't execute it, so I think they weren't betting on me as much as other clubs.\n\n\"I thought they were wrong.\"\n\nNow widely considered one of the best full-backs in the world, it's safe to say he's done alright for himself since leaving Real Madrid behind.", "source": {"uri": "planetfootball.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Planet Football"}, "authors":

France were knocked out of the tournament at the semi-final stage by Spain.\n\nLes Bleus led the tie through Randal Kolo Muani before 16-year-old sensation Lamine Yamal netted a spectacular equaliser. Dani Olmo's effort before half time ultimately proved the difference between the sides.\n\nMbappe managed just one goal in the tournament, and wore a protective mask for much of the competition after suffering a broken nose versus Austria. There were initially fears that the former Monaco star would miss the remainder of the tournament, but he quickly made his return.\n\n\"In football, you're good or not good. I wasn't good. My EURO was a failure,\" was Mbappe's blunt assessment of his Euro 2024 performance however.\n\nTeammate Adrien Rabiot, ahead of the semi-final, acknowledged that Mbappe had not reached the heights expected of him. \"For Kylian and Antoine, maybe their legs aren't as fresh as they could be, but we are 100 per cent behind them,\" he said.\n\n\"We have blind faith in them. They are players can change a game at any point. When we have the captain [Mbapp\u00e9] or Antoine experiencing a rough patch, it's fine, we are there to support them.\n\n\"But obviously, it would be easier if Kylian and Antoine were at the top of their game, which has not been the case so far. I think everyone is surprised because we know what he [Griezmann] is capable of.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Eduardo Camavinga takes on six after Nacho Fernandez's departure from the club, while Federico Valverde takes on Toni Kroos' eight following the German star's retirement following Euro 2024.\n\nAurelian Tchouameni will now wear 14, following Joselu's time in the top last season. The number has also been worn by Casemiro, Xabi Alonso and Guti.\n\nJesus Vallejo takes on Tchouameni's previous shirt, 18.

The Spanish champions unveiled the new jersey numbers for the upcoming campaign via an official statement on July 10.\n\n\"Several Real Madrid players will change their jersey numbers at the start of the 2024/25 season,\" the club wrote on its official website. Mbappe will follow in the footsteps of his childhood hero Cristiano Ronaldo, who was also given the No. 9 jersey after joining Real Madrid in 2009.\n\nThe Portuguese superstar, however, later switched to his favourite No. 7 that he first wore during his Manchester United career and has now become iconic for him. Now, Brazilian winger Vinicius Jr continues the legacy of Ronaldo at the Madrid-based club, wearing the legendary jersey number 7.\n\nBefore Mbappe, another Frenchman Karim Benzema had donned Real Madrid's No. 9 shirt for over a decade. The Ballon d'Or winner left the Spanish capital to join Saudi Pro League side Al Ittihad last summer.\n\nNo Real Madrid player had the privilege to wear the No. 9 jersey during the 2023-24 campaign. Mbappe will now take it over, having secured his dream transfer to Real Madrid from home club Paris Saint Germain. The World Cup winner used to wear the classic No. 10 at PSG.\n\nReal Madrid have changed the shirt numbers of a few more players for the next season. Uruguayan star Fede Valverde will now take charge of the No. 8 jersey, succeeding Toni Kroos, who took his retirement after winning the Champions League last season.

Apart from Mbappe, Real Madrid also revealed that their midfielder Eduardo Camavinga will take over the jersey number 6, which was left vacant by Nacho Fernandes, who made a transfer to SPL side AL Qadsiah. On the other hand, Federico Valverde will also be taking over the number 8 kit, after club legend Toni Kroos announced his retirement from professional football.\n\nAfter a six-year-long dramatic transfer saga, Mbappe completed a free transfer to Real Madrid, in what can arguably be considered as the next level of his already record-filled footballing career. As for the kit number, one would ideally think that Mbappe would ideally don the number 10 jersey, which he features in for the France national team, or the iconic number 7 jersey which was previously donned by his idol Cristiano Ronaldo at the club and is now by the in-form Vinicius Jr.\n\nRenowned Italian sports journalist Fabrizio Romano has even gone to the extent of revealing that Mbappe had not even enquired about the availability of the no.10, as he wishes to honour Luka Modric's rich legacy at the club so far. While Modric is speculated to be extending his currently expiring contract at the Santiago Bernabeu for one more season, the Croatian has also hinted at his potential retirement with Real Madrid, similar to his midfield partner Kroos.\n\nAfter having a forgetful Euro 2024 with France, Mbappe will be hoping to enjoy a fruitful opening season with Real Madrid and clinch his long-desired UEFA Champions League title with his new side.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Camavinga", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eduardo Camavinga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Valverde", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federico Valverde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Professional_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Professional League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Bernab\u00e9u_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portugal national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ittihad_Club_(Jeddah)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al-Ittihad Club (Jeddah)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacho_(footballer,_born_1990)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nacho (footballer, born 1990)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karim_Benzema", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karim Benzema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toni_Kroos", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toni Kroos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin\u00edcius_J\u00fanior", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squad_number_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Squad number (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Modri\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Modri\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cristiano Ronaldo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Education and Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202407/kylian-mbappe-105426971-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=1afDFcAvNyBO.c3xjVog9PQW.qMSNM9W", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721553", "eventUri": "eng-9721553", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 270, "textEnd": 276}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 419, "textEnd": 426}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

It arrived a bit late in my career, but I can tell you I enjoyed playing for Real Madrid and winning the trophies we won in the best way you can imagine.\"\n\nLast season felt like a dreamland for Joselu, a boyhood Madrid fan who ended the campaign knowing he would be a part of their folklore forever after the night he had against Bayern Munich on May 8.\n\nWith Madrid on the verge of getting knocked out of the Champions League semi-finals in their own stadium, Joselu was thrown on to perform a rescue mission with nine minutes of the 90 to go. There were just two minutes between his two goals which turned the tie around and sent Madrid to Wembley, where they beat Borussia Dortmund.\n\n\"(Madrid manager Carlo) Ancelotti told me to stay in the box and try to get anything I could,\" Joselu says of that 2-1 comeback win against Bayern. \"I had the luck to find a couple of balls in there and score, and after that day everything changed -- for the club but also for me.\"\n\nA man for the big occasion, Joselu was again in the picture for another dramatic late goal for the ages last Friday: Mikel Merino's header from Dani Olmo's cross in the final minute of extra time as Spain beat tournament hosts Germany -- also the country of Joselu's birth -- in their Euros quarter-final.\n\n\"I promise you, just five minutes before the goal, I spoke to Dani about that exact move,\" Joselu says.\n\n\"When Olmo plays as a left-winger, we all know he likes to cut inside to his right foot and look for a ball into the box. I told him that I would always go to try and pin the further centre-back -- to make him mark me individually. That way, there would be a free space just at his back for someone to attack.\n\n\"Then, it was all down to Olmo and his magnificent cross. It went just over (now former Madrid team-mate Antonio) Rudiger and I was being marked by (Waldemar) Anton, the other centre-back. This created the space for Mikel to crash into the box, as he does, and to head it home.\"\n\nThe clarity with which Joselu recalls the whole sequence is impressive, and the joy in his voice as he does so is clear. It reflects what this group of players and coach Luis de La Fuente have achieved over the past month: there's been at least one moment in which practically every member of the 26-man squad has felt relevant in this run to the semi-finals.\n\n\"That was the biggest priority of the manager,\" Joselu says. \"I spoke with him many times about how we should contribute to the team. The first day I joined the squad, I told him that, for me, the most important thing was daily life and harmony with the team. Keeping it all healthy and competitive. He totally agreed with me.\n\n\"I think he's built a family here, which is basically what has brought us to this point. We've won the UEFA Nations League on the way, showed some outstanding performances, and the human group assembled here has been the difference-maker.\"\n\nDuring the Euros, Joselu has changed clubs.\n\nHe spent last season on loan at Madrid from Espanyol, after the Catalan side were relegated to the second tier.\n\nThe deal included a \u20ac1.5million (\u00a31.3m; $1.6m at current exchange rates) purchase option for Madrid, and a few months ago it seemed like he would be staying in the Spanish capital. Instead, he has joined Qatari club Al Gharafa, although only after Madrid exercised their option, then sold him on immediately for the same price to respect his wishes.\n\nAccording to sources close to the negotiations, who preferred to speak anonymously to protect relationships, the three-year contract he signed comes with the biggest salary of his career. The transfer is not without controversy, as players who have moved to the Qatari league have faced criticism for going to a country whose human-rights record has attracted condemnation from Amnesty International and other groups.\n\n\"I had really tight margins defined by the option Real Madrid had on me, which was expiring, so I had to address this situation now,\" says Joselu on the inconvenience of deciding his future while on Spain duty.\n\n\"The decision was so tough to make. Many people called me crazy for saying no to Real Madrid. In the end, it is a decision that I thought long and hard over and made with my family.\"\n\nOne of Joselu's closest confidantes throughout the year has been his Madrid and Spain team-mate (and brother-in-law, with the pair having also played together for Madrid's reserve team as youngsters over a decade ago) Dani Carvajal.\n\n\"We spoke a lot,\" Joselu says. \"I know Dani is sad because we were spending every day together with our families, and now we won't. But he understands the reasons behind my choice. Real Madrid has a bright future ahead with plenty of young players who will deliver more titles and great memories, and we (he and his family) believed it was a convenient time for me to go.\"\n\nWith right-back Carvajal suspended for the semi-final having been sent off in the final seconds of the Germany game, 38-year-old Jesus Navas is set to come into the team as Spain attempt to cope with France's biggest attacking threat, and new Madrid signing, Kylian Mbappe.\n\n\"We all know how good Dani has been. For me, he should be a Ballon d'Or contender,\" says Joselu, who is expected to be on the bench again in Munich tonight. \"His performances at Euro 2024 have been outstanding, but we also have a deep enough squad to make sure any replacement can fill the bill perfectly.\n\n\"People say Mbappe has not been playing great (his only goal in the tournament was a penalty), but then he can come up in a game and change everything. We have to be aware of that.\"\n\nAs anyone who's watched them in this competition will know, Spain also have game-changing talent in their ranks -- wingers Lamine Yamal and Nico Williams especially. Joselu has played a key role in helping the two youngsters settle with the national team.\n\nThe match against Brazil in March illustrated this perfectly. Yamal was given some rough treatment that night at Madrid's Bernabeu, and Joselu ran from the bench to defend the 16-year-old Barcelona forward as tensions spilt over.\n\n\"That game was a friendly, but it got heated and there were some actions that were not needed,\" he says. \"I quickly stood up to protect him. I would do that for any squad member we have here. We were close to the Euros (at that time) and a bad tackle could rule you out.\n\n\"On Lamine, I was so impressed during his first call-up. How he dares to do everything, the willingness to learn and work, his attitude is so good. He is of course so young and promising, and it is our duty to take care of him.\n\n\"The veterans need to show younger players which path is the right one to follow. Those team call-ups in major tournaments are a good experience for them to discover what's coming in the next 15 years of their careers. It also involves managing them in training sessions, because we don't want to be pushing too much now and putting his future at risk.\"\n\nWhen asked about Williams, Joselu isn't short of praise either and does not hesitate to put the 21-year-old among the best in business in his position.\n\n\"When we met him in La Liga last season we already realised he is an absolute rocket of a player,\" he says. \"In every game against Athletic Bilbao, we analysed him individually, he is so dangerous with the one-on-ones and has now added goalscoring and chance-creating to his game. Nico can leave any full-back in the world with nightmares.\"\n\nWillians and Yamal are the faces of the new Spain, who are for some the team to beat at Euro 2024, and for most neutrals are its most enjoyable side to watch. They will now take on a pragmatic France team who have scored only three times in their five games (and not once from open play; the three being Mbappe's penalty and two own goals), while conceding just once.\n\n\"Everyone can have their opinions. I understand France might not be playing as some people were expecting,\" Joselu says. \"But the only thing I know is that they are in the semi-finals of the Euros. That's all that matters to me. To get there, you must have done something good. When you are just one step away from playing in a final, I don't think what has happened before has that much of an impact.\n\n\"It will be tough, but don't doubt it: we will be ready.\"", "source":

Despite often being seen as the ultimate players' coach rather than an elite tactician, he excels in both roles.\n\nAncelotti's tactical adaptability is frequently underestimated, much like Mbappe's versatility. Hence, wether it is the centre-forward role, or on the flanks, the former Chelsea boss knows best how to utilise his new star man, and Mbappe in turn is versatile enough to adapt.\n\nPotential Ballon d'Or?\n\nThroughout his career, Ancelotti has consistently devised innovative solutions to integrate superstars into his teams. At AC Milan, he skillfully fit four elite midfielders -- Andrea Pirlo, Clarence Seedorf, Rui Costa, and Kaka -- into three available positions, ensuring each player's immense potential was fully realized.\n\nKaka is among the four Ballon d'Or winners who have earned the accolade under Ancelotti's management, the highest for any coach. During his tenure at Milan, the Brazilian secured the award in 2007, while Andriy Shevchenko won it in 2004. At Madrid, Cristiano Ronaldo claimed two of his five Ballon d'Or titles in 2013 and 2014 under Ancelotti, and Karim Benzema won it in 2022.\n\nBar the 2020 pandemic where the award was cancelled, Mbappe has consistently finished in the top 10 every year since 2017 and finished third in the last nominations behind Erling Haaland and Lionel Messi.\n\nWith his move to Madrid now completed, Mbappe's name will definitely be brought up in the discussion and it is only a matter of when, not if, for the France International to clinch the prestigious award.\n\nMore goals for Madrid next season\n\nThe missing link for some time has been a clinical goal-scorer -- a third offensive force to create opportunities and space for Vinicius Jr., Jude Bellingham, and Rodrygo Goes.\n\nRecall the first leg at the Bernabeu against Manchester City in the Champions League, where Madrid squandered numerous chances, and the second leg where Vinicius was left isolated during transitions. Mbappe significantly raises the team's potential in such scenarios and fans with Real Madrid tickets are excited to see how the Frenchman can impact the team.\n\nMbappe is the type of player who can elevate this already outstanding team to new heights. His magnetic presence, dribbling skills, goal-scoring ability, link-up play, and passing are all top-notch, leaving defenders bewildered and trailing behind.\n\nIn the 2023-24 season, Jude Bellingham, Rodrygo, and Vinicius Junior collectively netted 59 goals across all competitions.\n\nMbappe alone scored 44 goals last season in just 48 matches, more than double the individual tally of Madrid's current attacking trio.\n\nThe France captain is not merely a scorer of spectacular goals; he is a prolific goal-scorer of crucial goals at the crucial moment and an embodiment of the phrase 'cometh the hour, cometh the man'.\n\nChampions League domination\n\nAt 25, Mbappe has already participated in two World Cup finals, winning one and delivering one of the most remarkable individual performances ever in an international final in the other. Despite repeated shortcomings in the Champions League, he has never been part of a team like the one he is about to join. This current Madrid squad has a strong core that can stabilize the team on both ends of the field. As Mbappe enters his prime, he adds the final missing piece -- a prolific scorer who can significantly increase the team's margin for error.\n\nConsider how Madrid secured their last two Champions League titles, enduring a gruelling run that saw them surpass teams like PSG, Chelsea, Manchester City, Liverpool, RB Leipzig, Bayern Munich, and Borussia Dortmund. In 2022, Madrid outscored their knockout stage opponents 15-12. In 2024, the margin was 11-8.\n\nLast season, during the seven knockout matches, Madrid secured three victories in regulation time: against Leipzig and Bayern at home, and Dortmund in the final.\n\nThis tally is bound to increase with Mbappe's inclusion as more goals would be scored and more matches would be won in regulation time irrespective of the opponent, reminiscent of the Galacticos.\n\nHowever, there remains one problem: Manchester City.\n\nMain rivals\n\nCity has been Los Blancos' biggest threat in the past couple of seasons. A comeback win in the 2021-22 season after Pep Guardiola had taken off his key players relieved the pressure on Madrid, who turned the game around to win 6-5 on aggregate.\n\nAnother intense clash in the 2022-23 season saw a feisty 1-1 draw at the Santiago Bernabeu before City completely dismantled the Champions League holders 4-0 at the Etihad Stadium.\n\nIt seems the winner of this tie is almost guaranteed the trophy, as Madrid once again defeated the Cityzens on penalties en route to their Champions League triumph last season.\n\nFor Madrid to sustain their perpetual, seemingly endless dynasty, they will need to overcome the challenge posed by Pep Guardiola's side each year. This squad is now constructed to defeat teams of that calibre.\n\nIn La Liga, no team came close to matching them. The Champions League proved more challenging, but the team still managed to advance.\n\nIn the upcoming season, Madrid are anticipated to dominate Spain once again. They lost only one match last season, boasting a goal difference of 61 - the highest in the league, having scored an impressive 87 goals and conceded just 26.\n\nMORE NEWS....

Understandably, every ardent Madridista wants to add Mbappe's No. 9 jersey to their collection as soon as possible, leading to a massive queue on the Real Madrid online store.\n\nAs things stand, fans will have to wait up to six weeks to get their Mbappe merchandise, meaning some will not have their swanky new kit before Real Madrid's UEFA Super Cup clash with Atalanta on August 14.\n\nRecord 15-time European champions Real Madrid announced Mbappe's signing before the 2024 European Championship (EURO 2024) in Germany. However, with the 25-year-old solely focusing on helping France in EURO 2024, the club postponed the unveiling ceremony.\n\nOn Wednesday (July 10), a day after France lost 2-1 to Spain in the EURO semi-final, Real Madrid announced they will officially present the player at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium on July 16. The club also confirmed Mbappe would don Karim Benzema's No. 9 jersey and made his 2024-25 kit available for purchase through their retail and online stores.\n\nMadridistas rushed to the online stores to get their hands on the kit, causing inventory depletion and backlogs. On Thursday, Madrid's official online store said fans would have to wait for up to six weeks to get their Mbappe jersey.\n\nThe official statement from the online store read (via ESPN):\n\n\"Due to the current high demand, items from this collection may have a delivery delay of up to 4-6 additional weeks, regardless of the shipping method selected.\n\n\"This delay will affect both orders exclusive to the Mbapp\u00e9 collection and those combining products from the Mbapp\u00e9 collection with other products from the online store.\"\n\nFans need to shell out a cool $215 to get an \"authentic\" Mbappe jersey -- identical to what he will wear on Matchdays. The fan version, meanwhile, retails at $150.\n\nMbappe may not join Real Madrid's pre-season right away, as he spent the majority of his summer representing France in EURO 2024. However, he is likely to play at least one pre-season match -- either against Barcelona (July 31) or Chelsea (August 3) -- before taking to the field in the UEFA Super Cup.", "source": {"uri": "sportslens.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportslens.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sushan_chakraborty@sportslens.com", "name": "Sushan Chakraborty", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atalanta_B.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atalanta B.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Bernab\u00e9u_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Super_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Super Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karim_Benzema", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karim Benzema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Education and Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Real_Estate", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Real Estate", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://sportslens.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Kylian-Mbappe-Real-Madrid.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721553", "eventUri": "eng-9721553", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-14", "textStart": 466, "textEnd": 475}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 749, "textEnd": 756}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-16", "textStart": 918, "textEnd": 925}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 2104, "textEnd": 2111}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-03", "textStart": 2125, "textEnd": 2133}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

The day will begin at the club's training facilities at Valdebebas for the official signing of his contract alongside president Florentino P\u00e9rez, where he will also be welcomed by other members of the board.\n\nFrom there, he will travel across the city to the Bernab\u00e9u, where he will be presented to fans and press at the stadium. Entry is free to spectators, though the 12:00pm timing means that attendance may be lower than some had initially hoped with an evening presentation. The decision to bring forward the time came down to compatibility with upcoming events, with work required to prepare the arena for upcoming concerts later in the week.\n\nFollowing his presentation to fans in the ground, he will hold a press conference and address the international press alongside representatives of the club. That will bring a close to his presentation, with a huge amount of excitement already generated.\n\nThe French national team captain has also confirmed that he will don the number nine jersey for Real Madrid, being the first man to wear it since the departure of his compatriot and former France team-mate Karim Benzema.\n\nIt will be a new jersey number for Mbapp\u00e9, who has most recently worn the number 10 for his country and the number seven for Paris Saint-Germain. He has only worn the number nine on one occasion, in February 2017, against FC Chambly Oise in the Coupe de France de football.\n\nHe is not the only one to change his jersey number, with Fede Valverde taking over Toni Kroos' number eight jersey. Also changing are Eduardo Camavinga, who replaces Nacho in the number six, Aureli\u00e9n Tchouameni as he changes to number 14, while Arda G\u00fcler moves to 15 and Jes\u00fas Vallejo takes over the 18 following his return from a loan from Granada.\n\nMbapp\u00e9 suffered a broken nose in his first outing with France at Euro 2024 against Austria, and has since been playing with a face mask to protect his face until the game against Spain, when he played without one.\n\nThe forward had complained of the discomfort and restricted vision of wearing the mask, which many attributed to his poor form, with only one goal in the tournament coming from the penalty spot.\n\nFollowing a medical examination on Tuesday, Real Madrid's medical team will determine whether or not Mbapp\u00e9 should undergo surgery to correct the injury. That could impact his potential debut date, otherwise he will likely target August 14th, and the UEFA European Super Cup against Atalanta, as his potential first outing in a Real Madrid jersey.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Bernab\u00e9u_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florentino_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florentino P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karim_Benzema", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karim Benzema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Camavinga", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eduardo Camavinga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jes\u00fas_Vallejo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jes\u00fas Vallejo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacho_(footballer,_born_1990)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nacho (footballer, born 1990)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granada_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Granada CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arda_Turan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arda Turan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atalanta_B.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atalanta B.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupe_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coupe de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Super_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Super Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toni_Kroos", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toni Kroos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Valverde", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federico Valverde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/668ea4073f18ecfe2da5e515/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721553", "eventUri": "eng-9721553", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-16", "textStart": 509, "textEnd": 518}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-14", "textStart": 2962, "textEnd": 2973}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-02-", "textStart": 1888, "textEnd": 1901}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

As for compensation, the Texans and Rams will reportedly swap sixth- and seventh-round picks in 2026.\n\nThe 26-year-old has only played for the Rams, having been selected by L.A. in the seventh round of the 2021 NFL Draft out of Notre Dame. Skowronek caught just eight passes for 66 yards and his first career touchdown in 2023, but did put together a career campaign in 2022 with 376 receiving yards on 39 receptions.

Over three NFL seasons, Skowronek has also recorded 22 combined tackles.\n\nIn Houston, Skowronek will compete with a loaded room that includes Stefon Diggs, Tank Dell, Noah Brown, Nico Collins, Xavier Hutchinson, Johnny Johnson III, John Metchie III, Steven Sims, Jared Wayne and the veteran Robert Woods.

But Similar to how the trade transpired with the Bengals for running back Joe Mixon, the Texans got on the phone and worked out a deal to acquire Skowronek before his release would be official, according to NFL Network's Tom Pelissero.\n\nThe Texans and Rams swapped 2026 sixth- and seventh-round picks in the trade, per NFL Network's Ian Rapoport.\n\nSkowronek is much more than a wide receiver, though. Here's what he brings to the Texans offense.\n\nSkowronek was drafted in the seventh by the Rams at pick No. 249 back in 2021. He played in 14 games during his rookie season where he saw 19% of the offensive snaps and 53% of the snaps on special teams.\n\nHe started 11 games while seeing action in 14 the following year. Skowronek played on 82% of the offensive snaps in those games and only 12% of the special teams snaps as he caught 39 passes for 376 yards. His catch rate improved year-over-year from 55% to 64%.\n\nSkowronek's offensive role diminished in 2023 with the addition of stellar rookie receiver Puka Nacua. Skowronek saw action in all 17 games but saw his roles on offense and special teams flip with him playing only 19% of the offensive snaps as compared to 71% of the special teams reps.\n\nSkowronek is more than a receiver. At 6-foot-3 and 224 pounds, the Rams would use him at fullback and even targeted him out of the backfield in 2022. Skowronek also had a rushing touchdown for 17 yards that season. He returned kicks as a rookie in 2021 with four returns for 70 yards.\n\nAs previously mentioned, he also has a lot of special teams experience. Skowronek tied for the team lead with six special team tackles during his rookie year and tied for the NFL lead with 13 special teams tackles in 2023. The new kickoff rules also adds value to Skowronek with the Texans, who love versatility.\n\nNow he'll join one of the best special teams units in the NFL under coordinator Frank Ross. The offense also gets a big-body receiver to provide depth behind Nico Collins, Tank Dell and Stefon Diggs. There will be plenty of ways to get value out of Skowronek in the last year of his contract.\n\nReceiver Robert Woods could lose his job after this acquisition.

In order to make this deal happen, the two teams will swap 2026 sixth-and-seventh-round picks\n\nSkowronek, a former seventh-round pick from Notre Dame, joined the Rams in 2021.

The #Rams are sending WR Ben Skowronek to the #Texans, per sources.\n\nSkowronek, who will turn 27 in June, is entering the final year of the rookie contract signed after being selected by the Rams in Round 7 of the 2021 draft out of Notre Dame.\n\nAs a rookie in 2021 Skowronek was a member of the Super Bowl winning Rams team, playing a then career high 46 snaps after O'dell Beckham Jr. tore his ACL and left the 23-20 win over the Cincinnati Bengals in the second quarter.\n\nListed at 6'3', 224 pounds, Skowronek is a big-bodied receiver who struggled to see the field in Los Angeles. That should not come as a surprise, given the presence of Cooper Kupp, Puka Nacua and Tutu Atwell on the roster of the Rams roster.\n\nAdd in the Rams use of a sixth round pick on wide receiver Jordan Whittington out of Texas in the draft this offseason, and the route to playing time for Skowronek in Los Angeles for the 2024 season is certainly uncertain.\n\nHowever, while Skowronek might have had trouble finding snaps for the Rams, he can address some of the special teams snaps Houston lost in free agency, while providing depth at wide receiver.\n\nAlso, Skowronek occasionally lined up at both fullback and tight end during his time with the Rams, according to PFF.com. Neither of those are positions of immediate need for the Texans, with Dalton Schultz and Andrew Beck solidly in place, but it never hurts to add positional flexibility to keep a defense on its toes.\n\nThis has not gone unnoticed by fans and observers, many of whom quickly took to social media to share their opinions on Skowronek's fit with the Texans, first as a receiver.\n\nIn addition, after three seasons playing in Sean McVay's offense, it should not take long to learn the system used by Houston offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik. Slowik and McVay both spent several seasons working under Kyle Shanahan, and both run very similar systems. That should allow for a smooth and near seamless transition for Skowronek, with the biggest obstacle perhaps building chemistry with quarterback C.J. Stroud.\n\nCollins, Dell and Diggs are the unquestioned front three in the receiver room for Houston, and acquisition of Skowronek does nothing to change that. However, it could easily spell the end for Robert Woods as a member of the Texans.\n\nWoods turned 32 earlier this offseason, and is no longer the threat he once was. He has not recorded more than 556 receiving yards in a season since 2020, when he hauled in 90 passes for 936 yards and 6 touchdowns. Add in a catch rate of 53.3% in 2023, the second lowest catch rate of his career and lowest since his rookie season in 2013, and the writing is on the wall for Woods.\n\nIn all probability, though, the final nail in the coffin for Woods is cost. Woods is set to carry a cap hit of $9,705,882 for the 2024 season according to OverTheCap.com. That is a significant cap hit for receiver who is likely no higher than 4th on the depth chart and contributes very little on special teams. The Texans can save $4,955,882 of cap space in 2024 by releasing Woods, and the question now seems more likely to be about when, rather than about if, the team will make the move.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puka_Nacua", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Puka Nacua"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Skowronek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Skowronek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutu_Atwell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tutu Atwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Kupp", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cooper Kupp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Notre Dame Fighting Irish football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Beckham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Beckham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalton_Schultz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dalton Schultz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullback_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fullback (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_McVay", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sean McVay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Slowik", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bobby Slowik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Woods_(wide_receiver,_born_1992)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert Woods (wide receiver, born 1992)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Shanahan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Shanahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Skowronek-e1715289234102.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554032", "eventUri": "eng-9554032", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

He's also a strong special teams player, too, which could help plug the need on special teams for the Steelers.\n\nIf Skowronek is claimed by a team, he would have a base salary of $1,055,000. That would be his cap charge as well, making him a very affordable veteran to add to a receiver room and special teams units.\n\nMany of you reading this who might not be familiar with the Rams are probably going \"who?\" That's understandable. Skowronek isn't a big name.\n\nHowever, he checks quite a few boxes and connects a few dots when it comes to potential interest from the Steelers' perspective.\n\nFirst, his size. Skowronek checked in at 6027, 220 pounds at the 2021 NFL Scouting Combine coming out of Notre Dame. He certainly fits the criteria for what the Steelers typically look for from a size perspective at the position, but his 4.59 40-yard dash would have caused him to miss out on the \"what they look for\" study that Alex Kozora so wonderfully does every year from a position standpoint.\n\nThat size translated well to the NFL for Skowronek, who landed with the Rams as a seventh-round pick in the 2021 NFL Draft. With the Rams, his best season as a receiver came in 2022 when he hauled in 39 receptions for 376 yards and added one carry for 17 yards and a touchdown.\n\nDuring that 2022 season, he played 698 offensive snaps for the Rams and graded out at a 57.2 overall, including a 54.6 as a run blocker. In three seasons with the Rams, Skowronek hauled in 58 passes for 575 yards and one touchdown, adding three receptions for 17 yards in the playoffs, including two catches for 12 yards in 2021 as the Rams went on to win the Super Bowl.\n\nWhere he made his mark under Sean McVay was with his versatility.\n\nSkowronek lined up at fullback on 68 snaps over his career under McVay, including 60 during the 2022 season. He also has experience lining up as an in-line tight end under McVay, doing that on 39 snaps over three seasons, according to Pro Football Focus.\n\nHe cut his teeth the most on special teams though, which is where he could really stick in the NFL moving forward. Last season alone, Skowronek tied for the league lead in tackles on special teams with 13 stops (11 solo, two assisted), tying with Pittsburgh's Miles Killebrew and New England's Brenden Schooler, two players with All-Pro capabilities on special teams.\n\nIn his career, Skowronek has 569 career snaps on special teams, including a career-high 327 last season in Los Angeles. That special teams ability, combined with his versatility offensively and his experience, will help him land on his feet in the NFL after being waived by the Rams.\n\nThat spot could be in Pittsburgh. The dots connect from a pre-draft interest standpoint.\n\nAccording to Steelers Depot's Alex Kozora, Skowronek told him at the 2021 Senior Bowl that he met with the Steelers during the week in Mobile. Then, head coach Mike Tomlin and then-GM Kevin Colbert attended the 2021 Notre Dame Pro Day, where Skowronek participated.\n\nThough the Steelers didn't host Skowronek for a pre-draft visit or hold a Zoom meeting with him, it doesn't mean they aren't familiar with the player overall.\n\nWith a need for a big-bodied receiver with blocking abilities, not to mention special teams capabilities in an effort to replace Miles Boykin, Skowronek makes quite a bit of sense for the Steelers were they to kick the tires on the veteran receiver with a waiver claim.\n\nRelated Items:Ben Skowronek, Los

Skowronek had a career-best year in 2022 with the Rams. The Rams have WR depth for 2024 with the return of Puka Nacua and Cooper Kupp.\n\nThe back-and-forth over the football fate of Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Ben Skowronek ended with the four-year veteran finding a new home via a trade, with the Rams sending Skowronek and a seventh-round draft pick to the Houston Texans in exchange for sixth and seventh round pick swaps in 2026, per NFL Network's Tom Pelissero and Ian Rapoport.\n\nThe trade moves were first reported just hours after The Athletic's Diana Russini had posted that Skowronek had been released by the Rams.\n\nSkowronek was a seventh-round draft pick by the Rams out of Notre Dame in 2021 and won a Super Bowl as a rookie, snagging two receptions for 12 yards in a 23-20 win over the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl 56.\n\nSkowronek had his best season with the Rams in 2022, with 39 receptions for 376 receiving yards in 11 starts. Rams head coach Sean McVay also lined Skowronek up at fullback, where he scored his only NFL touchdown so far on a 17-yard run.\n\nRelated Top 10 Los Angeles Rams of All Time The Los Angeles Rams are the only NFL franchise to win a world championship in three different cities thanks to these legendary players. Rams Return 2 Star WRs in Nakua, Cupp Texans build on the strength of their WR room\n\nOne position the Rams appear set at in 2024 is wide receiver, where 2023 fifth-round pick Puka Nacua returns after setting NFL rookie records for receptions (105), receiving yards (1,486), single-game receptions (15), and most receiving yards in a playoff game (181) while earning second-team NFL All-Pro and Pro Bowl.\n\nAlso back and presumably healthy is 2021 NFL Offensive Player of the Year Cooper Kupp, who has missed 15 games over the last two seasons due to injuries. Kupp had one of the greatest seasons for a wide receiver in NFL history in 2021 with 145 receptions for 1,947 receiving yards and 16 touchdowns, becoming just the fourth player since 1966 to win the receiving triple crown.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Stat: The Los Angeles Rams have drafted two NFL All-Pro wide receivers in the last decade without having to use a first-round pick -- 2023 fifth-round pick Puka Nacua and 2017 third-round pick Cooper Kupp. The Rams have used a first-round pick on a wide receiver just once in the last 20 years, when they selected West Virginia's Tavon Austin at No. 8 overall in 2013.\n\nKupp capped that season by earning Super Bowl MVP honors with eight receptions for 92 yards and two touchdowns, including the game-winner, in the win over the Bengals. Kupp signed a 3-year, $80 million contract extension before the 2022 season.\n\nThe Rams also added a wide receiver in the 2024 NFL Draft, taking Texas' Jordan Whittington in the sixth round.\n\nThe Texans, meanwhile, find themselves unexpectedly needing depth in their wide receivers room after second-year player Tank Dell suffered a gunshot wound while a bystander at a private event in Sanford, Florida, on April 28, although the team has said they expect Dell to make a \"full recovery.\"\n\nSkowronek joins a stacked receiver room in Houston that includes Dell, perennial All-Pro Stefon Diggs, and the Texans' 2023 leading receiver, Nico Collins. They'll also have newly extended TE Dalton Schultz as well as fourth-round TE Cade Stover.\n\nAll stats courtesy of Pro Football Reference unless stated otherwise.

He had a four-year rookie contract for $3.6 million going into its last year.\n\nSkowronek was a seventh-round pick in 2021 and has played 45 games for Los Angeles in the last three seasons.

Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Rams are reportedly releasing wide receiver Ben Skowronek, a former seventh-round pick who blossomed into a contributor in LA. He was on the Rams' Super Bowl-winning team as a rookie, played a big role on offense in 2022, and has been an important special teams player throughout. By releasing him now, they're giving him an opportunity to catch on with a new team before OTAs begin.\n\nCould the Vikings be interested in Skowronek? The connection to their coaching staff would make it an easy fit. He spent his first NFL season playing for Kevin O'Connell and Wes Phillips on Sean McVay's staff, so the transition to Minnesota's playbook presumably wouldn't be too difficult. Skowronek is a big-bodied receiver with run-blocking ability, which is a quality the Vikings value -- and something they lost when K.J. Osborn signed with the Patriots in free agency this year.\n\nThe Vikings haven't done much to replace Osborn this offseason. Their main addition at WR was journeyman veteran Trent Sherfield, who figures to compete with Brandon Powell and Jalen Nailor for the WR3 job behind Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison. If he were added to the mix, Skowronek could compete for a roster spot as a better version of current Vikings receiver N'Keal Harry.\n\nSkowronek played college football at Northwestern and Notre Dame before getting drafted by the Rams in the seventh round. The 6'3\", 224-pound receiver played a little over 200 offensive snaps in both 2021 and 2023, sandwiched around a 2022 campaign where he started 11 games and played nearly 700 snaps. He has 575 career receiving yards and two touchdowns (one receiving, one rushing). He also has over 600 snaps of special teams experience, which should help him make a 53-man roster somewhere this season.\n\nThere will likely be plenty of interest in Skowronek around the league once he's officially released. If he wants to reunite with former coaches and join a situation where he'd have a good shot at making the roster, the Vikings might be a logical fit.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Skowronek", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ben Skowronek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glendale,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glendale, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Glendale, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Nailor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Nailor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Phillips", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wes Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_O'Connell_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin O'Connell (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_McVay", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sean McVay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Addison", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Addison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Jefferson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Jefferson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N'Keal_Harry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "N'Keal Harry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_Wildcats_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northwestern Wildcats football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Notre Dame Fighting Irish football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5580,h_3138,x_0,y_356/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_vikings/01hxf7b4pgn8d140bv7r.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554032", "eventUri": "eng-9554032", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

With more than $11 million in cap space, the Rams have plenty of room to not only sign their draft class, but also a veteran if they'd like.\n\nThis decision will save Los Angeles some money, however. According to Over The Cap, Skowronek was set to have a $1.076 million cap hit in 2024. By releasing him, the Rams will save $1.055 million, so his remaining dead cap charge will only be $21,131.\n\nIt is worth noting that with Skowronek's contract coming off the books, another player will replace him in the top-51 cutoff, so the savings won't be as large as the $1.055 million.\n\nWhile not a big savings, it could give the Rams a little bit of added flexibility when it comes to the salary cap. That doesn't make the timing of this release any less puzzling, though. Seeing Skowronek get cut months before training camp even begins is shocking.\n\nPerhaps the Rams knew they planned to cut him later this summer and wanted to give him a head start on landing with another team before camps open.", "source": {"uri": "theramswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rams Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cameron_dasilva@theramswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Cameron DaSilva", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Skowronek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Skowronek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritual_Beings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritual Beings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://theramswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/64/2023/10/1763635790.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554032", "eventUri": "eng-9554032", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

You never know when one team's \"trash\" could be another team's \"treasure\". With that in mind, the Los Angeles Rams recently released former 7th-round pick Ben Skowronek, who could draw the interest of the Denver Broncos and head coach Sean Payton.\n\nUpdate: Ben Skowronek was traded to the Houston Texans after this post was published\n\nSkowronek was drafted by the Rams in 2021 out of Notre Dame, but he spent the majority of his college career with the Northwestern program where he has ties to current Denver Broncos running backs coach Lou Ayeni (Ayeni was RBs coach at Northwestern from 2018-2022).\n\nWhat makes Skowronek an interesting potential fit for Sean Payton, specifically, is his versatility.\n\nWe have seen the Los Angeles Rams move Skowronek around the offensive formation quite a bit, and he did the same thing at the collegiate level. He had a rushing touchdown at Notre Dame and got his first NFL rushing touchdown with the Rams in 2022. The 2022 season -- Skowronek's second in the NFL -- was also where he played the most offensively for Sean McVay and got pretty heavily involved as a receiver, catching 39 passes for 376 yards.\n\nIn addition to being a versatile threat offensively, Skowronek is also a core special teams player. He played 327 total special teams snaps last year for the Rams and has the type of size and speed teams covet in that phase of the game (6-foot-3, 225 pounds).\n\nSkowronek's impressive combination of size and athleticism could rev up the \"joker\" engines for Sean Payton in terms of the overall vision for the player. He's obviously not proven to be a dominant dynamic weapon and has perhaps been maximized in Los Angeles by Sean McVay, but this is exactly the type of player that Sean Payton covets.\n\nThe Broncos have done a good job revamping their wide receiver room this offseason, but Skowronek could be viewed as more of a hybrid player with the team lacking depth at the tight end position. He's certainly not a traditional tight end, but Skowronek will stick his facemask in there and block.\n\nHe could be a nice depth piece for the offseason and someone whose talent Sean Payton could maximize.", "source": {"uri": "predominantlyorange.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Predominantly Orange"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sayre_bedinger@predominantlyorange.com", "name": "Sayre Bedinger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Payton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sean Payton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Skowronek", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ben Skowronek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_Wildcats_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northwestern Wildcats football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Texans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Texans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Notre Dame Fighting Irish football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_McVay", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sean McVay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4873,h_2741,x_0,y_58/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/46/01hxf25tc5jt110hpesf.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554032", "eventUri": "eng-9554032", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Rams managed to find a trading partner for wide receiver Ben Skowronek. The former seventh-round draft pick is headed to the Houston Texans where he'll catch passes from second-year quarterback C.J. Stroud.\n\nThe Rams and Texans are swapping their 6th and 7th-round picks in the 2026 NFL Draft as part of the trade. Skowronek has spent the first three years in Los Angeles after the Rams drafted him with the 249th pick in the 2021 NFL Draft. He played the start of his collegiate career for Northwestern before transferring to Notre Dame for the 2020 season.\n\nSkowronek won a Super Bowl ring in his first NFL season as the Rams took down the Cincinnati Bengals to win the big game for the first time since 1999. Through his first three seasons, the former Fighting Irish standout has 58 catches for 575 yards and one receiving touchdown. He also scored a rushing touchdown, which was his first in the league, during the 2022 season. In postseason runs, he's added another three catches for 17 yards.\n\nSkowronek was playing for the Rams on a four-year deal for $3.56 million. The Houston Texans will now take over the remainder of his deal for 2024 before deciding whether or not to let him become a free agent in 2025. He joins the Texans wide receiver room with Stefon Diggs, Nico Collins, Tank Dell, Robert Woods, John Metchie, and Noah Brown.\n\nThe NFL 2024 calendar year began at 4 p.m. ET on March 13. At that time, contracts running through 2023 officially ran out, making those players free agents. Prior to the beginning of free agency, teams had a chance to designate one franchise or transition tag player, starting on Feb. 20 at 4 p.m. ET and ending on March 5. Beginning March 11 through March 13 teams could enter into a legal negotiation with players who will become unrestricted free agents.\n\nIn addition to NFL free agency, the new year also marked the beginning of all trades being made official by the league office. April 19 marked the deadline to sign restricted free agents to offer sheets. On April 24, the deadline for teams to match restricted free agent offers sheets hit. Following the restricted free agent deadline followed the 2024 NFL Draft, which ran from April 25-27.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nikki_chavanelle@on3.com", "name": "Nikki Chavanelle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Texans", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Houston Texans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Notre Dame Fighting Irish football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Skowronek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Skowronek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_Wildcats_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northwestern Wildcats football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Bears_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown Bears football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nico Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Woods_(wide_receiver,_born_1992)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert Woods (wide receiver, born 1992)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefon_Diggs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stefon Diggs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restricted_free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Restricted free agent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2022/10/04103050/sko.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554032", "eventUri": "eng-9554032", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-11", "dateEnd": "2024-03-13", "textStart": 1732, "textEnd": 1757}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "dateEnd": "2024-04-27", "textStart": 2236, "textEnd": 2247}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-13", "textStart": 1446, "textEnd": 1454}, {"amb": false, "date": "-02-20", "textStart": 1678, "textEnd": 1685}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-05", "textStart": 1713, "textEnd": 1720}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-19", "textStart": 1984, "textEnd": 1992}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 2064, "textEnd": 2072}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

As first reported by Dianna Russini of The Athletic, the Texans acquired wideout Ben Skowronek in a trade from the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nThe move marked the second time this offseason the Texans traded for a wide receiver. The first came on April 3 when Houston landed All-Pro Stefon Diggs from the Buffalo Bills. In the exchange, Houston and Los Angeles swapped sixth and seventh round picks for the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nREAD MORE: Did DeMeco Ryans Find His 'Separator' With Houston Texans Trade for Stefon Diggs?\n\nSkowronek began his career as a seventh-round pick (No. 249 overall) in the 2021 NFL Draft. He spent his first two seasons playing a solid role within the Rams' position group, recording a combined 50 catches for 509 receiving yards in 24 games.\n\nHowever, Skowronek's production took a significant decline during the 2023 season. He appeared in six games, recording 13 yards on two receptions.\n\nThe Texans did not draft a wide receiver during the 2024 NFL Draft. However, Houston will enter training camp with a handful of receivers who could play a prominent role within Houston's passing attack.\n\nIn addition to Diggs, the Texans have three receivers who can take the helm as Houston's top wideout. Nico Collins is coming off his first 1,000-yard season, while Tank Dell established himself as one of the top young prospects at his position.\n\nHouston also has a solid core when it comes to depth. Headlined by 2022 third-round pick John Metchie III, Noah Brown, Xavier Hutchinson, Jared Wayne, and Robert Woods make up the Texans' current core.

Skowronek was an integral part of the special teams unit last season and was a captain of that group, but the Rams didn't see him contributing in 2024 so they chose to trade him now instead of waiting until later this summer.\n\nWhile he wasn't more than the fourth or fifth receiver on the depth chart, Skowronek's departure does open the door for some of the other wideouts on the team. The biggest beneficiary of this move is rookie Jordan Whittington, who now has a good chance to be the fourth or fifth receiver behind Cooper Kupp, Puka Nacua and Demarcus Robinson.\n\nWhittington is a willing blocker and has the ability to play any of the wide receiver spots on offense, which will help him get on the field more quickly. He can be a lead blocker on running plays where he comes across the formation and takes on the nickel defender, or he can line up outside and catch fades along the sideline.\n\nXavier Smith and Tyler Johnson could also benefit from Skowronek being out of the picture. The Rams re-signed Johnson this offseason and retained Smith after he was brought in as an undrafted rookie in 2023. Smith has some special teams potential as a return man, as well, so that will only help his chances of making the team.\n\nIf we look even further down the depth chart, a trio of undrafted free agents could push for a roster spot: Drake Stoops, J.J. Laap and Sam Wiglusz. It was hard to see any of them making the team with Skowronek occupying a spot on offense and special teams, but their chances just increased now that there's one fewer player to compete with.\n\nAs of now, here's how the depth chart could look.\n\nWR1 Cooper Kupp Tutu Atwell Xavier Smith Sam Wiglusz WR2 Puka Nacua Jordan Whittington Drake Stoops WR3 Demarcus Robinson Tyler Johnson J.J.

The Rams won't include the services of Ben Skrowenek, the wide receiver whom the team almost released before trading him to DeMeco Ryans, CJ Stroud and the Houston Texans.\n\nThe news came amid Rams GM Les Snead leaving the door open for an Aaron Donald return to the team. The Rams' exciting 2024 draft class got a grade for each of its ten selections.\n\nNow that the smoke has cleared, Rams fans are dissecting the team's latest moves, which including jettisoning Skrowenek in favor of playing time for the team's other offensive players.\n\nRams Deal Skrowenek to Texans\n\nThe latest news cycle included the update on the Skrowenek deal which was made on Thursday. Tom Pellisero shared the update on X citing unnamed sources.\n\n\"Interesting...An obvious depth piece,' one fan said in response to the trade from a Texans vantage point. \"I think this might be the nail in the coffin for Robert Woods.\"\n\nThe Rams got 8 receptions and 66 receiving yards from Skrowenek last season, not exactly all-world numbers. The receiver was buried deep on the Rams' depth chart and figures to have the same experience in Houston, although Stroud is playing at a level that could elevate him to higher status.\n\nSkrowenek Was Almost Released; Report\n\nSkrowenek was almost released according to a report from CBS Sports, but the Texans reportedly did not want to let the 26-year-old wideout hit the free agent market. The Texans and Rams will swap sixth and seventh-round picks in 2026 as a result of the trade.\n\nSkrowenek was selected in the seventh round of the 2022 out of Notre Dame and has 58 receptions over the course of his career, turning in a career campaign in 2022 with almost 400 receiving yards for Matt Stafford, Sean McVay and the Rams. He will have to compete with a talented Texans receiving corps that now includes Woods and Diggs as well as several other rising stars including Tank Dell and Nico Collins.\n\nThe Rams will move on without the Fighting Irish product, having drafted 6-foot-4, 220 pound Texas Longhorns receiver Jordan Washington with the 213th overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft.

The #Rams are sending WR Ben Skowronek to the #Texans, per sources.\n\nSkowronek, who will turn 27 in June, is entering the final year of the rookie contract signed after being selected by the Rams in Round 7 of the 2021 draft out of Notre Dame.\n\nAs a rookie in 2021 Skowronek was a member of the Super Bowl winning Rams team, playing a then career high 46 snaps after O'dell Beckham Jr. tore his ACL and left the 23-20 win over the Cincinnati Bengals in the second quarter.\n\nListed at 6'3', 224 pounds, Skowronek is a big-bodied receiver who struggled to see the field in Los Angeles. That should not come as a surprise, given the presence of Cooper Kupp, Puka Nacua and Tutu Atwell on the roster of the Rams roster.\n\nAdd in the Rams use of a sixth round pick on wide receiver Jordan Whittington out of Texas in the draft this offseason, and the route to playing time for Skowronek in Los Angeles for the 2024 season is certainly uncertain.\n\nHowever, while Skowronek might have had trouble finding snaps for the Rams, he can address some of the special teams snaps Houston lost in free agency, while providing depth at wide receiver.\n\nAlso, Skowronek occasionally lined up at both fullback and tight end during his time with the Rams, according to PFF.com. Neither of those are positions of immediate need for the Texans, with Dalton Schultz and Andrew Beck solidly in place, but it never hurts to add positional flexibility to keep a defense on its toes.\n\nThis has not gone unnoticed by fans and observers, many of whom quickly took to social media to share their opinions on Skowronek's fit with the Texans, first as a receiver.\n\nIn addition, after three seasons playing in Sean McVay's offense, it should not take long to learn the system used by Houston offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik. Slowik and McVay both spent several seasons working under Kyle Shanahan, and both run very similar systems. That should allow for a smooth and near seamless transition for Skowronek, with the biggest obstacle perhaps building chemistry with quarterback C.J. Stroud.\n\nCollins, Dell and Diggs are the unquestioned front three in the receiver room for Houston, and acquisition of Skowronek does nothing to change that. However, it could easily spell the end for Robert Woods as a member of the Texans.\n\nWoods turned 32 earlier this offseason, and is no longer the threat he once was. He has not recorded more than 556 receiving yards in a season since 2020, when he hauled in 90 passes for 936 yards and 6 touchdowns. Add in a catch rate of 53.3% in 2023, the second lowest catch rate of his career and lowest since his rookie season in 2013, and the writing is on the wall for Woods.\n\nIn all probability, though, the final nail in the coffin for Woods is cost. Woods is set to carry a cap hit of $9,705,882 for the 2024 season according to OverTheCap.com. That is a significant cap hit for receiver who is likely no higher than 4th on the depth chart and contributes very little on special teams. The Texans can save $4,955,882 of cap space in 2024 by releasing Woods, and the question now seems more likely to be about when, rather than about if, the team will make the move.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puka_Nacua", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Puka Nacua"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Skowronek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Skowronek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutu_Atwell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tutu Atwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Kupp", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cooper Kupp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Notre Dame Fighting Irish football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Beckham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Beckham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalton_Schultz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dalton Schultz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullback_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fullback (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_McVay", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sean McVay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Slowik", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bobby Slowik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Woods_(wide_receiver,_born_1992)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert Woods (wide receiver, born 1992)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Shanahan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Shanahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Skowronek-e1715289234102.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554032", "eventUri": "eng-9554032", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 452986971, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 32, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 32}}}

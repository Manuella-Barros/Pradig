The defender made over 600 appearances for the Reds between 1977 and 1990 and also won 26 Scotland football caps before going on to a successful broadcasting career \u2013 arguably becoming Match of the Day\u2019s most recognisable pundit during his time on the programme from 1992 to 2014. According to Liverpool\u2019s statement he has now been hospitalised due to illness and they asked for privacy for his family. \u201cThe thoughts and support of everyone at Liverpool FC are with our legendary former captain Alan Hansen, who is currently seriously ill in hospital,\u201d read the statement. \u201cA defender of the utmost elegance, Hansen\u2019s outstanding raft of honours across a 14-year spell with the Reds \u2013 he joined from Partick Thistle in 1977 \u2013 included eight league titles, three European Cups, two FA Cups and three League Cups. \u201c\u2018Jocky\u2019, as he was known by teammates, is in the top 10 for all-time appearances for the club having played 620 matches, and the Scottish centre-back also served as Liverpool skipper for four seasons. \u201cThe club is currently in contact with Alan\u2019s family to provide our support at this difficult time, and our thoughts, wishes and hopes are with Alan and all of the Hansen family. We will provide any further updates as we receive them in due course, and we request that the Hansen family\u2019s privacy is respected at this time.\u201d Having joined Liverpool from Scottish side Partick Thistle as a 22-year-old in 1977, Hansen went on to win eight league titles, three European Cups, two FA Cups, four League Cups and one Uefa Super Cup during a trophy-laden spell at Anfield. He was also named in the PFA First Division Team of the Year on six occasions and the PFA Team of the Century as his reputation as a no-nonsense defender for one of English football\u2019s most successful sides in history became cemented. Remarkably, his post-playing career as a pundit was perhaps just as successful. As a regular on Match of the Day, he became renowned up and down the country for his forthright opinions, especially on the defending of Premier League teams, which he would routinely label as \u201cdiabolical\u201d or \u201cshocking\u201d. Perhaps his most memorable moment came during an episode of MOTD early in the 1995-96 season, where he confidently declared \u201cyou can\u2019t win anything with kids\u201d in reference to the youthful line-up Sir Alex Ferguson was fielding at Manchester United. Of course United \u2013 inspired by the \u2018class of 92\u2019 including the likes of Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Paul Scholes and Gary Neville \u2013 went on to win the Premier League title that season and dominated the 1990s under Ferguson.", "summary": "<p>The ex-Scotland defender and popular <em>Match of the Day </em>pundit won a slew of trophies during his time at Anfield</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/alan-hansen-hospital-cause-illness-liverpool-b2559468.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/09/17/newFile.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:06:41", "author": "Luke Baker", "authors": ["Luke Baker"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.49}

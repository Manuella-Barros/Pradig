{"id": 223735610, "title": "Mario Lewis exhibits Blackness of Our Rebellion 1970", "text": "THE Blackness of Our Rebellion 1970, an exhibition by Mario Lewis, seeks to tell the backstory of the February Revolution. \u201cThe exhibition was conceived by Chi Kamose as a text exhibition to be interspersed with archival newspaper reports and headlines of the events leading to the revolution,\" Lewis said via e-mail after phone interview. Kamose, 69, is a member of the Emancipation Support Committee (ESC); he joined the National Joint Action Committee (NJAC) as a teenager when the movement was new. \u201cMy life interest has been focused on contributions to addressing the misunderstanding and inequalities between the black/white interplay of the world,\u201d the retired civil servant said. \u201cThe idea was to celebrate the 54th anniversary of 1970 and put it in another perspective,\u201d Kamose said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to only focus on the demonstrations. I wanted to explore what were the philosophical reasons behind 1970. There was thought about the political system and the economic system. To show how something that happened on Independence Night, August 31, 1962, led to this.\u201d The late Makandal Daaga, who would later go on to found NJAC and be a leader of the revolution, is at the heart of the story Kamose tells about Independence Night, 1962. \u201cDaaga had gone to a party and the DJ put on a calypso and those in attendance revolted against the calypso being played. \u2018Take off that calypso, it\u2019s not Carnival!\u2019 We couldn\u2019t rely on our music to take us through. We didn\u2019t have a sense of self. And that was Independence Night.\u201d The experience led Daaga to found an organisation called Pegasus, Kamose said, \u201cto help people find true and meaningful independence.\u201d The subsequent revolutionary actions of 1970 \u2013 including anti-imperialist demonstrations in the capital, cross-country solidarity marches and vandalism of the RC Cathedral in protest of racist practices in the Church \u2013 hinged on this search for the authentic black Trinidadian and Tobagonian self. \u201cSome changes were made in big leaps, and there have been reversals. But when you come to the exhibition you will see what those changes are,\u201d Kamose said. \u201cI\u2019ve known Chi for many years through ESC,\u201d Lewis, 55, recalled. As a youth, Lewis joined other makers, including Chi\u2019s son Tau DuFour, in creating some of the iconic public art pieces that marked the ESC\u2019s Emancipation Day celebrations. \u201cA lot we were exposed to was building our awareness and black consciousness, our enlightenment about history,\u201d Lewis said. He was one of \u201c50 or 60\u201d youths involved in the movement then. \u201cSome of those young people are now lawyers, doctors, all over the world, doing their own thing. That environment harnessed a confidence that they have carried all their life.\u201d DuFour, for example, is an architect and spatial theorist and teaches at Cambridge. Lewis\u2019 own path led him to teaching animation, music technology and software engineering at the University of Trinidad and Tobago. He has continued to make art, and last year showed Forest Notebooks at Medulla Gallery in Woodbrook. The exhibition will be remounted at OXY ARTS in Los Angeles in 2025, he said. Kamose found Forest Notebooks \u201can eye opener\u201d about the potential of a similar, unused space Kamose had built in Morvant for his own NGO, Chi Interface. \u201cHe made me understand why he had the space and I started thinking of the possibilities,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIt could be a studio space for artists; it could also be a space where artists could do workshops, a community space for sharing new experiences, skills and connections.\u201d Both men live in Morvant, which Lewis said \u201cgets little recognition for what\u2019s good.\" \"The community that I\u2019m in is rich in understanding what a community should be like; when friends say they\u2019re not coming to Morvant I say, 'Morvant is a big place and it\u2019s diverse in its landscape, population and design.'\u201d The materials of the exhibition are \u201ccardboard, reclaimed wood, wooden pallets, paper, fabric, used galvanise, found objectives, aquarium and fishes, charcoal, burnt tree trunk, tree branches, emulsion paint, oil paint, photocopies, video projection, soundscape,\u201d Lewis said in the e-mail \u2013 a list explained by Kamose in the interview. \u201cWe had no choice of materials,\u201d Kamose said. \u201cWe had to work with what we had. We had old galvanise around the place and Mario put them on the wall. I had no idea what we were going to do with that galvanise.\u201d The Blackness of Our Rebellion 1970 continues Monday to Saturday, 1 pm - 6 pm, at 4 Flamingo Road, Morvant, until June 1.", "summary": "<p><img width=\"800\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/23234169-e1716735417879-800x510.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" /></p>\n<p>THE Blackness of Our Rebellion 1970, an exhibition by Mario Lewis, seeks to tell the backstory of the February Revolution.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe exhibition was conceived by Chi Kamose as a text exhibition to be interspersed with archival newspaper reports and headlines of the events leading to the revolution,\" Lewis said via e-mail after phone interview.</p>\n<p>Kamose, 69, is a member of the Emancipation Support Committee (ESC); he joined the National Joint Action Committee (NJAC) as a teenager when the movement was new.</p>\n<p>\u201cMy life interest has been focused on contributions to addressing the misunderstanding and inequalities between the black/white interplay of the world,\u201d the retired civil servant said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe idea was to celebrate the 54th anniversary of 1970 and p", "url": "https://newsday.co.tt/2024/05/26/mario-lewis-exhibits-blackness-of-our-rebellion-1970/", "image": "https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/23234169-e1716735417879.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:42:38", "author": "Lisa Allen-Agostini", "authors": ["Lisa Allen-Agostini"], "language": "en", "source_country": "tt", "sentiment": 0.418}

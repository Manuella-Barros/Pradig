And I think that's something I have the responsibility as a filmmaker to listen to. I care about people seeing the film, and I care about how it makes people feel.\"\n\nRelated: Z\u00f6e Kravitz's Directorial Debut Starring Channing Tatum Gets Title Changed from Pussy Island\n\nTatum, who first met Kravitz when she cast him in this film in 2021, has done nothing but gush over the project and her work in the leadup to its release.\n\nIn January, he shared an Instagram carousel of Kravitz hard at work, writing, \"MISS DIRECTOR LADY HERSELF IN ACTION!!

The premiere holds special significance for Kravitz, as it marks her directorial debut, while Tatum stars in the lead role. Although they've been linked since 2021 and are often seen together at various events, this red-carpet appearance is their first public debut, following engagement rumours in 2023.\n\nBefore Don't Blink, Kravitz and Tatum worked together in the 2017 animated film The Lego Batman Movie, where they voiced Catwoman and Clark Kent. Reportedly, their romance began to blossom as they started working on their upcoming psychological thriller together and captured public attention. Tatum was linked with Jessie J until 2020, while Kravitz was married to actor Karl Glusman, but they divorced in the same year.\n\nAccording to Hollywood Reporter, just before the screening of Don't Blink, Zoe Kravitz took a moment to share some sweet words for Channing Tatum.

Thank you for your patience. Making this film with you has been a great adventure. Thank you for trusting me to direct you. It's really very cool to get to make a movie, but when you get to do it with the love of your life, it's even cooler.\"\n\nKravitz also thanked the team for their dedication and hard work. She mentioned that everyone put in extra effort and dealt with her late-night messages. Despite the challenges, the team remained supportive and helped bring the movie to life.\n\nZoe Kravitz directed and co-wrote Don't Blink, featuring Channing Tatum as Slater King, a tech billionaire.

However, as their romance blossomed, their creative efforts followed suit.\n\nIn the two years since filming kicked off, the pair have gone public with their romance and subsequently gotten engaged.\n\nOn Thursday, they walked the red carpet at the Los Angeles premiere for the psychological thriller, and they each spoke with ET's Cassie DiLaura about what it was like working together.\n\n\"I think there is so much trust there,\" Kravitz, 35, explained, \"and you're able to go to places that maybe you couldn't go with someone that you maybe don't know as well.\"\n\n\"So it was a really beautiful experience to work together creatively,\" she added.\n\nFor Tatum, 44, getting the chance to act under the direction of the woman he loves, and getting to collaborate together, was a relationship-cementing experience.\n\n\"It was really interesting, because we started as friends just working on a project that we both really believe in,\" Tatum said. \"When things start in that creative place... you just respect each other's point of view, you respect each other's mind, each others' experience in life.\"\n\n\"I now don't know what I would do creating without her,\" he added. \"Everybody was like, 'You sure you want to go create with your partner?' But I actually suggest that to almost everyone now, 'cause you really get to know who that person is and what they are to you, and who they are to you, when you're in the trenches.\"\n\n\"You go, 'Alright, I need to have your perspective right now. Tell me tell me what to do, tell me how to do it. Tell me what I don't know and what I'm not seeing,'\" he added.\n\nKravitz and Tatum first sparked dating rumors in August 2021. ET learned in late October 2023 that the 21 Jump Street star and the Batman actress had gotten engaged.\n\nKravitz's romance with Tatum is her first since her public split from ex-husband Karl Glusman. The two ended their relationship after 18 months of marriage in 2021.\n\nTatum was previously married to his Step Up co-star, Jenna Dewan, from 2009 to 2019, and they share daughter Everly, 11.\n\nBlink Twice marks Kravitz' directorial debut, and the actress-turned-filmmaker told ET on Thursday that she was still processing the fact that her movie would soon be hitting theaters.\n\n\"I feel so many things. It's been a 7-year journey,\" Kravitz said. \"I don't think I even understand what's happening right now.\"\n\nBlink Twice, written by Kravitz and E.T.

However, as their romance blossomed, their creative efforts followed suit.\n\nIn the two years since filming kicked off, the pair have gone public with their romance and subsequently gotten engaged.\n\nOn Thursday, they walked the red carpet at the Los Angeles premiere for the psychological thriller, and they each spoke with ET's Cassie DiLaura about what it was like working together.\n\n\"I think there is so much trust there,\" Kravitz, 35, explained, \"and you're able to go to places that maybe you couldn't go with someone that you maybe don't know as well.\"\n\n\"So it was a really beautiful experience to work together creatively,\" she added.\n\nFor Tatum, 44, getting the chance to act under the direction of the woman he loves, and getting to collaborate together, was a relationship-cementing experience.\n\n\"It was really interesting, because we started as friends just working on a project that we both really believe in,\" Tatum said. \"When things start in that creative place... you just respect each other's point of view, you respect each other's mind, each others' experience in life.\"\n\n\"I now don't know what I would do creating without her,\" he added. \"Everybody was like, 'You sure you want to go create with your partner?' But I actually suggest that to almost everyone now, 'cause you really get to know who that person is and what they are to you, and who they are to you, when you're in the trenches.\"\n\n\"You go, 'Alright, I need to have your perspective right now. Tell me tell me what to do, tell me how to do it. Tell me what I don't know and what I'm not seeing,'\" he added.\n\nKravitz and Tatum first sparked dating rumors in August 2021. ET learned in late October 2023 that the 21 Jump Street star and the Batman actress had gotten engaged.\n\nKravitz's romance with Tatum is her first since her public split from ex-husband Karl Glusman. The two ended their relationship after 18 months of marriage in 2021.\n\nTatum was previously married to his Step Up co-star, Jenna Dewan, from 2009 to 2019, and they share daughter Everly, 11.\n\nBlink Twice marks Kravitz' directorial debut, and the actress-turned-filmmaker told ET on Thursday that she was still processing the fact that her movie would soon be hitting theaters.\n\n\"I feel so many things. It's been a 7-year journey,\" Kravitz said. \"I don't think I even understand what's happening right now.\"\n\nBlink Twice, written by Kravitz and E.T.

It was made complete with a ruching effect at the midpoint of her waist that fanned out on the dress' skirt. She wore Raven slingback pumps in satin crepe.\n\nKravitz kept the elegant look simple and wore a couple of rings and one pair of dangle drop earrings that had a star charm. Her glam also remained simple, with a deep red lipstick and soft pink eyeshadow. Her hair was in a slick back bun.\n\nHer fianc\u00e9 and the star of her film, Tatum, 44, walked the red carpet by her side in a black suit, white button down, a white pocket square, and black leather loafers.\n\nThe two, who have been engaged since 2023, were previously seen together after the New York City premiere of the Tatum-starring Fly Me to the Moon, where they sweetly held hands in the theater. In the clip, which was captured in July, Tatum stopped to look for his bride-to-be and slowed his pace to allow her to catch up with him.

Thank you for your patience,\" she said. \"Making this film with you has been an awfully great adventure. Thank you for trusting me to female direct you. It's really very cool to get to make a movie, but when you get to do it with the love of your life, it's even cooler.\" The couple, who got engaged last year, also made their red carpet debut at the event.\n\nKravitz directed and co-wrote the film, a psychological thriller that stars Tatum as Slater King, a tech billionaire who meets cocktail waitress Frida (Naomi Ackie) at his fundraising gala. He invites her to join him and his friends on a vacation to his private island, where things begin to go awry.\n\nAdmitting that public speaking is her biggest fear, Kravitz also used her premiere night speech to thank the film's team for taking \"the time it took to make this movie what we dreamed it could be. All of you worked harder than you were being paid to work. All of you lost sleep and probably sanity over this project. All of you received a number of weird fever-dream text messages from me at strange hours of the night. But none of you rolled your eyes and called me a bitch, at least to my face, when I said, 'We're not there yet.' All of you said, 'Yes, let's keep going, let's get there,' and we did.\"\n\nOn the carpet, Kravitz told The Hollywood Reporter that she came into the director's chair quite naturally, as \"I had a series of emotions and didn't know what to do with them so I wrote something, and then I ended up being lucky enough to make it,\" while pointing to Paul Thomas Anderson, Quentin Tarantino, Penny Marshall and John Cassavetes as her inspirations.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Reporter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kirsten_chuba@hollywoodreporter.com", "name": "Kirsten Chuba", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zo\u00eb_Kravitz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zo\u00eb Kravitz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channing_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Channing Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Tears_Ricochet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "My Tears Ricochet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directors_Guild_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Directors Guild of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Lively", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blake Lively"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Ackie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naomi Ackie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_thriller", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychological thriller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frida_Kahlo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frida Kahlo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adventure film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Marshall", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penny Marshall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cassavetes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Cassavetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Thomas_Anderson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Thomas Anderson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hollywood Reporter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Tarantino", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quentin Tarantino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165954284.jpg?crop=0px%2C73px%2C5000px%2C2798px&resize=1440%2C810", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803383", "eventUri": "eng-9803383", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

I've been saying I want it for the last 10 years,\" Tatum said. \"It's in Bob Iger and Kevin Feige's hands.

I love ya buddy.\"\n\nThe \"Magic Mike\" star praised \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" director Shawn Levy as \"a brilliant creator on every single level.\"\n\n\"All things happen for a reason,\" Tatum also wrote in the Instagram post. \"I'm so grateful to be in this movie.

Things go awry and take a very dark turn as the group spends countless hours drinking and doing drugs.\n\nThe film, co-written by Kravitz and E.T.

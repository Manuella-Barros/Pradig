{"id": 232089120, "title": "Ex-Liverpool star compares new Reds boss Arne Slot to Jurgen Klopp and Jose Mourinho", "text": "Ex- Liverpool star Georginio Wijnaldum has compared Arne Slot to Jurgen Klopp and Jose Mourinho, having backed him for success at Anfield. The Dutchman has been confirmed as Klopp\u2019s successor on Merseyside. He has huge pressure on his hands given the success that the German enjoyed with the club. Having worked under Slot back in his homeland, Wijnaldum believes that Slot could continue that trend with Liverpool and believes he shares plenty of characteristics with some of the best managerial masterminds in the world. Speaking to Algemeen Dagblad, the former Liverpool midfielder said: \u201cI trained at Feyenoord for a few more days at the beginning of this season and there I saw how Slot worked. That was of a very high level, I thought that was really great. \u201cI can compare him to Klopp and Mourinho and then I say Slot is of the same level. Yes, he's coming into a completely different world now, that's just the case. But that doesn't mean he can't do what he did at Feyenoord there?\u201d One of Wijnaldum\u2019s former club and international teammates has also given his thoughts in Slot taking the reins at Anfield. Captain Virgil van Dijk has underlined his support for his compatriot at Anfield. The defender said: \"There is so much room for improvement, so much room to develop. I am looking forward to next season already. Will Arne Slot be a success with Liverpool? Share your thoughts in the comments below \u201cChange is sometimes a little bit scary as you are in the unknown but the only thing you can do is trust the club. I am very curious and have a lot of questions. The Premier League and Liverpool is obviously a different ball game but we are here for him [Slot]. \u201cI'll be here for him, whatever he needs. It is all about sticking together and giving him the chance to show what he is capable of with the other guys who will come in.\u201d Slot moves to Anfield off the back of a frustrating season with Feyenoord. They finished second in the Eredivisie behind PSV after winning the league the previous campaign. Slot did however manage to lead Feyenoord to the Dutch Cup. While he has been given words of support by Wijnaldum and Van Dijk, the Dutchman could potentially be reunited with one of his former Feyenoord stars. The Telegraph have reported that Newcastle could potentially be forced to sell Yankuba Minteh for \u00a340m during his loan spell with the Eredivisie side last term. Liverpool are apparently one of the sides interested in making a move for him. Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

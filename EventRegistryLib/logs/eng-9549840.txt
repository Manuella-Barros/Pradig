He drilled seven on 12 attempts as the Celtics blew past the Cleveland Cavaliers 120-95 at TD Garden in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals.\n\nWhite was similarly lethal in his previous two outings, going 8-for-15 from deep in Game 4 against the Miami Heat and 5-for-10 in the Game 5 clincher, games the Celtics won by double digits.\n\nFans expect those types of performances from a 3-point maestro like Curry. But not from White, who had never been known as an elite sharpshooter.\n\n\"Derrick White has grown,\" teammate Jaylen Brown said. \"This is a new version that we haven't seen before. He put the work in. His body has developed a little bit. He's got some more playoff experience, and he's being aggressive. And we urge him to do that. We're going to need that more and more down the line.\"\n\nRemember the 2022 postseason, White's first as a Celtic after his trade from San Antonio? His shooting was woeful during Boston's run to the NBA Finals (36.4% overall, 31.3% from long distance), and he was a non-factor from beyond the arc.\n\nIn 23 playoff games that year, White made a total of 26 triples. He's already at 28 this postseason, firing away as frequently and effectively as the league's top snipers.\n\nEven during the regular season -- White's best to date -- he ranked 29th in made 3-pointers per game, 27th in 3-point attempts and 48th in 3-point shooting percentage (39.6%).\n\nSo far in these playoffs, only Damian Lillard has more made threes per game than White's 4.7, and only Lillard and Luka Doncic have attempted more than White's 9.3. White's 50% success rate on those shots ranks third, and the two players ahead of him (Miami's Delon Wright and Minnesota's Karl-Anthony Towns) both average fewer than five attempts per game.\n\nBefore his current hot streak, White had never made five or more 3s in three consecutive NBA games, regular or postseason.\n\n\"I think I'm getting pretty good looks,\" said White, who finished with 25 points Tuesday night. \"Then obviously you make a couple, basket's a little bit bigger. Then you can kind of take and make tougher ones. I think I definitely started the game with good looks and just went from there.\"\n\nWhite's star turn from 3-point range has added yet another weapon to a Celtics offense that led the NBA in points per 100 possessions during the regular season.\n\nConsider this: Jayson Tatum -- a two-time All-NBA first-teamer and Boston's leading scorer in each of the last five seasons -- ranks third on the team in points per game so far this postseason, trailing Brown and White. Tatum had an off night offensively in Game 1 against the Cavs (18 points on 19 shots), and the Celtics still won easily, leading by double-digits for the entire second half.\n\n\"I love the way he's playing on both ends of the floor,\" Tatum said of White. \"It's just putting a lot of pressure on the defense, (Tuesday) and last series.\n\n\"We've just got a lot of different ways to win a game, and I would assume that it's tough for the other team to try to figure that out.\"\n\nThe Celtics also have not slowed since losing 20-point-per-game big man Kristaps Porzingis to a calf strain, winning by 34 and 25 in their two games without him.\n\n\"(White is) the kind of guy that can impact the game differently every night,\" head coach Joe Mazzulla said. \"Whatever the game calls for, he's willing to do, and he's done it. And we need him to continue to do that.\"", "source": {"uri": "unionleader.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UnionLeader.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Lillard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Damian Lillard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Klay Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delon_Wright", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delon Wright"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/unionleader.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/a5/5a536f28-0d71-11ef-8fb8-ebf91f748e35/663bd3199e4a2.image.jpg?crop=1674%2C879%2C0%2C179&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549840", "eventUri": "eng-9549840", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

Following that performance, White stayed hot in Game 5 by hitting five 3s on 10 attempts, tying a game-high with 25 points as the Celtics closed out the series on the Heat.\n\nIn the opening game of the Eastern Conference semifinals against the Cavs, White brought the home crowd to their feet by converting on 7 of 12 attempts from deep as he worked his way to a 25-point night in Boston's 120-95 win over Cleveland.\n\nAfter narrowly missing his first All-Star nod this season, White has seen his scoring improve from 15.7 points per game on 46.1 percent from the field and 39.6 percent from deep in the regular season to 22.8 points on 57.5 percent from the field and 50 percent from deep.\n\nTNT's Stephanie Ready spoke with Jaylen Brown following Tuesday night's Game 1 win to ask him if he was surprised to see White's emergence in the playoffs so far, and his answer didn't disappoint.\n\n\"If you don't know Derrick White, you better get to know him,\" Brown told Ready. \"That man has been balling and he's just getting started.\"\n\nNBC Sports Boston's Abby Chin caught up with White after the win, asking the 29-year-old how big the rim looked after his barrage of 3s.\n\n\"I'm just trying to get good looks, get good shots, and knock them down when I take them.\" White said, as seen in the video player above. \"I just have to keep going -- a lot of credit to the team, though.\"\n\nThe crowd at the TD Garden got loud for White, continuously chanting his name as Boston's lead over Cleveland continued to grow. White took notice and took the time to show his appreciation.\n\n\"I love it here in Boston,\" White told Chin. \"I love the fans, they're amazing.\"\n\nThroughout the first six games of the postseason, White is posting 22.8 points, 3.5 assists, 3.2 rebounds, and just under a block per game.

He's already at 28 this postseason, firing away as frequently and effectively as the league's top snipers.\n\nEven during the regular season -- White's best to date -- he ranked 29th in made 3-pointers per game, 27th in 3-point attempts and 48th in 3-point shooting percentage (39.6%).\n\nCallahan: Celtics send message overcoming Jayson Tatum Game 1 clunker to crush Cavaliers\n\nSo far in these playoffs, only Damian Lillard has more made threes per game than White's 4.7, and only Lillard and Luka Doncic have attempted more than White's 9.3. White's 50% success rate on those shots ranks third, and the two players ahead of him (Miami's Delon Wright and Minnesota's Karl-Anthony Towns) both average fewer than five attempts per game.\n\nBefore his current hot streak, White had never made five or more 3s in three consecutive NBA games, regular or postseason.\n\n\"I think I'm getting pretty good looks,\" said White, who finished with 25 points Tuesday night. \"Then obviously you make a couple, basket's a little bit bigger. Then you can kind of take and make tougher ones. I think I definitely started the game with good looks and just went from there.\"\n\nWhite's star turn from 3-point range has added yet another weapon to a Celtics offense that led the NBA in points per 100 possessions during the regular season.\n\nConsider this: Jayson Tatum -- a two-time All-NBA first-teamer and Boston's leading scorer in each of the last five seasons -- ranks third on the team in points per game so far this postseason, trailing Brown and White. Tatum had an off night offensively in Game 1 against the Cavs (18 points on 19 shots), and the Celtics still won easily, leading by double-digits for the entire second half.\n\n\"I love the way he's playing on both ends of the floor,\" Tatum said of White. \"It's just putting a lot of pressure on the defense, (Tuesday) and last series. We've just got a lot of different ways to win a game, and I would assume that it's tough for the other team to try to figure that out.\"\n\nThe Celtics also have not slowed since losing 20-point-per-game big man Kristaps Porzingis to a calf strain, winning by 34 and 25 in their two games without him.\n\n\"(White is) the kind of guy that can impact the game differently every night,\" head coach Joe Mazzulla said. \"Whatever the game calls for, he's willing to do, and he's done it. And we need him to continue to do that.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zack_cox@bostonherald.com", "name": "Zack Cox", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Lillard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Damian Lillard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delon_Wright", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delon Wright"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/lticsnl012_f5e515-e1715176410875.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549840", "eventUri": "eng-9549840", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

And White's teammate Jaylen Brown gave his efficient and hard-working teammate a shoutout after the Celtics' dominant Game 1 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nFollowing Boston's 120-95 home victory against Donovan Mitchell and the Cavs, Brown was asked if White's Game 1 performance (25 points, 5 rebounds, 7-12 3PT) was \"surprising.\"\n\n\"If you don't know Derrick White, you better get to know him,\" Brown said. \"That man has been balling and he's just getting started, man. Hell of a game for him tonight.\"\n\nThe only NBA accolade to Derrick White's name is an All-Defensive 2nd Team selection last season, but those who have watched the Boston Celtics over the past few seasons know how invaluable White has been to Boston's success. In addition to his remarkable, game-winning tip-in in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals last year against the Miami Heat, White has consistently become a heavily relied-upon player for the Celtics.\n\nSince being acquired by the Celtics in a trade with the San Antonio Spurs during the 2021-22 season, White's role has continued to expand. Rarely a starter when he first arrived in Boston, White became a regular part of the starting five last season, during which he started 70 of 82 regular-season games but still didn't crack 30 minutes per game as Joe Mazzulla rolled with an eight-man rotation that included Marcus Smart and Malcolm Brogdon in the backcourt.\n\nWith Smart and Brogdon both gone this season, however, White started every game in which he played this season and became arguably the Celtics' most important guard. He certainly took a step up offensively. After averaging 12.4 points and 3.9 assists on shooting splits of 46.2% FG / 38.1% 3PT / 87.5% FT last season, White took more shots and not only maintained his efficiency but improved it this season, as evident by his 15.2 points and 5.2 assists per game while shooting 46.1% FG / 39.6% 3PT / 90.1% FT.\n\nIn the playoffs, White has shined even brighter, though. White showed flashes of brilliance last postseason, but so far this year, White's white-hot offense has transformed the Celtics' already great offense. Through six postseason games, White has scored 20 or more points in four, including a 38-point showing in Game 4 vs. the Miami Heat, and has been unstoppable from the perimeter. While Jayson Tatum has struggled to find his shot, White is shooting 50% from beyond the three-point line on a team-high 9.3 attempts per game. He leads all players in the playoffs so far in true shooting percentage, three-point field goals made, and effective field goal percentage.\n\nIf White can even somewhat maintain what he has done to this point in the playoffs, the Celtics, especially when Tatum breaks out of his slump, would seem nearly impossible to beat.\n\nThe Celtics have a chance to take a commanding 2-0 series lead over the Cavaliers tomorrow. Game 2 is scheduled to tip off around 7 p.m. ET in Boston.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "preston_byers@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Preston Byers", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Brogdon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malcolm Brogdon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Defensive_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Defensive Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Field goal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Smart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Smart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Field goal percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Celtics-news-Jaylen-Brown-sends-Derrick-White-message-to-fans-after-Game-1-masterpiece-vs.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549840", "eventUri": "eng-9549840", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

It wasn't random. White practices that.\n\nThat's why on Monday, a big plastic egg crate covered the rim where White and his coaches were working. His touch has been so good lately, that they couldn't let him practice offensive rebounding without a lid on the hoop.\n\nIn the opposite corner of the gym was Jaylen Brown, who spends every day running pick-and-roll reads against several coverages. One coach is wearing a giant foam arm to ensure Brown threads the perfect skip pass to the corner. Practice at game speed in game conditions and the results will be game-ready.\n\nBrown's work was apparent in Boston's 120-95 win over Cleveland to open the second round on Tuesday. But when he saw White come one short of a career-high with seven 3-pointers, he understood the work that led to that moment.\n\n\"We just go over certain reads in practice all the time. I see him on the side always working on the kind of shots he knows he's gonna get,\" Brown said. \"We got certain actions, actions he's mastered, where his shots come from. So it's almost like practice for him because he shoots those shots over and over again. If a guy goes under, Derrick White feels confident, and he takes those shots and makes those shots.\"\n\nWhen White first got to Boston, he was shooting 30 percent from deep on many wide-open looks. Catch, stare at the basket, shoot -- it wasn't clicking. The Celtics paid a pretty price for this jovial utility player who could do a little bit of everything but couldn't deliver offensively enough to be a part of the system. He was already 27, presumably a finished product.\n\nNow, 2022 feels like a long time ago. That Derrick White is gone.\n\nWhile he has spent the last few years saying his uptick is due to his teammates and coaches giving him confidence, it's more than that. It's the work Brown and others see him putting in every day.\n\n\"Derrick White has grown. Like, this is a new version that we haven't seen before,\" Brown said. \"He's put the work in, his body has developed a little bit, he's got some more playoff experience and he's being aggressive. We urge him to do that. We'll need that more and more down the line.\"\n\nWhite joined Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Damian Lillard and Jamal Murray as the only players to hit 20 3-pointers over a three-game span in postseason history, per NBC Sports Boston's Dick Lipe. As this season has progressed, so has White's evolution.\n\n\"Hell of (good) players,\" White said of the list he just joined. \"That's for sure.\"\n\nHis individual output has a clear correlation to winning. When White takes at least a dozen shots, they don't lose. The Celtics have won 21 of those games consecutively, with their last loss coming against Denver on Jan. 19 in a 102-100 thriller.\n\nThe numbers make it clear: Boston needs White to fire away to be at its best.\n\n\"It's important because it means usually the shots he takes are because we're either out in transition, we've set really good screens and he has that (look), or there are two-on-ones and we're making extra passes,\" Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said after White scored 25 points in Game 1. \"So I think when those guys get more and more shots, it means we're getting to the different layers of our offense which is important against a team like this.\"\n\nThe thing about White is he takes some bad shots now, but somehow usually in the right moments. He used to be reticent to take anything out of the rhythm of the offense, but launching this shot with 17 seconds on the clock is audacious.\n\nWhite broke from the play to take a 3 that Garland nearly blocked, because he felt it. There are not many presumptive \"role\" players in the NBA who can get away with that. He was given the green light when he got to Boston and the team begged him to speed through it, but this is beyond taking what the game gives you. And yet, his teammates and coaches seem to love it.\n\nMaybe it's because when he was asked how he felt about his big shooting night, he said he didn't care.\n\n\"I think just the most important thing is just to win,\" White said. \"Like I've said before, it doesn't matter if I score or however much I scored today. If we win then that's doing enough.\"\n\nBut with Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is out, the Celtics needed this. Even without their center, Mazzulla kept putting White in their go-to action \"Octagon\" which is the primary conduit to Porzi\u0146\u0123is' role in the offense.\n\nIt's often White and Porzi\u0146\u0123is on the elbow, with the rest of the team spaced to the other side of the floor. White reads the coverage, tries to get Porzi\u0146\u0123is the ball with an advantage, or zips it out of there so his teammates can attack three-on-two.\n\nWith Jayson Tatum in the action instead of the injured center, Cleveland decided to hedge the action and send Tatum's defender up at White to disrupt him, then quickly retreat to Tatum. Hedges are less common in the 3-point era because it gives the ball handler a chance to launch a 3. Well, White seized those chances and capitalized.\n\n\"I think on the one there, they went under. So I think that's why I shot it,\" White said. \"But just trying to read the pick-and-roll every time and see what they're trying to do. We understand they're going to make adjustments and so we've gotta be ready for whatever it is.\"\n\nWhite has also become one of the team's most reliable shooters at the end of the shot clock, especially when one of the Jays can draw a crowd and kick it to him for a contested spot-up 3. He has such a quick release and can shoot moving backward so well, making him the best spot-up option on the team.\n\nJust watch how he directs Luke Kornet to give the ball to Tatum, knowing he could float back to the wing so Tatum could collapse the defense and get him a clean look.\n\n\"Just trying to get good looks and JT and JB get a lot of attention,\" White said. \"So just stay spaced, stay ready and I think I take a lot of 3s like that, probably made a lot too, so just keep taking good looks and knock them down.\"\n\nTatum and Brown inevitably got most of the shots in the past, but they're better playmakers now and White in turn has become a better scorer. So far, he's averaging 22.8 points per game in the postseason. In the only postseason game they lost, White took eight shots.\n\nThough correlation does not always equal causation, the sample size has gotten big enough to make it clear. And yet, White will happily go scoreless, as long as they win.\n\n\"He's the kind of guy that can impact the game differently every night. Whatever the game calls for, he's willing to do, and he's done that,\" Mazzulla said. \"And we need him to continue to do that.\"", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

But he made sure to shout out a teammate who has been playing great for them in the postseason - Derrick White.\n\nBrown led the Celtics charge with 32 points on 12-18 shooting, including 4-6 from three-point distance, as the Men in Green annihilated the Cleveland Cavaliers 120-95 in Game 1 of the best-of-seven second-round series. But on a night when Jayson Tatum struggled with his shot, it was White who picked up the slack again.\n\n\"If you don't know Derrick White, you better get to know him,\" said Brown after the game. \"That man has been balling, and he's just getting started. A hell of a game from him tonight.\"\n\nDerrick has been Celtic's unsung hero\n\nWhite entered the playoffs coming off the best campaign of his 8-year NBA career. With the stakes higher in the postseason, he has elevated his game even further.\n\nThe 29-year-old averaged 22.4 points, 3.6 rebounds, 3.2 assists, and 1.0 blocks per game in Boston's first-round series against the Heat. In that series, White made an average of 4.2 three-pointers per game, a remarkable 47.7% three-point clip. He knocked down 8 triples on his way to a career-high 38 points in Game 3.\n\nOn Tuesday night, White knocked down seven three-pointers en route to 25 points in 33 minutes of action. He also issued five assists without a turnover while playing terrific defense, as usual, on the other end of the court.\n\nWhite has been balling in the playoffs\n\nIn his last three games, Derrick has averaged 26 points per game while making 20 out of 37 three-point attempts. He becomes only the fifth player in NBA history to hit 20+ three-pointers during a three-game span in the playoffs.\n\n\"It feels good. I think the most important thing is to win,\" White said. \"I've said before, it doesn't matter if I score zero or score however many I scored today. When we win, I'm doing enough.\"\n\nWhite has done more than enough for the Celtics this postseason. With Tatum still looking for his shot at 41.% shooting, His 22.4 points per game is making him Boston's second-leading scorer behind Brown's 22.8 PPG. Given the pressure to win it all this season, both Brown and Tatum are certainly glad White is balling right now.\n\nRelated: Derrick White had some inspiring words after a memorable playoff performance: \"Believe in yourself, never stop working\"", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shane_garry_acedera@postandcourier.com", "name": "Shane Garry Acedera", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brown Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/70/770b601a-19cc-59fd-bf64-d6dc53e92cea/663b357633e65.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C22&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549840", "eventUri": "eng-9549840", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

I just want to help us win.\"\n\nWhite certainly did that in Game 1. He continued his shooting barrage to begin these playoffs by going 7-for-12 from deep -- including 4-for-6 in the third quarter, when he scored 14 points -- to improve to 20-for-37 (54%) over Boston's past three playoff games.\n\nHe's the fifth player to make 20 or more 3-pointers over a three-game span in the postseason, joining Stephen Curry (three times), Klay Thompson (2016), Jamal Murray (2020) and Damian Lillard (2021 and 2024 combined).\n\nWhite's latest stretch of hot shooting was more than enough to put away the game for the Celtics, who improved to 5-1 in these playoffs with a game that mostly felt more like one in November or December than the first week of May.\n\nCeltics coach Joe Mazzulla was asked how much White being aggressive with his shot helps Boston's offense overall.\n\n\"It's important because it means, usually the shots he takes are because we're either out in transition, we've set really good screens and he has that, or there's 2-on-1s and we're making extra passes,\" Mazzulla said.\n\n\"So I think when those guys get more and more shots, it means we're getting to the different layers of our offense, which is important against a team like this.\"\n\nIt also played a part in opening up the floor for Jaylen Brown, who finished with 32 points on 12-for-18 shooting to go along with six rebounds, two assists and just a single turnover. Brown and White powered a Boston offense that more or less was able to do what it wanted against a Cavaliers team that was barely 48 hours removed from surviving a rock fight of a Game 7 against the Orlando Magic.\n\n\"There's a lot of areas we can improve on,\" Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. \"I thought the guys came out with the right intent and the right effort. Facing a team like Boston, I think it's good to be able to play them. You're not used to the speed, the spacing, the shooting and all those things until you get up against them especially coming from a series we just came from that was more of a half-court slugfest where they play with more tempo, more space.\n\n\"We'll learn from it, and we'll be better on Thursday.\"\n\nThe Cavaliers will need to be to have a chance of making this series competitive. Boston recovered from going 6-for-22 in the first half from distance to pull away from Cleveland after the break despite a 33-point performance from star Donovan Mitchell.\n\nBoston was able to do so, in large part, because of White's latest impressive shooting performance, just a couple of seasons removed from his struggles from deep during Boston's run to the 2022 NBA Finals.\n\n\"Derrick White has grown,\" Brown said. \"He's a new version that we haven't seen before. He's put the work in, his body has developed a little bit, he's got some more playoff experience. And he's being aggressive, and we urge him to do that more and more down the line.\"", "source": {"uri": "ktbb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBB"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Lillard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Damian Lillard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Klay Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Magic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Magic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://ktbb.com/post/wp-content/media/2022/12/facebook-og-1200630.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549840", "eventUri": "eng-9549840", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

It required tireless hours, patience, and a tailor-made regimen which fits in perfectly with Boston's primary goal: Banner 18.\n\nThe Cavaliers received a first-hand look at White's behind-the-scenes work coming to life in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals. White scored 25 points, drained seven 3-pointers, and proved himself to be a ceiling-shattering version of what the 29-year-old was just a few years ago. It's continued to leave an impression on Boston's locker room, opposing players, and the TD Garden crowd that chanted, 'Derrick White,' in the third quarter of Tuesday night's 120-95 Celtics victory.\n\n\"He's the kind of guy that can impact the floor differently every night,\" Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla explained after Game 1. \"Whatever the game calls for he's willing to do. He's done that and we need him to continue to do that.\"\n\nWhite's ascendance from being a second-unit rotation guard to a fringe All-Star candidate with a legitimate case has occurred before Boston's eyes within the last three seasons. In 2022, when the Celtics acquired White from the Spurs -- giving San Antonio Josh Richardson, Romeo Langford, and a 2022 first-round draft pick -- he wasn't nearly as impactful.\n\nWhen that season's playoffs commenced, White became a 3-point liability, not a threat, shooting 31.3% on 3.6 attempts per night while averaging 8.5 points. Fast forward to last season's playoff run; White delivered a buzzer-beater tip-in layup to defeat the Heat in Game 6 of the conference finals after Miami got ahead of Boston, 3-0, in the series.\n\nPicking up right where he left off this go-around, White's consistently been the backbone of Boston's offense. His scalding-hot catch-and-shoot trigger, much like the miraculous layup in Miami, is a result of White's devotion and unique approach to preparing for those scenarios -- not sheer luck.\n\n\"I see him on the side (during practice) always working on the type of shots that he knows he's gonna get,\" Jaylen Brown said postgame. \"We got certain actions and those actions he's mastered them. Like, where his shots come from so it's almost like practice for him because he shoots those shots over and over again.\"\n\nBrown added: 'Derrick White has grown. This is a new version that we haven't seen before. He put the work in, his body has developed a little bit, he's got some more playoff experience, and he's being aggressive.\"\n\nDuring team practices, White works to perfect getting to the basket by having a lid placed over the rim, per Jared Weiss of The Athletic. Unusual to see, but evidently very effective in the long run.\n\nWhile Kristaps Porzingis is working toward a return and Jayson Tatum uses Cleveland's multi-defender attack to assist open teammates, White has been a postseason luxury. He's shooting a team-leading 50% from three (28-of-56) and sits runner-up to Brown (24.3 points) for the scoring lead, too. None of the shots are forced or unnecessary, it's simply a testament to A) White's readiness and B) the roster Celtics president of basketball operations Brad Stevens assembled in the offseason.\n\nWhite's most recent three-game stretch, in which he's shot 20-of-37 (54%) from three, placed him in a very limited playoff record list. Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Jamal Murray are the only other players ever to hit 20 3-pointers within a three-game playoff span.\n\n\"(It) feels good,\" White told reporters Tuesday night, per CLNS Media. \"I just think the most important thing is just to win. Like I've said before, (it) doesn't matter if I score zero or however many I scored today. When we win, then (we're) doing enough.\"\n\nThe Celtics, collectively, have done more than enough, riding the wave of a four-game winning streak in the playoffs -- all wins by double digits. Boston walked over Miami in the first round, and sit three wins shy of kicking Cleveland to the elimination curb alongside the Heat.", "source": {"uri": "nesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The humble yet dominant Boston guard put on another show in the Celtics' 120-95 win to tip off their second round series against the Cavaliers, and joined some elite shooters in NBA history in the process.\n\nWhite scored 25 points for the Celtics, and continued his torrid stretch from downtown. He knocked down seven of his 12 three-pointers in the victory, which had Celtics fans chanting his name as Boston's lead grew in the second half.\n\n\"It was awesome,\" White said of the chants. \"Shoutout to the fans always. I'm thankful, and I'm grateful for them, always.\"\n\nFans are grateful for White, too, and the heater he's been on over the last three games. White has scored 88 points to lead Boston over that span (Jaylen Brown is next with 74 points) and he's done so by shooting a blistering 54 percent from downtown, hitting 20 of his 37 bids from deep.\n\nWith those 20 threes over his last three games, White became just the fifth player in NBA history with that many threes over a three-game span. (Thank you to Celtics stats guru Dick Lipe.) The others are Stephen Curry, Jamal Murray, Klay Thompson, and Damian Lillard.\n\nNot a bad group to be mentioned in. But that's not the only good company White is associating himself with these days.\n\nWhite leads the NBA with 28 made threes this postseason, and only Lillard made more threes per game than the 4.7 White has knocked down during the playoffs. (Dame's playoff run came to an end in the first round.) Those 28 triples over Boston's first six playoff games are the most in franchise history, breaking the previous high mark set by Ray Allen.\n\nAre there any Reggie Miller records for White to break this postseason? I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.\n\nWhite is shooting 57.5 percent overall for the playoffs, and 50 percent from downtown. Only Miami's Delon Wright (60 percent) and Minnesota's Karl-Anthony Towns (53.4 percent) are shooting better from long distance, but both are taking fewer than five threes per game. Wright has only taken 1.5 threes per game in the playoffs, while White is throwing up 9.3 attempts.\n\nHe was a big part of the Celtics pulling away in the second half Tuesday night, scoring 14 points while canning four of his threes in the third quarter. White's best shot of the night came off a filthy stepback where he ruined Sam Merrill's sneakers, giving the Celtics an 87-72 edge with two minutes to play in the frame.\n\nWhite even took an uncharacteristic heat check after that three, which clanged off the back of the rim. But he had done enough to that point for fans to fire off more \"Derr-ick Whiiiiittteeeee\" chants as the two teams walked off the floor for a timeout.\n\nThose chants are more than warranted. White is up to 22.8 points per game this postseason, ranking second on the Celtics. And that doesn't even account for his defensive impact, forming a stingy and suffocating backcourt along with Jrue Holiday.\n\n\"He's the kind of guy that can impact the game differently every night,\" Boston head coach Joe Mazzulla said of White after Tuesday night's win. \"Whatever the game calls for, he is willing to do, and he has done that. We need him to continue to do that.\"\n\nThis is nothing new for the Celtics or Celtics fans, who have watched Derrick White rise from a savvy role player into one of the team's top contributors since he arrived from San Antonio just over two years ago. And though White is as humble as ever despite flirting with superstardom, his teammates are promising even more from the 29-year-old.\n\n\"Derrick White has grown,\" Brown said Tuesday. \"This is a new version that we haven't seen before. He put the work in. His body has developed a little bit. He's got some more playoff experience, and he's being aggressive. And we urge him to do that. We're going to need that more and more down the line.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Lillard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Damian Lillard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delon_Wright", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delon Wright"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ray Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Klay Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/05/08/11296f64-8554-4ddd-bacc-ad47ac1eb2fa/thumbnail/1200x630g2/a35b652709709b32500347caca7a968d/derrick-white.jpg?v=3a71db5e6dd1c027f95668a1c7b6fcaf", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549840", "eventUri": "eng-9549840", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

There were no jokes about ju-jitsu instructors, bitcoin or Aaron Hernandez. Only G-rated jabs.\n\nThe Big Aristotle and Sir Charles got a little giddy in the 1 a.m. hour after watching highlights of White's 26-point performance in that 119-109 win a year ago.\n\nErnie Johnson and Kenny Smith tried to talk basketball. They were smothered by Barkley's barbs and Shaq's inability to control himself in the wee hours on the East Coast.\n\n\"Is that Derrick White or Stephen A. (Smith)?\" Barkley said over an image of White from his post-game press conference. \"That dude does 'First Take' in the morning and plays for the Celtics.\"\n\n\"Do you know the crazy part about that?\" Smith asked Johnson (about White's game).\n\n\"He combed it like that,\" interjected Barkley. \"That's the crazy part.\"\n\nAs Smith tried to talk about Malcolm Brogdon (rest in peace), Shaq crooned in his best Barry White voice: \"You'll never find ... bom ... bom ... bom ... bom ... a hairline like mine.\"\n\n\"Hey man,\" Barkley said to his other co-hosts, \"y'all acting like you didn't notice that.\"\n\n\"Y'all acting like you've never seen Derrick White in your life,\" Smith replied.\n\n\"I never seen it like that,\" was Barkley's retort. \"He always had a headband on. We'll see you and your forehead in the Eastern Conference finals.\"\n\n\"Don't be mad, D-White,\" begged Johnson.\n\nBarkley soon got a text message from Smith. \"Do not repeat what Steven A. texted,\" Johnson implored.\n\nWhite's hair - or what was left of it - was long ago shorn by Tuesday. He's become an anti-Sampson. Losing his locks to unlock newfound strength and ability.\n\nWhite discovered the beauty of baldness in the offseason. \"Trying something new,\" White said when asked about his new coif-less bean at Celtics media day in October.\n\nHair or no hair, White's been a shining star for the Celtics this season. He has yet to slow down since his game-six-clinching put-back against the Heat in the 2023 Eastern Conference finals.\n\nThe Celtics choked out last season in rallying down from 0-3 to Miami only to set up another Garden Game 7 heartbreak. But White was the only fully consistent player on that team, regardless of his role.\n\nThat rolled into this season. White never seems to have an off night. It helps that his role isn't clearly defined. That's also the splendor of it.\n\nHe's what the Celtics need when they need it.\n\nWhite started all 73 regular season games in which he played. He generated 15.2 points and 5.2 assists while averaging 32.6 minutes. More importantly for Joe Mazzulla's \"Shoot-First, Make Excuses Later\" Celtics, White hit 39.6% of his 3-point attempts. That's his best single-season number since his 17 games as a rookie. White's 3-point percentage was second-best on these Celtics for anyone who averaged more than 30 minutes, only behind Jrue Holiday.\n\nWhite replaced Marcus Smart at the \"open guy\" whenever defenses are fully fixated on Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown.\n\nThe difference is that White makes so many of the shots that Smart bricked.\n\nWhite is quietly becoming \"the player you want to take the last shot.\" Sort of like John Paxson to Michael Jordan. Or Dennis Johnson to Bird, McHale and Parish. Or Ray Allen (also bald) to Pierce and KG. According to Boston Sports Info, White has now made the most 3-pointers over any six-game span in Celtics history. Allen held the mark of 27 in 2009.\n\nWhite poured in 25 points Tuesday night, hitting 7 of his 12 3-point attempts. His fifth 3-pointer of the night stifled the Cavs' last hope to make the game competitive. It put the Celtics up 71-57 with 8:48 to play in the third. Boston and the clock stopped at 120-95.\n\nOnly three other players have made 20-or-more threes over a three-game span in the playoffs: Jamal Murray (who shares the record with White at 22), Steph Curry and Klay Thompson.\n\n\"Hell of a (group of) players,\" White said post-game when altered to the feat. \"Just taking what the defense gave me.\"\n\nHis Celtics teammates, Tatum in particular, remain too mercurial when it comes to talent and temperament. White's mood is chill. His face is that of an assassin, serial killer, or tax collector. Too bad his unflappable nature, especially with officials, isn't contagious within the Celtics locker room.\n\nWhite doesn't waste words. His answers are clipped but clear.\n\nHe told NBC Sports Boston's Abby Chin \"we've got to be better\" after the Game 1 snoozer.\n\nWhen pressed for specifics, White was ready: \"Transition. Giving them easy looks. Losing matchups. Stuff like that. It can't happen at this level.\"\n\nOn \"Inside the NBA\" Tuesday night, Barkley was \"bored\" with the Celtics. He was far more excited about a four-leg FanDuel-sponsored parlay that cashed.\n\nShaq called White \"one of the others\" necessary for any team that wants to win a championship. Shaq said White must be a main man, even without his mane, if the Celtics hope to procure Banner 18 in June.\n\n\"He reminds me of Big Shot Bob (Robert Horry) or Rick Fox,\" Shaq said of White, \"a guy that does his job and plays his role. But when you need him, especially to get a big bucket, he will always be there.\"\n\nThe rest of the Celtics would be wise to follow.", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news",

He followed that up with a 7-of-12 shooting night from three-point range to kick off the Celtics' second-round series with the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nHis impact as a scorer and taking his place in an offense where a different player can lead each night truly stood out to the Cavaliers to start the series.\n\n\"I think it's the confidence that you see,\" Cleveland head coach J.B.

The Celtics won two of their three games against the Cavaliers during the regular season, but Cleveland won the only game it played at home.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_maloney@cbssports.com", "name": "Jack Maloney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrett_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jarrett Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payton_Pritchard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Payton Pritchard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/05/09/2f5e3c88-c2e6-4ffb-bd60-8420706044b1/thumbnail/1200x675/b0d928ae1a00b294515f4fab3cde43f0/derrick-white-celtics-g.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549840", "eventUri": "eng-9549840", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

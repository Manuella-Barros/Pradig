They're optimistic. As long as we don't have a setback, which we don't anticipate, we certainly feel good about where we are right now. \"It's very positive.'' Newton hadn't thrown in team drills before Sunday since being pulled midway through a July 30 practice after experiencing soreness and showing signs of fatigue.\n\nHe completed 3 of 4 pass attempts in a red zone drill with short passes to tight end Greg Olsen, running back Fozzy Whittaker and wide receiver Russell Shepard.\n\nHe did not participate in team drills that required him to throw deep passes.\n\n\"Like I told you guys, it's just a matter of time,'' Rivera said. \"We're doing to do what the trainers and doctors say we can do with him with all intent and purpose for him to get ready for the season.'' Newton had surgery to repair a partially-torn rotator cuff on March 30. He threw with the team for the first time on the first day of training camp on July 26. While on a pitch count, he appeared to be throwing without any pain until the fifth practice. Since then he has worked with team trainer Ryan Vermillion, gradually working his way back to where he was as the Wofford College portion of camp broke on Sunday.\n\nRivera said how much Newton participates in the joint practices in Nashville depends on how he responds on Tuesday after having Monday off. \"Today was a good step, very positive,'' Rivera said. \"A lot of good things happened.

in what locals call the Sparkle City.\n\nThey installed the bulk of their new-look offense, got confirmation that Christian McCaffrey's diverse skill set translates to the pros and held their annual P.I.G. basketball tournament, preserved for posterity in a couple of entertaining tweets by Pro Bowl center/Hollywood mogul Ryan Kalil.\n\nWhat the Panthers didn't do during training camp is receive complete assurance that their most player will soon be back to full strength.\n\nCoaches, teammates and the medical staff all believe quarterback Cam Newton and his surgically repaired shoulder will be good to go Week 1 in San Francisco. There's been no sense of panic from coach Ron Rivera or interim general manager Marty Hurney in regards to Newton.\n\n\"There's no reason to (panic). We're just listening to what the doctors and trainers say. They're optimistic, as long as we don't have a setback, which we don't anticipate,\" Rivera said after Sunday's final practice in Spartanburg.\n\n\"We're feeling good about where we are right now. It's very positive.\"\n\nEveryone certainly would have felt better about the situation had No. 1 not spent most of the final two weeks at Wofford stretching, taking half-speed handoffs and making only a few live throws to receivers.\n\nBut Newton ended on an upswing Sunday with his most extensive action since trainers shut him down two weeks ago with arm fatigue.\n\nNewton threw for 10 minutes during individuals, including a fade pass to Kelvin Benjamin and a toss over the middle to McCaffrey. He then participated in 11-on-11 red-zone drills, completing 3-of-4 passes, highlighted by a scoring strike to Russell Shepard.\n\nThe plan is for Newton to continue increasing his pitch count over the next two weeks, and Rivera said he could be a part of the joint practices with the Titans next week in Nashville.\n\n\"I think he's going to be all right,\" backup quarterback Derek Anderson said. \"But like Coach has said, it's a process with anybody. (Friday) he looked pretty good to me.\"\n\nFriday was the first time Newton had thrown live to receivers since July 30 when he was pulled near the end of his fifth practice in five days. The following day Newton went to Charlotte for a consultation with team doctor Pat Connor, who performed the surgery in March on Newton's partially torn rotator cuff.\n\nThe decision was made to scale back Newton's workload to let the pain in his shoulder subside. There was also concern about the range of motion in Newton's shoulder, and team officials didn't want the 2015 league MVP to develop poor throwing habits while overcompensating for the shoulder.\n\nWith Newton getting shelved after doing everything the first week of camp, it's fair to ask whether he pushed himself too hard or whether too much was put on his plate.\n\n\"I don't think so,\" offensive coordinator Mike Shula said. \"You had to find out a little bit. And then being very cautious, where we're not all of a sudden going to do anything to set him back.\"\n\nThe Panthers have been gradually increasing Newton's activity.\n\nHe began by doing light throwing with head trainer Ryan Vermillion, who for a couple of days was Newton's favorite target. Newton then threw on the side to injured rookie receiver Curtis Samuel one day before jumping back into individual drills with his wideouts for 10 minutes Friday.\n\nAfter a day off Saturday, Newton made what Rivera called a \"good step\" Sunday. His day included lining up at wideout with McCaffrey behind center in the Wildcat formation.\n\nThe Panthers would like him to play in a preseason game. The third exhibition at Jacksonville on Aug. 24, when the starters will get their longest work, would make the most sense if you had to pick only one.\n\nBut Rivera said he's fine if Newton's first action comes Sept. 10 at Levi's Stadium, site of Super Bowl 50.\n\n\"As long as we're doing things at an up-tempo with a good pace, we can get the timing down that we need,\" Rivera said. \"But you really can't simulate playing and that's the big difference.\"\n\nBesides building arm strength, the biggest thing for Newton between now and Week 1 will be working on his timing with his receivers and running backs, particularly new weapons McCaffrey, Samuel and Shepard.\n\nThis is not the first time the Panthers have had to monitor Newton's reps during the preseason. When Newton was coming off offseason ankle surgery in 2014, he was held out of the first exhibition and played the next two.\n\nIn the third preseason game at New England, a hit by linebacker Jamie Collins left Newton with cracked ribs and he missed the season opener at Tampa Bay.\n\nSo the Panthers rightly aren't going to take any chances with Newton in games that don't count.\n\nIn Indianapolis, Colts quarterback Andrew Luck remains on the physically unable to perform list while rehabbing from January shoulder surgery. You can imagine the hand-wringing among the Hoosiers.\n\nAt least Newton is back on the field. The key for the Panthers is keeping him there.", "timeCrawl": "17:11:00", "sim": 0.7176470756530762, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 2145, "date": "2017-07-30", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2152}, {"textStart": 3667, "date": "2017-08-24", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 3674}, {"textStart": 3836, "date": "2017-09-10", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 3844}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8945022", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "id": 281, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "id": 521, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "id": 533, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "id": 537, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "id": 885, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/History", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/History", "id": 1013, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

The 30-year-old\u2019s death was announced on Saturday, a day after he had withdrawn from the Charles Schwab Challenge. \u201cWe have spent the last 24 hours trying to come to terms with the fact that our son is gone. It\u2019s surreal that we not only have to admit it to ourselves, but that we also have to acknowledge it to the world. It\u2019s a nightmare,\u201d Murray\u2019s parents, Eric and Terry, said in the statement. \u201cWe have so many questions that have no answers. But one. Was Grayson loved? The answer is yes. By us, his brother Cameron, his sister Erica, all of his extended family, by his friends, by his fellow players and \u2013 it seems \u2013 by many of you who are reading this. He was loved and he will be missed. \u201cWe would like to thank the PGA Tour and the entire world of golf for the outpouring of support. Life wasn\u2019t always easy for Grayson, and although he took his own life, we know he rests peacefully now.\u201d Murray had spoken about his struggles with alcohol and mental health. After winning the Sony Open in January he talked about his problems away from the golf course. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to give up a lot of times. Give up on myself. Give up on the game of golf. Give up on life, at times.\u201d As well as his victory at the Sony Open, Murray won the Barbasol Championship in 2017. His best finish in a major was a tie for 22nd at the 2017 US PGA Championship. He also won three events on the Korn Ferry Tour and was ranked No 58 in the world at the time of his death. On Saturday, Murray\u2019s fellow professionals expressed their grief at his death. \u201cTruly devastating news that Grayson Murray has passed away,\u201d the former world No 1, Luke Donald, wrote on X. \u201cHe asked me for some advice on how to play Augusta a few months ago, last week I saw him at the PGA Championship, life truly is precious. My condolences and prayers to his whole family that they may find some peace.\u201d Webb Simpson said he learned of Murray\u2019s death just before he teed off at the Charles Schwab Challenge. \u201cI just hate it so much,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cI\u2019ll miss him. I\u2019m thankful he was in the place with his faith before this morning happened.\u201d The PGA Tour commissioner, Jay Monahan, said grief counsellors would be available for players at tournaments in the coming days. \u201cTo be in the locker room, to see the devastation on the faces of every player that\u2019s coming in, it\u2019s really difficult to see. And really just profound,\u201d Monahan told CBS on Saturday. \u201cGrayson was a remarkable player on the PGA Tour, but he was a very courageous man, as well. And I\u2019ve always loved that about him, and I know that the locker room is filled with people that really will take that away when they think about Grayson.\u201d In January, Murray said he had been sober for eight months, had become a Christian and was engaged. He said he believed his best golf was ahead of him. He had recently been appointed as a member of the 16-person Player Advisory Council.

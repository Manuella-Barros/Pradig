Biden has said he is fit to serve but understands the questions.\n\nOn Tuesday, Representative Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey became the seventh House Democrat to call on Biden publicly to drop out of the race.\n\nMany more Democrats have expressed concern that Biden continuing at the top of the ticket could cost the party the White House and both houses of Congress in November.\n\nBut public defections remain a small segment of the 213 Democratic-aligned House of Representatives members, and the party's leadership continues to back Biden publicly. No members of the Senate have publicly said Biden should stand aside.\n\nBiden, eager to change the story, has surrounded himself with communities of his staunchest supporters, including Black Democratic lawmakers and voters. His campaign has framed sticking with Biden as a return of the loyalty he has shown them through his half-century of public life.\n\nBiden's first 2020 campaign rally, in 2019, was at a Pittsburgh union hall, and the president has made his thick-as-thieves alignment with Big Labor leaders a major pillar of his populist economic platform. Last September, he became the first sitting president to join a union strike when he met United Auto Workers asking for raises.\n\nLabor leaders expected at Wednesday's meeting include the national presidents of 60 unions, representing 12.5 million Americans, Biden aides said.\n\nAlso this week, Biden has used the NATO summit as a global stage, with a forceful speech denouncing Russian President Vladimir Putin. On Wednesday, he will hold meetings with NATO leaders and then host a dinner for heads of state. The dinner would not normally draw much attention, but concerns over whether Biden can handle the demands of the presidency for another four years have put every Biden event in the spotlight.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, who is the party's top alternative should Biden drop his candidacy, will speak to the Black Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc. in Dallas after a Las Vegas campaign stop on Tuesday.\n\nAfter the NATO summit ends, Biden will hit the road again, traveling to two of the competitive states, Michigan and Nevada, that he must sway to defeat Trump.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre faced another salvo of questions from reporters about Biden's health on Tuesday. In a statement, the White House physician said Biden was not being treated for any neurological condition and had received a clean bill of health at his most recent physical examination in February.",

Biden said he had a bad night at the debate and vowed to stay in the race.\n\nPelosi said on MSNBC she was encouraging her colleagues on Capitol Hill with concerns about Biden to refrain from airing them while he hosts NATO leaders in Washington this week.\n\n\"I've said to everyone: let's just hold off. Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week,\" she said, describing Biden's strong remarks at the NATO summit on Tuesday as \"spectacular.\"\n\nShe declined to say definitively that she wanted Biden to run. \"I want him to do whatever he decides to do,\" she said. \"We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.\"\n\nBiden's campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon and senior advisers Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti will brief Senate Democrats at a lunch on Thursday, Biden's campaign said.\n\nAsked to comment on Pelosi's remarks and Clooney's article, Biden's campaign pointed to a letter he sent Democrats in Congress that said he was \"firmly committed\" to staying in the race and beating Trump.\n\nAsked at the NATO summit whether he still had Pelosi's support, Biden responded by raising a triumphant fist.\n\nHowever, other Democrats' echoed Pelosi on Wednesday, suggesting Biden's efforts to quell dissent within his party had not succeeded. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said he was \"deeply concerned\" about Biden's ability to win the race.\n\nIn Dallas, Vice President Kamala Harris, the party frontrunner to replace Biden if he were to step aside as the Democratic candidate, spoke to a group of some 19,000 people at an event of the historically Black Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority.\n\nThe election is the most \"existential\" and consequential of their lifetimes, Harris said to a crowd that chanted, \"Four More Years!\"\n\nIn his opinion piece, Clooney wrote: \"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\" Clooney wrote.\n\n\"We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate.\"\n\nDemocrats in Congress remain deeply divided over whether to fall in line behind Biden or to urge him to step aside because of persistent questions about his health and acuity.\n\nBut public defections remain a small segment of the 213 Democratic-aligned House members, and the party's leadership continues to back Biden publicly. No members of the Senate have publicly said Biden should stand aside, though Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado said on Tuesday he did not believe Biden could beat Trump.\n\nBiden, eager to change the story, has surrounded himself with communities of his staunchest supporters, including black Democratic lawmakers and voters. His campaign has framed sticking with Biden as a return of the loyalty he has shown them through his half-century of public life.\n\nBiden was greeted with raucous applause when he met with a group of labour leaders, an important part of his political base, on Wednesday, joining an AFL-CIO (America's Unions) executive council meeting in Washington to discuss \"their shared commitment to defeating Donald Trump,\" the Biden campaign said.\n\nBiden listed high rents, expensive grocery prices and a lack of housing as issues to be tackled going forward.\n\nThere is \"a whole range of things we're going to get done with your help in a second term,\" Biden said. \"We're better positioned than any country in the world to own the remainder of the 21st century because of union labour.\"\n\nLabour

Biden, eager to change the story, has surrounded himself with communities of his staunchest supporters, including Black Democratic lawmakers and voters.\n\nHis campaign has framed sticking with Biden as a return of the loyalty he has shown them through his half-century of public life.\n\nBiden's first 2020 campaign rally, in 2019, was at a Pittsburgh union hall, and the president has made his thick-as-thieves alignment with Big Labor leaders a major pillar of his populist economic platform.\n\nLast September, he became the first sitting president to join a union strike when he met United Auto Workers asking for raises.\n\nLabor leaders expected at Wednesday's meeting include the national presidents of 60 unions, representing 12.5 million Americans, Biden aides said.\n\nAlso this week, Biden has used the NATO summit as a global stage, with a forceful speech denouncing Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nOn Wednesday, he will hold meetings with NATO leaders and then host a dinner for heads of state.\n\nThe dinner would not normally draw much attention, but concerns over whether Biden can handle the demands of the presidency for another four years have put every Biden event in the spotlight.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, who is the party's top alternative should Biden drop his candidacy, will speak to the Black Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc in Dallas after a Las Vegas campaign stop on Tuesday.\n\nAfter the NATO summit ends, Biden will hit the road again, traveling to two of the competitive states, Michigan and Nevada, that he must sway to defeat Trump.\n\nJoe Biden back on campaign trail as pressure mounts\n\nWhite House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre faced another salvo of questions from reporters about Biden's health on Tuesday.\n\nIn a statement, the White House physician said Biden was not being treated for any neurological condition and had received a clean bill of health at his most recent physical examination in February.", "source": {"uri":

Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week,\" she said, describing Biden's strong remarks at the NATO summit on Tuesday as \"spectacular\".\n\nShe declined to say definitively that she wanted Biden to run.\n\n\"I want him to do whatever he decides to do,\" she said.\n\n\"We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.\"\n\nAsked to respond, Biden's campaign referred to a letter Biden sent Democrats in Congress that said he was \"firmly committed\" to staying in the race and beating Trump.\n\nIt also noted Pelosi's remark on Tuesday that she had \"always been committed\" to Biden.\n\nDemocratic Senator Richard Blumenthal echoed Pelosi's message later on Wednesday, saying he was \"deeply concerned\" about Biden's ability to win the race.\n\nIn his opinion piece, Clooney wrote: \"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\" Clooney wrote.\n\n\"We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate.\"\n\nOften described as an \"ATM for Democrats,\" Hollywood has traditionally been a significant source of donations for the party.\n\nClooney's event, hosted with actor Julia Roberts, raised more than $US30 million ($A44 million) in what the Biden campaign said was the largest Democratic fundraiser in history.\n\nAfter Biden's debate performance, several Hollywood donors called on the president to end his campaign.\n\nBiden was greeted with raucous applause when he met with a group of labour leaders, an important part of his political base, on Wednesday, joining an AFL-CIO executive council meeting in Washington DC to discuss \"their shared commitment to defeating Donald Trump,\" the Biden campaign said.\n\nAt the meeting, Biden listed high rents, expensive grocery prices and a lack of housing as issues to be tackled going forward.\n\nThere is \"a whole range of things we're going to get done with your help

Picture: REUTERS/ELIZABETH FRANZ\n\nAsked to respond, Biden's campaign referred to a letter Biden sent Democrats in Congress that said he was \"firmly committed\" to staying in the race and beating Trump. It also noted Pelosi's remark on Tuesday that she had \"always been committed\" to Biden.\n\nDemocratic senator Richard Blumenthal echoed Pelosi's message later on Wednesday, saying he was \"deeply concerned\" about Biden's ability to win the race.\n\nIn his opinion piece, Clooney wrote: \"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe 'big f-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\" Clooney wrote.\n\n\"We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate.\"\n\nBiden was greeted with raucous applause when he met a group of labour leaders, an important part of his political base, on Wednesday, joining an AFL-CIO executive council meeting in Washington to discuss \"their shared commitment to defeating Donald Trump\", the Biden campaign said.\n\nAt the meeting, Biden listed high rents, expensive grocery prices and a lack of housing as issues to be tackled.\n\nThere was \"a whole range of things we're going to get done with your help in a second term\", Biden said. \"We're better positioned than any country in the world to own the remainder of the 21st century because of union labour.\"\n\nLabour votes were key to Biden's win over Trump in competitive states, including Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania, in 2020.\n\nDemocrats in Congress remain deeply divided over whether to fall in line behind Biden or to urge him to step aside because of persistent questions about his health and acuity. Biden has said he is fit to serve but understands the questions.\n\nSome have expressed concern that Biden continuing at the top of the ticket could cost the party the White House and both houses of Congress in November.\n\nBut public defections remain a small segment of the 213 Democratic-aligned House members, and the party's leadership continues to back Biden publicly.\n\nNo members of the Senate have publicly said Biden should stand aside, though Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado said on Tuesday he did not believe Biden could beat Trump.\n\nBiden, eager to change the story, has surrounded himself with communities of his staunchest supporters, including Black Democratic legislators and voters. His campaign has framed sticking with Biden as a return of the loyalty he has shown them through his half-century of public life.\n\nBiden's first 2020 campaign rally, in 2019, was at a Pittsburgh union hall, and the president has made his thick-as-thieves alignment with big labour leaders a major pillar of his populist economic platform. Last September, he became the first sitting president to join a union strike when he met United Auto Workers asking for raises.\n\nBiden has used the Nato summit as a global stage, including his forceful speech denouncing Russian President Vladimir Putin. On Wednesday, he will hold meetings with Nato leaders and then host a dinner for heads of state.\n\nVice-president Kamala Harris, who is the party's top alternative should Biden drop his candidacy, will speak to the Black Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority in Dallas after a Las Vegas campaign stop on Tuesday.\n\nAfter the Nato summit, Biden will hit the road again, travelling to two of the competitive states, Michigan and Nevada, that he must sway to defeat Trump.", "source": {"uri": "businesslive.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessLIVE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

You know me. Don't scream at me. Just talk,' the first lady said with a smile after she made an unscheduled stop at a coffee shop in Tampa, Fla.\n\nBut she still didn't answer any questions about the president's health or Democrats' concerns about his ability to beat Donald Trump.\n\nJill Biden spent Monday on a three-state tour to tout Biden's committment to veterans\n\nThe first lady is on a three-state tour to launch Veterans and Military Families for Biden. In her remarks, she emphasized the administration's committment to veterans and reassured the crowd President Biden is staying in the 2024 contest.\n\n'For all the talk out there about this race, Joe has made it clear that he's all in,' she said.\n\nAnd, while she didn't directly address the rumors that she was behind his decision, she did indirectly hint to it.\n\n'That's the decision he's made and just as he has always supported my career, I am all in too. I know you are too or you wouldn't be here today. And with four more years Joe will continue to fight for you,' she said.\n\nThe crowds reacted with cheers, yelling variations of 'yes' and 'four more years.'\n\nBiden was greeted with friendly crowds at all three venues.\n\nVoters at them told DailyMail.com that while they acknowledged the president's bad night at the debate, they were still backing him over Donald Trump.\n\nThe venues were filled with cheering supporters, Biden-Harris signs and out pourings of affection for the first lady as she campaigned in the three battleground states.\n\nBut there were protesters too - at all three stops. In North Carolina and Georgia, Trump supporters waved flags as the Jill Biden's motorcade drove by. In Florida, there were protesters of the president's policy in Gaza, with one sign reading 'Genocide Jill' - a play on the 'Genocide Joe' signs that have followed the president.\n\nJill Biden's message matched Joe Biden's as the president spent Monday on the offensive, sending a letter to Congressional Democrats declaring he was staying in the race. He also held a call with donors, telling them he was 'done talking about the debate.'\n\n'We need to move forward. Look, we have roughly 40 days til the convention, 120 days til the election. We can't waste any more time being distracted,' Biden said, according to a recording obtained by Politico.\n\nJill Biden shakes hands at a campaign event in Tampa, Fla., on Monday\n\nJill Biden led the charge on moving forward. She is one of the president's closest advisers and seen as one of the few people who could convince him to step down as the Democratic nominee.\n\nBut she made it clear she was 'all in,' spending the day attacking Trump for his record on veterans and arguing the former president should not be in power.\n\nShe told the military-heavy crowds that she and Joe Biden know what it's like to be in the armed services. Their late son Beau served in Afghanistan in the Delaware National Guard.\n\n'This is personal for us. We know what it's like to connect with a lagging phone call from across the world, to smile through another holiday at the table. Let me ask you this: Does Donald Trump - does Donald Trump know what it's like?,' she said.\n\nShe repeated the story of how Donald Trump called soldiers 'losers' and 'suckers' - a story which Trump denies.\n\n'He's evil,' she said in Georgia of the former president.\n\n'He didn't want to be seen with injured veterans because it didn't look good for him. It's disgraceful. But it's not surprising,' she said.\n\nShe also warned what would happen if Trump returned to the White House.\n\n'Donald Trump wakes up every morning thinking of one person and one person only: himself,' she said.\n\nAnd she specifically mentioned the recent Supreme Court ruling that presidents have immunity while they are in office.\n\n'We know what Donald Trump is like as commander-in-chief. He dismissed the military community diminished. America's leader ship around the world. It could be worse this time. He said he wants to be a dictator from day one,' she said.\n\nShe noted the recent Supreme Court decision that ruled presidents have immunity from official actions while in office.\n\n'Our democracy cannot stand a Trump presidency with virtually no limits,' she warned.\n\nThe Biden family has circled the wagons around the president.\n\nJill Biden and Hunter Biden are now acting as the president's gatekeepers.\n\nThe president's sister, Valerie Biden Owens, is also standing by him. Owens ran Joe Biden's first Senate campaign and has been involved in every one of his campaigns since. She is his top political adviser.\n\nJill, Hunter and Valerie are the three most important people in any decision Joe Biden makes about his future.\n\nHe listens to them the most. They would need to give their blessing from him to exit the presidential race.\n\nThey show no signs of doing so.\n\nThe Biden clan gathered at Camp David last weekend for a pre-planned photo shoot with famed photographer Annie Leibovitz. But the main topic of conversation was Biden's disastrous debate performance against Trump.\n\nBoth Jill Biden and President Biden have criticized Donald Trump for his comments on veterans, particularly on a report that he called them 'suckers' and 'losers.' Trump has denied those comments\n\nAll the family urged Bien to stay in the race.\n\nJill Biden, in particular, points to all the family has had to endure during Joe Biden's time in the White House.\n\nShe noted the prosecutor of Hunter Biden, NBC News reported, pointing out he could go to prison. The family - and even some Republicans - saw Hunter's prosecution on a 2018 gun purchase as too much over reach.\n\nJill Biden argued now was the time to fight.\n\nThere is another reason the Bidens are digging in their heels. The family, particularly Jill Biden, remembers how Joe Biden was forced out of the 1988 presidential race after a plagiarism scandal.\n\n'In 1987, she saw him be forced out by the press, pundits and polls, and it was really a scarring experience for both of them,' Michael LaRosa, the first lady's former press secretary, told the New York Times.\n\nHe said had discussed the 1988 episode multiple times with the first lady when he worked for her.\n\n'I think they learned from that experience and they weren't going to have their hands forced like they were in 1987.'", "source": {"uri":

He said he had a bad night at the debate and vowed to stay in the race.\n\nPelosi said on MSNBC she was encouraging her colleagues on Capitol Hill with concerns about Biden to refrain from airing them while he hosts NATO leaders in Washington this week.\n\n\"I've said to everyone: let's just hold off. Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week,\" she said, describing Biden's strong remarks at the NATO summit on Tuesday as \"spectacular.\"\n\nShe declined to say definitively that she wanted Biden to run. \"I want him to do whatever he decides to do,\" she said. \"We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.\"\n\nBiden's campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon and senior advisers Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti will brief Senate Democrats at a lunch on Thursday, Biden's campaign said.\n\nAsked to comment on Pelosi's remarks and Clooney's article, Biden's campaign pointed to a letter he sent Democrats in Congress that said he was \"firmly committed\" to staying in the race and beating Trump.\n\nOn Tuesday, Pelosi said that she had \"always been committed\" to Biden, the campaign noted. On Wednesday, she told ABC News she thought Biden could win in November.\n\nAsked at the NATO summit whether he still had Pelosi's support, Biden responded by raising a triumphant fist.\n\nHowever, other Democrats' echoed Pelosi on Wednesday, suggesting Biden's efforts to quell dissent within his party had not succeeded. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said he was \"deeply concerned\" about Biden's ability to win the race.\n\nIn Dallas, Vice President Kamala Harris, the party frontrunner to replace Biden if he were to step aside as the Democratic candidate, spoke to a group of some 19,000 people at an event of the historically Black Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority.\n\nThe election is the most \"existential\" and consequential of their lifetimes, Harris said to a crowd that chanted, \"Four More Years!\"\n\nCLOONEY WITHDRAWS SUPPORT\n\nIn his opinion piece, Clooney wrote: \"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\" Clooney wrote.\n\n\"We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate.\"\n\nDemocrats in Congress remain deeply divided over whether to fall in line behind Biden or to urge him to step aside because of persistent questions about his health and acuity.\n\nBut public defections remain a small segment of the 213 Democratic-aligned House members, and the party's leadership continues to back Biden publicly. No members of the Senate have publicly said Biden should stand aside, though Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado said on Tuesday he did not believe Biden could beat Trump.\n\nBiden, eager to change the story, has surrounded himself with communities of his staunchest supporters, including Black Democratic lawmakers and voters. His campaign has framed sticking with Biden as a return of the loyalty he has shown them through his half-century of public life.\n\nBiden was greeted with raucous applause when he met with a group of labor leaders, an important part of his political base, on Wednesday, joining an AFL-CIO executive council meeting in Washington to discuss \"their shared commitment to defeating Donald Trump,\" the Biden campaign said.\n\nBiden listed high rents, expensive grocery prices and a lack of housing as issues to be tackled going forward.\n\nThere is \"a whole range of things we're going to get done with your help in a second term,\" Biden said. \"We're better positioned than any country in the world to own the remainder of the 21st century because of union labor.\"\n\nLabor votes were key to Biden's win over Trump in competitive states, including Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania, in 2020.\n\n(Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt and Jeff Mason; additional reporting by Susan Heavey and Jarrett

She also lectured the press corps traveling with her on asking her questions about the president's standing with the party. 'Why are you screaming at me? You know me. Don't scream at me. Just talk,' the first lady said with a smile after she made an unscheduled stop at a coffee shop in Tampa, Fla.\n\nBut she still didn't answer any questions about the president's health or Democrats' concerns about his ability to beat Donald Trump. The first lady is on a three-state tour to launch Veterans and Military Families for Biden. In her remarks, she emphasized the administration's committment to veterans and reassured the crowd President Biden is staying in the 2024 contest. 'For all the talk out there about this race, Joe has made it clear that he's all in,' she said.\n\nAnd, while she didn't directly address the rumors that she was behind his decision, she did indirectly hint to it. 'That's the decision he's made and just as he has always supported my career, I am all in too. I know you are too or you wouldn't be here today. And with four more years Joe will continue to fight for you,' she said. The crowds reacted with cheers, yelling variations of 'yes' and 'four more years.' Biden was greeted with friendly crowds at all three venues.\n\nVoters at them told DailyMail.com that while they acknowledged the president's bad night at the debate, they were still backing him over Donald Trump. The venues were filled with cheering supporters, Biden-Harris signs and out pourings of affection for the first lady as she campaigned in the three battleground states.\n\nBut there were protesters too - at all three stops. In North Carolina and Georgia, Trump supporters waved flags as the Jill Biden's motorcade drove by. In Florida , there were protesters of the president's policy in Gaza, with one sign reading 'Genocide Jill' - a play on the 'Genocide Joe' signs that have followed the president. Jill Biden's message matched Joe Biden's as the president spent Monday on the offensive, sending a letter to Congressional Democrats declaring he was staying in the race. He also held a call with donors, telling them he was 'done talking about the debate.'\n\n'We need to move forward. Look, we have roughly 40 days til the convention, 120 days til the election . We can't waste any more time being distracted,' Biden said, according to a recording obtained by Politico. Jill Biden led the charge on moving forward. She is one of the president's closest advisers and seen as one of the few people who could convince him to step down as the Democratic nominee. But she made it clear she was 'all in,' spending the day attacking Trump for his record on veterans and arguing the former president should not be in power.\n\nShe told the military-heavy crowds that she and Joe Biden know what it's like to be in the armed services. Their late son Beau served in Afghanistan in the Delaware National Guard. 'This is personal for us. We know what it's like to connect with a lagging phone call from across the world, to smile through another holiday at the table. Let me ask you this: Does Donald Trump - does Donald Trump know what it's like?,' she said. She repeated the story of how Donald Trump called soldiers 'losers' and 'suckers' - a story which Trump denies. 'He's evil,' she said in Georgia of the former president. 'He didn't want to be seen with injured veterans because it didn't look good for him. It's disgraceful. But it's not surprising,' she said.\n\nShe also warned what would happen if Trump returned to the White House. 'Donald Trump wakes up every morning thinking of one person and one person only: himself,' she said. And she specifically mentioned the recent Supreme Court ruling that presidents have immunity while they are in office. 'We know what Donald Trump is like as commander-in-chief. He dismissed the military community diminished. America's leader ship around the world. It could be worse this time. He said he wants to be a dictator from day one,' she said. She noted the recent Supreme Court decision that ruled presidents have immunity from official actions while in office. 'Our democracy cannot stand a Trump presidency with virtually no limits,' she warned. The Biden family has circled the wagons around the president.\n\nJill Biden and Hunter Biden are now acting as the president's gatekeepers. The president's sister, Valerie Biden Owens, is also standing by him. Owens ran Joe Biden's first Senate campaign and has been involved in every one of his campaigns since. She is his top political adviser. Jill, Hunter and Valerie are the three most important people in any decision Joe Biden makes about his future. He listens to them the most. They would need to give their blessing from him to exit the presidential race. They show no signs of doing so. The Biden clan gathered at Camp David last weekend for a pre-planned photo shoot with famed photographer Annie Leibovitz. But the main topic of conversation was Biden's disastrous debate performance against Trump. All the family urged Bien to stay in the race.\n\nJill Biden, in particular, points to all the family has had to endure during Joe Biden's time in the White House . She noted the prosecutor of Hunter Biden, NBC News reported, pointing out he could go to prison. The family - and even some Republicans - saw Hunter's prosecution on a 2018 gun purchase as too much over reach. Jill Biden argued now was the time to fight. There is another reason the Bidens are digging in their heels. The family, particularly Jill Biden, remembers how Joe Biden was forced out of the 1988 presidential race after a plagiarism scandal.\n\n'In 1987, she saw him be forced out by the press, pundits and polls, and it was really a scarring experience for both of them,' Michael LaRosa, the first lady's former press secretary, told the New York Times. He said had discussed the 1988 episode multiple times with the first lady when he worked for her. 'I think they learned from that experience and they weren't going to have their hands forced like they were in 1987.'\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Biden has said he is fit to serve but understands the questions.\n\nOn Tuesday, Representative Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey became the seventh House Democrat to call on Biden publicly to drop out of the race.\n\nMany more Democrats have expressed concern that Biden continuing at the top of the ticket could cost the party the White House and both houses of Congress in November.\n\nBut public defections remain a small segment of the 213 Democratic-aligned House of Representatives members, and the party's leadership continues to back Biden publicly. No members of the Senate have publicly said Biden should stand aside.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre faced another salvo of questions from reporters about Biden's health on Tuesday. In a statement, the White House physician said Biden was not being treated for any neurological condition and had received a clean bill of health at his most recent physical examination in February.", "source": {"uri": "khaleejtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Khaleej times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@khaleejtimes.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL\u2013CIO", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AFL\u2013CIO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikie_Sherrill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mikie Sherrill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karine_Jean-Pierre", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karine Jean-Pierre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Residential", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Residential", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian_Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian Democracy", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://image.khaleejtimes.com?uuid=a23027bf-da8b-56fe-b104-bc4e1f3a7191&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.8427&width=1200&height=675&x=1.0E-5&y=0.15543.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716125", "eventUri": "eng-9716125", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 534, "textEnd": 541}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

You know me.Don't scream at me, just let me talk.\n\nThe White House had solicited reporters to join Jill Biden's three-state campaign tour Monday, but the first lady is rarely asked hard-hitting questions.\n\nAs part of ongoing efforts by the Biden administration to address growing concerns from media pundits and Democratic colleagues about the president's mental fitness to remain in the race following his first debate against Donald Trump in June, Jill Biden made three campaign stops across North Carolina, Florida, and Georgia on Monday to support her husband's campaign, reported Fox News.\n\nPresident Biden and his family have maintained that he will continue in the race. During her North Carolina event, Jill Biden emphasized, \"\"As commander in chief, President Biden wakes up every morning ready to work for you. That's what this election is all about. You. For all the talk out there about this race, Joe has made it clear that he's all in.\"\n\nBiden has also begun receiving more media attention, particularly after reports have suggested that she is the \"ultimate influence\" over whether the president should remain in the race.

Michael Bennet, D-Colo., told CNN Tuesday evening he is worried a Biden run could lead to a Trump \"landslide\" win, and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on Wednesday opted against endorsing him running in a separate television interview. Still, no widespread movement has emerged this week among divided House and Senate Democrats to try pushing out the president -- and that's advantage Biden.\n\n\"Biden is outplaying all of his Democratic adversaries right now. The President controls the calendar, the delegates, and ultimately the power,\" David Jolly, a former Republican House member, said in an email.\n\nTeam Biden has gone on the offensive, and that could help the president run out the clock on his detractors.\n\n\"It's time to put Trump in the bullseye,\" Biden told Democratic donors on a Monday call, according to excerpts released by the White House. \"I'm in this to the end, and I'm going to beat Trump -- I promise you.\"\n\nBiden received the support of the Congressional Black Caucus and House progressives. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., backed down from a reported effort to assemble a group of his colleagues to urge Biden to step aside. There were no major movements to push for Biden's departure from the race from House or Senate Democrats following separate private meetings on Tuesday.\n\nThat only bolsters how the calendar is on Biden's side. Here are three reasons why.\n\nBoth parties for decades adhered to an unwritten agreement to avoid besmirching a sitting commander in chief when a president was overseas. The summit is being held at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, not far from the White House and Capitol -- but it will put Biden shoulder-to-shoulder with other world leaders.\n\nIt might as well be Paris, London or Brussels.\n\nThat means Biden -- who ran on and continues to tout his decades of foreign policy experience as a senator, then vice president, and now as president for three years -- would be unlikely to announce he's ending his reelection campaign during the summit, which ends Thursday evening.\n\n\"It's good that we're stronger than ever, because this moment in history calls for our collective strength,\" Biden told alliance leaders Tuesday evening.\n\nAsked by a MSNBC anchor if she wants Biden to run for a second term, Pelosi responded: \"I want him to do whatever he decides to do. And that's the way it is.\" She also pointed to Biden hosting and \"setting the agenda\" for the summit which, by definition, will allow him to buy a few more days.\n\nStill, the main event may be a planned solo press conference Thursday, when Biden is slated to take questions from reporters who were not told what to ask in advance by his staff. That also raises the stakes and risks, however, should he have gaffes or bad moments during the summit and wrap-up press conference.\n\n\"Biden might be toast,\" said one Democratic strategist via email who requested anonymity to be candid. \"Unless he aces NATO and his press conference.\"\n\nTo that end, Biden and White House aides this week have reminded pundits that the president has faced long odds and been counted out before. Yet, he found ways to win.\n\nRepublicans are preparing to put on a four-day show of unity next week during their nominating convention in Milwaukee.\n\nTrump has promised another prime-time spectacle, and -- despite saying July 3 that Biden \"just quit\" the race and \"I got him out\" -- said in a television interview this week he believes Biden will stay in due to his \"ego.\"\n\nCharlie Dent, a former GOP House member from Pennsylvania, said earlier this week that's a big reason why Biden appears hellbent on staying in the race.\n\n\"This is a race now between the incapable and the unimaginable. In a perfect world, both would drop out and pass the torch,\" Dent said in a telephone interview. \"But Trump isn't going to do that, and Biden apparently doesn't want to do that -- even after an epic debate meltdown that was witnessed by 50 million viewers.\"\n\nThe twice-impeached and once-convicted 45th president has a unique way of dominating news coverage. His rally Tuesday evening in Florida was a good example, as he verbally attacked Vice President Kamala Harris, a kind of strategic hedge -- just in case Biden's mind is changed and she becomes the Democratic nominee.\n\n\"Whatever else can be said about 'Crooked Joe Biden,' you have to give him credit for one brilliant decision, probably the smartest decision he ever made,\" Trump told his loyalists as sweat glistened on his face under a red \"Make America Great Again\" ball cap. \"He picked Kamala Harris as his vice president. No, it was brilliant. Because it was an insurance policy. Maybe the best insurance policy I've ever seen.\n\n\"If Joe had picked someone even halfway competent,\" Trump added, \"they would have bounced him from office years ago, but they can't because she's gotta be their second choice.\"\n\nBiden campaign aides for months have bragged they have a superior ground operation across the country, but especially in the six to eight battleground states that likely will decide the election.\n\nIf Biden stepped aside, Democratic strategists this week said it is unclear if, or how much of, Biden's state-by-state organizations would cleanly transfer to the eventual nominee.\n\nOn the call with donors Monday, Biden reminded them he has an infrastructure already in place.\n\n\"We have a hell of an organization. We have thousands of volunteers out there now,\" Biden said, according to a summary released by the White House. \"We've opened hundreds and hundreds of headquarters all across the country.\"\n\nThat's a reason Jolly said of congressional Democrats: \"Unless a leading Democrat launches an organized effort to flip 2,000 delegates at the [Democratic] convention, then they're just meeting to meet -- and with no discernible strategy to rally adversarial Democrats to.\"\n\nThe vast Biden campaign apparatus is a big reason why, if he sticks by his vow to run, Democrats might have to accept another thing Pelosi said Wednesday: \"Whatever he decides, we go with.\"", "source": {"uri": "rollcall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Roll Call"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_t_bennett@rollcall.com", "name": "John T.

Media isn't asking; Trump offers clues", "body": "Joe Biden's abysmal performance in last month's debate with Donald Trump \"was a crystallizing moment for some Biden backers, who said it caused them to reassess previous interactions\" with the 81-year-old Biden, a July 8 Wall Street Journal analysis noted.\n\nThe debate \"caused many people to piece together gnawing concerns about Biden's mental acuity they had long harbored,\" the report added.\n\nEven as Biden's deterioration became quite evident to anyone watching, his staff attempted to hide it by carefully scripting all of his public appearances while relying on a compliant legacy media to assure Americans that Biden was, as Joe Scarborough put it, a completely \"cogent\" individual who \"is so sharp and he's on top of everything.\"\n\nThe June 24 debate completely shattered the facade, leaving even some on the Left to ask \"who is really running the country.\"\n\nPeople close to Biden are blaming a handful of advisers \"for putting in place a strategy that minimized\" Biden's age-related struggles,\" the Journal wrote.\n\nThose advisers include Anita Dunn, who is responsible for the White House's communications strategy, along with Steve Ricchetti and Mike Donilon, decades-long political counselors.\n\nBiden allies outside the White House also pointed to lesser-known aides who have served as gatekeepers for the 81-year-old, including Annie Tomasini and Anthony Bernal, close confidants of Biden and first lady Jill Biden, respectively. The White House didn't make Tomasini, Bernal, Dunn, Ricchetti or Donilon available for comment.\n\nDonald Trump has said that he doesn't think Biden will quit the race.\n\n\"It's hard to give it up that way, the way they're trying to force him out,\" Trump said, adding that Jill Biden as well as Hunter Biden are dedicated to making sure Joe continues to the DNC and on to November.\n\n\"It looks to me like [Biden] may very well stay in. He's got an ego and doesn't want to quit. I think Jill would like to see him stay, she's having a good time. I'm hearing Hunter is calling the shots,\" Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity in a phone interview on Monday evening.\n\nSupport American Journalism\n\nAs for being on stage with Biden during the debate, Trump said, \"Within minutes I could tell this was not going to be a good night for Joe Biden.\" He added that Biden looked \"extremely pale\" on the debate stage. Later, Biden seemed to take on a more tintend glow. \"He was a very pale man, to put it nicely,\" Trump said. \"I don't know, maybe it was a good makeup job, maybe it wasn't a good makeup job.\"\n\nAxios reported that Hunter Biden has indeed become his father's \"de facto gatekeeper for longtime friends.\"\n\nThe news comes after NBC News reported last week that Hunter Biden was attending official White House meetings as the family seeks to grab the reins of power away from advisers who they feel have damaged Joe Biden and whom they suspect of leaking to the media.\n\nJoe often refers to his son -- who has a history of using prostitutes, belonging to sex clubs, and recording many of his alleged illicit activities on camera -- as the \"smartest guy I know.\"\n\nIn its report, the Journal noted that those close to him say that Biden \"has moments where he is sharp and detail-oriented. At other times, he is forgetful, stumbles over words and struggles to convey his thoughts. Those kinds of slip-ups have become more frequent.\"\n\nSome who have spent time with Biden after not seeing him for a while said they were surprised by how much he had slowed.\n\nMany Democrats have said they are worried that the nation sees Biden as unfit for another four years and that his staying in the race is a drag on other Democrat candidates.\n\nObama White House adviser David Axelrod said that the governors of Michigan and New Mexico have sounded the alarm that Biden is losing these states and could even lose reliably blue strongholds.\n\n\"There are certain immutable facts of life,\" Axelrod said in an interview with CNN while discussing Biden's age and leadership. \"Those were painfully obvious on that debate stage.\"\n\nAxelrod added that Biden \"just hasn't come to grips with it. He's not winning this race.\"\n\nJill Biden slammed reporters when they asked her about the number of calls from Democrats wanting Joe to withdraw. She was walking out of a coffee shop in Florida when she was approached by the press.\n\n\"What is your message for House Democrats who are calling for your husband to drop out of the race?\" a reporter asked as she was leaving the shop. The reporter added, \"How are you feeling about the state of the race?\"\n\nJill Biden took pause and then scolded the reporter, \"Why are you screaming at me? You know me. Don't scream at me.\" She did not stop to answer the questions from the reporters at the time before getting into a vehicle.", "source": {"uri": "worldtribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Tribune: Window on the Real World"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Donilon", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Donilon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Ricchetti", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Steve Ricchetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anita_Dunn", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anita Dunn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Scarborough", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Scarborough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_transition_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidential transition of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Hannity", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sean Hannity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Axelrod_(political_consultant)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Axelrod (political consultant)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Barack_Obama", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.worldtribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/debate1-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716125", "eventUri": "eng-9716125", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-08", "textStart": 214, "textEnd": 220}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-24", "textStart": 743, "textEnd": 750}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Michael Bennet, D-Colo., told CNN Tuesday evening he is worried a Biden run could lead to a Trump \"landslide\" win, and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on Wednesday opted against endorsing him running in a separate television interview. Still, no widespread movement has emerged this week among divided House and Senate Democrats to try pushing out the president - and that's advantage Biden.\n\n\"Biden is outplaying all of his Democratic adversaries right now. The President controls the calendar, the delegates, and ultimately the power,\" David Jolly, a former Republican House member, said in an email.\n\nTeam Biden has gone on the offensive, and that could help the president run out the clock on his detractors.\n\n\"It's time to put Trump in the bullseye,\" Biden told Democratic donors on a Monday call, according to excerpts released by the White House. \"I'm in this to the end, and I'm going to beat Trump - I promise you.\"\n\nBiden received the support of the Congressional Black Caucus and House progressives. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., backed down from a reported effort to assemble a group of his colleagues to urge Biden to step aside. There were no major movements to push for Biden's departure from the race from House or Senate Democrats following separate private meetings on Tuesday.\n\nThat only bolsters how the calendar is on Biden's side. Here are three reasons why.\n\nNATO summit\n\nBoth parties for decades adhered to an unwritten agreement to avoid besmirching a sitting commander in chief when a president was overseas. The summit is being held at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, not far from the White House and Capitol - but it will put Biden shoulder-to-shoulder with other world leaders.\n\nIt might as well be Paris, London or Brussels.\n\nThat means Biden - who ran on and continues to tout his decades of foreign policy experience as a senator, then vice president, and now as president for three years - would be unlikely to announce he's ending his reelection campaign during the summit, which ends Thursday evening.\n\n\"It's good that we're stronger than ever, because this moment in history calls for our collective strength,\" Biden told alliance leaders Tuesday evening.\n\nAsked by a MSNBC anchor if she wants Biden to run for a second term, Pelosi responded: \"I want him to do whatever he decides to do. And that's the way it is.\" She also pointed to Biden hosting and \"setting the agenda\" for the summit which, by definition, will allow him to buy a few more days.\n\nStill, the main event may be a planned solo press conference Thursday, when Biden is slated to take questions from reporters who were not told what to ask in advance by his staff. That also raises the stakes and risks, however, should he have gaffes or bad moments during the summit and wrap-up press conference.\n\n\"Biden might be toast,\" said one Democratic strategist via email who requested anonymity to be candid. \"Unless he aces NATO and his press conference.\"\n\nTo that end, Biden and White House aides this week have reminded pundits that the president has faced long odds and been counted out before. Yet, he found ways to win.\n\nGOP convention\n\nRepublicans are preparing to put on a four-day show of unity next week during their nominating convention in Milwaukee.\n\nTrump has promised another prime-time spectacle, and - despite saying July 3 that Biden \"just quit\" the race and \"I got him out\" - said in a television interview this week he believes Biden will stay in due to his \"ego.\"\n\nCharlie Dent, a former GOP House member from Pennsylvania, said earlier this week that's a big reason why Biden appears hellbent on staying in the race.\n\n\"This is a race now between the incapable and the unimaginable. In a perfect world, both would drop out and pass the torch,\" Dent said in a telephone interview. \"But Trump isn't going to do that, and Biden apparently doesn't want to do that - even after an epic debate meltdown that was witnessed by 50 million viewers.\"\n\nThe twice-impeached and once-convicted 45th president has a unique way of dominating news coverage. His rally Tuesday evening in Florida was a good example, as he verbally attacked Vice President Kamala Harris, a kind of strategic hedge - just in case Biden's mind is changed and she becomes the Democratic nominee.\n\n\"Whatever else can be said about 'Crooked Joe Biden,' you have to give him credit for one brilliant decision, probably the smartest decision he ever made,\" Trump told his loyalists as sweat glistened on his face under a red \"Make America Great Again\" ball cap. \"He picked Kamala Harris as his vice president. No, it was brilliant. Because it was an insurance policy. Maybe the best insurance policy I've ever seen.\n\n\"If Joe had picked someone even halfway competent,\" Trump added, \"they would have bounced him from office years ago, but they can't because she's gotta be their second choice.\"\n\nGround game\n\nBiden campaign aides for months have bragged they have a superior ground operation across the country, but especially in the six to eight battleground states that likely will decide the election.\n\nIf Biden stepped aside, Democratic strategists this week said it is unclear if, or how much of, Biden's state-by-state organizations would cleanly transfer to the eventual nominee.\n\nOn the call with donors Monday, Biden reminded them he has an infrastructure already in place.\n\n\"We have a hell of an organization. We have thousands of volunteers out there now,\" Biden said, according to a summary released by the White House. \"We've opened hundreds and hundreds of headquarters all across the country.\"\n\nThat's a reason Jolly said of congressional Democrats: \"Unless a leading Democrat launches an organized effort to flip 2,000 delegates at the [Democratic] convention, then they're just meeting to meet - and with no discernible strategy to rally adversarial Democrats to.\"\n\nThe vast Biden campaign apparatus is a big reason why, if he sticks by his vow to run, Democrats might have to accept another thing Pelosi said Wednesday: \"Whatever he decides, we go with.\"", "source": {"uri": "heraldonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cq_roll_call@heraldonline.com", "name": "CQ-Roll Call", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "john_t_bennett@heraldonline.com", "name": "John T.

And just as he has always supported my career, I am all in too.\" \"Four more years,\" the crowd shouted.\n\nMore: Democrats sound like they're going to back Joe Biden - but concerns haven't vanished\n\nGiven her clout, many in the party believe Jill Biden is best positioned to counsel her husband to step aside amid mounting voter concerns swirling around his age and acuity.\n\nBut there's no public sign the first lady agrees the president should drop out - or that she wants the responsibility of telling him to.\n\nAccording to those who know the family, the buck stops with Joe Biden.\n\n\"Jill Biden will be under tremendous pressure to talk to him but he is incredibly stubborn,\" a former Obama administration official told USA TODAY shortly after the disastrous June 27 debate against Donald Trump, where the president spoke in a faint, halting manner and sometimes struggled to complete sentences.\n\n\"I think it's going to come down to Jill. If she chooses to.\"\n\nMichael LaRosa, who served as the first lady's press secretary for most of the Biden presidency, disagreed with that assessment.\n\n\"She knows him better than anybody and she has a lot of wisdom from her years on the front lines, but she doesn't give him political advice,\" he said.\n\nLaRosa said Biden would make a decision after experts like his sister, Valerie Biden - who has led every campaign in her brother's political career - and his close circle of advisors, along with Jill, have weighed in.\n\n\"I wouldn't consider her the sole influencer in this kind of situation,\" LaRosa said. \"She's one of several that will inform his decision, but I don't think she would want that burden.\"\n\nSo far, the first lady has been the president's emissary as much as his consigliere.\n\nJill Biden has been continuously on the campaign trail, including a three state, one-day tour on Monday hitting Georgia, North Carolina, and Florida to launch a campaign coalition of veterans and military families.\n\n\"She was engaged and outgoing,\" said Rep. Nanette Barragan (D-Calif.), chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, who rode in the motorcade with the first lady to a July 2 event in Allentown, Pennsylvania. \"She was there to talk about education and workforce, which is one of her wheelhouse issues.\"\n\nIf Jill Biden was under stress, she didn't show it.\n\n\"Everybody wanted their photo with her, they wanted to be able to take a selfie,\" said Barragan, who on Monday came out in support of Biden as the chair of Hispanic caucus. \"The reception that she got there was so warm and so welcoming.\"\n\nThrough the turmoil, the first lady, who has been married to the president for 47 years, has emerged as a key figure in Bidenworld as a growing chorus of donors, lawmakers and editorial boards ask her husband to step aside.\n\nOn Monday, in North Carolina, she moved on from the campaign firestorm to recall how the Bidens came to \"truly\" understand the \"hard choices\" servicemembers and their families make when their son, Beau, joined the Delaware Army National Guard and went to war for a year in Iraq. \"This is personal for us. We know what it's like to connect with a lagging phone call from across the world, to smile through another holiday at the table,\" she said.\n\n\"Let me ask you this: Does Donald Trump - does Donald Trump know what it's like?\" \"No,\" the crowd shouted. She repeated the story - disputed by the former president - of how Trump reportedly called fallen American soldiers \"losers\" and \"suckers\" after skipping a visit to a World War 1 in Northern France in 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, as of Monday, five Democratic lawmakers had publicly called for Biden to withdraw from the race, including Reps. Lloyd Doggett, Seth Moulton, Ra\u00fal Grijalva, Angie Craig and Mike Quigley.\n\nIn a letter to House Democrats, the 81-year-old president said Monday that he was \"firmly committed\" to staying in the race.\n\nDonor Martin Dolan, who shelled out $10,000 to the Biden campaign in April, and now believes Biden should step aside, said he understands why Joe and Jill Biden would think he is the best person to carry the Democratic banner.\"Whether it's the international picture with China, Ukraine, Israel, Europe or the national picture with the infrastructure bill, they've forgiven student debt, they've accomplished the most legislatively,\" he said.\n\nSo when the president admits he's not as swift as he used to be, but argues that he brings a wealth of knowledge and ability to the office, Dolan said, \"I think that's what they believe.\"\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy is a White House correspondent for USA TODAY.

Biden has said he is fit to serve but understands the questions.\n\nOn Tuesday, Representative Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey became the seventh House Democrat to call on Biden publicly to drop out of the race.\n\nMany more Democrats have expressed concern that Biden continuing at the top of the ticket could cost the party the White House and both houses of Congress in November.\n\nBut public defections remain a small segment of the 213 Democratic-aligned House of Representatives members, and the party's leadership continues to back Biden publicly. No members of the Senate have publicly said Biden should stand aside.\n\nBiden, eager to change the story, has surrounded himself with communities of his staunchest supporters, including Black Democratic lawmakers and voters. His campaign has framed sticking with Biden as a return of the loyalty he has shown them through his half-century of public life.\n\nBiden's first 2020 campaign rally, in 2019, was at a Pittsburgh union hall, and the president has made his thick-as-thieves alignment with Big Labor leaders a major pillar of his populist economic platform. Last September, he became the first sitting president to join a union strike when he met United Auto Workers asking for raises.\n\nLabor leaders expected at Wednesday's meeting include the national presidents of 60 unions, representing 12.5 million Americans, Biden aides said.\n\nAlso this week, Biden has used the NATO summit as a global stage, with a forceful speech denouncing Russian President Vladimir Putin. On Wednesday, he will hold meetings with NATO leaders and then host a dinner for heads of state. The dinner would not normally draw much attention, but concerns over whether Biden can handle the demands of the presidency for another four years have put every Biden event in the spotlight.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, who is the party's top alternative should Biden drop his candidacy, will speak to the Black Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc in Dallas after a Las Vegas campaign stop on Tuesday.\n\nAfter the NATO summit ends, Biden will hit the road again, traveling to two of the competitive states, Michigan and Nevada, that he must sway to defeat Trump.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre faced another salvo of questions from reporters about Biden's health on Tuesday. In a statement, the White House physician said Biden was not being treated for any neurological condition and had received a clean bill of health at his most recent physical examination in

Lloyd Doggett of Texas, demand that President Joe Biden withdraw from the race due to the latter's dismal performance in the debate last month with former President Donald Trump. This is reminiscent of the spectacle fifty years ago this summer when the late Senator Barry Goldwater (R-Arizona) led a team of Republicans to the White House to urge President Richard Nixon to resign. Nixon bowed to the pressure, having resigned on August 9, 1974.\n\nBut there was a difference between this year and 1974. Nixon's corruption was insurmountable and he was facing certain impeachment. It's not clear whether enough votes were in the U.S. Senate to remove Nixon from office. But Tricky Dick was taking no chances. He had financial difficulties and he knew that if removed from office by way of impeachment that he would be ineligible to receive a former president's pension.\n\nFor his part, Biden possesses not a hint of corruption in his decades long political career. Ironically, Trump is saddled with a 34 count felony conviction and faces further legal difficulty. (By the way, immunity and innocence are quite different.) Biden's only offense is his poor showing in the debate. And polls do not show much movement since the debate. If Biden stays in the race and faces Trump in the fall, the election is sure to be close. Indeed, one poll shows Biden leading here in Michigan.\n\nAt this writing, it's only a minority of Democrats calling for Biden to withdraw. Of course, there may be more who might agree with the nine Democrats mentioned above and have simply not gone public. And pundits are right to note that even though the calls for Biden to pull out represent a minority of Democrats, the number may not be marginal and is certainly unhelpful.\n\nYet Biden has the delegates and a late comer into the presidential race will have an uphill climb and will have less chance than has Biden to beat Trump. Moreover, Biden was right to admonish on MSNBC any Democrat who feels he should not be the nominee to challenge him at the convention later this summer. A possible irony to this scenario is that such a challenge may make Biden an even better candidate.\n\nThose Democrats calling on Biden to withdraw from the race are in need of perspective. For instance, no Democrat can win for president absent the African American vote. And the Congressional Black Caucus should be commended for distinguishing itself from those Democrats opposed to Biden continuing his candidacy. Support for Biden from the caucus will go a long way in delivering significant African American voter turnout.\n\nOne must concede that Donald Trump has a significant following. But Biden beat Trump once before (albeit Trump has yet to concede the 2020 election). Those calling for Biden to drop out of the race insist much is on the line in this election. But that's exactly the point. A hypothetical alternative to Joe Biden is not bound to defeat Trump.\n\nEven before the debate, this election wasn't going to be easy for Biden. But he's very competitive with Trump. Indeed, the shot in the arm to the Biden campaign provided by the Congressional Black Caucus may rally the votes necessary for the Democrats to retain the White House. But this scenario can only be realized with Joe Biden as the nominee.", "source": {"uri": "thenewsherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_o_neill@thenewsherald.com", "name": "John O'Neill", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Nixon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Impeachment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Doggett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lloyd Doggett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Goldwater", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barry Goldwater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Black_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Black Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voter turnout"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.thenewsherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/John-ONeill-1.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716125", "eventUri": "eng-9716125", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nClooney said that Biden would lose the presidential election, and Democrats would also lose in the Senate and House of Representatives.\n\nAt the fundraiser in Los Angeles co-hosted by Clooney and fellow movie star Julia Roberts, Biden appeared tired as he took to the stage alongside former president Barack Obama.\n\nHe had flown straight to California from the G7 summit in Italy and has since blamed jetlag, and a cold, for his disastrous performance in a June 27 television debate with Donald Trump.\n\nFellow actor Michael Douglas

whether to end his candidacy, ignoring Biden's repeated insistence that he is committed to run.\n\n\"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run,\" she told MSNBC.\n\n\"We're all encouraging him to make that decision because the time is running short.\"\n\nPelosi said Biden should however delay any final decision until after NATO's 75th anniversary summit in Washington, which ends on Thursday with what will be a closely watched press conference by the president.\n\nFellow NATO leaders appeared to rally round Biden as he greeted them on arrival.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, himself under pressure after calling an inconclusive snap election, gave the older man a hug and a firm handshake on the podium.\n\nBiden, who gave a forceful speech pledging new air defenses for Ukraine as the summit opened on Tuesday, got through his opening remarks with only a couple of verbal stumbles.\n\nBut his every move from now until November will now be watched for evidence of age-related frailty or ill health.\n\nHe also dropped in on union leaders on Wednesday in another bid to shore up his key supporters.\n\nAt least eight House Democrats have openly called on Biden to not seek reelection, with New York Congressman Pat Ryan jumping ship on Tuesday.\n\nColorado's Michael Bennet became the first Senate Democrat to publicly turn on the president, saying Biden would lose if he stayed on the ballot.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide and take with it the Senate and the House,\" Bennet told CNN.\n\nFormer White House communications director Kate Bedingfield, who served under Biden for two years, urged his campaign to show a \"path to victory\" despite the \"overwhelmingly negative\" polls.\n\nRepublican challenger Trump, 78, is meanwhile back on the warpath after a long interval of silence following the June 27 debate, accusing Biden of hiding secrets about his health.\n\n\"It's the biggest cover-up in political history,\" Trump thundered at a rally in Florida on Tuesday.\n\nThe former president dared his successor to another debate without moderators and challenged him to a

\"it's up to the president to decide\" if he's going to run.\n\n\"We're all encouraging him to make that decision, because time is running short,\" Pelosi said early Wednesday on MSNBC.\n\nPressed on whether she personally wants Biden to stay on the top of the ticket, Pelosi said, \"I want him to do whatever he decides to do.\"\n\nShe said she watched as he delivered a forceful speech at NATO, and while foreign leaders are in Washington she encouraged Democrats to \"hold off\" with any announcements about his campaign.\n\nPelosi has been widely watched for signals of how top Democrats are

He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\" At the fundraiser in Los Angeles co-hosted by Clooney and fellow movie star Julia Roberts, Biden appeared tired as he took to the stage alongside former president Barack Obama.\n\nHe had flown straight to California from the G7 summit in Italy and has since blamed jetlag, and a cold, for his disastrous performance in a June 27 television debate with Donald Trump. Biden's bid for a second term in the White House has been under severe pressure since the debate, in which he slurred his words and stood with mouth agape while Trump talked.\n\nWhile top Democrats broadly but unenthusiastically backed him on Tuesday, Biden's efforts to turn the page took a leap backwards with the interventions of Pelosi and Clooney. Former House speaker Pelosi, 86, said time was running out for Biden to decide whether to end his candidacy, ignoring\n\nBiden's repeated insistence that he is committed to run.\n\n\"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run,\" she told MSNBC. \"We're all encouraging him to make that decision because the time is running short.\" Pelosi said Biden should however delay\n\nany final decision until after NATO's 75th anniversary summit in Washington, which the US president is hosting this week. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal echoed Pelosi's message later on Wednesday, saying he was \"deeply concerned\" about Biden's ability to win the race.\n\nOn the way to the summit on Wednesday, Biden was greeted with raucous applause when he met a group of labor leaders, an important part of his political base, joining an AFL-CIO executive council meeting in Washington to discuss \"their shared commitment to defeating Donald Trump,\" the Biden campaign said.\n\nAt the meeting, Biden listed high rents, expensive grocery prices and a lack of housing as issues to be tackled going forward. There is \"a whole range of things we're going to get done with your help in a second term,\" Biden said. \"We're better positioned than any country in the world to own the remainder of the 21st century because of union labor.\" Labor votes were key to Biden's win over Trump in competitive states, including Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania, in 2020.\n\nBiden's appearances at the NATO gathering are being closely watched as he tries to reassure allies of his continued ability to lead as the alliance backs Ukraine's fight against Russia. Seven House Democrats have openly called on Biden to not seek reelection. A handful of senators have also expressed concerns.\n\nLate Tuesday, Colorado's Michael Bennet became the first Senate Democrat to publicly turn on the president, saying Biden would lose if he stayed on the ballot -- and perhaps cause congressional Democrats to lose as well. \"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide and take with it the Senate and the House,\" Bennet told CNN, adding he believes the White House \"has done nothing\" to demonstrate they have a plan to win in November.\n\nRepublican challenger Trump, 78, is meanwhile back on the warpath after a long interval of silence following the June 27 debate, accusing Biden of hiding secrets about his health. \"It's the biggest cover-up in political history,\" Trump thundered at a rally in Florida on Tuesday. The former president dared his successor to another debate without moderators and challenged him to a round of golf. - Agencies", "source": {"uri": "kuwaittimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

For now, Biden shows no backing down, and with the exception of a few, Democrats don't seem ready to break with Biden, at least publicly for now. How California's House Democrats proceed could be telling as to how the caucus at large is feeling.\n\nRep. Lou Correa, D-Calif., admitted he was worried after watching Biden fail to defend his record against Trump on stage. But it was Biden's response in the days following that reassured the Orange County lawmaker that Biden was up for the challenge of a grueling campaign.\n\n\"I want to see how he reacts after, you know, getting sacked in the end zone. Is he going to come out fighting or is he going to give up?\" Correa said of Biden. His assessment? Biden \"came out fighting, he came out fighting hard.\"\n\nCorrea said the voters have already spoken in choosing Biden to be the nominee through the primary process, noting that \"at the end of the day, it's not a bunch of Congress people in a smoke-filled back room that are deciding if Biden's going to run.\" But Correa said the debate, and the subsequent hand-wringing, is a harsh wake-up call for Democrats that this election is going to be a battle on all fronts -- not just due to Biden's age.\n\n\"Donald Trump, convicted of felonies 34 times -- I think Democrats thought this was going to be a cakewalk, beating Trump. Now they're waking up and realizing, 'Oh, my God, we've got a dogfight.' And frankly, I'm happy people are waking up to the fact that this is going to be a tough fight,\" Correa shrugged. \"If Democrats are out there concerned, you know what? Put on your walking shoes and let's go out walking precincts door to door.\"\n\nBut other Democrats were not so quick to embrace Biden, keeping him at arm's length.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., was critical to the Biden-Harris campaign's efforts to get voters to write-in Biden on the ballot during the New Hampshire primary after the campaign didn't file to appear on the ballot to comply with the DNC rules to have South Carolina as the party's first primary.\n\nBut this week, Khanna gave a less-than-solid measure of support for Biden.\n\n\"We've got to focus on making the economic contrast with Donald Trump. We have a party that is focused on increasing wages for the working class, that's providing universal childcare, that's going to strengthen Medicare. Donald Trump wants to erode all of that. And that's the focus we need to make, in this election season,\" Khanna said. \"President Biden has the delegates. It's his decision what he wants to do. I respect that. I respect the nomination process. I will support vigorously whoever that nominee is, which right now, clearly is President Biden.\"\n\nFollowing Biden's meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus last night, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus also came out in strong support of his candidacy. Chairwoman Nanette Barrag\u00e1n, D-Calif., told Spectrum News she's \"with the president. [I] am with the, I like to say, the Biden-Harris team.\"\n\nBarrag\u00e1n appeared alongside First Lady Dr. Jill Biden in Allentown, Pennsylvania last week, and said that Democrats need to recommit to getting out there and spreading the message of what he has been able to accomplish over the last three years. And while she's occasionally been at odds with Biden on matters of immigration, she's got Biden's back.\n\n\"I think President Biden does the best when he's out with people and engaging with people. I know, I've seen it firsthand and the empathy that he has is so different than the opposition. He has a plan. He has ideas. He has a record to run on. That's so very different than Trump.\"\n\nOther Democrats said they need to see more from Biden before they follow him up the mountain -- or over a cliff.\n\n\"Joe Biden had a bad night -- Donald Trump has had a bad life,\" quipped Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif. \"The Republican convention meets this coming week. They ought to move to a different candidate, one who doesn't lie 30 times in one 90 minute debate.\"\n\nBut Sherman has been cautious about his support of Biden, saying the president needs to do more to convince both him and the public that he can defeat Trump this fall.\n\n\"Looking at the first three-years-plus of the Biden administration, the Democratic voters wanted Joe Biden. But they made that decision before they saw, June 27 Joe Biden. And so, nobody wants to vote for -- I mean, look, I love him, I respect him -- but the June 27 image is not what the country wants to embrace.\"\n\nSherman said the September debate between Biden and Trump hosted by ABC should not be the next time the Democratic nominee faces a live test. He's urging the president to do a live, lengthy interview before the convention to increase confidence among voters.\n\nSherman told Spectrum News he has not spoken to the president, and that he is \"undecided\" in where he stands on whether or not Biden should remain the nominee. \"I'm undecided in that I want more information -- but even the people who say they've decided want more information too.\"", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectrum News Bay News 9"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score":

We are sort of the Dutch uncles of American politics. For us, there is one goal: ensuring that Donald Trump and his plans for a retribution-driven, all-powerful presidency never see the inside of the White House. If Joe Biden is useful in achieving that, we're all for him. If he is not, then we are cold-blooded about replacing him.\n\nIn contrast, a lot of Democrats have been too polite to openly criticize their own party's presumptive nominee. Fortunately, though Never Trumpers have been accused of a lot of things, they've never been accused of being overly polite. So let's rip off the scab.\n\nDespite almost two weeks of gentle urging to reconsider his position, Joe Biden has now dug himself in and refuses either to demonstrate he's still up to the job or to step aside as the nominee. His best argument, easily dispensed with, is that quitting the race would be undemocratic, since he won the primaries. But Biden, by refusing to participate in primary debates, sold Democratic voters a pig in a poke. Had he taken the stage and let America see what they saw two weeks ago, we would not be having this discussion now.\n\nBut for the moment, let's ignore Biden's debate performance. While I personally don't agree with all of his policies, Biden has, overall, been a good president. But he is the worst communicator to occupy the Oval Office in my lifetime. Although he largely stuck the landing and guided the country out of COVID, voters' faith in Biden's ability to handle the economy is at historic lows.\n\nDespite two years of often-spectacular growth, half of Democrats believe we are in a recession. Half of Americans think the unemployment rate is at a 50-year high when, in fact, it is at a 50-year low. Half of Americans think the stock market is down, even though the S&P 500 has gone up about 25 percent over the last year. If I believed this sort of rubbish about the economy, I might be unenthusiastic about voting for Biden myself.\n\nAll this is 100 percent Joe Biden's fault. This would never have happened to Bill Clinton or Barack Obama, or even George W. Bush. Sharing good news is one of the most basic of presidential skills. And Trump is a master at pounding home a message, even if it's complete nonsense. But Biden is different. Forget selling voters on his vision, Biden hasn't been able to effectively communicate basic facts.\n\nI don't care what the reasons are for this. All I care about are the results. And Biden simply does not have the communications skills to deliver those results.\n\nThe situation is dire. Four years ago at this time, Biden was 9 points ahead. Now he is five points behind. In 2020, Biden eventually won nationally by four points, and by much less in the key states that put him over the top. So you do the math.\n\nNow let's factor in the age issue. Biden has been dogged by concerns about his age since 2020 Those concerns blew up into a full-blown crisis after the debate. Biden has had two weeks to handle this, but every time he speaks without a teleprompter, he only makes things worse. When asked whether he had watched his own debate performance afterward, his answer was, \"I don't think I did, no.\"\n\nTake a look at his public appearances over the last few months. Is anyone really comfortable gambling American democracy on Biden not having another \"episode\" when it is too late to do anything about it?\n\nThe only way Biden can stay on as the nominee is if he has a plan to address these problems and can execute it. It's great that Biden is a \"fighter\" and gets up after he gets knocked down, but platitudes are not a plan. And even if he did have a plan, Biden now lacks the necessary political skills to execute it. He hasn't been able to sell his accomplishments for the last three years. There's no reason to believe he'll be able to do that over the next three months, much less address voters' very real -- and growing -- concerns that he is now too old.\n\nAnd let's not even discuss how, after what we have seen, Biden is supposed to convince voters that he'll still be fit to serve four years from now.\n\nThe possibility -- now the probability -- that Trump will win the election is all too real. If Biden stays in the race, Democrats will have to rely entirely on the anti-Trump vote to get them to 270 electoral votes. But the anti-Trump vote is already baked in. Democrats could be running a tuna casserole in Biden's place, and it would be guaranteed to get something like 45 percent of the vote.\n\nVoters deserve something to get excited about, something to be for, instead of just something to be against. Since Biden can no longer provide that, there is no reason to keep him.\n\nKamala Harris has her own communications issues but she can certainly think on her feet. And I think Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan, as the nominee would fundamentally remake the race. Either of them would be a big improvement over Biden.\n\nHe has to go.\n\nNone of this gives me any pleasure. I was an early advocate for Biden. But we cannot afford to be sentimental. There is too much at stake.\n\nParty officials and elected Democrats, ask yourselves, 'Do I really believe that the Joe Biden of 2024 is the best possible candidate to beat Donald Trump?'

(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\n\nWith the revelation over the past two weeks that President Joe Biden is mentally and physically diminished, Democrats have traveled through all five stages of grief; first, they experienced denial; then anger; then bargaining; next, depression; finally, acceptance.\n\nBut what they're accepting is not Biden's mental decline. What they're accepting is the fundamental reality that they bet on the wrong horse.\n\nAnd what comes next is likely to be even worse.\n\nAt first, Democrats engaged in full-scale denial that anything was wrong with Biden. The White House maintained that he was hale and healthy; Democrats in Congress tried to maintain the brave front that his debate failure had been a one-off. This is a stance now relegated to Biden's immediate family: First lady Jill Biden insists that Joe is just fine; Hunter says that Joe hasn't lost a step.\n\nBut the rest of the party quickly moved on to stage two: anger. Democrats in Congress and members of the legacy media were -- and are -- enraged at the Biden campaign.\n\nThey knew, of course, that Joe Biden is addled. But they had faith that the Biden campaign wouldn't put that reality on full display. They believed that the Biden campaign, even with its ailing frontman, would somehow cobble together a winning campaign against former President Donald Trump. When their hopes were stripped away all at once, they responded with pure, unbridled fury. Congressmen called for Biden to step down; The New York Times editorial board fantasized about his ouster.\n\nBut as Biden continued to hold on -- as he continued to stonewall all the attempts by his erstwhile allies to dump him overboard -- Democrats entered Phase 3: bargaining.\n\nNow they began to fantasize about an open convention. A shortened primary process. A Kamala Harris invocation of the 25th Amendment. Anything -- anything! -- to get rid of Biden. Perhaps it would tear the party apart and finally sink the Democrats' 2024 hopes ... but surely the Biden campaign couldn't continue to maintain the charade.\n\nAnd yet Biden continued, stolidly, to deny any problems at all. He said that only elites within the Democratic Party wanted him gone. He explained that he had won the most votes in the primaries, and that he would not leave absent an act of God. He stated that he would be fully satisfied if he ran to the end of the race and lost, so long as he had done his \"goodest.\"\n\nAnd so, Democrats descended into depression. Looking at the national and state polls, congressional Democrats began to mutter behind closed doors about the prospect of losing both the House and the Senate. Donors began shifting their money away from the presidential race and toward down-ballot races.\n\nNow Democrats seem finally to have shifted into acceptance. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who had earlier said that Biden should drop out of the race, now reversed himself. When asked whether he had done so for pragmatic reasons, he answered surlily, \"Well, yeah. He said he's gonna remain in, he's our candidate, and we're all going to support him.\" Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., who had floated the idea of a shortened primary season, announced that Democrats would be \"riding with Biden.\"\n\nDemocrats know, of course, that Biden is in terrible shape in this presidential cycle.

People who had stood by Biden suddenly got cold feet. Disturbing reports about his private struggles began to emerge. Elected Democrats and even a senior White House official (albeit anonymously) called for him to drop out, and donors said they'd close their wallets.\n\nThe July 4 holiday and the weekend gave Biden some respite, but as the week started, more Democrats called for him to leave. Even Representative James Clyburn, perhaps Biden's most essential ally, looked like he might be wavering. The ground was shaking, the dam was breaking: Pick whichever clich\u00e9 you like, but Biden looked like he was done, no matter how defiant a pose he struck.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Joe Biden doesn't understand the post-debate reality\n\nYet by yesterday afternoon, Biden seemed to have quelled the rebellion. The rate of defections has slowed. The Congressional Black Caucus and Congressional Hispanic Caucus both reaffirmed their support on Monday. \"I'm with Joe,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer reiterated, several times, yesterday. A group of Senate Democrats, led by Mark Warner, that wanted to nudge Biden out called a meeting off. Senator Michael Bennet said he believed Trump will win in a landslide -- but declined to call for Biden to drop out. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the most prominent House leftist, also backed Biden. Representative Jerry Nadler, who had privately suggested Biden bow out, waffled.\n\nIn one of the most confounding statements of the whole sequence, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in an interview this morning that Biden must consider his choices, as though he has not been very clear about what he wants to do. \"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run,\" she said. \"We're all encouraging him to make that decision. Because time is running short.\"\n\nWhat happened that allowed Biden to calm the storm after more than a week of flailing? His interview with George Stephanopoulos on Friday, though not exactly inspiring, was adequate. A Monday phone interview with MSNBC's Morning Joe was downright vinegary, even if Biden acknowledged using notes. The Biden campaign was also able to cherry pick new polls that show the president tied with Donald Trump and closing the gap in key swing states, even though generally, polls show Biden losing a bit of ground since the debate.\n\nPerhaps the most effective thing was Biden's show of defiance. Immediately after the debate, his team seemed unsure how to respond, and it took more than a week for him to sit for a major national interview. Yet Biden's intense pushback in that interview and since, including a letter to congressional Democrats, seems to have cowed the party a bit.\n\nConor Friedersdorf: The worst argument in favor of keeping Joe Biden\n\nBiden's allies have tried to paint anyone who wants him to drop out as a bad-faith critics who are aiding Trump, but that's unfair. Many of them have been steadfast Biden supporters and have praised his presidency. They are nervous now because they view the possibility of a Trump victory as perilous. No one can dispute that changing candidates at this stage would be a risky maneuver. What is new since the debate is the sense that the risk of sticking with Biden is now at least as great as the downside of nudging him out.\n\nBecause these critics are motivated by fear of a Trump victory, however, some are wary of a drawn-out public argument that could weaken Biden but fail to force him out, so Biden's defiance has brought them up short. This moment is reminiscent, in a strange way, of October 2016, when many Republicans wanted Trump removed from the ticket after the release of the Access Hollywood tape. When Trump stood pat, the energy against him dissipated.\n\nDavid A. Graham: What is the Biden campaign's theory of victory now?\n\nIf Biden can ride out the next nine days, Democratic National Committee rules will make it much harder to remove him. None of the problems facing Biden's candidacy are gone, though. First, as I noted the other day, Biden's argument before the debate was that once Americans saw Trump on stage, they'd remember why they disliked him. That didn't happen. Now, Biden's argument is that the race is still close -- but he isn't articulating a clear case for how he's going to change a race that he has been consistently trailing for months.\n\nSecond, if you somehow still believe that Biden's struggles on the stage were a one-time issue, then you might be satisfied with his pushback . But one or a few steady appearances can't erase the bad one, and the chance that Biden will have another unsteady moment, even if it's not as serious, seems very great. The moment that happens, any confidence he's managed to instill will evaporate once again, and the rebellion will be back in action.", "source": {"uri": "theatlantic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Atlantic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_a_graham@theatlantic.com", "name": "David A.

It would be substantial,\" he said. \"But again, in a popular vote, I still think it's relatively close.

Additionally, a tracking poll from Morning Consult shows that since the debate, Trump has held a 2 percentage point lead over Biden.\n\nRealClearPolitics polling average currently shows Trump holding a 3.3 percent lead over Biden across several recent polls.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Biden's campaign and Trump's spokesperson via email for comment.\n\nSome Democrats, such as Illinois Representative Mike Quigley and Texas Representative Lloyd Doggett and major Biden donor George Clooney, have called on Biden to step down from his campaign and let the party pick a new candidate.\n\nBiden has repeatedly vowed to stay in the race. On Monday, Biden sent a letter to House Democrats that said, \"The question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now. And it's time for it to end.\"\n\n\"I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump,\" Biden added in his letter.\n\nA number of other Democrats have issued support for Biden, including New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who said, \"He made clear then, and he has made clear since that he is in this race...He had reiterated that this morning. He has reiterated that to the public. Joe Biden is our nominee. He is not leaving this race.

But what they're accepting is not Joe Biden's mental decline. What they're accepting is the fundamental reality that they bet on the wrong horse.\n\nAnd what comes next is likely to be even worse.\n\nAt first, Democrats engaged in full-scale denial that anything was wrong with Joe Biden. The White House maintained that he was hale and healthy; Democrats in Congress tried to maintain the brave front that his debate failure had been a one-off. This is a stance now relegated to Biden's immediate family: Jill Biden insists that Joe is just fine; Hunter says that Joe hasn't lost a step.\n\nBut the rest of the party quickly moved on to stage two: anger. Democrats in Congress and members of the legacy media were -- and are -- enraged at the Biden campaign. They knew, of course, that Biden is addled. But they had faith that the Biden campaign wouldn't put that reality on full display. They believed that the Biden campaign, even with its ailing frontman, would somehow cobble together a winning campaign against Donald Trump. When their hopes were stripped away all at once, they responded with pure, unbridled fury. Congressmen called for Biden to step down; The New York Times editorial board fantasized about his ouster.\n\nBut as Joe Biden continued to hold on -- as he continued to stonewall all the attempts by his erstwhile allies to dump him overboard -- Democrats entered phase three: bargaining. Now they began to fantasize about an open convention. A shortened primary process. A Kamala Harris invocation of the 25th Amendment. Anything -- anything! -- to get rid of Biden. Perhaps it would tear the party apart and finally sink the Democrats' 2024 hopes ... but surely the Biden campaign couldn't continue to maintain the charade.\n\nAnd yet Joe Biden continued, stolidly, to deny any problems at all. He said that only elites within the Democratic Party wanted him gone. He explained that he had won the most votes in the primaries, and that he would not leave absent an act of God. He stated that he would be fully satisfied if he ran to the end of the race and lost, so long as he had done his \"goodest.\" And so Democrats descended into depression. Looking at the national and state polls, Congressional Democrats began to mutter behind closed doors about the prospect of losing both the House and the Senate. Donors began shifting their money away from the presidential race and toward down-ballot races.\n\nNow Democrats seem finally to have shifted into acceptance. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who had earlier said that Biden should drop out of the race, now reversed himself. When asked whether he had done so for pragmatic reasons, he answered surlily, \"Well, yeah. He said he's gonna remain in, he's our candidate, and we're all going to support him.\" Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., who had floated the idea of a shortened primary season, announced that Democrats would be \"riding with Biden.\"\n\nDemocrats know, of course, that Biden is in terrible shape in this presidential cycle. As Jake Sherman of Punchbowl News reported, \"Very very few think he can win and that he is the right candidate for this moment post debate.\" But it's too little too late. No force on earth or in heaven can move Biden. Unless he is hit by lightning -- or suffers an actual physical collapse -- he'll be the man on the ballot in November.", "source": {"uri": "patriotpost.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Patriot Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brokered_convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brokered convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punchbowl_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Punchbowl News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Nadler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Nadler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Clyburn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Clyburn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coattail_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coattail effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Tecumseh_Sherman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Tecumseh Sherman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://img.patriotpost.us/01GR4QNK1K7PV7B16TYRNJ89RV.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716125", "eventUri": "eng-9716125", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

This was the Biden who was, for example, named floor manager by both political parties in 1998 when NATO faced a crucial U.S. Senate vote on the Western alliance's first expansion since the Cold War, bringing in Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic. This was the Biden, too, who for decades repeatedly pressed NATO members to pay more for their defense -- long before Donald Trump ever appeared on the scene.\n\nAnd this week, as President Biden hosts the NATO leaders in Washington for the 75th anniversary summit, it's clear that no one in U.S. politics understands the alliance better, or has done more to revitalize NATO at a moment of maximum peril for Europe.\n\nOn the other side of the screen, however, there was Biden the bumbling gaffe machine, the hail-fellow-well-met guy who stammered and misquoted and was sometimes hard to take seriously.\n\nThis was the Biden who, when he was chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and invited reporters up to Capitol Hill, would often ramble and go into long digressions and make every point at least three times. Biden's talk, even then, was regularly marred by unfinished sentences, with new sentences rising like uncertain phoenixes from the ashes of the half-articulated ones. Sometimes, sitting around the long conference table in his office, many of us (the journalists that is) would look at each other with raised eyebrows, then at our watches, and smile in exasperation as Biden went on talking, all of us sharing the same thought: Will he ever shut up? When can we get the hell out of here?\n\nIt was this same Biden who failed repeatedly and abysmally in presidential runs -- except for one perfect-storm moment in 2020, when he found himself running against a uniquely hated president, Donald Trump, and the only Democratic alternatives were unelectable far-left candidates like Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.\n\nAnd it's this latter Biden, of course -- now in apparent physical and mental decline at the age of 81 -- whose fitness for office is being intensively debated inside his own party. In the weeks since his now infamous debate performance on June 27, many prominent Democrats -- including a handful of congresspeople and senators -- have mounted an unprecedented effort to persuade Biden to stand aside even though he is already effectively the Democratic Party's nominee for reelection.\n\nWhat to think? Certainly, based on what happened on June 27, there is ample reason to question whether Biden is up to a second term -- or even equal to completing his first. But let's have a little perspective here. When it comes to a race against former President Trump, how bad is bad? And is \"Biden bad\" really that bad even now, considering there may be plenty of \"good Biden\" left despite his obvious diminishment?\n\nRecall that the \"age problem\" was a big factor in the runup to 2020 as well. Many Democratic grandees said even then Biden would be too old to enter office at age 78. \"There is no question that what has propelled Vice President Biden to clear front-runner status is his unparalleled experience in contrast to his primary counterparts, but am I hearing gargantuan concerns among Democratic insiders about Biden's advanced age?\" one pollster, Fernand Amandi, told Politico in 2019.\n\nIndeed, one reason billionaire Michael Bloomberg briefly entered the race in 2020 was because Democratic donors (many of whom are currently calling on Biden to drop out) were then also worried about Biden's performance behind closed doors. Well, setting aside his disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, Biden became an effective president after that. Many Democrats believe he has been an outstanding one.\n\nAnd some of those who have known Biden a long time say that even a slowing and aging president is leagues ahead of Trump, given Biden's unparalleled institutional knowledge.\n\n\"A diminished Biden is far better than Trump on his best day,\" said Norman Kurz, his former Senate spokesman.\n\nAdded Michael Haltzel, Biden's former Senate aide on Europe and NATO issues: \"That debate was painful to watch, but is he capable right now? Absolutely, I have no doubt about it at all. What will he be like in two or three years? God only knows. Obviously it's a risk.\"\n\nBut compared to Trump, who is a convicted felon and has repeatedly suggested that he would deploy the Justice Department to go after his political enemies? \"I would vote for Joe Biden if he was in a coma,\" Sarah Matthews, Trump's disaffected former deputy spokeswoman, said on CNN on Tuesday.\n\nSo here is the Biden dilemma. He appears to be damaged goods, not to put a fine point on it. But it's not as if there is a clear alternative, and when it comes to critical issues such as facing down Russia and China, arguably no one comes even close to Biden.\n\n\"Biden knows how the world works. After George H.W. Bush, he is the most internationally experienced president we have had,\" said Ryan Crocker -- one of America's most experienced diplomats and dubbed \"America's Lawrence of Arabia\" by President George W. Bush.\n\nCrocker, a former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan and five other Mideast nations, was harshly critical of Biden for the way he handled Afghanistan, but apart from that he says Biden has been solid on preserving America's place in the world.\n\n\"He is solidly in the tradition of post-World War II U.S. global leadership, understanding the value of alliances,\" Crocker wrote in an email. \"He led the international/NATO response on Ukraine right from the start, much as Bush did on Kuwait in 1990, but without committing U.S. troops. And he stayed with it, working the issue on the Hill. He was right on Israel, in spite of its unpopularity with his base. His work in Asia has been highly effective, bringing about an historic Japanese-South Korean rapprochement.\"\n\nTrue, the June 27 debate -- when Biden visibly froze, lost his train of thought and often sounded incoherent -- marked a new low point. But the issue of his advanced age had been thrashed out well before Biden rounded up nearly 3,900 delegates for renomination earlier this year -- almost twice as many as he needed -- in the primaries. As The New York Times reported back in 2022: \"His energy level, while impressive for a man of his age, is not what it was, and some aides quietly watch out for him. He often shuffles when he walks, and aides worry he will trip on a wire. He stumbles over words during public events, and they hold their breath to see if he makes it to the end without a gaffe.\"\n\nA national poll revealed Tuesday, conducted by the firm Bendixen & Amandi, found that Biden trailed Trump by 42 percent to 43 percent. But the survey also showed that the most likely alternative to Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, did only slightly better -- running ahead of Trump 42 percent to 41 percent.\n\nNo issue, perhaps, is more illustrative of the Biden dilemma than the question of NATO's -- and Ukraine's -- future. To many Americans, Trump has made a persuasive case that the United States can no longer afford to pay the lion's share of NATO's expenses, and the Europeans need to step up. He has also suggested he'll cut a deal to end the war, which would likely include a pledge not to expand NATO into Ukraine.\n\nBut Haltzel, among others, argues that Biden has been on top of these issues for decades. \"He really did his homework. When we had the first tranche of NATO enlargement [in 1998], he went out of his way to learn about the projected costs,\" Haltzel said. \"Every time we met with leaders of a NATO country Biden would always bring up what in those days was called burden sharing. The idea that Trump discovered the issue is bullshit.\"\n\nTrump takes credit for the fact that more NATO countries than ever are meeting the target of 2 percent of GDP spent on defense. But Jeremy Shapiro, research director for the European Council on Foreign Relations, told me that Russia's aggression had much more to do with those budget increases than Trump did. \"If you look at the trajectory of European defense spending, it started going up in 2014. And we know why: the Russian invasion of Ukraine. If you look at that trend line you don't see it change much at all in the Trump administration. Then we see another big inflection point in 2022\" after Moscow's full-scale invasion.\n\nBiden also understood that extending NATO into the former Warsaw Pact nations might be seen as a provocation by Moscow. Before that first expansion in 1998 he even flew to Moscow -- \"to personally assess the Russians' interests,\" Haltzel said. \"We went over all the complaints and hang-ups the Russians had,\" Haltzel added. \"At the end of the day, while they were not happy, compared to the post-2007 rewriting of history that Putin has been engaged in, their complaints were minor.\"\n\nBiden weighed the larger strategic implications as well. \"The single argument in favor of NATO enlargement that resonated most with Biden was the idea we can't allow a gray zone of insecurity in the middle of Europe a la the 1930s,\" which led ultimately to World War II, said Haltzel, who today teaches at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. \"The idea of moving the boundary of civility eastward in Europe was a big one. He knew the status quo wasn't going to last.\"\n\nIn a speech at the summit on Tuesday, Biden delivered strong remarks reading a teleprompter and, in an emotional moment that clearly won over the crowd of European leaders and statesmen, hung the Presidential Medal of Freedom around the neck of outgoing NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.\n\nBiden pointedly said: \"NATO is an alliance of nations but it's also made up of leaders.\"\n\nIt was, very decidedly, a good Biden moment. \"He's always made his share of mistakes,\" Haltzel said. \"But the idea that Biden on his worst day is better than Trump on his best -- of course that's true.\"", "source": {"uri": "foreignpolicy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Foreign Policy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_hirsh@foreignpolicy.com", "name": "Michael Hirsh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Crocker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Crocker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(meeting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summit (meeting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_NATO", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member states of NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Foreign_Relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bloomberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bloomberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cold War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_of_United_States_troops_from_Afghanistan_(2020\u20132021)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan (2020\u20132021)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._E._Lawrence", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

These 4 factors will determine his decision", "body": "Just weeks away from formally becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, President Biden is facing doubts from within his own party that he's capable of defeating former President Donald Trump and serving another four years in the White House. While the Biden campaign and allies attempt to rally support, calls for Biden to drop out of the 2024 race and cede the party's nomination to a younger Democrat aren't going away. The result is a stalemate unlike any other in recent U.S. history -- and nobody is quite sure how it will end. Yahoo News National Correspondent Andrew Romano explains the four factors that could break the impasse.\n\nWe're in a totally unprecedented situation right now in us, politics after President Biden's much criticized debate performance, there are calls for him to step aside and make way for a younger Democrat.\n\nBut on the flip side, President Biden has said he's not going anywhere.\n\nI am running and going to win again.\n\nAnd so you have a standoff, a stalemate, a staring contest between Democrats and their own president, their own presumptive nominee as the clock is ticking down to having to choose who's going to represent them on the ticket in November.\n\nThe first thing to watch is the poll numbers.\n\nNothing is more important right now for Democrats than beating former President Trump before the debate.\n\nPresident Biden was actually leading President Trump by 2% points after the debate, President Trump, he got a narrow lead.\n\nSo the Biden camp argues, ok, 2% points, they can overcome that.\n\nThe question going forward is really whether Biden's numbers sort of stabilize at the current where he can make an argument, at least that he's within striking distance of Trump or if they continue to fall, there's going to be increasing pressure on Biden to drop out and make way for another nominee.\n\nThe next factor to watch is big donors.\n\nNow, it's an unfortunate reality in us politics that it takes a ton of money to run for president and you need to keep a steady flow of cash coming in.\n\nSo Biden is aware of this publicly, he's come out and said he doesn't care what the millionaires think, but he has been courting his big contributors behind the scenes because if you know a big name defects, it gives permission to other donors to do the same.\n\nSo he's, he's trying to tighten it up.\n\nProbably the trickiest situation for Biden is figuring out and shoring up his support among elected Democrats.\n\nThe Senate has been a really interesting place to watch because what you have there is several senators running for re election in key swing states, essentially trying to walk a line in the middle here, not saying that they want Biden to leave the race but saying that he has to go out there and prove that he is the best candidate to beat Donald Trump.\n\nAnd I think that's going to be the ultimate test.\n\nThis is the thing that's going to influence the polls, that's going to influence the donors, that's going to influence other Democrats.\n\nBiden has to go out there and show people proof that he has what it takes to campaign for the next couple of months and govern for the next couple of years.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!

I know you are too or you wouldn't be here today. And with four more years, Joe will continue to fight for you.\"\n\nHer stops were officially about shoring up support for her husband among military families and tying it to Joining Forces, an initiative Jill Biden has championed since she was second lady in the Obama administration.

You can feel what she meant.\"\n\nThe Bidens still have an uphill battle in convincing those within his party whether the president, who is 81, is fit for a second term.

Ra\u00fal Grijalva became the second Democrat in Congress to publicly call for the president to quit the race.\n\nBut for delegates who'll converge on Chicago in six weeks for the Democratic National Convention, loyalty to Biden, pragmatism about what a last-minute scramble would say to voters, and a sense of responsibility to the party are paramount.\n\nFor some, the pile-on has been outright offensive.\n\n\"Indigenous communities and Native communities do not publicly humiliate their elders the way the media has,\" said delegate April Ignacio, who's running to be the first Indigenous woman elected to the Pima County Board of Supervisors.\n\nLorenzo Sierra, a former state House member from Avondale, recalled being on a ventilator weeks before the 2020 election. Doctors had given him only a slim chance of surviving a bout with COVID-19 in the early months of the pandemic.\n\nBiden called \"in our darkest hour\" to tell Sierra's wife that he and the first lady were praying for Sierra.\n\n\"President Biden did not give up on me, and I will not give up on him,\" Sierra said. \"President Biden and Vice President (Kamala) Harris form the team America needs to ensure we will not fall into a MAGA dictatorship.\"\n\nCronkite News reached out to more than 80 Arizona Democrats who'll serve as delegates in Chicago next month. Those who agreed to share their views on Biden were adamantly against him dropping out - though many also acknowledged they're worried.\n\n\"It's time to put this to bed,\" said delegate Mark Robert Gordon, who ran for secretary of state in 2018 - though he would entertain a serious discussion about replacing Biden if there's \"another incident\" like the debate, another occasion for there to be this \"introspection.\"\n\nOf more than 3,900 delegates, nearly all are pledged to Biden. Under party rules, they would ordinarily be obliged to support him on the first ballot unless he releases them.\n\nSome Democrats contend there's a loophole, because their pledge is to reflect the sentiments of those who elected them, and those sentiments can change by the time of the formal nomination.\n\n\"Whichever way we go, we are going to be able to beat Donald Trump,\" said Steven Jackson, a delegate from Tempe, who emphasized he supports Biden.\n\nNear-panic set in among Democrats after Biden's disastrous prime time debate performance live on CNN the night of June 27.\n\n\"We have a person that is honest and committed to our democracy in President Biden, and sometimes he stumbles over his words,\" said Joshua Polacheck, 44, a delegate from Tucson who's running for the Arizona Corporation Commission. \"He had a bad night at the debate.\"\n\nIn Congress, six Democratic lawmakers have publicly called for Biden to quit, and others have privately talked up the option.\n\nHouse Democrats huddled Tuesday morning to debate a path forward, with or without Biden at the top of the ticket. Calls for him to quit didn't escalate but weren't entirely quashed either.\n\n\"Those discussions will continue throughout the balance of the week,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said afterward.\n\nGrijalva, 76, is the highest-profile Arizona Democrat urging Biden to pass the baton to someone younger and more vigorous.\n\nSen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., told Cronkite News Tuesday that he sees no reason for Biden to step aside.\n\n\"Millions of people all across the country, 50 states and more territories voted for him ... and when it becomes a choice between him and Donald Trump, a convicted felon, the choice should be very clear to the American people,\" he said at the Capitol.\n\nBiden won Arizona's 11 electoral votes by just over 10,000 ballots in 2020. Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in the state by over 91,000 votes in 2016, and the latest polls indicate Trump's narrow lead over Biden is slightly wider than it was before the debate.\n\nTrump was the second-oldest president after Ronald Reagan, until Biden took office and bumped them both. Trump turned 78 last month and is now about a month younger than Biden was on Inauguration Day 2021.\n\nNow 81, Biden would be 86 at the end of a second term.\n\nPresident Joe Biden meets with Mark Kelly, Ra\u00fal Grijalva and Greg Stanton aboard Air Force One in December 2022.

(Photo by Adam Schultz/White House)\n\nTrump and other Republicans have questioned his mental acuity, and the debate did Biden no favors tamping down the concerns.\n\nLike other delegates, the youngest one from Arizona - 20-year-old Markus Ceniceros of Avondale, who also holds an elected post on a local school board - readily acknowledged concerns about Biden's age. But he remained committed to the president.\n\n\"He should stay in the race,\" he said, and \"as long as Biden is our nominee, he is the one to get the job finished.\"\n\nSigna Oliver, an Army veteran from Phoenix, was among the delegates who expressed fear that a mad scramble to replace Biden - four months before Election Day, long after he clinched the nomination - would invite disaster.\n\nHe should \"absolutely not\" drop out and \"if he does, we will lose to Trump,\" she said.\n\n\"I can't think of any one person that could step in, even the vice president,\" she said. She emphasized that Harris is fully qualified but added, \"I don't believe this country will elect her.\"\n\nBiden and Trump are scheduled to hold a second and final debate on Sept. 10, two months before Election Day and after each has been formally nominated.\n\n\"I would love to see someone who's not in their 70s or 80s as president. But those are the two options,\" said Isabel Hiserodt, president of the Young Democrats at Arizona State University.\n\nWhat she saw in the debate \"was concerning, and it wasn't a phenomenal performance,\" she said, but Trump is outright \"dangerous.\"\n\nDelegates like Llama Habern, from Cottonwood, are more focused on Biden's achievements in office than his stumbles.\n\n\"He doesn't have to be a great speaker, he just has to be a good president,\" Habern said.\n\nFirst-time delegate Robert Branscomb, 61, an insurance agent in Phoenix, acknowledged an \"initial shock\" at Biden's debate performance but said the president has provided reassurance about his vigor since then.\n\n\"People sometimes get a little shaken, a knee-jerk reaction, but I'm fully confident that the Arizona delegation will stay behind President Biden,\" he said. \"He's done some fantastic work over three years; he's kept his promises. We have a thriving economy, we have people in place to support him to move forward. ... He should stick in the race no matter what.\"\n\nThe succession plan is already in place, he noted: \"If something did happen, I have full confidence in Vice President Harris to pick up the pieces and move forward.\"\n\nWith reporting from Cronkite News Washington correspondents Keetra Bippus, Brianna Chappie, Alex Cunningham, Amaia J.

The Sine Qua Non Sequitur is taking the day off to binge watch Season 3 of \"Mr. Belvedere.\"\n\nIn the hail storm of epiphanies -- real or imagined -- that have been hitting the Democrats since Joe Biden's debate disaster, the realization that First Lady Jill Biden isn't much of a team player seems to be a surprise to many of them. A lot of us here on the Right have known all along that she would be the immovable object when the rest of the party finally admitted that it was time to insist that her husband step aside.\n\nI still maintain that Joe didn't really want to run all that badly in 2020, but the missus had it on her \"honey do\" list and would not be denied.\n\nThis is something I wrote in the Morning Briefing four years ago yesterday:\n\nThe longer the Joe Biden Obvious Decline Circus is allowed to go on, the more I'm convinced that Jill Biden is a power-hungry madwoman who so desperately wants to be in the White House that she is willing to subject her husband to what has now become bipartisan ridicule. If Joe Biden were your grandfather you would be worrying yourself into an ulcer about him and making sure that you helped him maintain as much dignity as possible.\n\nFour months before the 2020 election, and we all knew the truth about Joe Biden that the Democrats are just pretending to have figured out at the end of last month. The headline of that Briefing was \"Jill Biden Wants to Trash Her Husband's Dignity to Be Edith Wilson 2.0.\"\n\nNothing has changed, despite the crescendo of cries from more and more Democrats for Biden to remove himself from the race.\n\nHer First Ladyship is more combative than ever. This is from a post my friend Stephen Green wrote yesterday:\n\nThe stress has been phenomenal these past two weeks after that brutal cold/jetlag/stutter got Democrats publicly wondering whether Biden should step aside and open the nominating process back up. And so DOCTOR Jill Biden, who is known in her own mind for being effortlessly cool under pressure, lost it ever-so-slightly on Monday while deigning to speak to the press.\n\nThe video in Stephen's post makes it clear that Mrs. Biden is NOT in the mood to entertain questions about her husband's future. She's dismissive, rude, and displays the contempt for the press that has been her husband's trademark for decades. The Bidens do not like it when the press minions forget their places and challenge them. The fancy themselves royalty, not public servants. The media is there to -- as President LOLEightyonemillion infamously said in June -- \"play by the rules\" and do the Bidens' bidding.\n\nJill Biden has no doubt been assailed by Dem elites since the debate, because they know that they need her blessing to make the change at the top that they're so desperate to make. Those conversations can't be very pleasant. As Matt Vespa writes over at Townhall, Mrs. Biden doesn't share their interests, \"so the party is in Purgatory.\"\n\nRelated: Trust Me -- DOCTOR Jill Biden Has Already Worked Out a Modified 'Weekend at Bernie's' Plan\n\nThe Democrats are deep in \"be careful what you wish for\" territory, and it is Jill Biden who brought them there. If the power brokers in the Democratic National Committee really did think that Joe Biden would relinquish power and not run for a second term, they were obviously overlooking his wife. If she is feeling slighted, it's only going to strengthen her resolve to keep her husband propped up in the Oval Office for as long as she can.\n\nJill Biden is the de facto President of the United States now, and most likely has been for most of her husband's time in office. That's a gig that she isn't giving up without a bloody fight. If I were betting on the winner of the brawl, all of my money goes on her.\n\nClick the button below to get the Morning Briefing emailed to you every weekday. Have your coffee with me, people.

Michael Bennet, D-Colo., on Tuesday accused President Joe Biden of having done \"nothing\" to undo the damage from his debate performance, but stopped short of saying he should step down in the race -- as calls from Democrats urging Biden to drop his re-election bid continue to trickle in despite his insistence he's staying in the contest.\n\nBiden has rebuffed the calls to step aside in the race, telling congressional Democrats in a letter Monday \"it's time for [discussions about his debate performance] to end.\"\n\nSome Democrats have expressed careful skepticism about Biden's future in the race, but have stopped short of calling on him to step aside. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said on MSNBC in the days following the debate \"I think it's a legitimate question to say this is an episode or this is a condition,\" referring to Biden's cognitive abilities. She said Wednesday on the network that \"time is running out\" for Biden to decide if he'll stay in the race -- an odd statement that suggests he might still drop his bid despite his repeated insistence he'll keep running. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., a former member of the party's leadership, said he'd like Biden to remain the nominee but argued Harris should replace him if Biden stands down. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who has been floated as a replacement for Biden on the ticket, told reporters he will continue to support Biden \"so long as he continues to be in the race,\" but added \"only he can make decisions about his candidacy.\"\n\nThe presidential debate last month was considered the most important night of the 2024 campaign cycle -- and an opportunity for Biden to reassure voters concerned that he is too old to run for president. But Biden was widely viewed to have done the opposite, losing his train of thought within minutes of the debate beginning, speaking so softly at times it was hard to understand what he was saying, giving disjointed answers and often standing with a blank stare on his face, his mouth agape, while Trump was speaking. Abysmal reviews, even from some of Trump's fiercest critics, instantly poured in on social media, and by the end of the debate, Democrats were reportedly privately discussing the possibility of replacing him on the ticket, multiple outlets reported.\n\nThere is no formal mechanism for replacing Biden as the nominee if he doesn't step aside voluntarily. He has won nearly 3,900 of the 4,000 available delegates in the primaries who are beholden (but not legally required) to vote to formally nominate Biden at the Democratic convention in August. In an unprecedented and highly unlikely scenario, the delegates could spurn Biden and vote to select another nominee. Or Biden could withdraw from the race before the convention, giving his delegates the opportunity to cast their votes for another candidate. If he were to withdraw after the August convention, party rules state that the Democratic National Committee's approximately 500 members could convene a special meeting to select a new nominee by majority vote.

During one part of the evening, guests had the opportunity to shake hands with President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden.\n\nAfter taking a photo with Biden, the president clasped my hand and complimented my suit. When I thanked him, he shuddered a bit, smiled and greeted the next guest. He seemed winded, but I figured that was from attending an earlier diplomatic event. At least he didn't try to dap me up like he was campaigning in the 'hood.\n\nBut that brief moment left me with questions about the president's long term durability. Lots more were left with the same question on June 27 when Biden, now 81, seemingly stumbled and mumbled his way through his first debate with Donald Trump.\n\nThere's no question he looked tired, listless, and at times unintelligible. Some tweets that suggested Biden had a cold, and others suggested that he was suffering from exhaustion. Almost immediately, waves of criticism skeptical of his fitness to remain in the race flooded social media.\n\nWe're now at the point where political watchers like the New York Times' Thomas Friedman and multiple Democratic legislators are openly calling for Biden to step down. Almost two weeks after the debate, headlines about Biden's fitness continue to permeate media, forcing him to stay on the back foot in defense.\n\nSo it basically comes down to this: Should Joe Biden quit?\n\nTons of people have echoed Friedman's sentiments, fearful that Biden could not convince voters in key battleground states. Others believe that the Democrats should not jump ship based on a single debate performance. After all, Barack Obama struggled in his 2012 debate against Mitt Romney, but wound up winning the election handily.\n\nAnd to be clear, Donald Trump is the only participant of that debate who proved for certain that he is not fit for the presidency. This cat lied so much his nose almost cracked my television screen. Fact checking website Politifact broke down just how much crap Mr. \"Black Jobs\" shoveled that night and it was enough to fertilize an entire wheat field.\n\nIt's evident that we are better off with a foggy Biden for four more years than a lucid Trump for one day. If he won't let go of his narcissism for 90 minutes, imagine living with him until 2029. His bungling of the coronavirus pandemic should be evidence enough that he should not return to the White House.\n\nBut let's not be naive -- the debate hurt Biden at least temporarily. Confusion remains about his mental acuity, which is spurring calls for him to drop out. Also, one poll has him falling behind Trump by as many as six points post-debate, although a newer poll shows he has gained some ground.\n\nSo Biden faces an uphill battle because it's now about more than workable plans for the economy, foreign policy, and other issues. He needs to show that he is just as cogent as he was when he took office -- otherwise he's making the case for his exit.\n\nThe president now insists that he's staying the course. He has the support of ally, South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, as well as the Congressional Black Caucus. In an ABC News interview, he said the debate was just a \"bad night.\" Meanwhile, some critics are looking toward Vice President Kamala Harris as a possible replacement, but she has also insisted that the ticket would not change. And essentially, a vote for Biden is already a vote for Harris: by law, she becomes president if he cannot fulfill his duties.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre confirmed that Biden has had a comprehensive checkup, including seeing a neurologist. But none of his opponents (or really, anyone looking for more information) will be able to confirm any medical determinations on his mental acuity, so we have to take everyone at the White House at their word.\n\nBottom line is the only person who truly knows if Joe Biden can pull off another four years is Joe Biden. I don't realistically see a scenario in which he actually drops out, so the only way to find out if he can handle the next four years is to hit the polls in November.\n\n-- -- -- -- -- -", "source": {"uri": "theroot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Root"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PolitiFact", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PolitiFact"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Friedman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Friedman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mitt Romney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karine_Jean-Pierre", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karine Jean-Pierre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Clyburn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Clyburn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Black_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Black Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/7b3e6c1a09b66b25041d688e8f7c773b.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716125", "eventUri": "eng-9716125", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 652, "textEnd": 659}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

At 81, Biden believes he is in good shape, and confident he can beat Trump.\n\nOn the night of the debate President Biden was sick, and his clarity was lacking. Even though Biden got stronger as the debate went on, many Democrats and the media are asking him to step down.\n\nEveryone is entitled to a bad day or there are days where everything goes wrong. When this happens it is important to not let a bad day or a challenging period, mess up the good things happening in your life.\n\nFor three and a half years Biden has been extremely successful as the president of the United States. President Biden has created 14.8 million jobs in 3 years in a robust labor market. Millions of Americans have signed up for health care, which makes ACA a bigger success than Obama had ever expected.\n\nSalaries are increasing and outpacing inflation, and unemployment is at an all time low at 4%. Inequality is narrowing and there are more people in the country getting opportunities to get good jobs, and it does not matter your race or culture.\n\nPresident Biden had promised that when he got in the White House with Vice-President Harris, they would reduce student debt. Biden has implemented a student loan forgiveness program that has impacted over 30 million Americans to the amount of 146 billion dollars. This has allowed millions of Americans to be in a position to purchase a house, or purchase a new car.\n\nSeniors under Biden are able to save money, because the cost of insulin will max out at $35. Now seniors will be in a position to buy food and medicine and not go broke. Violent crimes have fallen, and murder is at an all time low.\n\nEvery day the Biden and Harris team is fighting to keep Democracy a reality in America. From the first day in office, they have taken steps to restore and strengthen America's democracy. President Biden has been fighting to get the Freedom to Vote Act, and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to get passed, and give more Americans the opportunity to vote.\n\nIt is very easy to take the easy way out, and claim that at 81, Biden is too old to be president of America, because it has never been done before. But America is thriving under the Biden administration with Kamala Harris Black multi-racial women as the Vice-President of America.

Democrats Float Plan B As Biden's Fate In Doubt", "body": "Democrats are floating plans for choosing a replacement for President Joe Biden if he decides to bow out of the race -- what would be an unprecedented and potentially chaotic process the party would have just weeks to complete before delegates are set to convene in Chicago next month to formalize their nominee.\n\nConvention rules state that the 4,000 \"pledged\" delegates \"shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them,\" meaning they're expected, but not legally required, to vote for Biden. If no candidate secures a majority of delegate votes on the first ballot, pledged delegates, along with the 700 \"unpledged\" delegates, can vote for whoever they please on the second ballot. Unpledged delegates do not vote in the first round.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention is set for Aug. 19-22 in Chicago. Democrats are planning to formalize the nominee in a virtual roll call before then, a move that was planned to ensure Biden was on the ballot in Ohio, which previously required parties to select their nominees 90 days before the Nov. 5 election. Ohio has since changed its law, but Democrats are expected to go forward with the virtual roll call as planned.\n\nIf Biden drops out, Vice President Kamala Harris is widely considered the most likely option to replace him as the nominee for a multitude of reasons. She is already on his ticket, meaning she can seamlessly take over his campaign war chest, allowing the party to avoid the complicated process of dispersing the funds to another candidate, as it would legally be required to do. She also benefits from name recognition, and most polls show her outperforming other Biden replacement options. Clyburn and former Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, have suggested Harris replace Biden if he drops out. Ryan explicitly called for that scenario in a Newsweek op-ed last week. Clyburn has said he supports Biden, but also floated the idea of a \"mini-primary,\" telling CNN he would \"absolutely\" support such a process, though he would back Harris in the truncated campaign if that were to occur. Clyburn emphasized that the party should \"bolster\" Harris and should not \"do anything\" to prevent her from replacing him, if he drops out.\n\nCarville, who was among the first high-profile Democrats to call on Biden to step aside in the race in the wake of the June 27 debate, warned that Democrats risk appearing as if they rigged the process and chose a nominee without public input if they don't engage in some form of a mini-primary if Biden drops his bid. \"We're not going to do that,\" he wrote in The New York Times. \"We're going to nominate a new ticket in a highly democratic and novel way, not in the backrooms of Washington, D.C., or Chicago.\"\n\nIn addition to Harris, some names commonly floated as Biden replacements include Democratic governors Gavin Newsom of California, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, Kentucky's Andy Beshear and Colorado's Jared Polis. Whitmer has disavowed calls for her to run in Biden's place and denied a Politico report that she told Biden's campaign he couldn't win Michigan after the debate. Newsom, in interviews immediately after the debate, expressed his unwavering support for Biden, telling reporters in the spin room \"I will never turn my back on President Biden,\" as chatter about the prospect of him replacing Biden was already underway before the debate even ended. Pritzker and Beshear have offered tempered criticism of Biden and urged him to do more to reassure the party and voters he is up to the job after his debate performance, though neither explicitly called on him to step aside in the race.\n\nBiden has rebuffed calls to step down in the race, insisting that the \"average voter\" still wants him to run, he said Monday on MSNBC, despite most post-debate polls showing Trump widening his lead in the wake of the debate. Biden has conceded the debate was a \"bad night,\" but has insisted he's still the best candidate to beat former Trump in November. As part of a concerted clean-up effort, the president has been leaning on his base, appealing to unions and Black and Hispanic voters. He's also sat for a flurry of media interviews -- which featured some shaky moments and were widely viewed to have gone better than the debate, but not well enough to undo the damage. Calls from Democrats for Biden to step aside in the race have continued to trickle in since, with a total of 10 Democrats in Congress as of Wednesday urging him to step aside, while other influential Democrats, including Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Michael Bennet, D-Colo., have expressed doubts that he can beat Trump.\n\nRep.

The 81-year-old Biden is also taking part in the NATO summit and looking to use the organization's 75th anniversary meeting as a way to spotlight support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia and to reset his stumbling campaign.\n\nBiden has been under intense scrutiny since his disastrous debate performance, putting pressure on a White House that until recently had been marked by discipline and loyalty.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has been reveling in the turmoil surrounding the Biden campaign and pressure from Biden's party to step down. Trump is also expected to soon announce his Republican running mate.\n\nThe network said that Holt will interview Biden on Monday in Austin, Texas. Highlights will run on \"NBC Nightly News\" and the full interview will air during a prime-time special on NBC Monday night. A similar playbook was followed when Biden was interviewed last Friday by ABC News' George Stephanopoulos.\n\nBiden is stepping up the appearances following his performance during the debate with Trump, which has given rise to calls for him to end his campaign.\n\nFollowing Biden's call with over 200 U.S. mayors Wednesday morning, messages of support for the president have slowly trickled out.\n\nAtlanta Mayor Andre Dickens posted on Twitter that Biden is \"locked in and determined to beat Donald Trump,\" touting his record on job creation, infrastructure, prescription drug costs and women's rights. Andy Schor, the mayor of Lansing, Michigan, said he was \"impressed\" by the president, noting, \"He's going to be running, and I think that we all need to be supporting him.\"\n\nTrump says he's \"pretty well set in my own mind\" on his choice of running mate.\n\nHe dished on the finalists in a Fox News Radio interview Wednesday.\n\nIs Ohio Sen. JD Vance's facial hair a strike against him?\n\nNo, Vance \"looks good. He looks like a young Abraham Lincoln,\" Trump said with a laugh.\n\nWhat about the highly restrictive abortion law North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum signed into law?\n\n\"Well, it's a little bit of an issue. It's a pretty strong ban,\" said Trump.\n\nAnd what about the fact that Sen. Marco Rubio would likely have to move out of Florida?\n\n\"No, but it does make it more complicated,\" he said.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden hosted NATO spouses at the Smithsonian's Museum of American History for a brunch of green goddess chicken and seared tuna.\n\nMore than 20 spouses, including Ukraine's Olena Zalenska, also had a chance to see an exhibit featuring cultural objects such as Muppets and the ruby red shoes worn by Dorothy's character in \"The Wizard of Oz.\"\n\nThe group is set to meet again Thursday at Camp David.\n\nThe first lady advised her counterparts to dress comfortably and wear flats or sneakers as they'll be getting in and out of helicopters.\n\nFaith leaders from hundreds of Black churches in Georgia will gather to support Biden on Thursday.\n\nThe event at the Georgia State Capitol aims to turn the attention back to Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee.\n\n\"Democrats have been fighting each other for the last two weeks, and it must stop now,\" said Bishop Reginald Jackson.\n\nHe presides over 500 African Methodist Episcopal churches in the state and is one of the event's organizers.\n\nBlack voter turnout will be key in Georgia, a battleground state.\n\nBiden didn't face calls to step aside or concerns about his fitness for office on a call he hosted for nearly 200 Democratic mayors. That's according to those who were on the call.\n\nReactions from some mayors:\n\n\u00b7 Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a letter that Biden was \"pretty fired up,\" and that he and Kamala Harris are \"exactly the leaders we need at this moment.\"\n\n\u00b7 Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson told AP \"the president is in it to win it.\"\n\n\u00b7 Kansas City, Missouri, Mayor Quinton Lucas said in an online post he will \"proudly stand with Joe!\"\n\nAn eighth Democratic member of Congress has publicly called on President Joe Biden to step aside, the New York Times reported.\n\nU.S. Rep. Pat Ryan of New York said he no longer believed Biden could make the case necessary to defeat Trump.\n\nHe called Trump an \"existential threat\" to American democracy and said that he was asking Biden to drop out \"for the good of the country.\"\n\nIt comes as Democrats continue to wrestle with the extraordinary question of whether to stand behind the president or push him to bow out.\n\nMovie star and lifelong Democrat George Clooney is adding his voice to calls for Biden to leave the presidential race.\n\nClooney said in a New York Times opinion piece Wednesday that he loves Biden, but the party would lose the presidential race and any control in Congress with him as the nominee.\n\n\"This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private,\" wrote Clooney, who has hosted high-dollar Hollywood fundraisers.\n\nClooney argued the party should pick a new nominee at its convention next month.\n\nThe president of Finland says that regardless of whether Biden or Trump win the presidency in November, the U.S. will remain a superpower. That will require it to have strong allies -- especially in Europe.\n\nAlexander Stubb said he is worried about the \"polarization of the political climate,\" calling it \"quite toxic.\"\n\nStubb spoke to reporters as he arrived at the NATO summit Wednesday.\n\nStubb also said there is \"strong bipartisan support\" for Ukraine and NATO, following a meeting with 15 U.S. senators.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Ukraine is on an \"irreversible\" path to NATO membership.\n\nThat advances American assurances that Ukraine will be allowed to join the Western self-defense alliance after its war against Russia ends.\n\nAll 32 allies are expected to issue a joint communique Wednesday cementing that \"irreversible\" commitment to Ukraine. That's according to a European official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss before the release.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy has battled for a firm guarantee Ukraine can join. The U.S. and some others have opposed to avoid an escalation with Russia that could lead to a larger war.\n\n-- Associated Press reporter Ellen Knickmeyer contributed to this story.\n\n__\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass released a one-sentence statement after the president held a virtual event with nearly 200 Democratic mayors.\n\n\"I'm supporting our nominee, President Biden,\" she said.\n\nBass is a former member of Congress who was on Biden's vice-presidential shortlist during his 2020 campaign.\n\nU.S. Sen. Alex Padilla of California has also backed the president, sending a fundraising appeal on behalf of Biden's campaign.\n\n\"The stakes of this election are simply too high to continue fretting and worrying,\" he wrote.\n\nSpeaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi stopped short of saying President Joe Biden should continue his re-election campaign, saying \"it's up to the president to decide\" if he's going to run.\n\n\"We're all encouraging him to make that decision, because time is running short,\" Pelosi said early Wednesday on MSNBC.\n\nPressed on whether she personally wants Biden to stay on the top of the ticket, Pelosi said, \"I want him to do whatever he decides to do.\"\n\nShe said she watched as he delivered a forceful speech at NATO, and while foreign leaders are in Washington she encouraged Democrats to \"hold off\" with any announcements about his campaign.\n\nPelosi has been widely watched for signals of how top Democrats are thinking about Biden's candidacy.", "source":

Jill Biden is giving screeching speeches to the public as she campaigns for her elderly husband. And she takes offense with reporters asking her questions.\n\nOh, hun, puddin', if you can't take the press asking you basic and honest questions, maybe you shouldn't say anything at all. Instead, perhaps you should start looking into how to care for your husband and get him some help for his mental decline.\n\nBut nope, she's out there reprimanding reporters, telling them not to scream at her.\n\nIrked first lady Jill Biden told reporters, \"Don't scream at me,\" when asked Monday about the mounting number of House Democrats calling for 81-year-old hubby President Biden to give up his re-election bid.\n\n\"What is your message for House Democrats who are calling for your husband to drop out of the race?\" a journalist asked as the first lady exited a coffee shop in Tampa, Fla. -- with another reporter adding, \"How are you feeling about the state of the race?\"\n\nThe first lady broke her stride as she walked past the press, demanding to know, \"Why are you screaming at me? - New York Post\n\nAfter the First Lady asked the reporter why you are screaming at me, she added Just talk to me, then immediately climbed into her limousine and rode off.\n\nJill Biden is visiting three states to campaign for her husband. She is in Georgia, Florida, and North Carolina.\n\nSomeone loves the limelight, except those pesky screaming reporters trying to do their job. I guess Jill's justification for being out on the campaign trail is that now people can't keep saying she is abusing the old man.\n\nIt appears Jill will do just about anything to prevent Kamala Harris from stepping in to save the campaign for the Democrats. Jill is not a fan of Kamala.\n\nAt one point in 2019, Jill Biden reportedly fumed that Kamala Harris, who later became her husband's running mate and vice president, should \"go f-k\" herself for attacking his historical opposition to interracial school busing. - New York Post\n\nMost of the government media had meltdowns on live air after the disastrous debate performance. Many of their own people, Democrats, call for Joseph Robinette Biden to step aside.\n\nIn case you were wondering what constitutes elder abuse, a quick Google search produced the 6 most common types of elder abuse, according to Home Instead. They are physical abuse, emotional or psychological abuse, sexual abuse, neglect or abandonment, financial exploitation, and healthcare fraud.\n\nDo you think dear old Jill can be responsible for two of those categories; financial and emotional/psychological abuse.\n\nLet's not even mention Hunter Biden, the smartest man Joe knows.\n\nGood grief, rumors swirl, or it's being reported that Hunter, the drug addict and whoremonger is by Joe's side constantly.\n\nHunter Biden is acting as his father's \"gatekeeper\" as calls for the US president to step aside ahead of the November election continue to mount.\n\nJoe Biden's family rallied around the Democrat leader and urged him to stay in the presidential race after his disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump.\n\nHunter Biden is understood to have raised eyebrows after returning from Camp David to Washington DC with his father and sitting in on White House meetings as an adviser.\n\nHe has also been acting as a \"de facto gatekeeper for long-time friends\", deciding who has access to the US president, according to Axios. - The Telegraph\n\nNow, tell me that's not a terrifying thought. This family is an abomination of catastrophic proportions. But they are in the White House right now and refusing to leave. Hey, isn't that what they accused Donald Trump of doing?\n\nHere's a tidbit for your next dinner party: Jill Biden has her walkout song. In January 2022, the Marine Corps band was given its orders.\n\nThe Marine Corps band was instructed last fall to come up with an entrance theme for the first lady, a source told the Washington Examiner. The band now has in its repertoire an original composition titled \"Fanfare for the First Lady.\" The song, the source said, is essentially Jill Biden's personal \"Hail to the Chief,\" in that it is to be performed and repeated at official White House functions, from her first appearance until she is ready to speak. - Washington Examiner\n\nThe ego, or is it false ego, this woman possesses is phenomenal. She has her Manolo Blahnik dug in, for sure. She really thinks she is staying in the White House, which doesn't make her smart; it makes her delusional.\n\nIf she can pull this off and keep Joe in place for another four years, Jill's full-time job will be keeping Kamala Harris from pulling that 25th Amendment trigger.", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Fort Moore, formerly Fort Benning, is near Columbus.\n\nAnd while the rally was focused on Biden's record supporting the military, such as the Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act, or the PACT Act, which expanded health care eligibility, there was no avoiding the ongoing fallout from the CNN debate.\n\n\"That 90 minutes means nothing. You don't define a president in 90 minutes,\" Gloria Tyson, U.S. Army veteran and owner of Kidz.com Child Development Center, said to the crowd as she introduced the first lady in Columbus.\n\nMonday brought a string of more developments just weeks ahead of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago where the party is set to officially nominate Biden. The day started with the president telling congressional Democrats he would not step aside despite mounting concerns, and he also called into MSNBC's Morning Joe and vowed to stay in the race. \"I am not going anywhere,\" Biden said.\n\nBut by the afternoon, Biden's press secretary was caught in a testy exchange with reporters over the president's health.\n\n\"For all the talk out there about this race, Joe has made it clear that he's all in,\" Jill Biden said to the crowd, which began to chant \"four more years.\"\n\n\"That's the decision that he's made, and just as he has always supported my career, I'm all in too,\" she said inside the Bibb Mill Event Center, which is a century-old mill-turned-event venue that sits alongside the Chattahoochee River. \"I know you are too, or you wouldn't be here today.\"\n\nThe Bidens have also leaned into their personal story as a military family. Biden's son Beau Biden, a veteran, suffered from a rare form of brain cancer and died in May 2015, years after being deployed to Iraq.\n\nIn Georgia, Democrats have largely stuck with Biden.\n\nState Sen. Ed Harbison, who is a Columbus Democrat who joined the first lady on stage Monday night, said Democrats who are questioning whether Biden should be the nominee are losing sight of the goal.\n\n\"To those people who have concerns about it, I would just like to reassure them to get over it, get focused and get going,\" Harbison said before Monday's rally. \"It's too late to do anything that would be a drastic change like that. That's just impractical.\"\n\n\"Let's go ahead, get it done and get moving. Get over it. One debate does not a campaign make,\" he said.\n\nFormer Georgia Congresswoman Carolyn Bourdeaux is an example of the rare Georgia Democrat who has said Biden should step aside. But others have voiced unease with the trajectory of the 2024 presidential election with Biden at the top of the ticket.\n\nStacy Richardson, who lives in Pine Mountain, made the short trek Monday to Columbus in search of reassurance after she said Biden's debate performance left her nervous and wondering whether that kind of episode could happen at any time.\n\nRichardson said she admires Biden and the accomplishments of his presidency and long career in public service, but as she waited for the first lady to take the stage, Richardson said she was not convinced Biden was the best candidate to face former President Donald Trump in November.\n\n\"I don't want to write him off,\" Richardson said. \"I'd like to see a little more, maybe a couple more interviews that are unscripted, a couple more appearances without a teleprompter and things that are a little more challenging.\"\n\nShe said she would also like to see the campaign address the president's health \"head on.\"\n\n\"I feel bad because I totally appreciate what his presidency did, and I believe in all that. He accomplished so much. I'm just really worried about the alternative,\" she said.\n\nBiden narrowly won Georgia in 2020 by about 12,000 votes, becoming the first Democratic presidential candidate to win here in three decades and cementing the state's battleground status. Polling has so far given Trump a slight edge in Georgia.\n\n\"For me, I feel like it's so important to have someone in that office who is honest, and I think he's honest,\" state Rep. Debbie Buckner, a Junction City Democrat, said of Biden.", "source": {"uri": "gpb.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Georgia Public Broadcasting"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jill_nolin@gpb.org", "name":

As Biden fights to extend his political life, he's betting that reframing the race as an us-against-the-world fight will pay off.\n\n\"Joe has made it clear he's all in,\" Jill Biden said, after chants of \"four more years\" died down. \"I'm all-in, too. And I know you are, too, or you wouldn't be here today.\"\n\nSince his dismal performance last month in the CNN debate in Atlanta, the president and his campaign have attacked \"elites in the party,\" the \"bedwetting brigade\" and the \"self-important podcasters\" sparking panic in the party.\n\nHe's casting himself as an insurgent incumbent by painting the small but growing ranks of of progressive pundits, wealthy donors and congressional Democrats demanding he step aside as the gasps of an establishment bent on usurping the people's will.\n\n\"I don't care what those big names think,\" he told MSNBC on Monday. \"They were wrong in 2020. They're wrong in 2022 about the red wave. They're wrong in 2024.\"\n\nNow a campaign that frames Biden as the only Democrat who can defeat former President Donald Trump is gambling that supporters will swallow their fears about his physical and mental health if its means holding off Trump.\n\nEven Biden's most stalwart supporters aren't sure it will work. Some arrived in Columbus on Monday evening in need of reassurance. Judy Varnett, a retired nurse, lingered long after Jill Biden departed and left feeling more upbeat.\n\n\"We really needed the pep talk,\" she said. \"So many of my friends are discouraged and rethinking their choices. And I'm trying to remind them there's no real choice except Biden.\"\n\n'Not going anywhere'\n\nHis comeback strategy in Georgia, where he trails Trump by single-digits in most polls, hinges on Black voters, the same constituency that helped rescue his candidacy in 2020 after poor showings in Iowa and New Hampshire during primary season.\n\nNot so long ago, media reports were full of critical coverage about whether Black support in Georgia was waning. While those concerns haven't dissipated, Black elected officials remain the most important bulwark of Biden's support.\n\n\"If they have to wheel him in or carry him in, I will still vote for him,\" said state Rep. Billy Mitchell, a prominent Black legislator. \"He's been a great president. There's no reason to abandon him.\"\n\nThe internal turmoil has turned otherwise rote events in Georgia into new tests of enthusiasm for Biden. A DeKalb County campaign office opening over the weekend took on a circus-like atmosphere, while Jill Biden was accompanied by a clutch of national reporters Monday for an appearance that a few weeks ago might merit scant attention.\n\nSome spoke candidly about the price the infighting has exacted on the party's psyche. Bob Christian already faced a difficult fight against GOP U.S. Rep. Rich McCormick in a district drawn to favor Republicans.\n\n\"The best argument for Joe Biden is Joe Biden's success,\" he said. \"He had a disappointing debate and he is showing signs of decline.

As someone who has spent years working within Democratic politics, I believe it is time for Biden to step down -- not just for his own sake, but for the nation's.\n\nBiden's performance was marked by troubling signs of frailty and confusion. His halting delivery, frequent stumbles and moments of incoherence have reignited concerns about his fitness for the presidency. These issues were not merely missteps; they highlighted deeper questions about his mental acuity and overall health -- concerns that have been brewing for some time.\n\nRumors about Biden's mental health have been persistent throughout his presidency. While the White House and Democrats have attempted to downplay these concerns, the president's recent public appearances have done little to dismiss them. The American people deserve transparency about the health and capabilities of their leader.\n\nThe DNC's changing the primary process this past year to ensure Biden's nomination without significant opposition has further separated many voters. By excluding potential challengers and forcing a largely uncontested primary, the DNC has denied Democratic voters a true choice and a chance for countless Americans to choose their preferred candidate. This manipulation of the process not only undermines democratic principles but also breeds resentment. Many voters feel they were forced to vote for Biden with no real alternatives, leading to a sense of disenfranchisement and a lack of enthusiasm.\n\nThe effects of Biden remaining on the ballot are grim. With his age and health issues becoming increasingly apparent, many voters may choose to stay home rather than cast their vote for a candidate they no longer believe in. This potential drop in voter turnout could have catastrophic consequences in November. The stakes are too high to ignore these warnings.\n\nAdding to the concerns about Biden's leadership is his limited availability, with Biden stating he is unavailable for critical duties after 8 p.m. This restriction raises serious questions about his ability to handle emergencies and maintain the rigorous schedule required of a president. The American people need a president who is fully engaged and accessible at all times, especially during crises.\n\nBiden is also losing support from crucial groups. The President of the Teamsters, Sean O'Brien, is scheduled to speak at the Republican National Convention later in July, a move that underscores the labor union's waning support for Biden. Additionally, Biden's support among Black voters is eroding, a demographic that has traditionally been a stronghold for the Democratic Party. This decline in support further jeopardizes his re-election prospects and should be a major sign to Biden as well as Democrats that he is not the right candidate for our country right now.\n\nProminent Democrats and donors have also started to call for Biden to step aside. Damon Lindelof, a notable Democrat donor, recently stressed the necessity for Biden to bow out of the race to prevent further damage to the party. In addition, Disney heiress Abigail Disney has stated she will stop Democratic donations until Biden steps aside. This sentiment is echoed by several Democratic members of Congress including Seth Moulton of Massachusetts; Mike Quigley of Illinois; Angie Craig of Minnesota; Adam Smith of Washington; among others who have openly called on Biden to step aside. Lindelof's and these representatives' calls reflect a growing belief that Biden's continuation as the candidate could cost the Democrats dearly in the upcoming election. Instead of listening to his own party, Biden is putting his ego above that as well as the nation's interest.\n\nJoe Biden, it is time to put the nation above personal ambition. By clinging to power despite clear signs of inadequacy, you are prioritizing your title over the needs of the American people. For the good of the party and the country, it is time for you to step aside. This is not just about winning an election; it's about ensuring that the American people have a leader who is up to the task of governing effectively.\n\nIn my experience as a political advisor, I have seen firsthand the importance of strong, decisive leadership. The Democratic Party must now show the courage to acknowledge the realities of the situation and take the necessary steps to secure a brighter future. We need a viable election to ensure the American public does not question the results. Trump needs a competitive opponent to validate his candidacy and ensure a robust democratic process. Trump, with his policies and leadership style, is currently the right candidate for addressing the nation's pressing issues and restoring confidence among voters. It's time for Biden to step down and make way for a new generation of leadership. America needs a president who can lead the nation, not one who cannot even lead his own party.\n\nWill Pierce is a political consultant and columnist.

Michael Bennet, D-Colo., told CNN Tuesday evening he is worried a Biden run could lead to a Trump \"landslide\" win, and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on Wednesday opted against endorsing him running in a separate television interview. Still, no widespread movement has emerged this week among divided House and Senate Democrats to try pushing out the president -- and that's advantage Biden.\n\n\"Biden is outplaying all of his Democratic adversaries right now. The President controls the calendar, the delegates, and ultimately the power,\" David Jolly, a former Republican House member, said in an email.\n\nTeam Biden has gone on the offensive, and that could help the president run out the clock on his detractors.\n\n\"It's time to put Trump in the bullseye,\" Biden told Democratic donors on a Monday call, according to excerpts released by the White House. \"I'm in this to the end, and I'm going to beat Trump -- I promise you.\"\n\nBiden received the support of the Congressional Black Caucus and House progressives. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., backed down from a reported effort to assemble a group of his colleagues to urge Biden to step aside. There were no major movements to push for Biden's departure from the race from House or Senate Democrats following separate private meetings on Tuesday.\n\nThat only bolsters how the calendar is on Biden's side.

If she talks her husband into staying the course after his widely panned debate performance, she's a power-hungry puppet master who's guilty of elder abuse.\n\nBut if she persuades President Joe Biden to abandon his reelection campaign, she's admitting that she has been part of a cruel \"Weekend at Bernie's\" charade that has propped him up for months, maybe even years.\n\nI didn't vote for Jill Biden any more than I voted for Michelle Obama or Nancy Reagan.\n\nBut I knew she came with the package. So it doesn't bother me that she advises her husband, the president, even in moments of crisis.\n\nWhat does bother me is this wicked attack on her character and, even worse, on her credentials.\n\nTo America, the first lady is known as Dr. Jill Biden. No, she isn't a medical doctor. And, no, she doesn't have a Ph.D.\n\nBut she is not a quack, as some of her worst critics have said. Columnist Maureen Callahan dissed Jill Biden's community college credentials in the Daily Mail this past week.\n\nJill Biden is a devoted teacher and college professor who earned her honorific by completing the coursework required to receive a doctorate degree in education. That was after earning two master's degrees in the same field.\n\nTwo days a week, she takes off her FLOTUS hat and stands in front of students at Northern Virginia Community College, where she is a professor in the English department.\n\nBut some of her political enemies have for years insisted on treating her like she's some fake TV court judge whose legal resume wouldn't fit on the back of a business card.\n\n\"Madame First Lady -- Mrs. Biden -- Jill -- kiddo,\" author Joseph Epstein wrote in a 2020 op-ed piece for the Wall Street Journal. \"Any chance you might drop the 'Dr.' before your name? 'Dr. Jill Biden' sounds and feels fraudulent, not to say a touch comic.\"\n\nBiden's debate debacle has given rise to some wild replacement conspiracy theories, none wilder than the suggestion that Biden should dump Vice President Kamala Harris and put former President Barack Obama on the ticket.\n\nDon't bet on it. The authors of the Constitution's 12th Amendment already nixed that idea.\n\nThe second-wildest theory is Jill Biden herself is actually angling for the job.\n\nIt should be noted that some of the most cutting comments about the first lady have come from white women, members of the same demographic that helped put Donald Trump in the White House in 2016.\n\nWhen Trump was elected president, exit polls showed he had the support of 42% of American women.\n\nEven more shocking was he received the votes of 53% of white women -- even though a white woman was running against him.\n\nFrom there, Trump was able to nominate three conservatives to the U.S. Supreme Court and overturn the right to abortion.\n\n\"We are the first generation in half a century to give our daughters a country with fewer rights than we had,\" the first lady told a campaign crowd this year.\n\n\"Book bans. Voting laws gutted. Court decisions that strip away our most basic freedoms. But circumstance is not destiny,\" she said.\n\nA day after the debate, Jill Biden took to the stage in a statement dress decorated with a simple word: Vote.\n\nIt was an important message.

While the GOP has been all for it, Democratic leaders have urged unity following Biden's disastrous debate performance in late June and subsequent charges of Biden not being cognitively up for the task.\n\nCongressman Lloyd Doggett (D-TX) was the first to break ranks on July 2nd in terms of Congressional support. Since then, 11 in total have said that they want Biden to leave the race. The California Democratic delegation, by far the largest in the House, had been pretty firm up until Sunday. Most members had said that they were firmly on Biden's side, with a few saying more time was needed or outright refusing to say if they supported or didn't support Biden. The most notable in the latter camp was Congressman Adam Schiff (D-CA), who actually received some flack for his indecisiveness.\n\nBut, on Sunday, that changed, with one California Democrat coming out saying that they would not be supporting Biden running again in 2024: Riverside Congressman Mark Takano (D-CA). This became known during a Zoom meeting late on Sunday with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY). During the meeting they said that Biden should leave the race. For Takano, the Chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, this came down to concerns about Biden's electability following the debate.\n\n\"It is evident Biden is not the best person to carry the Democratic message,\" said Takano on Sunday.\n\nOnly a few weeks before, Takano was all in for Biden and even publicly praising him. In a statement made just before the debate made on Biden's executive order on extending work authorization and legal status of undocumented spouses and children, Takano had said \"I applaud President Joe Biden's bold action that made today's historic executive order possible. Countless American families across our nation will sleep easier knowing that their loved ones can continue to remain part of the communities they have long lived and contributed to. The President's leadership stands in stark contrast to the cruel agenda advanced by convicted felon Donald Trump and extreme Congressional Republicans whose immigrant families as political pawns. This executive action is a clear win for 500,000 American families that have been desperately yearning for relief.\"\n\nHowever, like many Democrats, the President's debate performance and growing concerns over his viability rocked Takano. He hasn't spoken more on not backing Biden since the Sunday meeting, but the disconnect is evident. On his X account, Takano has not even mentioned Biden despite commenting on the NATO summit currently going on in Washington.\n\nDonors also beginning to back away from Biden\n\nAnd he won't be the last. More Democrats are expected to continue to trickle forward this week not supporting Biden to run again in 2024, including several Californian members who haven't already gone all in for Biden. When it comes to donors, many Californian donors are also calling for a new nominee as well and refusing to throw in more for the Biden-Harris campaign. On Tuesday, this included actor George Clooney, who had just last month helped run a fundraiser for Biden.\n\n\"I love Joe Biden,\" said Clooney in a New York Times op-ed. \"As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. But, during the June 15th fundraiser, he was not the Joe Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\n\n\"Democratic leadership need to ask Biden to voluntarily step aside. We are not going to win in November with this president. We deserve to hear from other politicians such as Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Vice President Kamala Harris, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker. The dam has broken. We can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November, or we can speak the truth.\"\n\nOthers noted more discontentment from California Democrats this week.\n\n\"More lawmakers and more donors are feeling this way,\" explained San Diego area pollster Gale Martin to the Globe. \"It's just Takano right now, but as more and more turn away from Biden and want someone else, we're going to see more and more from California announce that they won't go Joe. Especially with not one, but two big names coming out of the state.\"\n\n\"The real winner right now is Trump and the GOP. They needed a good rebound after the court verdict, and this more than what they asked for. They're staying quiet and just letting the Democrats have a massive in-fight right now.\"\n\nMore California Democratic Congressional members are expected to give statements on the matter of supporting Biden soon.\n\nAuthor Recent Posts Evan SymonEvan V.

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are the President and Vice President, and President Biden showed tonight that he is fully committed to working with us to defeat Donald Trump once and for all.\"\n\nThe group lamented conditions under Trump's presidency, arguing they \"can't endure another four years of chaos and fear while he dismantles our fundamental freedoms and rights, threatens our diverse populations and disparages places we call our hometowns.\"\n\n\"We recognize there is still significant work to be done,\" the group acknowledged, but said, \"we need Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to finish the job they started and continue working hand in hand with Mayors to deliver results for our communities.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign continues to run damage control after the debate last month, with calls continuing to trickle in for Biden to leave the race, perhaps passing the baton to Vice President Harris, though there have been Democratic leaders who have stood firm behind the President.\n\nBiden has so far vowed to stay in the race and, in a letter to Democrats in Congress, asked for unity behind the Biden-Harris ticket.\n\nBiden said on Friday in an interview with ABC News host George Stephanopoulos that he doesn't \"think anybody's more qualified to be President or win this race\" than he is. That sentiment doesn't track with either recent polls or among other Democratic leaders who either publicly or privately are expressing concern.\n\nA New York Times/Siena College poll taken after the debate showed him 6 points behind Trump among likely voters nationwide, a 3-point drop from his standing before the debate. A CBS News/YouGov poll taken after the debate found that 72% of registered voters believe Biden doesn't have the mental or cognitive acuity to serve another term as President.\n\nSome House Democrats fear Biden's continued candidacy and place at the top of the ticket could affect them down ballot, particularly in tight races in swing districts. Democratic U.S. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia is attempting to assemble a coalition in the upper chamber to press Biden to drop out, though so far none have.\n\nKriseman's support comes after another local leader, Tampa City Council member Alan Clendenin, a member of the Democratic National Committee, took the opposition stance in calling for Biden to leave the race.", "source": {"uri": "floridapolitics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Florida Politics - Campaigns & Elections.

It explains why he's remained uncharacteristically schtum since last month's presidential debate, scene of an historic slow-motion car crash for Biden from which he's yet to recover. Don't interrupt your opponent when they're making all the mistakes.\n\nTrump's even postponed announcing his choice of running mate.\n\nWhy feed the media alternative headlines when the Democrats are generating a damaging feeding frenzy of their own? Even the most slavish Democratic media outlets are now having a field day at Biden's expense.\n\nTrump has always wanted to face Biden in the 2024 presidential race. He reckons he's easy to beat (and that was before the Democrats started doing Trump's work for him).\n\nWhen, earlier this year, House Republicans were moving to impeach Biden, I'm told that Trump called them in and told them to back off. The clear message: do nothing to imperil Biden's chances of being the Democratic candidate.\n\nTrump has always wanted to face Biden in the 2024 presidential race. He reckons he's easy to beat (and that was before the Democrats started doing Trump's work for him).\n\nRead MoreEXCLUSIVE ANDREW NEIL speaks to multiple senior Democrats who reveal party's verdict: 'EVERYONE wants Biden to quit'\n\nBiden's tenacity in digging in and clinging on suits Trump perfectly. The drip drip of defectors to the rebel cause continues but it is, as yet, far from being the tsunami required to force the President to give up running again.\n\nA meeting of House Democrats on Tuesday failed to produce a call to arms for him to stay -- or to go. In its aftermath, Mikie Sherrill (New Jersey) became the seventh House Democrat to call on Biden to step aside. Pat Ryan, whose New York district could fall to the Republicans, today became the eighth. It is still not enough of a critical mass to force Biden off the ticket.\n\nNonetheless, the drumbeat of party dissent continues. Senator Michael Bennet (Dem, Colorado) hasn't called on Biden to step aside but predicted Trump 'could win by a landslide', which is as good as saying he should step aside.\n\nThat great sage of Hollywood, George Clooney, penned a piece in the New York Times (where else?) urging his old mate Joe to step down, after the ritual obeisance (demanded of all Democrat apostates) about what a wonderful President he's been.\n\n'We're not going to win' with Biden at the top of the ticket he concludes, something he didn't share with the Democratic donator class only a few weeks ago when he hosted a massive fundraiser in Los Angeles.\n\nPerhaps the most damaging intervention came from former Speaker of the House and fellow gerontocrat Nancy Pelosi, who told MSNBC's Morning Joe - the President's very own breakfast fan club - that Biden could still reconsider standing but was running out of time to do so.\n\nShe then walked back her remarks saying she was not suggesting Biden should reconsider his position. But, since the President has been adamant that he's standing, it's hard to see what else she meant.\n\nJust when it couldn't get any better for Trump, a number of leading Democrats have started insisting that, should Biden throw in the towel, the crown should automatically fall to Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThis has infuriated other Democrats who think she's as big a liability as Biden and want an open convention in Chicago next month to choose a fresh candidate.\n\nHarris's supporters insisted it would be unconscionable for the Democrats to pass over a black women for a white man, or even a white woman. Thus has the party become prisoner of its own obsession with identity politics in which ability and competence play second fiddle to race and gender.\n\nBut Harris boosters, acting in some cases with her tacit support, tickled Trump. If there's one candidate he is even more sure of beating than Biden, it's Harris.\n\nThe Republicans head for their convention in Milwaukee this weekend in fine fettle, courtesy of the Democrats.\n\nTrump will be master of all he surveys, his candidacy not in any doubt. His hostile takeover of the Republican Party is complete. The convention will produce headlines of its own when he unveils his choice for running mate.\n\nThe latest polls give him a comfortable lead in five of the seven battleground states. Only two (Wisconsin and Michigan) are in close contention. Trump has a five-point lead in Pennsylvania. There is no route back to the White House for Scranton Joe that does not go through the Keystone State.\n\nA Trump insider told me that the former president was heard to joke in recent days that he wondered if the convention could be postponed for a week.\n\nWhy would you want that he was asked. To give the Democrats another week to stew in their own juice came the reply.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

He is, after all, 81 years old going at full throttle to 82 in just a few months.\n\nAlready, it was a federal special counsel, Robert Hur, who concluded Biden did, in fact, keep government secrets to which was not entitled in violation of federal law. But Hur recommended against filing charges, which would be felonies, because a jury would see Biden as an old man with diminished memory.\n\nBiden's gaffes and verbal blunders likely didn't create a real clear picture about the severity of his situation for one thing because he's been making those gaffes for years - starting long before a serious decline apparently started. It was just part of him being Joe Biden.\n\nMike Towle's book, \"Biden Time,\" notes back in 2006 he demanded, \"You cannot go to a 7-11 or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent ... I'm not kidding!\"\n\nIn 2009 he said, \"Now, people when I say that look at me and say, 'What are you talking about, Joe? You're telling me we have to go spend money to keep from going bankrupt?' The answer is yes, that's what I'm telling you.\"\n\nFurther, he called out a \"friend\" as a \"butt buddy.\" And he bragged about knowing three presidents \"intimately.\"\n\nHis penchant for sniffing girls' hair came out verbally, too. He said, to a 15-year-old, \"How old are you? Fifteen? I hope mom has a big fence\" and \"You've got some eyes, Isabel, I tell you.\"\n\nAnd he's made himself an expert on weapons: \"So you want to keep people away in an earthquake? Buy some shotgun shells.\"\n\nBut there were indicators of issues, despite the best efforts by his circle of family and friends to hide them.\n\nA nonscientific polling in 2020 revealed that 98%, 362 votes, to 2%, 9 votes) said he has \"lost his mind.\"\n\nAfter all, he said he \"got to the Senate\" \"180 years ago.\"\n\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet - delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts!\n\nHe's sometimes interrupted his own teleprompter speeches with, \"What am I doing here?\"\n\nHe complained of \"one trillion, 640 billion\" loopholes in the tax code.\n\nHe was talking about the costs of a program: \"740 million billion dollars.\"\n\nThat would actually be 740 sextillion, a word that fortunately has not made it into the federal budget. Yet.\n\nHe called someone who didn't give him the answered he liked a \"Lying, dog-faced pony soldier,\" whatever that means in his octogenarian mind.\n\nConfronted with the irrefutable fact of Biden's' decline, the White House suddenly started claiming all such videos were \"cheap fakes,\" a takeoff on the \"deep fakes\" that are manipulated with tech devices.\n\nBut these were not manipulated, only presented to Americans.\n\nAt a G7 summit, he turned his back on other leaders and started walking away. He's wandered across the White House lawn. He's tried to shake hands with people who weren't there.\n\nHeritage Foundation tech researcher Jake Denton said what's going on is clear.\n\n\"They're trying to push a new term underneath the school of misinformation to try and pressure social media companies to take action on videos of this nature.\"\n\nA full election cycle back in the 2020 presidential campaign, advertisements openly questioned his mental stability.\n\nQuestions begin\n\n\"Does Joe Biden have the mental capacity to keep America safe?\" asked a narrator in one spot, titled \"Lost His Mind.\"\n\nHe continues, \"In a world losing its mind, we don't need a president who's already lost his.\"\n\nAt one point he called the Jan. 6, 2021, protesters who viewed his presidential election as fraudulent as \"erectionists.\"\n\nAnd he sometimes is barely able to move about, getting on and off stages and in and out of vehicles.\n\nBesides putting Americans in the natural fear for their lives should their president lose control of his words during a confrontation with an enemy, Biden's mental failings already were creating a threat,\n\nIt was because his White House made a \"social media misstep that exposed special operators\" and could put the lives of those servicemen at risk.\n\nBiden did that by posting an image, shortly later deleted, that showed him in a meeting with special forces in Israel that exposed their faces, and identities.\n\nA spokesman explained, \"The risk is high. These guys that got pictured, it could ruin their careers. They could put their families in danger. It could put them in danger.\"\n\nThen his reputation further was skewered when he called on a member of Congress who had died a month before.\n\nDuring a news briefing he called on Rep. Jackie Walorski, who was killed in a car crash weeks before.\n\nThen Biden's spokeswoman, Karine Jean Pierre, claimed Biden didn't forget Walorski was dead,\n\nHe's also claimed to have had discussions with several world leaders during time periods that came after those leaders died.\n\nAnd he once left more than one reporter with pencil suspended when he said, \"I'll lead an effective strategy to mobilize truinnerashuvaduprezure, isolate and punish China.\"\n\nJill Biden demanded at one point that the media simply quit mentioning her husband's blunders.\n\nWhy, or how, did someone with failing faculties get to be president? His circle worked desperately to conceal the truth, and Jill Biden pushed him into a scenario from which he could not mentally emerge successful.\n\nAnd an example of Jill Biden's pushing was on video after his disastrous debate, when she told him, like a small child, that he \"knew the answers!!!\"\n\nIt was Jill Biden's first husband, Bill Stevenson, who ripped Jill Biden, to whom he was married 1970-1975, for insisting that Joe Biden stay in the election.\n\nStevenson, of Delaware, is an ardent Trump supporter who married the first lady when she was still a college student. He supported Biden when he ran for the U.S. Senate in 1972 and when Biden ran as vice president with Barack Obama. He has since been vocal with his contempt for what he has at times called \"the Biden crime family.\"\n\n\"I just don't understand why she is so adamant about defending him and keeping him in the race since it appears that he's struggling,\" Stevenson said.\n\nHe added, \"She's always been very driven. People say she's the one who wants to be president now.\"\n\nEarlier, when Joe Biden was named the Democratic nominee in 2020, Stevenson charged Jill and Joe Biden's relationship began as an affair.\n\n\"It makes me cringe every time he calls Trump a liar because I'm telling you right now, there is no better liar than President Biden,\" Stevenson said. \"He's just a bad person. I'm probably one of the few people outside his family who has known him for 50 years.\"\n\nThe Daily Mail described how members of the Biden \"inner circle\" \"have been working for years to conceal the aging commander-in-chief's cognitive decline from the public.\"\n\nThose \"gatekeepers\" were listed as senior advisers Anita Dunn, Steve Ricchetti, Mike Donilon, Annie Tomasini and Anthony Bernal.\n\n\"The group uses a range of tactics, including scheduling only early meetings, not taking unvetted questions in public forums and declining high profile interviews with respected journalists,\" the report said. \"The group's worries are not just over Biden's mental abilities but also physical. A mooted plan to make a cross country journey to promote an infrastructure bill was nixed over concerns regarding his physical stamina.\"\n\nBiden's circle also limits media interviews, scripts meetings with donors, put up physical barriers to stop journalists from being close enough to ask Biden questions, and fitted him with sneakers that have a better grip, following his infamous fall on stage at the Air Force Academy.\n\nBiden also has insisted:\n\nSuch a collection does not include Biden's near expulsion from Syracuse University's College of Law over a plagiarism scandal. In a letter to the faculty, Biden pleaded, \"If I had intended to cheat, would I have been so stupid?\" Nor does it include Biden's plagiarism, during the 1988 presidential campaign, of a speech by British politician Neil Kinnock, a scandal that helped torpedo that campaign.\n\nAs time went on, his stumbles more and more became ... silence.\n\nOf late, sometimes he has simply stood, with a vacant stare in his eyes, without moving.\n\nWhy hasn't there been more of an outcry over a president who likely is unable to comprehend the complexities of America's modern world challenges?\n\nWell, for one thing, there's that concerted coverup. A coverup that includes his family, his White House, his associates, the Democrats, even news reporters.\n\nThe coverup\n\nOne published report confirmed press members at the White House, mostly diehard liberals and leftists, admitted they were \"turned off\" from exposing his mental failings because those \"right-wing media\" WERE reporting on it.\n\nThe debate performance, described as catastrophic and shocking, prompted questions about why reports, often seeing the president daily, did nothing to expose the dramatic change.\n\nSome revealed they \"didn't want to feed into the 'right-wing talking point' about 81-year-old Biden,\" the report said. \"Biden's age was also a right-wing talking point for years, something the White House was quick to point out to reporters, which may have inadvertently turned off any serious investigation.\"\n\nThe New York Post confirmed \"the media\" have seen Biden's decline for years.\n\nCarl Bernstein, of Watergate fame, confirmed \"he knew of 15 or 20 occasions in the past 18 months when Joe Biden's brain has malfunctioned as it did during last week's debate.\"\n\nBut no mentions.\n\n\"Several people \"who are very close to President Biden ... are adamant that what we saw the other night, the Joe Biden we saw, is not a one-off ... In the last six months particularly there has been a marked incidence of cognitive decline,\" he confirmed.\n\nThe White House has claimed Biden does not have dementia or Alzheimer's. And reporters who ask about that issue are questioned about whether they've asked the \"other guy\" the same questions.\n\nExtremists in the Democrat party, like ex-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who orchestrated two failed impeach-and-remove campaigns against Trump and then created an off-the-rules House committee to blame the protest turned riot on Jan. 6, 2021, on Trump, have wildly claimed that it is Trump who has dementia.\n\nBill Ackman, Pershing Square CEO, explained that he no longer blamed Biden for not stepping away.\n\n\"He no longer as the mental acuity to make important judgments about himself. It is becoming increasingly clear however that the fault lies with @FLOTUS.\"\n\nThat would be Jill Biden, who has faced complaints of \"elder abuse\" for pushing her husband into situations he clearly is unable to handle.\n\n\"Jill Biden becomes irrelevant the moment her husband is no longer president. No more Air Force One. No more glamorous life. No more White House dinners for dignitaries. No more being treated like a queen when traveling the world. I am sorry to be harsh, but what has become entirely clear is that the first lady values what is best for herself over her husband's health and the safety and security of the country at large,\" he wrote.\n\nHe added, \"Her power has clearly grown as he gets weaker. And she likes the feeling of power. She speaks for the president when he can't or when he is napping. She tells his team and staff when he is available, and when he is not. She likes being in control. We all do. Which begs the question, how many decisions of the president are actually made by the FL? \"\n\nIt was a columnist from the Washington Examiner that wrote Jill Biden \"should be held responsible for 'elder abuse.'\"\n\nTrump's former campaign press secretary said, \"The majority of the American public agree with that. Jill Biden doesn't because, I guess, she doesn't want to be a loving wife and go take care of her husband in Delaware, which is what she should be doing,\"\n\nThe statement continued, \"And I think the media, it's time for them to finally step up after they've been complicit in this cover-up by the Democrat Party over the last four years and ask really tough questions of Jill Biden and of the Biden family about what they know about our president's state. Clearly, Jill Biden obviously knows her husband better than anyone else in this country, in this world, and she too continues to lie to the American people. It really is shameful. She's been engaging in elder abuse, and she should be held accountable for that.\"\n\nAt Newsweek, Laura Rosen Cohen wrote, \"Elder Abuse Is a Crime. We're All Watching It Happen to Joe Biden.\"\n\n\"Recent reports confirm what's obvious to everyone on the planet: President Joe Biden is a frail 81-year old who requires physiotherapy daily for his increasingly stiff gait and must wear slip proof sneakers to prevent frequent falls. Staff reportedly can only schedule important meetings for him from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM, because that is when he is most lucid,\" she said.\n\n\"This is a pattern in keeping with many dementia patients, as are other symptoms: Rarely does a day go by without video of Biden looking completely confused. He also frequently shouts angrily at reporters and confuses things, like Mexico and Egypt, or the names of dead leaders with current ones.\n\n\"It's increasingly alarming, and the general consensus in America and around the world is that Biden is both too old for the job and not well.\"\n\nContent created by the WND News Center is available for re-publication without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

But what they're accepting is not Joe Biden's mental decline. What they're accepting is the fundamental reality that they bet on the wrong horse.\n\nAnd what comes next is likely to be even worse.\n\nAt first, Democrats engaged in full-scale denial that anything was wrong with Joe Biden. The White House maintained that he was hale and healthy; Democrats in Congress tried to maintain the brave front that his debate failure had been a one-off. This is a stance now relegated to Biden's immediate family: Jill Biden insists that Joe is just fine; Hunter says that Joe hasn't lost a step.\n\nBut the rest of the party quickly moved on to stage two: anger. Democrats in Congress and members of the legacy media were -- and are -- enraged at the Biden campaign. They knew, of course, that Biden is addled. But they had faith that the Biden campaign wouldn't put that reality on full display. They believed that the Biden campaign, even with its ailing frontman, would somehow cobble together a winning campaign against Donald Trump. When their hopes were stripped away all at once, they responded with pure, unbridled fury. Congressmen called for Biden to step down; The New York Times editorial board fantasized about his ouster.\n\nBut as Joe Biden continued to hold on -- as he continued to stonewall all the attempts by his erstwhile allies to dump him overboard -- Democrats entered phase three: bargaining. Now they began to fantasize about an open convention. A shortened primary process. A Kamala Harris invocation of the 25th Amendment. Anything -- anything! -- to get rid of Biden. Perhaps it would tear the party apart and finally sink the Democrats' 2024 hopes ... but surely the Biden campaign couldn't continue to maintain the charade.\n\nAnd yet Joe Biden continued, stolidly, to deny any problems at all. He said that only elites within the Democratic Party wanted him gone. He explained that he had won the most votes in the primaries, and that he would not leave absent an act of God. He stated that he would be fully satisfied if he ran to the end of the race and lost, so long as he had done his \"goodest.\" And so Democrats descended into depression. Looking at the national and state polls, Congressional Democrats began to mutter behind closed doors about the prospect of losing both the House and the Senate. Donors began shifting their money away from the presidential race and toward down-ballot races.\n\nNow Democrats seem finally to have shifted into acceptance. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who had earlier said that Biden should drop out of the race, now reversed himself. When asked whether he had done so for pragmatic reasons, he answered surlily, \"Well, yeah. He said he's gonna remain in, he's our candidate, and we're all going to support him.\" Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., who had floated the idea of a shortened primary season, announced that Democrats would be \"riding with Biden.\"\n\nDemocrats know, of course, that Biden is in terrible shape in this presidential cycle. As Jake Sherman of Punchbowl News reported, \"Very very few think he can win and that he is the right candidate for this moment post debate.\" But it's too little too late. No force on earth or in heaven can move Biden. Unless he is hit by lightning -- or suffers an actual physical collapse -- he'll be the man on the ballot in November.\n\nGood luck to the Democrats.\n\nBen Shapiro, 39, is a graduate of UCLA and Harvard Law School, host of \"The Ben Shapiro Show,\" and co-founder of Daily Wire+.

The answer to this question will decide, in my humble opinion, what kind of nation will we leave to future generations. As it relates to baby boomers, the answer to this question will determine the quality of ourselves as it relates to hopefully, \"the bonus years\" that remain.\n\nThe Democratic Party is having a proverbial meltdown since the June 27, 2024, debate debacle by President Biden. Democrats can't get out of their own way. Some believe that President Biden should step aside for what appears to be his failing health. Others in the party are standing with the president, saying in essence, he should remain in the race. What are you saying? Should he stay or should he leave ?\n\nFull disclosure: I am an independent. I once was a Democrat and even a Republican. The Republican Party ran me out of the party. I really couldn't stay in a party that is destroying and dismantling programs and policies that I truly believed made this country great.\n\nLet's turn our attention back to the Biden challenge. I voted for President Biden and will gladly vote for him again if he remains in the race.\n\nHe brought us through the worst pandemic in our lifetime. He didn't recommend injecting \"bleach.\" He provided resources to struggling Americans to keep food on their tables and most importantly, he trusted the vaccine and the medical community's advice. This president didn't weaponize this deadly virus for political points.\n\nPresident Biden helped bring this economy out of an impending recession. President Biden has advocated for the expansion of Medicaid and not the elimination of Medicaid.\n\nPresident Biden is bringing down the high cost of prescription drugs, especially for the elderly and the poor.\n\nPresident Biden is fighting to save Obamacare, social security, the environment, and good paying jobs for all Americans.\n\nPresident Biden is a strong advocate for the Civic Rights Bill of 1964, The Voting Rights Bill of 1965, and the Fair Housing Bill of 1966.\n\nPresident Biden is an advocate for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).\n\nPresident Biden is for affirmative action programs.\n\nPresident Biden is for women making their own health decisions.\n\nPresident Biden will stand up the rights of the dreamers. He hasn't demonized immigrants. Unlike the Republican Party's likely nominee, I don't recall President Biden ever saying he doesn't want people coming to the United States from those \"s____ hole\" countries.\n\nPresident Biden has never been an advocate for white supremacy. Remember, he decided to run for president because of the pro- supremacy march in Charlottesville Virginia. His slogan became \"I am fighting for the soul of the nation!\" Friends, unfortunately this nation's soul is sick. We need someone in that White House who does not give voice to white supremacy, nor give support to the proud boys. President Biden is proud to be an American.\n\nThe question is should President Biden stay or should he go?\n\nJesus said, \"You will know them by their fruits.\" (St. Matthew 7:16)\n\nAfter the debate between President Biden and former President Donald Trump, I begin to examine the fruit. In essence, I became a fruit inspector. Yes, the president acknowledged he had a bad debate and confirmed that he is no longer a smooth talker: his steps are slower and he isn't as articulate as he was in the past. The question is, who is ? As a fruit inspector, I don't think we ought to cut down the entire tree because of a bad branch.\n\nLet me continue to examine the Biden fruit. Yes, it is an old tree, but old trees are full of shade, wisdom, hope, experience and tenacity. Biden was appointed by the first black president to serve this country in 248 years, the honorable Barack Hussein Obama. Oh yes! He saw the good fruit. The powerful United States Congressman, the Honorable Jim Clyburn (D-SC), saw this good fruit when he enthusiastically endorsed Joe Biden in 2020 for president. I met Congressman Clyburn a few Sundays ago when he spoke at the Mount Zion Baptist Church in Albany Georgia, where the pastor is Reverend Daniel Simmons. At that service, Congressman Clyburn told the story of an elderly woman at a funeral who asked him, \"who was he voting for.\" He told her Joe Biden and the rest is history.\n\nCongressman Clyburn is still standing with Joe Biden. Why? He has seen a fruit tree producing good fruit. Congressman Clyburn has witnessed up front and close the good decisions that President Biden has made and will continue to make. The man has sound judgment and he has wisdom. President Biden selected The Honorable Senator Kamala Harris to be his Vice President. Her selection was indeed an historic and transformative decision. Listen, I have personally met Vice President Kamala Harris. She is the real deal. She is brilliant; she is intelligent and she is probably one of the best vice presidents to ever serve this nation.\n\nAlso, as I examine the Biden tree, he is decisive and courageous in making the right decisions and appointments. He appointed the first black female to the United States Supreme Court. Yes, the Supreme Court: the honorable Associate Justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson. In reference to federal judges, President Biden has appointed more black federal judges than any president in these 248 years of this nation. Trust me, federal judges matter. The next president will most likely appoint two or more justices to the mighty Supreme Court, a court today, that is radically and cynically erasing the significant rulings of the 20th century. Melvin and the Blue Notes are prophetically telling us to \"Wake up everybody!\" While the country is in a debate about Biden, we are losing our hard earned rights of yesteryears.\n\nThe question is should Biden stay or should he step down? My answer is he should stay in the race for a second term. This decision is between President Biden and his family. I believe this president will make the best decision for the good of this country. Moreover, he has an impressive record of achievements and accomplishments in his fifty plus years as a faithful public servant. I hope we would not allow a 90 minutes debate to be the defining moment of a stellar political career of fifty remarkable years. He has provided this nation with faithful, forthright, and fruitful leadership. I pray to God that he would be healthy enough to continue to \"bring forth good fruits.\"\n\nLet's look into the future. If for some reason, President Biden should step aside, there is a viable and venerable alternative. That person is the sitting vice president of this nation, the gifted Kamala Harris. This nation is blessed and highly favored to have such an incredible person ready to accept the baton and lead us to victory in November. Please do not let the negative talking heads convince you that she isn't ready. She will be ready and she is ready to serve, protect and defend the values of this nation. Again, President Biden made a masterful decision to select her as his running mate. If she gets the call, she will motivate the base to turn out in record breaking numbers. She will defeat her opponent; she will unite this country and she will bring hope and steadfast leadership as our next president. Listen, there should be no division at the Democratic Party's National Convention, if president Biden should decide to step aside. Vice-president Harris is ready to step up!\n\nReverend Dr. RB Holmes is CEO and Publisher of the Capital Outlook Newspaper", "source": {"uri": "thewestsidegazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

And he won't care who goes down with him in November.\n\nConsider recent history. In a letter to congressional Democrats on Monday, Biden warned, \"The question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now. And it's time for it to end.\"\n\nAnd in a telephone interview on \"Morning Joe,\" Biden was even more combative. \"If any of these guys think I shouldn't run, run against me -- go ahead, announce for president,\" he said. \"Challenge me at the convention.\"\n\nAll of this points to the hesitation we're now seeing on Capitol Hill and among prominent Democrats. You take a shot at the king, don't miss. And that's likely to be enough to keep Biden in office. And even if they succeed in running him out of the race, they will be responsible for whatever bad happens to the party in November.\n\nDonald Trump plays hardball politics better than anyone in the game today. That's because when he threatens retaliation, he follows through on it. What about Biden?\n\nSemafor:\n\nBiden's threat is similar in effect, but functionally different. He doesn't command a rabid army of supporters to weaponize against opponents like Trump (though Democrats are watching for signs of pro-Biden backlash), and he's the definition of an institutionalist and insider, not an anti-establishment rebel who could leave his party behind if he wanted to.\n\nWhat Biden can do is be stubborn in a way that sets up a scenario of mutually assured destruction for Democrats. So long as opponents of his nomination believe it's impossible to force him to step aside, any escalation of their criticism risks damaging him even further in November. And the worse his standing gets, the more his party is likely to suffer up and down the ballot.\n\nIndeed, Biden has the pledged delegates at the convention who will be glad to vote for his nomination. And if they don't, they can be replaced with alternates. As long as Biden sticks it out and refuses to cede his position, he will be the Democratic nominee for president in 2024.\n\nAt what price to the party?\n\nSome Democrats may think that rolling the dice with another candidate may be preferable to going down to certain defeat with Biden.\n\nIt's not a very appetizing prospect. If Biden really is willing to fight a Democratic civil war, it would mean heading into convention season with key chunks of the party on the record with doubts about their nominee and pro-Biden factions accusing them of sabotage, all while Republicans quietly sit back and munch popcorn. Biden has been working hard to line up support from Black Democrats and labor -- Congressional Black Caucus Chair Steven Horsford backed Biden Monday -- setting up a potentially uncomfortable race and class dynamic to the fight as well.\n\nRep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.) asked Democrats in a statement released on Monday not to criticize Biden or the old MAD doctrine will become operational and everyone will lose.\n\n\"Regardless of where one stands on the question of President Biden's political future, the intra-party mixed messaging strikes me as deeply self-destructive,\" he said. \"Those publicly calling on President Biden to withdraw should ask themselves a simple question: what if the President becomes the Democratic nominee? The drip, drip, drip of public statements of no confidence only serve to weaken a President who has been weakened not only by the debate but also by the debate about the debate.\"", "source": {"uri": "pjmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PJ Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rick_moran@pjmedia.com", "name": "Rick Moran", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mutual assured destruction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Joe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morning Joe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-establishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-establishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Horsford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steven Horsford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Black_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Black Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritchie_Torres", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ritchie Torres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabotage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sabotage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/181/0403cd4c-000e-473f-a1cc-5e70429b2917.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716125", "eventUri": "eng-9716125", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

She clearly loves the public spotlight and the perks of the office too much to let them go.\n\nIf she had not and had his and the country's best interests at heart, she would have convinced her husband months ago that it was time to pack it in and retire to a life of leisure in Delaware. She sees him more intimately than anyone, and she knows better than anyone his capabilities and limitations.\n\nMoreover, she is his most trusted adviser.\n\nOne might think that after 35 years as the wife of a U.S. senator, eight years as second lady to a vice president and four years as first lady, Jill might be ready to take a break.\n\nBut instead of laying the groundwork for a graceful exit, she is the driving force and most visible cheerleader behind Mr. Biden's reelection effort. Consider that telling moment in Atlanta immediately after the president left the debate stage on June 27 and greeted cheering supporters following his disastrous performance against former President Donald Trump: \"Joe, you did a great job!\" a frenzied first lady shouted into a microphone. \"You answered every question. You knew all the facts.\"\n\nThen, turning to the cheering partisan crowd, she asked: \"And then what did Trump do? Lie!\" she and the promoted supporters responded with gusto.\n\nIt appeared that Jill, the teacher, was pumping up a shy first grader, not the president of the United States. The only difference was that she did not give him a gift pencil or a new ruler.\n\nA day later, at a Biden post-debate campaign rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, there was Jill again, wearing a black dress with the word \"Vote\" plastered across its entire surface. If the goal was to detract from the speech her husband gave with the aid of a teleprompter, it worked. The dress seemed to get at least as much media coverage as the speech.\n\n\"[President] Biden might have been speechifying, but that dress did the talking,\" gushed New York Times chief fashion critic Vanessa Friedman.\n\nThe dress detracted from the speech, which the Biden campaign staff did not mind at all. And neither did Jill, who loves public attention. And that is a big part of the reason why she is not encouraging her husband to step down. She is reluctant to give up the spotlight.\n\nThis Jill Biden is far different from the shy political spouse this reporter first met in 1987 -- 37 years ago -- in Wilmington, Delaware. The occasion was a party thrown the night before then-Sen. Biden planned to announce his Democratic run for president in 1988.\n\nThis reporter spotted a shy Jill Biden sitting alone on the sidelines as Mr. Biden's supporters whooped it up in a hotel ballroom. I went over and introduced myself as a reporter for USA Today and asked why she was watching the revelry rather than joining in. She confessed that she was still new to the game of political commotion and had not yet learned to wade into crowds easily.\n\nShe learned quickly enough after that.\n\nMr. Biden's 1988 White House bid flamed out over a charge of plagiarism dating back to his time in law school. Imagine a presidential candidacy crashing over such a charge today. This shows how our political standards have changed over the last four decades, for better or worse.\n\nWhich brings us back to the harsh reality of today. Jill Biden, far from the shy wife of a senator I met back in 1987, now holds in her hands the fate of a nation. If she tells her husband to battle on, he will. And if she tells him to retire to Delaware, he will.\n\nIn the end, it all depends on what Jill wants to do. It's up to her.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_lady", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First lady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raleigh,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raleigh, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Raleigh, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plagiarism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/07/09/B1_BENE_Nation_Fate_GG_c0-47-2466-1484_s1770x1032.jpg?462c54336f9bca874392c664e15977b0de279881", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716125", "eventUri": "eng-9716125", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 1457, "textEnd": 1464}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

Fort Moore, formerly Fort Benning, is near Columbus.\n\nAnd while the rally was focused on Biden's record supporting the military, such as the Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act, or the PACT Act, which expanded health care eligibility, there was no avoiding the ongoing fallout from the CNN debate.\n\n\"That 90 minutes means nothing. You don't define a president in 90 minutes,\" Gloria Tyson, U.S. Army veteran and owner of Kidz.com Child Development Center, said to the crowd as she introduced the first lady in Columbus.\n\nMonday brought a string of more developments just weeks ahead of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago where the party is set to officially nominate Biden. The day started with the president telling congressional Democrats he would not step aside despite mounting concerns, and he also called into MSNBC's Morning Joe and vowed to stay in the race. \"I am not going anywhere,\" Biden said.\n\nBut by the afternoon, Biden's press secretary was caught in a testy exchange with reporters over the president's health.\n\n\"For all the talk out there about this race, Joe has made it clear that he's all in,\" Jill Biden said to the crowd, which began to chant \"four more years.\"\n\n\"That's the decision that he's made, and just as he has always supported my career, I'm all in too,\" she said inside the Bibb Mill Event Center, which is a century-old mill-turned-event venue that sits alongside the Chattahoochee River. \"I know you are too, or you wouldn't be here today.\"\n\nThe Bidens have also leaned into their personal story as a military family. Biden's son Beau Biden, a veteran, suffered from a rare form of brain cancer and died in May 2015, years after being deployed to Iraq.\n\nIn Georgia, Democrats have largely stuck with Biden.\n\nState Sen. Ed Harbison, who is a Columbus Democrat who joined the first lady on stage Monday night, said Democrats who are questioning whether Biden should be the nominee are losing sight of the goal.\n\n\"To those people who have concerns about it, I would just like to reassure them to get over it, get focused and get going,\" Harbison said before Monday's rally. \"It's too late to do anything that would be a drastic change like that. That's just impractical.\"\n\n\"Let's go ahead, get it done and get moving. Get over it. One debate does not a campaign make,\" he said.\n\nFormer Georgia Congresswoman Carolyn Bourdeaux is an example of the rare Georgia Democrat who has said Biden should step aside. But others have voiced unease with the trajectory of the 2024 presidential election with Biden at the top of the ticket.\n\nStacy Richardson, who lives in Pine Mountain, made the short trek Monday to Columbus in search of reassurance after she said Biden's debate performance left her nervous and wondering whether that kind of episode could happen at any time.\n\nRichardson said she admires Biden and the accomplishments of his presidency and long career in public service, but as she waited for the first lady to take the stage, Richardson said she was not convinced Biden was the best candidate to face former President Donald Trump in November.\n\n\"I don't want to write him off,\" Richardson said. \"I'd like to see a little more, maybe a couple more interviews that are unscripted, a couple more appearances without a teleprompter and things that are a little more challenging.\"\n\nShe said she would also like to see the campaign address the president's health \"head on.\"\n\n\"I feel bad because I totally appreciate what his presidency did, and I believe in all that. He accomplished so much. I'm just really worried about the alternative,\" she said.\n\nBiden narrowly won Georgia in 2020 by about 12,000 votes, becoming the first Democratic presidential candidate to win here in three decades and cementing the state's battleground status. Polling has so far given Trump a slight edge in Georgia.\n\n\"For me, I feel like it's so important to have someone in that office who is honest, and I think he's honest,\" state Rep. Debbie Buckner, a Junction City Democrat, said of Biden.\n\nGeorgia Recorder is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

Having vaulted Joe Biden into the presidency and then covered up his cognitive decline ever since, Democrats may be laboring under the impression that Biden knows he owes them something. But perhaps the Bidens believe that Democrats and the country owe him another term in office regardless of any incapacity he has to execute its duties.\n\nThat certainly explains the Twelve Days of Bidenmas after the debate that Biden himself demanded, no?\n\nStill, Aaron Blake makes a good point at the Washington Post this afternoon. Democrats tried suggesting retirement sotto voce for a while after the debate. Today, however, Biden's putative allies started dispensing with the subtlety, to the point where the word 'hint' no longer really applies:\n\nThis is not even the first time that Pelosi has leaned in on the idea that perhaps Biden should reconsider his plans. But it is one of the most significant statements to date. That's because Biden has hailed his support among Democratic leaders like her -- his strongest critics have mostly come from the rank-and-file -- and because it looked for a time this week as if Biden might just get past this.\n\nBut all along, we've continued to see a series of Pelosi-esque statements from Democrats -- particularly in the Senate. They're not joining the 10 House Democrats who have called for Biden to drop out, but they are saying things that are decidedly not, \"Yes, he should stay.\"\n\nThe statements instead emphasize that it's Biden's decision and that these Democrats will support the nominee, without making anything amounting to an affirmative case for him.\n\nThat summation may no longer apply either. Before Aaron wrote this, Colorado Democrat Michael Bennet had already lamented on CNN last night that Biden's candidacy would create a \"landslide\" for Trump that would carry the GOP to full control of Congress. Richard Blumenthal added that he was \"deeply concerned\" over Biden's decision to remain in the race, and like Pelosi left the decision as still open -- although Blumenthal added that Biden would have his support if he remained in the race.\n\nHowever, Senate Democrat Tim Kaine, the party's 2016 VP nominee, raised the stakes later this morning. Kaine called on Biden to make the \"patriotic\" choice about his candidacy:\n\nThat's not a hint. That's a clear message: Get out!\n\nJon Tester faces a tough re-election bid in Montana, and the mess certainly has him worried. He didn't go quite as far as Kaine, but he went a little further than Pelosi:\n\n\"If you look at the statement I put out on Monday - it kind of fits with my statement that I put out on Monday. What I said in my statement was that I have serious concerns, and he has to fix it.\"\n\nAsked if Biden should drop out, Tester told us: \"I'll refer you to my statement that I made Monday.\"\n\nTester's statement didn't mention whether Biden should stay in the race.\n\nThese are all testaments of no-confidence, at the very least. That goes farther than hinting, but even a direct call to pull out probably wouldn't move the obstinate Bidens from their current position. From their perspective, it's all \"bed wetting,\" which as Emily Yoffe and Jon Stewart have both noted separately, is a very bad analogy for a man with cognitive issues to use as a put-down.\n\nBiden and his team are taking steps to answer these critics. Biden will hold his \"big boy press conference\" tomorrow in conjunction with the NATO summit taking place in DC, where he could demonstrate some remaining capacity for extemporaneous engagement. NBCNews also announced that Biden would sit down with Lester Holt for a one-on-one taped interview on Monday, the first night of the GOP convention. Biden already tried that with George Stephanopoulos and didn't do terribly well, certainly not enough to reassure his allies that his debate debacle was just \"one bad night.\"\n\nWill another taped interview improve matters? Maybe, as long as he doesn't grab the mic and start rambling about diversity being an \"asset,\" or something, while the cameras are on him. But Biden knows better to do that now when he's under so much scrutiny, right? Right?", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ed_morrissey@hotair.com", "name": "Ed Morrissey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Blumenthal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Blumenthal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dementia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Kaine", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Kaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Tester", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jon Tester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bennet", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bennet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCNews.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBCNews.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(meeting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summit (meeting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lester_Holt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lester Holt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jon Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/180/d08fb36a-9e0d-47ef-8e75-b8bc2a0a7d69.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716125", "eventUri": "eng-9716125", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

Democrats Get in Line", "body": "WASHINGTON -- Joe Biden has made it clear that despite his dismal, embarrassing, very faltering debate performance last month, he's running. The president may not be able to finish two sentences without stumbling or needing cue cards, but Scranton Joe is not going down without a fight.\n\nHe told fellow Democrats as much in a letter Monday morning. The 81-year-old doesn't care if voters think that he is too frail to hold the office. He is the president, and no one can make him bow out unless he wants to.\n\nOver the weekend, there was a movement among some Democrats to push him out of the race. A handful of Democrats, such as Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., signaled that Biden should bow out, but by Tuesday morning, Nadler pledged fealty to the one Democrat most likely to lose to Donald Trump.\n\nFew Democrats have the stomach to risk being the party's scapegoats if Biden loses.\n\nThe White House press corps is getting sick of being played -- so there was an open mini-rebellion during Monday's news briefing. CBS News reporter Ed O'Keefe challenged press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre for answering questions about the president's health so obliquely that the issue was allowed \"to fester.\"\n\nKJP berated the veteran journalist for asking about the identity of a Parkinson's specialist who treated the president. But by Tuesday, the fester appeared to have scabbed over.\n\nFor the record, I believe it when the administration denies Biden has shown signs of Parkinson's. I think Biden has cognitive problems.\n\nOf course, I'm no doctor. I'm just someone who, like many readers, has seen loved ones battle cognitive decline. It is painful to watch.\n\nNow that House Democrats know they can't push Biden off the stage, they can only play along. They're in the same shoes as Republicans who thought a ticket headed by Trump would doom the GOP. They're fellow hostages.\n\n\"It's clear that he's up for the job,\" Rep. Troy Carter, D-La., told CNN after Democrats huddled together. \"The president had a bad debate,\" Carter added, but he likes the Biden record and doesn't believe in judging a man by one bad night.\n\nFor once Trump has remained subdued. He knows voters cannot unsee what they have seen. Debate video clips speak louder than Trump tweets.\n\nOnce NATO decamps, expect the White House to go into the same cover-up mode we saw Monday when Biden called into MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" show. There was no video of Biden -- so you couldn't tell if he was slack-jawed, staring aimlessly, or reading certain staff-supplied quotes.\n\nThe \"Morning Joe\" segment lasted some 18 minutes -- and it was at 9 a.m. Eastern -- so, unlike the debate, not too long or too late.\n\nSoon the president of the United States will not be called to talk at length extemporaneously. He's not up to it.\n\nUntil this month, the White House was able to squelch or somewhat discredit reporting on Biden's cognitive decline. When The Wall Street Journal ran a piece in June under the headline, \"Behind Closed Doors, Biden Shows Signs of Slipping,\" Biden loyalists quickly pounced on the piece. MSNBC's Joe Scarborough was among the faithful who scoffed at the notion that Biden was not sharp as a tack.\n\nDuring Tuesday's briefing, KJP returned to the claim that Biden just had a bad night.

down.\n\n\"This is his decision,\" LaRosa said on \"Jesse Watters Primetime\" when asked about speculation that the president's wife was the motivating force behind him refusing to withdraw.\n\nDespite rising pressure on Joe and Jill Biden to convince them to leave the race after the president's rocky debate performance, the first family has repeatedly stated that it will continue to fight.\n\nJILL BIDEN'S FORMER SPOX MAKES REVEALING ADMISSION ABOUT BIDEN CAMPAIGN AHEAD OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE\n\n\"Jill alone won't make this decision,\" LaRosa said. \"I don't know if Democrats really want her to be making the decision for the party.\"\n\n\"I don't think she would want that decision,\" he said. \"I don't think she's comfortable with it.\"\n\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLaRosa said that the president was unlikely to leave the race willingly, explaining that it would \"have to be a pretty compelling case\" to convince Joe to suspend his campaign.\n\n\"She hates politics but she loves him,\" LaRosa said of Joe and Jill's relationship.\n\nJILL BIDEN'S EX-PRESS SECRETARY LAMBASTS TIGHT CONTROL OVER PRESIDENT IN NY TIMES REPORT\n\nAs a result of the president's refusal to leave the race, multiple media outlets, including The Washington Post, have launched pressure campaigns on the Biden family to convince him to step down.\n\nReaders from Pennsylvania, New York, Washington and other states urged Jill Biden to tell her husband to withdraw from the presidential race after his debate performance, in letters published on Friday.\n\n\"We turn to you, Ms. Biden, with our request to urge your husband to end his campaign for the presidency,\" readers and self-described \"Democratic women\" from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, wrote in a letter to The Post.\n\nOne reader, Richard Young, from Lexington, New York, told Jill Biden that he agreed with 72% of registered voters that told CBS that the president is no longer mentally fit to serve as president.\n\nThe Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.\n\nOriginal article source: Jill Biden's former press secretary says first lady 'alone

The Columbus area is home to Fort Moore, a sprawling Army post.\n\n\"As commander in chief, President Biden wakes up every morning ready to work for you,\" the first lady said. \"Because you are what this election is all about. For all the talk out there about this race, Joe has made it clear that he's all in. That's the decision that he's made. And just as he has always supported my career, I'm all in too. And I know you are, too, or you wouldn't be here today.\"\n\nThe first lady spoke on the northside of downtown at the Bibb Mill Event Center, inside what was, a century ago, a thriving textile operation on the eastern bank of the Chattahoochee River along the Alabama border.\n\nConcerns about Joe Biden's mental fitness in the wake of his recent debate with Trump have prompted some Democrats to call for Biden, who is 81 years old, to step aside.\n\nGloria Tyson, an Army veteran and Democratic organizer in Columbus, introduced the first lady onstage. Tyson, asked later if she thought Jill Biden had sufficiently addressed the matter of the president's health, said some in the crowd \"probably did\" want to hear more.\n\n\"But it's not even needed. ... His cognitive skills are there,\" said Tyson, 67, who runs a child-development center.\n\nAnother attendee, Louise Hurless, the executive director of the Columbus Area Habitat for Humanity, said she sensed that the first lady said enough to rally support for the president.\n\n\"I don't think you should dwell on things sometimes. If you're going to keep moving forward, you have to keep moving forward,\" Hurless, 64, said, adding that watching the debate \"was tough. ... But everyone has a bad day.\"\n\nIn remarks that went on for about eight minutes Monday night, Jill Biden touched on the president's backing of programs for veterans.\n\n\"With four more years, Joe will continue to fight for you, the military community that he, that we, are humbled and proud to call our own,\" she said.\n\nShe blasted Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, for allegedly during a 2018 trip to France referring to U.S. soldiers who had been caught or killed in war as \"suckers\" and \"losers.\" Trump has denied making the comments.\n\n\"He's evil,\" Jill Biden told the crowd Monday.\n\nShe also brought up the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity.\n\n\"Our democracy cannot withstand a Trump presidency with virtually no limits,\" she said. \"Service members honor their oath to support and defend the Constitution. We cannot trust Donald Trump to do the same.\"\n\nThe site of Monday's event lies less than 32 miles southwest of Warm Springs and the Little White House made famous by former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. During the 1944 campaign, first lady Eleanor Roosevelt staunchly supported an ailing FDR, who died in April 1945, five months and five days after winning reelection.\n\nEarlier in the day in downtown Columbus, some Muscogee County residents were unaware of the first lady's visit, word of which wasn't widely reported locally until Saturday evening.\n\nKim Aguirre, a personal-care assistant and likely Democratic voter come November, sat in the shade with a client on a 2nd Avenue sidewalk.\n\n\"I feel like we're in trouble,\" Aguirre, 47, said of the populace in general. \"I don't know if Biden is going to be able to go another four years, looking at his health and his age. And I'm just going to be honest with you. ... I just don't trust Trump.\"\n\nOf the debate less than two weeks ago, Aguirre said, \"I watched as much as I could.\"\n\nShe couldn't say whether the first lady's vocal support of her husband's candidacy will put Democratic voters at ease.\n\n\"I think everybody's concerned about his health, and will he be able to make it the four years to live up to all of what he said he's going to do,\" Aguirre said.\n\nAt a McDonald's about three blocks away on Veterans Parkway, customer Wanda Hall was dining in on a $5 Meal Deal: a double cheeseburger with four chicken nuggets, fries and a drink. She was aware that Jill Biden would be in town later in the afternoon.\n\n\"They're trying to ensure getting the Georgia votes again. ... Which I hope they do,\" Hall said. \"Maybe Jill can instill some confidence into some Georgia voters. But I'm not so sure at the moment.\"\n\nShe believes the first lady was here \"just trying\" to do what she can.\n\n\"You've got to back your husband, but I just don't see it happening,\" Hall said of Joe Biden's prospects for victory.\n\n\"Everything you see -- his health, his cognitive side -- he's declining,\" she said. \"I'd rather have him there than Trump, but with his decline I don't think he can last another four years.\"\n\nHall, 60, who most recently worked as a convenience store manager, said persuading enough voters to support Biden may at this point be a losing battle.\n\n\"Everybody's got their own opinion, but they can see with their own eyes, and hear,\" she said.\n\nOn the night of the debate, Hall tuned in but soon switched it off.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Joe,\" she said, as if addressing the president. \"I voted for you originally. I just don't think I can. ... I don't even know if I'm gonna go to the polls this year.\"", "source": {"uri": "americanmilitarynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Military News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_lady", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First lady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Moore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fort Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commander-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibb_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bibb County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bibb County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattahoochee_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chattahoochee River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_for_Humanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Habitat for Humanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

Sanford Bishop told reporters that the ticket is set.\n\n\"Everybody is looking at a tremendous record, and we have a nominee,\" the Albany native said.\n\nDemocrats like Bishop have pointed to Biden's accomplishments during his first term, including student loan relief, capping the cost of insulin and the infrastructure package, as evidence that he has been a strong president.\n\nJohnson and others described the discussion as a family meeting of sorts where members shared their opposing views but pledged to remain united in their goal of preventing former President Donald Trump from returning to the White House. Johnson said he was already in Biden's corner beforehand but was even more resolved to back the president after listening to his colleagues.\n\n\"Today was an opportunity for the members to express themselves, and my personal take-away is that Joe Biden has tremendous support from the Democratic caucus,\" he said. \"And we're going to move forward.\"\n\nBiden has said repeatedly he has no plans to abandon his campaign and chalked up his poor debate performance to \"a bad night.\" More recently, he has received praise for strong speeches at campaign rallies and Tuesday's NATO Summit kickoff.\n\nAn interview on ABC News Friday garnered more mixed reviews. The 81-year-old president has seen every move -- and even previous statements -- scrutinized for signs of ailments and advanced aging.\n\nBiden has held private calls with lawmakers and donors to address those who have expressed doubts about his ability to serve. On Monday he joined a Zoom call with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, addressing a group of lawmakers that has become some of his most vocal supporters since the debate.\n\nBlack voters are also a key constituency group for Biden in swing states like Georgia. If just a small fraction of those who supported him in 2020 decide to sit out this year's election or back another candidate, it would be difficult for him to rebuild his winning coalition.\n\nEvery Democrat in Georgia's congressional delegation except U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff are members of the CBC, and all, including Ossoff, have expressed support for Biden.\n\nSenate Democrats also discussed Biden at their private weekly luncheon; members were similarly tight-lipped afterward. Congressional Democrats have not come up with a plan on how they will present a united front as some continue to have deep concerns that Biden's sagging approval ratings and poll numbers have foreshadowed a losing night in November.\n\nJohnson said he saw no reason to abandon Biden, even after a debate performance in which he spoke with a raspy voice and delivered unfocused and hard-to-follow answers that shocked many supporters.\n\n\"Presidents are not hired because they are great debaters,\" he said. \"Presidents are hired because we expect them to govern our country, and they have the knowledge and the wisdom and experience to do so. And President Biden has done just that.\"\n\nBiden is attending NATO Summit working sessions all week and will host fellow heads of state at a dinner at the White House on Wednesday evening. He is scheduled to hold a rare news conference to conclude the summit on Thursday and on Friday will campaign in Detroit.\n\n\u00a92024 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Visit at ajc.com.

For a while there were suggestions that President Biden was about to call it quits and resign as president after his debacle of a debate with Donald Trump. If that had happened, Kamala Harris, Biden's VP, would automatically assume the presidency. Although the president's family convinced him to stay the course, there is still a possibility that President Biden might hang up his boots sometime in the near future thus making Harris our nation's first female Commander-in-Chief -- at least until the November elections.\n\nIt all started in the now famous June 27 Presidential Debate between President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden. President Trump held sway in that event; President Biden seemed lost. Even the unabashed left-leaning New York Times and Washington Post had to publicly admit that Trump was the winner and that Biden seemed unaware of what was going on. The Times wrote that President Biden \"appeared on Thursday night as the shadow of a great public servant. He struggled to explain what he would accomplish in a second term.\" Meanwhile, the Washington Post also panned Biden, noting that his performance \"raises legitimate questions about whether he's up for another four years in the world's toughest job.\"\n\nOne by one the media that supported Mr. Biden had to admit that he had lost his ability to be America's president. As the New Yorker magazine put it: \"For him to remain the Democratic candidate, the central actor in that referendum, would be an act not only of self-delusion but of national endangerment.\" CNN wrote: \"Biden was hoarse and at times unintelligible. Words often ran together. He stumbled, particularly when he tried to cite statistics and legislation.\" And, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, \"This wasn't a bad night; it was confirmation of the worst fears of some of Biden's most ardent supporters -- that after 36 years in the U.S. Senate, eight more as vice president and a term in the White House, age has finally caught up to him. Biden's candidacy was grounded in his incumbency and the belief of Democratic leaders and pollsters that he stood the best chance of defeating Trump in November. That is no longer the case.\"\n\nEven the British publication, The Economist, declared that Biden was \"befuddled and incoherent -- too infirm, frankly, to cope with another four years in the world's hardest job. The Republicans have long said that Mr. Biden's powers are fading. The debate was his great chance to prove them wrong. Alas, in front of many millions of people, he did not just fail to rebut his opponents, he presented irrefutable evidence to back them up.\"", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commander-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlanta_Journal-Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Atlanta Journal-Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/c1/ec109f46-6233-5402-ad8a-405f67e304f2/6023ebd6e68de.image.jpg?crop=705%2C370%2C0%2C61&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716125", "eventUri": "eng-9716125", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 599, "textEnd": 606}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

Brown, NNPA Newswire Senior NationalCorrespondent@StacyBrownMedia\n\nPresident Joe Biden's bid for a second term is on shaky ground following his poor showing in a debate with the twice impeached and convicted felon and former President Donald Trump on June 27. Mainstream news outlets, which played a vital role in Trump's political ascendance, now report that Biden is contemplating dropping out of the race.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Biden recently told a trusted ally that he fears his campaign might be beyond saving unless he can quickly reassure the public of his capabilities. Despite maintaining his resolve, Biden is aware that his upcoming appearances -- including an interview with ABC News George Stephanopoulos and campaign stops in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- are crucial.\n\nNBC News reported that Biden scheduled a meeting with Democratic governors to address rising concerns about his campaign. White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zientz also planned an all-staff meeting, and Biden campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon and campaign manager Julie Ch\u00e1vez Rodriguez reportedly led an all-hands call with campaign staff.\n\nOne significant voice urging Biden to withdraw is Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas. Doggett's call might prompt other officials to follow suit. Many Democrats, however, are awaiting fresh polling data to determine the impact of Biden's debate performance on his support and close races down ballot.\n\nThe Democratic Governors Association's chair, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, organized a separate session before the meeting with governors -- the gathering, which includes Govs. Gavin Newsom of California, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, Kathy Hochul of New York, and Andy Beshear of Kentucky, aims to offer support and strategic advice to Biden. \"The governors back Biden and, at a time when everyone wants to get back to the core contrast in this race, they want to hear from the president and offer key insights from their states as allies and surrogates for his campaign,\" an unnamed Democrat told NBC.\n\nAt a fundraiser in McLean, Virginia, Biden acknowledged his subpar debate performance, attributing it to exhaustion from extensive travel. \"I wasn't very smart for having traveled around the world a couple of times before the debate,\" he said, adding that he \"almost fell asleep onstage.\" Biden reiterated the critical need to defeat Trump in November.\n\nCBS News reported that Trump now leads Biden by three points in battleground states and holds a two-point advantage nationally. Democratic voter enthusiasm appeared to have dipped, with fewer Democrats than Republicans declaring they would \"definitely\" vote. Despite this, over 90% of Biden and Trump supporters remain committed.\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, fiercely defended Biden, criticizing colleagues who suggest he should step aside. \"If Dems found half as much energy to attack MAGA, the real threat, then we'd be good,\" Crockett asserted. She challenged those advocating for a new candidate to explain who could replace Biden, how they would secure ballot access in all 50 states, and how they would raise the necessary funds and build the campaign infrastructure in just four months.\n\n\"Dems spend all their time seeking perfection, while Republicans focus on their disastrous agenda and could care less so long as they rig the system in their favor,\" Crockett said, urging her party to focus on substantive threats like Project 2025 and the Supreme Court's role in undermining democracy.", "source": {"uri": "thewestsidegazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Westside Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "carma_henry@thewestsidegazette.com", "name": "Carma Henry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Ch\u00e1vez_Rodriguez", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julie Ch\u00e1vez Rodriguez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jen_O'Malley_Dillon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jen O'Malley Dillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Biden has said he does not plan to drop out of the race.\n\nJill Biden was last in Pittsburgh in June, speaking on the first day of Pride Month celebrations, and near the anniversary of the Dobbs decision to speak about reproductive rights.\n\nPresident Biden last visited western Pennsylvania in April, when he made a three-day campaign swing through the state with stops in Scranton, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia ahead of the state's primary election.\n\nThe post Jill Biden coming to Pittsburgh on Saturday to attend Italian Sons and Daughters of America dinner appeared first on Pennsylvania Capital-Star.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Pennsylvania", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Pennsylvania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrisburg,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harrisburg, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harrisburg, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erie,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erie, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Erie, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

As Biden fights to extend his political life, he's betting that reframing the race as an us-against-the-world fight will pay off.\n\n\"Joe has made it clear he's all in,\" Jill Biden said, after chants of \"four more years\" died down. \"I'm all-in, too.

They're wrong in 2022 about the red wave. They're wrong in 2024.\"\n\nNow a campaign that frames Biden as the only Democrat who can defeat former President Donald Trump is gambling that supporters will swallow their fears about his physical and mental health if its means holding off Trump.\n\nEven Biden's most stalwart supporters aren't sure it will work. Some arrived in Columbus on Monday evening in need of reassurance. Judy Varnett, a retired nurse, lingered long after Jill Biden departed and left feeling more upbeat.\n\n\"We really needed the pep talk,\" she said. \"So many of my friends are discouraged and rethinking their choices.

Images of Joe Biden as a tottering old man unable to articulate a coherent vision, much less mix it up with Donald Trump, are indelibly etched in their brain.\n\nSeeing Joe Biden doddle onto the stage and fumble from the first question should give no American joy. Joe Biden has a distinguished legacy, with more than a half-century of public service. It's sad that his family, the Administration and his campaign staff didn't intervene in what is now a critical problem.\n\nIn today's polarized political environment, where an \"Orange Man Bad\" philosophy trumps rational decision-making, the outright hatred of Donald Trump allowed Democrats and the mainstream media to look past or ignore a deeply flawed candidate with the hope that the American voter would focus their attention on Trump's antics and not Joe Biden.\n\nThis paradigm is no longer possible.\n\nFor months, the White House and its elite media friends have pushed back on claims that the president was unfit for re-election.\n\nWhen Special Counsel Robert Hur released a statement that Joe Biden wouldn't be prosecuted for having classified documents and said that the president was \"a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory,\" he was raked over the coals by the Biden-friendly commentators and Congressional Democrats. It now looks like Hur was prescient. The White House still refuses to release the video of the interview.\n\nJoe tried to right the ship by appearing in a taped interview with former Clinton message guru and now ABC News host George Stephanopoulos. The interview wasn't live. Joe fumbled and stumbled during their 22-minute exchange. Not the \"boost\" the president and his campaign needed.\n\nIn the week leading up to the debate, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre accused Republicans and conservative media of \"deep fakes\" and \"fake news\" when highlighting the president's obvious age-related challenges. Post-debate, she refuses to retract these concerns.\n\nNow, the Biden Administration spin doctor spends her days battling a re-awakened elite media and trying to explain why a Parkinson's doctor visited the White House multiple times.\n\nTwo weeks after the worst performance by any presidential candidate in a presidential debate, the White House is consumed with Joe Biden and his ability, or lack thereof, to run a 50-state campaign for president, much less function as America's CEO and commander in chief for the next four years. The Democrat Party is in disarray. And Donald Trump remains largely silent.\n\nWhether to keep or ditch Biden rests solely with Joe Biden. He legitimately won 3,896 delegates, double the number needed to win his party's nomination. The party cleared the field of any viable candidate. This decision by the \"establishment\" doesn't look too wise at this point.\n\nThe scramble among Democrat members of Congress and Party insiders remains as clear as mud: keep Joe or dump him for a younger, more viable candidate. Both options are fraught with peril.\n\nRegardless of how the above plays out, the elite media is finally doing its job. They're investigating Joe and asking the tough questions.\n\nThe media digging and investigating will hopefully discover what the Biden family, Kamala Harris and others close to the president knew about his condition and when they knew it?\n\nWas this a cover-up of epic proportions all because Democrats fear Donald Trump?

And it's time for it to end.\"\n\nHis theory of the case is that, if he demonstrates a determination to hold onto the Democratic nomination, Democrats can't dislodge it and will have no choice but to accept his nomination and move on.\n\nI find this view unduly fatalistic. If the Democratic Party develops a sufficiently strong consensus that Biden is not fit to campaign and/or serve in office four more years, they can probably push him out.\n\nA prevailing, if not quite uniform, belief among Democrats is that Biden stands almost no chance of winning the election. That conviction was endorsed today by George Clooney, whose op-ed stated flatly, \"We are not going to win in November with this president.\"\n\nThat is an overstatement. There's inherent unpredictability attached to future political events. Maybe Trump will suffer a heart attack. That said, if Democrats believe Biden stands no chance, or close to no chance, and that they are facing a wipeout in Congress, Biden's warnings that they're hurting his campaign by talking about replacing him will have no impact. If they believe they have nothing to lose, they'll keep trying to get him off the ticket.\n\nAnd if that belief becomes the prevailing view among Democrats, it places enormous pressure on Biden. Supporting the Biden campaign stops being the default choice for a loyal Democrat and becomes an act of subverting what the party believes is its only choice to stop Donald Trump.\n\nIn that environment, raising money gets much harder. (One of his biggest fundraisers just publicly asked him to drop out!) And at some point, staffing his campaign will become difficult, too. Biden famously relies on an inner circle of longtime advisers who are deeply loyal. But if those advisers also conclude he can't win, and is dooming the country to a second Trump term, they will face pressure to advise Biden to quit. Nobody wants their career to be associated with a kamikaze mission fueled by one man's ego.\n\nAnd if Biden's advisers abandon him, he could find new ones, or press onward with his family members taking over as his key advisers. (This process has already begun to an extent, according to press reports.) But the Democratic National Committee delegates would probably revolt and cite the conscience clause before they nominated a campaign with Jill and Hunter Biden as chief strategists and virtually no authentic support from the party.\n\nBiden has a lot of leverage over his party. But his party also has a lot of leverage over him.", "source": {"uri": "nymag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NYMag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_chait@nymag.com", "name": "Jonathan Chait", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myocardial infarction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/e71/2b2/532eac363e12c0e860d6cf79c98edd28cb-Chait-V4-biden.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716125", "eventUri": "eng-9716125", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

Gary Peters said Wednesday he supports President Joe Biden staying on the presidential ticket amid Democratic concerns over his electability, saying Biden can \"absolutely\" beat former President Donald Trump in November's election.\n\n\"Yes, absolutely. I believe President Biden can win,\" said Peters, who chairs the Senate Democrats' political arm. \"And I believe that we'll be able to hold the Senate majority, and I think we also have a good shot of expanding it.\"\n\nPeters was speaking to reporters on a call about his legislation that Biden signed into law Tuesday that extends two popular federal grant programs to 2028 to help local fire departments purchase safety equipment, address staffing and training needs and provide cancer screenings for firefighters.\n\n\"Any interactions I've had with President Biden, he's been very engaged in whatever topic was before us. Yesterday, I spent time with him at the signing ceremony for the legislation that I authored,\" Peters said.\n\n\"He had comments prior to the signing. He engaged in some substantive conversations -- not only with me and some other members of Congress, but also with many of the firefighters who were there, as well.\"\n\nMore: Biden's support on Capitol Hill grimly uncertain. A seventh Democrat says he should drop out\n\nMore: The White House faces many questions about Biden's health and medical history. Here are some answers\n\nPeters, a Democrat from Bloomfield Township, said he had not been asked by the White House to voice support for the president publicly. He noted that he works with and engages with Biden on a regular basis and said he's \"always found him very able to deal with complex issues, and that's what I will let everybody know.\"\n\nPeters is the latest top Michigan Democrat to reaffirm their support for Biden amid questions about his age, electability and a politically disastrous debate performance on June 27 during which he was at times incoherent.\n\nNone of the state's congressional delegation has said publicly that they think Biden should step aside as the party's nominee, though U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten, D-Grand Rapids, said last week that she had raised \"concerns strongly\" to party leaders following the debate.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colorado, became the first Democratic senator to say he doesn't believe Biden is can win a second term following his halting and at times incoherent debate performance.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide, and take with him the Senate and the House,\" he told CNN. \"So for me, this isn't a question about polling. It's not a question about politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country.\"\n\nBennett added that the White House has \"done nothing\" to demonstrate that they have a plan to win the election.\n\nMore: Actor George Clooney, a high-profile Biden supporter and fundraiser, asks president to leave race\n\nMichigan state Rep. Phil Skaggs, D-East Grand Rapids, said Tuesday that Biden's insistence on continuing to run as the Democratic nominee could put at risk several national races in Michigan, as well as the Democrats' state House majority.\n\nSkaggs said Biden should step aside and \"pass the torch to a new generation of leaders,\" stressing the risk for Michigan Democrats down ballot if Biden refused to do so. The state has a four tight U.S. House races, a tossup U.S. Senate contest and the entire state House -- where Democrats hold a slim 56-54 majority -- on the ballot, Skaggs noted.\n\n\"A collapse at the top of the ticket will seriously endanger a dozen of my colleagues,\" Skaggs said on social media.\n\nMore: Michigan House Democrat calls on Biden to step aside, says state seats are at risk\n\nAsked by The Detroit News whether he has concerns that Biden could hurt down-ballot Democratic candidates if his approval ratings fall further, Peters responded that the Senate races he's focused on are candidate-versus-candidate contests specific to their strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\"One thing we know about this presidential election is it's going to be very close. That should not be a surprise to anybody these days, especially in battleground states like Michigan,\" Peters said.\n\n\"Whether it's in the presidential level or each of our U.S. Senate races, I believe Democrats are in a good position to win, but we know these are going to be close races, and that's why it will be imperative for people to show up and vote on Election Day. To make sure that their voices is heard.\"\n\nPeters said he'll be out of state with a previous commitment on Friday and won't attend Biden's campaign rally in Detroit. \"But if I was Michigan, I would I would be with him,\" he added.\n\nWhitmer, who's been floated as a possible replacement for Biden on the ticket, is also going to be out of state for her book tour and won't attend the rally, according to her office.\n\nOn MSNBC's \"Alex Wagner Tonight,\" Whitmer on Tuesday acknowledged the \"debate did not go well\" for Biden but said the president has made it clear he won't exit the race.\n\nWhitmer said fellow Democrats need to \"stop wringing our hands and roll up your sleeve\" in order to prevail in the November elections.\n\n\"He's in it, and he is going to fight like hell to make sure that we continue the work that he has begun in this first term. I've got confidence in him, and I'm continuing to support him,\" Whitmer said. \"He's got to prove to people he is up to the moment, and I think he's going to.\"", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com",

If she talks her husband into staying the course after his widely panned debate performance, she's a power-hungry puppet master who's guilty of elder abuse. But if she convinces President Joe Biden to abandon his reelection campaign, she's admitting that she has been part of a cruel \"Weekend at Bernie's\" charade that has propped him up for months, maybe even years.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nLeonard Greene is an opinion columnist with the New York Daily News.\n\nI didn't vote for Jill Biden any more than I voted for Michelle Obama or Nancy Reagan. But I knew she came with the package. So it doesn't bother me that she advises her husband, the president, even in moments of crisis.\n\nWhat does bother me is this wicked attack on her character and, even worse, on her credentials.\n\nTo America, the first lady is known as Dr. Jill Biden. No, she isn't a medical doctor. And, no, she doesn't have a Ph. D. But she is not a quack, as some of her worst critics have said. Columnist Maureen Callahan dissed Jill Biden's community college credentials in the Daily Mail this past week.\n\nJill Biden is a devoted teacher and college professor who earned her honorific by completing the coursework required to receive a doctorate degree in education. That was after earning two master's degrees in the same field. Proud and noble accomplishments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo days a week, she takes off her FLOTUS hat and stands in front of students at Northern Virginia Community College, where she is a professor in the English department. But some of her political enemies have for years insisted on treating her like she's some fake TV court judge whose legal resume wouldn't fit on the back of a business card.\n\n\"Madame First Lady - Mrs. Biden - Jill - kiddo,\" author Joseph Epstein wrote in a 2020 op-ed piece for the Wall Street Journal. \"Any chance you might drop the 'Dr.' before your name? 'Dr. Jill Biden' sounds and feels fraudulent, not to say a touch comic.\"\n\nAs if to say that education isn't as important as some other academic disciplines. Biden's debate debacle has given rise to some wild replacement conspiracy theories, none wilder than the suggestion that Biden should dump Vice President Kamala Harris and put former President Barack Obama on the ticket.\n\nDon't bet on it. The authors of the Constitution's 12th Amendment already nixed that idea.\n\nThe second-wildest theory is that Jill Biden herself is actually angling for the job, as evidenced by her appearance on the cover of Vogue magazine. Opinion writer Ingrid Jacques even said in USA Today that the cream-colored tuxedo dress she wore in her cover shoot made her look \"very presidential.\"\n\nIt should be noted that some of the most cutting comments about the first lady have come from white women, members of the same demographic that helped put Donald Trump in the White House in 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Trump was elected president, exit polls showed that he had the support of 42% of American women. Even more shocking was that he received the votes of 53% of white women - even though a white woman was running against him.\n\nFrom there, Trump was able to nominate three conservatives to the U.S. Supreme Court and overturn the right to abortion.\n\n\"We are the first generation in half a century to give our daughters a country with fewer rights than we had,\" the first lady told a campaign crowd earlier this year. \"Book bans. Voting laws gutted. Court decisions that strip away our most basic freedoms. But circumstance is not destiny,\" she said.\n\nA day after the debate, Jill Biden took to the stage in a statement dress decorated with a simple word: Vote.\n\nIt was an important message. It was just what the doctor ordered.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nRelated Stories Latest Articles", "source": {"uri": "pressherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Portland Press Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_college", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Community college"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Daily_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Daily News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Reagan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Virginia_Community_College", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern Virginia Community College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master's_degree", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Master's degree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doctorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelfth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exit poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Demography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/07/Biden_30526_3d7fff-1720533176.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716125", "eventUri": "eng-9716125", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.388235294117647, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

The president may not be able to finish two sentences without stumbling or needing cue cards, but Scranton Joe is not going down without a fight.\n\nHe told fellow Democrats as much in a letter Monday morning. The 81-year-old doesn't care if voters think that he is too frail to hold the office. He is the president, and no one can make him bow out unless he wants to.\n\nOver the weekend, there was a movement among some Democrats to push him out of the race. A handful of Democrats, such as Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., signaled that Biden should bow out, but by Tuesday morning, Nadler pledged fealty to the one Democrat most likely to lose to Donald Trump.\n\nFew Democrats have the stomach to risk being the party's scapegoats if Biden loses.\n\nThe White House press corps is getting sick of being played -- so there was an open mini-rebellion during Monday's news briefing. CBS News reporter Ed O'Keefe challenged press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre for answering questions about the president's health so obliquely that the issue was allowed \"to fester.\"\n\nKJP berated the veteran journalist for asking about the identity of a Parkinson's specialist who treated the president. But by Tuesday, the fester appeared to have scabbed over.\n\nFor the record, I believe it when the administration denies Biden has shown signs of Parkinson's. I think Biden has cognitive problems.\n\nOf course, I'm no doctor. I'm just someone who, like many readers, has seen loved ones battle cognitive decline. It is painful to watch.\n\nNow that House Democrats know they can't push Biden off the stage, they can only play along. They're in the same shoes as Republicans who thought a ticket headed by Trump would doom the GOP. They're fellow hostages.\n\n\"It's clear that he's up for the job,\" Rep. Troy Carter, D-La., told CNN after Democrats huddled together. \"The president had a bad debate,\" Carter added, but he likes the Biden record and doesn't believe in judging a man by one bad night.\n\nFor once Trump has remained subdued. He knows voters cannot unsee what they have seen. Debate video clips speak louder than Trump tweets.\n\nOnce NATO decamps, expect the White House to go into the same cover-up mode we saw Monday when Biden called into MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" show. There was no video of Biden -- so you couldn't tell if he was slack-jawed, staring aimlessly, or reading certain staff-supplied quotes.\n\nThe \"Morning Joe\" segment lasted some 18 minutes -- and it was at 9 a.m. Eastern -- so, unlike the debate, not too long or too late.\n\nSoon the president of the United States will not be called to talk at length extemporaneously. He's not up to it.\n\nUntil this month, the White House was able to squelch or somewhat discredit reporting on Biden's cognitive decline.\n\nWhen The Wall Street Journal ran a piece in June under the headline, \"Behind Closed Doors, Biden Shows Signs of Slipping,\" Biden loyalists quickly pounced on the piece. MSNBC's Joe Scarborough was among the faithful who scoffed at the notion that Biden was not sharp as a tack.\n\nDuring Tuesday's briefing, KJP returned to the claim that Biden just had a bad night. Nobody believes that.\n\nDebra J. Saunders is a fellow with Discovery Institute's Chapman Center for Citizen Leadership.

Michael Bennett (D-CO) from becoming the first Democratic senator to tell CNN he doesn't believe Biden can beat Donald Trump.\n\nAnd Sen.

Show us in the way you campaign that you can effectively beat Donald Trump,\" Durbin said.\n\nOn the campaign trail, former President Trump was enjoying all the Democrat infighting, telling supporters, \"The radical left Democrat Party is divided in chaos and having a full-scale breakdown all because they can't decide which of the candidates is more unfit to be president.\"\n\nSome Democrats are now fearing a Trump landslide and another stumble by Biden is sure to ignite more calls from his own party to step down.\n\nMeanwhile, at the NATO summit in Washington on Tuesday, Biden announced a new aid package to Ukraine.\n\n\"The United States, Germany, the Netherlands, Romania, and Italy will provide Ukraine with the equipment for five additional strategic air defense systems,\" Biden said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is clearly worried about the impact the 2024 election will have on more aid for Ukraine, saying, \"Americans are waiting for November. In Europe, Middle East, in the Pacific, the whole world is looking towards, looking to November and, truly speaking, Putin awaits November too.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBN.com - The Christian Broadcasting Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Cohen_(politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Cohen (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Durbin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dick Durbin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www2.cbn.com/sites/default/files/media/slider/images/bidenprayerbreakfast_hdv.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716125", "eventUri": "eng-9716125", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

It was 2003, and inside the family home in Delaware, senior Democrats were trying to persuade her husband Joe to run for president. Joe knew she didn't want him to do it.\n\nShe decided to force the issue. Scrawling 'NO' in large letters on her stomach with a black marker pen, the former part-time model marched into the room where they were meeting in her bikini.\n\nMr Biden got the message -- he didn't run that year, although Jill changed her mind over time, with her husband finally winning the presidency in 2020 after ousting Donald Trump.\n\nInsiders say Jill Biden remains the only person who can really influence the floundering octogenarian President\n\nBut amid escalating concern over the President's mental competence, and his declaration yesterday that he was 'firmly committed' to running for re-election, how dearly Democrats would love the First Lady to write that same instruction on her midriff again -- if that's what it takes to persuade Joe Biden to bow out.\n\nInsiders say she remains the only person who can really influence the floundering octogenarian as Democrats try to avert defeat in November and their Doomsday scenario of Donald Trump back in the White House.\n\nThe 73-year-old First Lady, with her passion for teaching English to immigrants and posting unfussy recipes online -- such as her 'chicken parmesan' -- was once seen as a huge asset to the Democrats. Now she is widely regarded as a dead weight dragging down their chances of beating Trump.\n\nFor it appears that the vanity and arrogance of Joe Biden in refusing to face facts about his mental frailty is shared -- perhaps even exceeded -- by his second wife, whom a conservative website, in a nod to Shakespeare's scheming villainess, has dubbed 'Lady MacBiden'.\n\nAs Democrats repeatedly call on the First Lady to shake some sense into the decrepit commander-in-chief (though not too vigorously, of course), Washington insiders say that's hardly likely to happen, because she's the very person encouraging him to keep going.\n\nNBC News reported several days ago that she and her disgraced stepson Hunter -- awaiting sentencing in October for his conviction for buying a gun while being a drug user -- have been urging the President to sack staff who haven't been sufficiently upbeat about his election prospects.\n\nMeanwhile, the sense of unity between husband and wife was impossible to miss in Lady Mac-B's comments to American Vogue in the wake of the catastrophic televised debate with Donald Trump: 'We will continue to fight,' she told the magazine.\n\nDr Biden -- a title on which she insists, despite holding a doctorate in education rather than being a physician -- features on the cover of the August issue sporting a \u00a33,900 Ralph Lauren tuxedo dress and similarly priced earrings.\n\nThe cover bore the imperious headline 'We will decide our future'. In Dr Biden's defence, she was talking about women, not her husband's campaign, but the timing of the fawning profile, which went to press in the weeks before the debate, could have not been more inopportune.\n\nNowadays, the First Lady seems far removed from the woman Michelle Obama once hailed as down-to-earth and 'without an ounce of pretence'. But despite her presidential posturing, Dr Biden hasn't left her classroom manner entirely behind.\n\nThe 73-year-old First Lady was once seen as a huge asset to the Democrats. Now she is widely regarded as a dead weight dragging down their chances of beating Trump\n\nNowadays, the First Lady seems far removed from the woman Michelle Obama once hailed as down-to-earth and 'without an ounce of pretence'\n\nLeading her star pupil carefully off stage from the debate 12 days ago, she gave him a pep talk in full kindergarten mode. 'Joe, you did such a great job!' she enthused in front of the cameras. 'You answered every question, you knew all the facts!'\n\nIt was excruciatingly plain to viewers that he had not, but Jill continues blithely to deny the obvious. 'Joe isn't just the right person for the job. He's the only person for the job,' she told a fundraising event in New York the following day.\n\nHer husband continues to tie himself in knots, however. Though he was provided with the questions in advance of a radio interview on Thursday, the leader of the free world managed to make the bizarre boast that he was the 'first black woman to serve with a black president'.\n\nREAD MORE: Jill Biden's campaign blitz to defend Joe, 81, as he ignores mountain of calls to drop out... and she faces questions on hiding his ailing condition from the public\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe revelation on Sunday that his staffers provide him with photos and instructions in large print on how to enter and exit events -- with one such instruction being 'Walk to podium' -- will do little to quell concerns that the President must be spoon-fed even the most basic information.\n\nSo is Jill Biden simply playing the loyal wife, cheering on her husband's decisions; or is she truly in charge? Joe often speaks after Jill at rallies and opens with: 'My name is Joe and I'm Jill's husband.' Some believe it's not entirely spoken in jest.\n\nMost First Ladies accept they are an unelected accessory to their spouse, but Dr Biden takes herself very seriously. In 2021, for example, she posted a photo of herself going through briefing manuals at the President's desk on Air Force One. The caption read: 'Prepping for the G7.'\n\nCertainly, she knows her own mind, as her stunt with the marker pen in 2003 makes clear. Yet the comparisons now being made with Nancy Reagan -- whose domineering presence made her the power behind the throne of husband Ronald in the 1980s -- hardly seemed likely when the Bidens entered the White House in 2021.\n\nFollowing the seedy talk of serial infidelity and cynical pre-nup agreements that surrounded the marriage of previous incumbents Donald and Melania, the relationship between Jill and Joe seemed refreshingly sweet and non-transactional. They appeared genuinely devoted to one another.\n\nIt is a second marriage for both. Born Jill Jacobs in 1951, the eldest of five daughters of a bank cashier, she grew up in New Jersey and Pennsylvania before getting married at just 18 to Bill Stevenson, a former college football player whom she met the summer before graduating from high school.\n\nAfter the death of his first wife and infant daughter in a car crash, Mr Biden said of Jill: 'She gave me back my life. She made me feel normal again.' The pair are pictured with the President's sons, Hunter and Biden, and their daughter Ashley\n\nIn the early decades of their marriage Jill was a reluctant political wife who made it clear that nothing would stop her teaching\n\nBy late 1974 the romance had fizzled out and Bill and Jill divorced the following spring.\n\nThat same year she met Biden, who by chance, as he tells the story, had seen her posing as a model in an advert. His brother Frank had been a friend of Jill at the University of Delaware and gave him her phone number.\n\n'You'll like her, Joe,' Frank reportedly told his brother. 'She's not interested in politics.'\n\nJoe's first wife, Neilia Hunter, had died along with their infant daughter three years earlier in a car crash, just a few weeks after he had won a triumphant underdog campaign to become a senator for Delaware. Jill recalled sitting in her car after taking her final exams and hearing news of the tragic accident on the radio.\n\nFrom their first meeting, Joe was instantly smitten, later saying: 'She gave me back my life. She made me feel normal again.' Jill had initially thought Joe, nine years her senior, was too old for her, and when he arrived for their first date wearing a suit and polished shoes, she admitted her first reaction was to think: 'Thank God this is only one date.'\n\nHowever, the two hit it off and she was pleasantly surprised by his propriety when he brought her home and said goodnight by shaking her hand.\n\n'During the 1970s, usually the guy was groping you at the door. I was so taken aback I ran upstairs and I called my mother -- it was one in the morning -- and said: 'Mom, I have finally found a gentleman,' she recalled.\n\nBiden said he had to ask her five times before she agreed to marry him, eventually promising not to stand for re-election to the Senate if she said 'Yes'.\n\nHe went so far as to phone a reporter to announce his intention but Jill cut off the call with her thumb, saying -- according to the official Biden family account -- that she couldn't come between him and his dreams.\n\n'Most of all I fell in love with the boys,' Dr Biden has gushed of Joe's two young sons -- the late Beau and Hunter -- who had survived the crash that claimed the lives of their mother and sister.\n\nHunter, who has struggled for years with crack cocaine addiction, has been less complimentary.\n\nIn a text to his uncle in 2018, Hunter reportedly called his stepmother a 'vindictive moron', and in messages to his brother's widow, with whom he was in a relationship at the time, referred to Dr Biden as a 'selfish silly entitled c***' and said that she should 'go f***' herself, after she urged him to go to rehab.\n\nWhite House insiders say Dr Biden can be fiercely protective of her husband and bristles at any suggestion his faculties are in decline\n\nHe further boasted to his uncle that he was more intelligent than her: 'The drunkest I've ever been is still smarter than you could ever even comprehend and you're a shut [sic] grammar teacher.'\n\nJoe and Jill had daughter Ashley together in 1981, four years after they were married. Some of the details of their domestic life are almost toe-curlingly saccharine -- she says she used to play their favourite song, Have I Told You Lately (That I Love You) when he came home from the Senate.\n\nBut for all her reputation now as a kingmaker, in the early decades of their marriage Jill was a reluctant political wife who made it clear that nothing would stop her teaching. 'Being a teacher is not what I do but who I am,' she has said.\n\nShe has described marking school work while travelling on Air Force Two when Joe was Vice President, and once 'scrambling into a cocktail dress and heels' in a school lavatory to make it to a White House reception.\n\nThe first First Lady to have a paid job outside the White House, she still teaches at the modest North Virginia Community College, which has campuses in the suburbs of Washington DC. Some of its students (of whom many are recently arrived immigrants) admitted this month that they didn't even know the woman they know as 'Dr B' is married to the U.S. President.\n\nWhite House insiders say Dr Biden, who before she became First Lady ran five miles a day, five days a week, can be fiercely protective of her husband and bristles at any suggestion his faculties are in decline. At a Biden rally in 2020, when two militant vegans jumped onto the stage clutching 'Let Dairy Die' placards, she instantly inserted herself between them and her husband.\n\nMonths later, she published a children's book, Joey: The Story Of Joe Biden, that portrayed the presidential candidate courageously overcoming a childhood stutter for which he was bullied.\n\nWhen, in the previous year, at least seven women accused her husband of physically touching them in a way that made them feel uncomfortable, Jill leapt to his defence, making him sound almost Christ-like: 'What you don't realise is how many people approach Joe. Men and women, looking for comfort or empathy.'\n\nShe's also had considerable experience clearing up his verbal messes, although, given his own self-description as a 'gaffe machine', it didn't previously arouse anything like the alarm it does now.\n\nDr Biden should ask herself whether her 'admirable loyalty' to her husband will serve the best interests of her country, writes U.S. political commentator William Galston\n\nThe Bidens after Joe announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination\n\nWhen Joe began talking about stopping 'four more years of George' [Bush] in an interview just days before the 2020 election, Dr Biden's lips were seen moving twice as she appeared to prompt him with the word 'Trump'.\n\nIn speeches, she still urges Americans to try to see the noble soul she married and ignore the gaffes or the critical headlines. 'I want you to hear Joe's words. But most of all I want you to listen to his heart,' she has said.\n\nInsiders have said she encouraged him to seek re-election, having warmed to White House life and -- unlike Melania Trump -- enjoyed her role as First Lady.\n\nShe has been a constant presence in campaign meetings. 'She is usually in the room when senior campaign staff are presenting strategy to her husband. She will ask questions. But she never weighs in on the decision,' a former Biden aide told Politico website last year. The adviser added: 'She is always his final 'gut check'.'\n\nBut sources say he sometimes seems too reliant on her, always asking for her opinion in meetings, where she'll sit taking notes. Biden aides have called her 'the closer' -- a confidante on whose unvarnished advice he'll rely before he makes a final decision.\n\nThe stakes couldn't be higher now. Jill Biden should ask herself whether her 'admirable loyalty' to her husband will serve the best interests of her country, writes a prominent U.S. political commentator [William Galston], adding: 'Fate has given Mrs Biden the power to shape history. May she use it wisely.'\n\nThe President could sorely do with some unvarnished advice from the First Lady now. And if she wants so desperately to retain the trappings of power, the increasingly presidential Dr Biden could always follow in the footsteps of Hillary Clinton and make her own run for the White House.\n\nAt just 73, compared to the two current candidates, she'd be a spring chicken.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [],

I don't think she's comfortable with it.\"\n\nMoore made his blunt comments following a concerning ABC News interview with Biden that aired on Friday.\n\n\"If I have to be the only one to stand up for Joe Biden here to protect him from the cruelest form of elder abuse I've ever been forced to watch, well then that's what I'll do,\" the filmmaker said.\n\nRELATED: Michael Moore Says 'Elder Abuse' Must Stop, Calls For Biden To Step Down After 'Utter Collapse' At Debate\n\n\"He was in epic distress [during the debate],\" Moore continued. \"Every cognitive default in his mind seemed to be shutting down.

Would you have seriously even let him go out on that stage?\"\n\n\"I will say this, to protect him from an out of control party machine that is in a panic over what to do -- for any of us to be silent now is exactly what the term elder abuse is meant to describe,\" he added. \"Leave Mr. Biden alone.\"\n\nBefore addressing the \"elder abuse\" accusation, LaRosa said that the Bidens' decision to stay as the nominee is likely being colored by Biden's withdrawal from the Democratic nomination race in 1987.\n\n\"That moment was scarring for them,\" LaRosa said.\n\nBiden has been adamant about staying in the race, even saying during the ABC News interview that he would only drop out if the \"Lord Almighty\" told him to.\n\nFurther, in a letter he sent to Congressional Democrats on Monday, the president emphasized his position and urged Democrats to fall in line. \"Any weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task ahead only helps Trump and hurts us,\" Biden wrote. \"It is time to come together, move forward as a unified party, and defeat Donald Trump.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailywire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elder abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Press secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physical fitness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://dw-wp-production.imgix.net/2024/06/GettyImages-2159613477.jpg?w=1200&h=800&ixlib=react-9.3.0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716125", "eventUri": "eng-9716125", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

But there wasn't the consensus needed to try to urge him to drop out of the race, either. ...\n\nThe varying opinions on Biden left Democrats frozen with an insoluble problem. While most of his critics figured that Biden was likely to lose if he remained on the ticket, they also estimated that an unsuccessful effort to oust him would just widen the margin of defeat and cause collateral damage down-ballot, possibly dooming their own campaigns.\n\nTo be clear, there was never any prospect of Democrats removing Biden against his will, if only because he and his allies (including the most likely replacement candidate, Kamala Harris) totally control the delegates and the machinery for the convention that would have to do the deed, well before the first gavel falls in Chicago next month. With Biden making it abundantly clear he had no plans to step aside, the only hope for regime change was a quick and overwhelming show of force among Democratic elected officials, particularly in Congress, that might convince Biden to reconsider. It didn't happen. Nor (so far) did polls appear showing the president's support in free fall; he's not doing great, but he didn't lose much ground.\n\nBiden's not fully out of the woods yet; there are concerns about how he will handle a July 11 press conference at the end of the NATO summit, and bad new polls could drop at any moment. But the sort of off-the-record carping we're now hearing from restive Democrats is becoming a waste of time if they aren't going to go public with it. By the time Republicans gather in Milwaukee next week to celebrate their own improbable Comeback Kid, Democrats need to move on and figure out how to help their nominee win.\n\nThe first step is to believe Biden can still win, which they really should. Eight years ago, Donald Trump had been trailing Hillary Clinton in the polls for months, then on October 7, 2016 he suffered what nearly everyone at the time thought was a candidacy-ending blow: the Access Hollywood tape exposing him as a raging sexist asshole. Republican elected officials were abandoning him left and right. A month later he became president-elect. Yes, a lot of weird things happened, and the polls turned out not to have been accurate in terms of the Electoral College outcome. But there's a lot more time this year for weird things to happen (possibly another debate, almost certainly a criminal sentencing of the convicted felon of Mar-a-Lago, and potentially real-life good news for Biden from Gaza and the economic indicators). And Democrats need to shake the superstitious conviction that polling errors only benefit Trump. There's significant evidence this year that Trump's support level is being inflated by unlikely voters.\n\nThe main thing Biden lost in the debate was a huge opportunity to focus a spotlight on Trump's record, conduct, and extremist agenda, and the immense amount of time it has already taken away from his campaign plan. Now he needs his party to help him make up for that lost time with a sustained high-volume messaging effort that makes it clear why their fear and dread about a second Trump administration should be shared by the majority of voters who give the 45th president an unfavorable rating. For Biden's ticket-mates, that means refusing to yield to the temptation to distance themselves from the president and run their own races. And for donors, that means quashing talk of conceding the presidency and concentrating on House races to prevent a Republican trifecta. Without much question, in an era still dominated by straight-ticket voting and turnout-dependent strategies, a close presidential contest is the best way to give House Democrats a shot at flipping control of the chamber. And a presidential win (with the tie-breaking vice-presidential vote that ensures) is undoubtedly the only feasible path to a Democratic Senate.\n\nYes, Kamala Harris or some fantasy alternative candidate like Gretchen Whitmer might give Democrats a fresh start and a better chance of victory. And perhaps some final effort to surround Joe Biden with friends and allies begging him to step aside is still in the works. But if it doesn't happen (and it probably won't), then at some point Democrats need to stop pouting and get to work turning this thing around.", "source": {"uri": "nymag.com", "dataType": "news",

So, let's review the last few days.\n\nPresident Biden had an absurdly bad debate with his Republican counterpart, Donald Trump, two weeks ago. At one point, the president said, \"We finally beat Medicare.\" Yeah, it was bad.\n\nThe disastrous debate led to this: First, Democrats defended the president's performance. Then, a few said maybe Mr. Biden should be replaced -- anonymously, of course. Then, a few Democrats came right and said Mr. Biden should bail out. Then, everyone was talking about Vice President Kamala Harris stepping in.\n\nBut that didn't last long.\n\nOver the past weekend, there was a new report that a neurologist and Parkinson's disease specialist had made at least eight visits to the White House, raising new questions about Mr. Biden's fitness for office. Another report said Mr. Biden has only a small time frame each day in which he can focus -- and he can't work after 8 p.m.\n\nOn Monday, a fiery Mr. Biden called into a morning TV show to declare \"I'm not going anywhere,\" and the White House said the president doesn't have Parkinson's. By Tuesday, there was talk of a \"mini-primary\" to pick Mr. Biden's replacement.\n\nBack to the top: Nothing happens by accident. Washington has a no-fly zone over it, but that doesn't include trial balloons. Those are aloft every day inside the Beltway, and no one bats an eyelash when they get shot down.\n\nYour guess is as good as mine about what's really going on, but here's my guess: The move to replace Mr. Biden is being masterfully orchestrated, and we're nearly at the endgame: replacing him as the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nLet's work through a couple of scenarios. First, it's a no-brainer to think that top White House advisers knew that Mr. Biden was going to screw the pooch in the debate. They see him every day, they know he's not, as he might say in his 1950s lingo, \"with it.\" He's no longer a hep cat, and his staffers knew that when he walked onto the debate stage.\n\nThen there's the timing of the debate: June 27?! That's the earliest by far in recent presidential campaigns. Why? My theory is this: They trot out a clearly confused president, everyone sees his diminished state of mind, the chattering class does what it does, the balloon of replacement gets launched, and off we go.\n\nSo what's up with what followed? Kamala's balloon was floated, then shot down, and despite a slew of prominent Democrats calling on Mr. Biden to disappear -- no less than liberal firebrand film director Michael Moore called it \"elder abuse\" -- the president vows to stay in the race?!\n\nI'm still predicting Mr. Biden is not the 2024 presidential nominee. He's 81, he's fading fast, and he's lost the faith of his brethren -- and that includes donors, the real deciders of who is the nominee. A new report says few donors with deep pockets will even take his call.\n\nMy theory is that California Gov. Gavin Newsom is the anointed one, chosen by Mr. Biden to take over when he steps aside. Asked if he would run in an open convention, Mr. Newsom said: \"That's a legit question, but it's exactly where the other party wants us to be is having this internal fight. And I think it's extraordinarily unhelpful.\"\n\nThat's not a no.\n\nPolitical guru James Carville on Tuesday laid out an intriguing path. He said that former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama could moderate four town halls with up to eight potential candidates to replace Mr. Biden and then delegates could select the party's nominee at the Democratic National Convention in mid-August.\n\nAll the polls say Mr. Biden is going to lose the election -- maybe really, really badly. It's now or never. And it's all been mapped out: Bad debate performance, chatter to replace, maybe Parkinson's, Kamala bad, fiery Joe vowing to stay in the race -- and then, replaced.\n\nNothing happens inside the Beltway by accident. Mr. Biden said he'd drop out only if God himself tells him to, but it's unclear if God is playing favorites in the 2024 presidential election in the United States.

Nearly all back Biden", "body": "Greg Bluestein, Tamar Hallerman and Michelle Baruchman - The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (TNS)\n\nATLANTA -- One said he would vote for President Joe Biden if he was on life support. Another said she might have to move to a different continent if he loses. A third said he would vote for a chunk of plywood if it meant defeating former President Donald Trump.\n\nAs Biden faces pressure to end his reelection bid over concerns about his age, Georgia delegates to the Democratic National Convention interviewed by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution appear to share one thing: a near-unflinching loyalty to the embattled incumbent.\n\nThe AJC this week attempted to contact each of the party's 109 state delegates and interviewed nearly half of them. Of the 50 people interviewed, all but two said they would back Biden's reelection bid without hesitation.\n\nThe delegates also voiced broad support for Vice President Kamala Harris as Biden's successor should he voluntarily step aside, though many stressed it was a moot point until the president deems otherwise.\n\nCeremonial role\n\nDelegates fill what is typically a ceremonial role, formally casting votes to nominate their candidate for president. But the labor organizers, small business owners, party officials, longtime activists and others who are headed to Chicago as delegates for the party's four-day gala in August could play a far different role if doubts about Biden's fitness impact the proceedings.\n\nFollowing Biden's disastrous debate in Atlanta, calls for the 81-year-old to pass the torch to a younger leader have reshaped the campaign, and there is growing pressure from a liberal activists, wealthy donors and progressive officials who predict Biden won't be able to beat Trump.\n\nThe president has defiantly dismissed efforts to push him aside, all but daring his naysayers to pick a fight. He told MSNBC this week they should \"go ahead, announce for president -- challenge me at the convention.\"\n\nIn the interviews, Georgia delegates made clear that a last-ditch effort on the DNC floor to defeat him won't go anywhere, even though party rules don't require them to vote for Biden if it goes against their \"good conscience.\"\n\n\"He just has to ride it out,\" state Rep. Dar'shun Kendrick said of the turmoil. \"I'm not saying the concerns about age aren't valid, but the reality is we have two choices. Democracy or dictatorship. As long as Democrats stick together and do the work to earn every vote, this brouhaha will blow over.\"\n\nThat was a common theme. Delegates acknowledged the president flubbed the debate and, in some of their views, has done little since then to reassure antsy voters. But they say his record in office and track record against Trump should outweigh health concerns.\n\n\"We can't count people out because of their age. He's probably forgotten more than those calling for him to step aside will ever know. Young people make gaffes too,\" said Henry Ficklin, a former Macon City Council member. \"I'll grant Biden a few gaffes, but I'll take him on life support over Trump.\"\n\nThe Georgia delegation's support for Biden shouldn't be surprising. Most have served in the Democratic trenches for years and fought in 2020 to help Biden flip Georgia for the party for the first time in nearly three decades.\n\nWinther Hardy of Jefferson said the delegation has little choice in the matter even if some were worried about whether Biden's health will hold up.\n\n\"I pledged as a delegate to vote at the convention the way that the Georgia voters chose, and they chose him overwhelmingly. So he is our candidate,\" Hardy said.\n\nAnd Quentin T. Howell, a longtime Democratic activist in Milledgeville, echoed other delegates who said the nation's lens should be focused less on Biden's lapses and more on Trump, who was convicted weeks ago of 34 felony counts in a New York hush money trial.\n\n\"We're not changing nothing on our side. we'll take Joe Biden if he's in a wheelchair on crutches,\" he said. \"What are they going to do with a candidate who is a convicted felon? it's a no brainer.\"\n\nFormer state Rep. Winfred Dukes, who long represented an Albany-based district, went a step further by summoning up Trump's record of false and misleading statements and a 2023 jury verdict that found Trump liable for sexually abusing columnist E. Jean Carroll in 1996.\n\n\"I'd rather be with a sick old man than a habitual liar, a convicted felon and a sexual assaulter any day. We're lining up with Biden. Donald Trump is in a world of trouble. He don't even know it.\"\n\nRisks are 'too great'\n\nWhile the delegation's support for Biden was overwhelming, it was not unanimous. Two delegates expressed concerns about the president's reelection bid on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive topics that could cause them to lose their coveted spots.\n\nOne said that it has become clear Biden is not the same energetic candidate who defeated Trump in 2020. The stakes are different now, too, with Trump expressing more authoritarian rhetoric and a fresh U.S. Supreme Court ruling that found presidents have substantial immunity for some official acts.\n\n\"I wish we could just reframe this, put a new light on it and that would make it OK,\" said the delegate. \"But every time we see him walk, every time we see his eyes in the sunglasses he wears so frequently ... I think the time has come (for him to bow out).\"\n\nA second delegate feared Biden was doomed no matter how his campaign scrambles to reposition itself.\n\n\"I'm very concerned. I don't think he should run. I think he's going to lose and the risks are too great. You're not going to see a revolt from Georgia delegates. We are pledged to Biden. But it's incumbent on party elected officials to tell Biden it's no longer tenable.\"\n\nBoth said they were skeptical anything could be done to change the party's course just weeks before the convention. And both said they feared speaking publicly to distract from the party's focus on defeating Trump.\n\n'The only choice ... is Kamala Harris'\n\nThere was also a broad consensus of delegates behind Harris if the decision was thrown to them, with some saying if Biden trusted her enough to make her his running-mate then Democrats should also back her as his successor.\n\n\"The vice president has done a good job, but I don't expect it to come to that,\" said Vinny Olsziewski, a Rome operative. \"The president has made clear he wants to stay at the top of the ticket.\"\n\nSome warned of voter backlash if Harris, a Black woman, was bypassed.\n\n\"The only choice that should be made is Kamala Harris,\" said Thelma Johnson, who is also a Black woman.\n\n\"[If not] are we saying that she's not qualified enough, that she doesn't have the ability to serve in the highest office of the land, or that she doesn't qualify because of her race?\" the 55-year-old Albany resident asked.\n\nOthers wouldn't even brook a conversation about a hypothetical.\n\n\"I pledged my support to President Biden and I don't have any intention of supporting anyone else. I'm in it for as long as he's in it,\" said Kristen Kiefer, a health care executive from Warner Robins.\n\nAmin Ghoneim, a political organizer from Suwanee, said he sees it as an \"obligation\" to represent Georgia primary voters by backing Biden.\n\n\"If he throws his weight behind somebody, that's who I throw my weight behind because Georgia voters voted for Biden,\" he said. \"And if it's not going to be Biden, then it should be who Biden sees fit.\"\n\nA 'move to Ecuador?'\n\nIf there was a consensus among the delegates, it was that Biden was the party's best hope at this late stage to defeat Trump.\n\nDeKalb County Commissioner Mereda Davis Johnson said Biden's debate performance gave her \"no reason to think that someone else should step in. Because we all have bad days. If we're judged by that one bad day we would never serve.\"\n\nFulton County Commissioner Marvin Arrington Jr. framed his support for Biden this way: \"I would vote for a piece of wood or a rock over his opponent.\"\n\nAnd then there was state Rep. Shelly Hutchinson, who said half-jokingly she would have to refresh her passport if party infighting scuttled Biden's chances of winning another term.\n\n\"I'm all-in for Biden. This has to be a group effort. A faction breaking off to do something else will bring chaos and ultimately dystopia,\" she said. \"And then I have to move to Ecuador.\"\n\n\u00a92024 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

His campaign hasn't yet released the full details of the event, but it will likely serve as another opportunity for the president to shore up support from his party.\n\nHarris, on Tuesday, hit the campaign trail in Nevada, a key swing state where polls show Trump maintaining an advantage. At the event, she took a notably aggressive approach in tying the former president to the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, a highly scrutinized initiative that's been portrayed as a blueprint for a future Republican administration to restructure many parts of the U.S. government.\n\nThe vice president will then head to a campaign stop in Greensboro, North Carolina, on Thursday, a state Trump narrowly carried in 2016 and 2020. This will be her sixth visit to the state just this year, and her 14th since taking office.\n\nFORMER DEMOCRAT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE CALLS OUT 'MISTAKE' IN BIDEN'S LETTER TO FELLOW DEMOCRATS\n\nJill Biden, who has notably taken a larger role on the campaign trail, launched Veterans and Military Families for Biden-Harris, a voter outreach group, on Monday in three major states being targeted by the Biden campaign, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida.\n\nShe delivered remarks in each before headlining a Tuesday press call hitting Trump on abortion and Project 2025 ahead of his own event in Doral, Florida.\n\nThe Biden campaign also launched the latest ad as part of its massive $50 million paid media campaign earlier this week, hitting Trump on abortion and Project 2025. Biden has been increasingly vocal in his attacks against Project 2025, which Trump attempted to distance himself from last week.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA source close to the Biden campaign told Fox News Digital that a vigorous schedule will continue into next week and will run counter to the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\n\nBiden has been facing mounting calls from members within his own party to step aside and suspend his re-election campaign following his disastrous debate performance last month. He has been \"incredibly busy working the phones\" and will continue to make calls through this week as he attempts to quell the unrest in his party, a source familiar previously told Fox News Digital.\n\nFox News' Brooke Singman and Chris Pandolfo contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Until then, I had been a wire service reporter and editor in Washington, D.C., and, before that, a sportswriter in Boston, but had never written opinion.\n\nWhen given the chance by the Morning News, I jumped on a subject that had piqued my curiosity: A senator for Delaware running for president had brazenly stolen a speech by a Welsh Labour Party leader in the United Kingdom and, when caught, paid the price by humiliatingly dropping out of the 1988 presidential race.\n\nThe Welsh politician was Neil Kinnock, and 27-year-old me simply used the brouhaha over the purloined speech as an excuse to praise him for daring to tell Labourites that \"socialism had become old hat,\" as I put it. Democrats should be stealing that speech, I wrote.\n\nThe senator for Delaware was President Joe Biden. Over the last 37 years since my column was published, I have watched him lie and lie again, sometimes about small things, other times about larger ones, but always with impunity.\n\n>>> The Left's $7 Trillion Lie: Biden Far Outpaces Trump in Racking Up the National Debt\n\nThe media are just as much to blame for Biden's habitual dishonesty because instead of covering him, they've covered for him.\n\nEven on those rare occasions when the legacy media have acknowledged that Biden is a fabulist, they have made excuses for him. The New York Times, for example, wrote protectively of him in 2022, saying that \"President Biden has been unable to break himself of the habit of embellishing narratives to weave a political identity.\"\n\nIt's not that he's lying, you see. Biden merely adorns reality.\n\nSometimes Biden's fabrications were just so oddball that they made you wonder if he was all there -- even before he started showing signs of senility. An example of this is Biden's insistence that his \"Uncle Bosie\" was eaten by cannibals in Papua New Guinea during World War II. The Defense Department was forced to put out a statement that Ambrose J. Finnegan was lost when his plane crashed in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nBiden has also lied about graduating in the top half of his law school class, having his house \"burn down with my wife in it,\" growing up in the Puerto Rican community, and once being the driver of \"an 18-wheeler\" to name only a handful of falsehoods that reveal a bizarre distance from reality.\n\nHe also habitually lies about former President Donald Trump leaving behind a 9% inflation rate. Inflation was 1.4% in January 2021.\n\nOther times, however, Biden's mendacity reveals a level of pathos that makes you want to look away. A case in point is when he told the mothers of the 13 soldiers killed in Afghanistan because of his ill-conceived pullout in 2021 that he could feel their pain because his son, Beau Biden, had also died in the war.\n\nIt was not the first time. Joe Biden has a history of saying that Beau Biden \"lost his life in Iraq.\" Beau Biden died tragically at the age of 46 in 2015 of cancer at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\n\"We lost our son as well and brought him home in a flag-draped coffin,\" Cheryl Rex said the president told her. Rex later complained at a forum, \"My heart started beating faster, and I started shaking, knowing that their son died from cancer and they were able to be by his side.\"\n\nThe context was Joe Biden's stubborn insistence at the time that he was not culpable for the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal. He was callously using his family's tragedy to buy sympathy. As the Wall Street Journal's Bill McGurn put it, \"Mr. Biden is not a gold star father and should stop playing one on TV.\"\n\n>>> Biden Lied, Your Wallet Died\n\nThis long record of deceitfulness was on display in the president's televised trainwreck of a debate with Trump on June 27, when he again lied about many things, including not having any military deaths during his term in office.\n\n\"I'm the only president this century that doesn't have any, this decade, that doesn't have any troops dying anywhere in the world,\" Joe Biden said at one point, ignoring the 13 body bags from the attack during his Afghanistan withdrawal, again painfully reminding the loved ones of those who died.\n\nJoe Biden also claimed that Trump left him a 15% unemployment rate, that he had been endorsed by the U.S. Border Patrol, and that Trump had told people to inject themselves with bleach during the pandemic. All these things were lies.\n\nIncongruously, post-debate Joe Biden is making truth-telling his badge against his display of precipitous cognitive degeneration. No, he doesn't debate as well as he used to, he angrily spat out at a rally on Friday, but \"I know what I do know -- I know how to tell the truth!\"\n\nAnd the media are there for him, regurgitating the new White House talking points. Joe Biden may be mentally incapacitated, but he's a truth-teller, unlike Trump, they claim.\n\n\"The ex-president got away with a torrent of lies,\" wrote a CNN senior reporter. That phrase is garnering mentions on Google.", "source": {"uri": "heritage.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Heritage Foundation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_gonzalez@heritage.org", "name":

As per an Insider report, multiple sources within the Democratic caucus described the atmosphere after their meetings with President Biden as \"miserable.\" The meetings were intended to rally support and unify the party behind Biden's candidature but instead highlighted growing concerns and discontent among lawmakers.The dissatisfaction stems from various policy disagreements and perceived lack of strong leadership.\n\nSeveral representatives described the atmosphere of the meetings as somber, with one noting it \"felt like a funeral.\" An anonymous House Democrat was quoted saying, \"There is a pervasive sense of frustration. We need clear and decisive leadership to move forward, but that's not what we're experiencing.\"\n\nAnother member remarked, \"The withdrawal of the nominee is just the latest in a series of disappointments. It's hard to stay motivated when we're not seeing the progress we hoped for.\"\n\nMeanwhile, President Biden is set to return to the campaign trail on Wednesday, engaging with a crucial constituency of labor leaders, even as some of his fellow Democrats persist in urging him to reconsider his decision to run for re-election.\n\nOver the past 13 days, the 81-year-old Biden has been working to prevent defections from Democratic lawmakers, donors, and other allies who are concerned about his potential loss to 78-year-old Republican Donald Trump, following his hesitant performance in the June 27 debate.\n\nDemocrats in the US Congress remain deeply divided over whether to support Biden or encourage him to step aside due to ongoing concerns about his health and mental acuity. Biden has asserted that he is fit to serve but acknowledges the validity of the questions.\n\nIn an effort to change the narrative, Biden has surrounded himself with his most loyal supporters, including Black Democratic lawmakers and voters. His campaign has framed continued support for Biden as a reciprocation of the loyalty he has demonstrated throughout his half-century of public service.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

President Biden to step aside on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.'\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden's former press secretary, Michael LaRosa, said Tuesday that President Biden will likely remain adamant about staying in the race despite increasing pressure on him to step down.\n\n\"This is his decision,\" LaRosa said on \"Jesse Watters Primetime\" when asked about speculation that the president's wife was the motivating force behind him refusing to withdraw.\n\nDespite rising pressure on Joe and Jill Biden to convince them to leave the race after the president's rocky debate performance, the first family has repeatedly stated that it will continue to fight.\n\nJILL BIDEN'S FORMER SPOX MAKES REVEALING ADMISSION ABOUT BIDEN CAMPAIGN AHEAD OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE\n\n\"Jill alone won't make this decision,\" LaRosa said. \"I don't know if Democrats really want her to be making the decision for the party.\"\n\n\"I don't think she would want that decision,\" he said. \"I don't think she's comfortable with it.\"\n\nLaRosa said that the president was unlikely to leave the race willingly, explaining that it would \"have to be a pretty compelling case\" to convince Joe to suspend his campaign.\n\n\"She hates politics but she loves him,\" LaRosa said of Joe and Jill's relationship.\n\nJILL BIDEN'S EX-PRESS SECRETARY LAMBASTS TIGHT CONTROL OVER PRESIDENT IN NY TIMES REPORT\n\nAs a result of the president's refusal to leave the race, multiple media outlets, including The Washington Post, have launched pressure campaigns on the Biden family to convince him to step down.\n\nReaders from Pennsylvania, New York, Washington and other states urged Jill Biden to tell her husband to withdraw from the presidential race after his debate performance, in letters published on Friday.\n\n\"We turn to you, Ms. Biden, with our request to urge your husband to end his campaign for the presidency,\" readers and self-described \"Democratic women\" from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, wrote in a letter to The Post.\n\nOne reader, Richard Young, from Lexington, New York, told Jill Biden that he agreed with 72% of registered voters that told CBS that the president is no longer mentally fit to serve as president.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.", "source": {"uri":

He shared how he saw President Joe Biden and his closest circle operate, and offered insight into the conversations they might be having as more of Biden's allies call for him to end his reelection campaign.\n\nConway asked LaRosa if he had noticed a visible decline in the president:\n\nConway: Does anything surprise you over the last couple of weeks, watching Joe Biden in that debate stage and taking a trip down memory lane. Just not even selected clips, this is Joe Biden on the daily. Flubbing, mumbling, stumbling, bumbling, fumbling. I want to feel sorry, but I feel a little angry. I'm a little miffed for so many people in the media, in the Biden White House, on Jill Biden's staff, former colleagues of yours concealing this. They're not upset that Joe Biden is losing it. They're upset that we all know now and we all saw that he's losing it.\n\nLaRosa: So a couple of things, for context. So I haven't been there in about two years. But what I would say is it just wasn't my experience. I've been pretty consistent and I've been critical when I thought it warranted being critical. He did not... I'll just say this: the debate was as jarring and shocking to me as it was for a lot of people. It wasn't my experience when I was there. A lot of the gaffes that we were watching just now, I mean, that's been Joe Biden his entire career. He's always made flubs and gaffes and things like that. So to me, some of the speech vernacular was nothing new and nothing worrisome. There wasn't a doubt in my mind that that Joe Biden was up for the job, that he was cognitively aware and fully in command and control.\n\nShe also asked LaRosa if he thought Biden was going to stand by his insistence to remain in the race:\n\nConway: You're telling the audience right now that you think Jill and Joe Biden are going to dig in. He's going to accept that nomination at the Democratic National Convention five weeks from now, and he's going to be the nominee?\n\nLaRosa: What happens five weeks from now, I do not know. But I do know in the short term that it is going to have to take a lot more than blind quotes and five members of Congress to push them out. It's just not going to happen.\n\nLaRosa was asked by Conway whether it was the First Lady keeping her husband in the race:", "source": {"uri": "mediaite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mediaite"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kellyanne_Conway", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kellyanne Conway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.mediaite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/conway-larosa.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716125", "eventUri": "eng-9716125", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1}

Fox News host Jesse Watters pressed Larosa on Jill Biden's role in keeping President Joe Biden on the Democratic ticket.\n\n\"Tell me a little bit about Dr. Jill. We don't know her the way you know Dr. Jill. She apparently is telling Joe, 'Stay in,' and isn't listening to the press or anyone at all. Why?\" Watters asked.\n\nBiden quit his 1988 presidential campaign after reports surfaced in Sept. 1987 that he plagiarized a speech by British Opposition and Labour Party Leader Neil Kinnock. Larosa told Watters that the plagiarism scandal was \"scarring\" and a \"huge learning lesson\" for both Bidens.\n\n\"So, one thing that was so interesting about the George Stephanopoulos interview when he said that if, if we lose, he would have given it his all. And you've got a lot of flak for that, right? It reminded me so much what happened in 87' because as soon as he dropped out that same day, he was going into a hearing to chair the board hearings. And this really was gonna be, like, the next step for political rehab for him. Well, Jill was with him in the anti-room and she heard him say something very similar like, 'Well, at least I can go focus on this hearing now' and she cut him off and took him by the shoulders and just kind of hold by the lapels and said, 'No, you have to go f-ing win. And, uh, because she knew that was sort of the retaliation moment for him,\" Larosa said.\n\n\"And, you know, they were driven from that campaign, and I think they learned a long time ago they were gonna let line quotes or polls or pundits really push them out ever again,\" he continued. \"And I think that, that moment was scarring for them, Jesse. You know, she had never had his character or his integrity attacked before. He had been groomed to run for president for 15 years. He was our next, he was a great rising hope, and the way that campaign ended was pretty devastating for them. But it was a huge learning lesson in sort of political combat. You know, she's from Philly like you, so she likes to fight.\"\n\n\"Yeah, we love to fight. We like to scrap. And we'll just do it for fun. We don't care,\" Watters said. \"Did you hear Michael Moore at the top accuse Dr. Jill Biden of elder abuse? What would Dr. Jill say to that?\" (RELATED: Where The Hell Is It?': Jill Biden's Fmr Press Sec Rages At Ex-Biden Official For 'Gaslighting' Supporters, Media)\n\n\"What she would say is that she hates politics, but she loves him,\" Larosa responded. \"And he never got in the way of her career, she wasn't gonna get in the way of his. They just never did that with their, both of their aspirations. It just wasn't, it's not a 'Leave It to Beaver' 1950s ro -- you know, comedy for that. They're pretty independent. They left, they lived independent professional lives outside of each other's shadows.\"\n\n\"So, she would never... she would probably not -- this is his decision, you know? She, Jill and the advisors and his sister and his family are probably there and giving advice. But Jill alone won't make this decision, and I don't know if Democrats really want her to be making the decision for the party. And I don't think she would want that decision. I don't think she's comfortable with it,\" Larosa told Watters.\n\nBiden repeatedly reiterated his intent to continue his 2024 re-election bid in multiple post-debate interviews, including one with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos, MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" and two black radio hosts from Milwaukee and Philadelphia. Jill Biden hit the road to campaign for Biden in three different states on Monday, where she assured voters that her husband is \"all in.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailycaller.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Caller"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Watters", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Watters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plagiarism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "1988 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Kinnock", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neil Kinnock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pundit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaslighting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leave_It_to_Beaver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leave It to Beaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Joe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morning Joe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_8928-e1720613679483.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716125", "eventUri": "eng-9716125", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1}

Don't Underestimate Jill Biden's Influence on the President", "body": "President Joe Biden's widely criticized debate performance started a vocal fight within the Democratic Party, with some leaders publicly calling on him to leave the race while others continue to support his candidacy. Biden, meanwhile, has shrunk his circle of influence and declared that only the \"Lord Almighty\" could persuade him to step down.\n\nWith just a month to go before the Democratic National Convention, replacing the top of the ticket would mean moving mountains from a procedural perspective. And who would take his place? According to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll of Democratic voters, former first lady Michelle Obama is the leading - and only - candidate who could beat Donald Trump, though she has said again and again that she is not interested in running. The former first lady also topped a list of Democrats favored by young adults surveyed in a new U.S. News-Generation Lab poll released July 10.\n\nBut history shows that in fact it's the current first lady who almost certainly has the best chance of shaping this race. It's Jill Biden - not former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, not Democratic congressional leaders Hakeem Jeffries or Chuck Schumer, not longtime advisers Ron Klain and Anita Dunn - whom the president listens to when weighing his political future. That should not come as a surprise.\n\nAs my co-authors and I wrote in our book, \"Remember the First Ladies,\" American presidents' wives throughout history have been their most valued political confidantes, using their unique, unfireable position and unlimited access to the president to shape their spouses' personal and political decisions. Much of this influence has been misunderstood or under-reported by the media and in history books.\n\nConsider Eleanor Roosevelt, who persuaded Franklin Delano Roosevelt to stay in politics after he was afflicted with polio. She gave speeches and campaigned in his place, helping to insulate him from voters seeing the realities of his disability. In a close parallel to today, Nancy Reagan grabbed hold of the debate process and accused Ronald Reagan's advisers of over-briefing him after his poor performance in the first debate of the 1984 re-election. In his second term, she exercised control over her husband's schedule and squelched talk that he was showing signs of dementia.\n\nThe most striking example of a first lady's influence, though, is Edith Wilson, whose husband Woodrow suffered a severe stroke late in his second term. Rather than advising him to resign, she kept him going by taking charge of matters of state - an extraordinary overreach, functionally running the executive branch for the remainder of Wilson's second term.\n\nIt is worth noting, however, a different example of a first lady deploying her influence: Lady Bird Johnson advised Lyndon as early as his 1964 campaign not to run for re-election in 1968. History has not damned Johnson for following her advice; even his critics praised his March 1968 speech declaring he would not run again, because it was clear how much he cared about the nation.\n\nJill Biden wrote in her 2019 memoir, \"Where the Light Enters,\" that she, too, had urged her husband not to run in 2004, when his advisers were telling him he should. She recounted walking into the political strategy huddle in a bikini with the word \"NO\" written on her stomach. He listened to her then, and there is little doubt that he is listening to her now; this time, she seems to have his advisers onside, working overtime to shore up congressional support.\n\nJill Biden now faces a dilemma: whether to use her considerable sway with the president to encourage him to stay in the race, or to follow in the footsteps of Lady Bird Johnson and recommend a graceful exit.\n\nThe Bidens' public career is long. They have been through a lot together. Over the past four decades, Jill Biden grew from a family-centered educator and reluctant political spouse to the president's most popular campaign surrogate. She reportedly urged her husband to run again at the beginning of this cycle, and she is apparently advocating for him to stay in the race because of a genuine belief he is the only person who can beat former president Trump.\n\nPolitics is a family affair, and the counsel of Jill Biden, like first ladies before her, cannot be ignored. As first lady Florence Harding famously said, \"I know what's best for the President. I put him in the White House.\"\n\nWhile the world listens to what members of Congress, Democratic Party elites and members of the media are saying about what the president should do, I encourage you to pay most attention to the first lady. It is she who is uniquely positioned to determine the fate of this race.\n\nAnita McBride is director of the First Ladies Initiative at American University, former chief of staff to first lady Laura Bush and one of the longest-serving women in White House history, serving three administrations across the East and West Wings.

She was hitting three different states on Monday.\n\nMy colleague Sister Toldjah wrote earlier about how North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper skipped out on Jill's visit to his state. More cracks in the crumbling Democratic coalition? It doesn't look good.\n\nREAD MORE: More Cracks in Dem Gov. Coalition?

That's the decision he has made... I am all in too.\"\n\nIf he's all in, why isn't he there? Why is she there?

But when she came out, it was clear that the pressure was getting to her. As the reporters tried to ask \"Dr. Biden\" about what she thought about Democrats calling for her husband to step aside. She was not happy.\n\nShe stopped suddenly, turned toward them imperiously, and scolded them for shouting to her.\n\n\"Why are you screaming at me? You know me. Don't scream at me, just let me talk,\" she said.\n\nThen she continued on and it didn't look like she answered the question.\n\nThis is the normal way reporters call out questions, they were not \"screaming.\" But she was treating the reporter the same way she treats her husband -- like a child who needs to be told what to do. How dare they yell at her imperial-ness? She has no idea what to do with an inquiring media.\n\nCan we say how disgusting this woman is?\n\nAnd isn't this the same woman who was really screaming at her audience after she treated her husband like a child?\n\nHere's a little mocking of that.\n\nThe wheels are coming off the bus and she's mad. She can't stop it and she can't control it. And the days of people toadying to her and giving her the attention she craves are likely coming to an end.

Doctor Jill ALL IN On POTATUS Reelection", "body": "I don't expect every First Lady to be adorable, cuddly, or approachable - that's not how human beings are made. All I really ask is that they - hopefully - love their husbands, their families, and this country enough not to mind putting up with the crap that comes with the job. And that they fulfill the duties of their office with gracious pride in doing so, representing these United States as they do.\n\nIt takes a rare person to thrive gracefully in the position, especially these days. And if that wife is by nature a reticent homebody, it's a particularly challenging gig. Or if she's treated as abominably as a certain recent First Lady, whose incredible air of dignity overwhelmed all the petty slings and arrows she suffered and foiled their best efforts to diminish her radiant confidence.\n\nIt takes a rare and phenomenally strong woman to survive such ill use and emerge triumphant.\n\nI get it and have always tried to cut most of our FLOTUSes a huss.\n\nMOST of them.\n\nJill Biden is one of the outliers that I find difficu...forget it. I won't even go that far.\n\nI can't stand her.\n\nBiden's the PTA mother who's never there when volunteers are doing drudge work setting chairs or cleaning up afterward. But she sure can shove everyone out of the way when the local newspaper sends a reporter out for quotes about a successful event. You'd better pray you're not near the stage edge when she spots a camera and microphone, or you are for sure going over as she zeros in on her target.\n\nSome girls just love the limelight.\n\nIf they can't get their own, they attach themselves like barnacles to whatever will draw them closer to something they feel is where they should rightfully be standing.\n\nYou could see it in her face when Joe Biden was forced to withdraw from the presidential race after his multiple exaggerations, lies, and plagiarism bubbled to the surface. As Hunter Thompson called him in a scathing expose, a \"liar, a plagiarist and a dope\" none of which ever changed.\n\nDr. Jill suggested he tell the world he was just \"human\" when asked to explain away his multiple exaggerations, lies, and plagiarisms.\n\nClever girl there. There's no point in completely torpedoing the grifter's chances, so why \"admit\" to something - he was young yet and might have another shot at the golden ring. Be \"human.\"\n\nBut this time, not only was POTATUS still a lying sack of egotistic bravado, Biden was now a cognitively compromised one. A man whose decline had to be hidden from the public at all costs lest they overcome their ingrained and rabid antipathy to the Bad Orange Man long enough to take a second glance at what they were proposing to vote for.\n\nThe Basement Mushroom Campaign was off and running, aided in its subterfuge by the COVID pandemic hysteria and the lovely DR. Jill's buying into selling her already half-baked husband to the country as the guy who would put the adults back in charge.\n\nWe got Dr Jill's husband, her, their derelict son, all his baggage, and the rest of the dysfunctional slag they brought with them.\n\nWe got the Biden version of decency in spades.\n\nThe liberal press went wild over her, almost as if going to make up for four years of stiff-arming an actual supermodel First Lady (who acted with complete class in whatever situation she found herself) had been too much for their tiny Prog brains to bear. Dr. Jill appeared in rags of assorted colors and various dizzying price points, and all were similarly swooned over by the fashionistas and sycophants on the Left. Regardless of how ill-fitting, inappropriate for Jill Biden's age, station, or even the event - when she was wearing whatever the couch cover of the day was, photos and coos fly.\n\nIt was and still is all fashion ambrosia to the press and sweet music to FLOTUS' ears.\n\nIt's an addictive power trip and she worked hard for it.\n\nBiden has gadflied about the country in her husband's stead, speaking - often poorly - as his representative and keeping the progressive troops rallied, even as they keep the barely functioning geriatric in charge of the country as isolated as possible.\n\nNo Dr Jill gaff is too awful to overlook or make excuses for, be it breakfast tacos or repeatedly mangled Spanish.\n\nThe Democratic media and loyalists are mad for her and her for their accolades.\n\nShe IS the FLOTUS, after all and who do we think is keeping Gampie upright?\n\nThat rates a little something extra doesn't it?\n\nI wonder why no one before a White House with Dr Jill inside came up with this idea.\n\nGhastly little ditty - like something that preceded a 1980's British series.\n\nAnd what a shame it went away.\n\nFurther Update: April 13, 2022.\n\nThe U.S. Marine Band has retired \"Fanfare for the First Lady\" from its repertoire, the Washington Examiner has learned. The song was removed quietly following the publication of this article, a source said. One source attributed the decision to pull the composition from rotation to \"negative\" news coverage. We hope the first lady can forgive us for killing her entrance theme.\n\nShe and the crackhead have doubled down on feeding the old man whatever cookies he needs to get through to the finish line and keep them where they both need to be. Hunter for the protection, Jill for the power trip.\n\nThe pressure of the farce and the desperation to maintain the status quo is starting to wear on the ever-gracious Dr. Jill. There are fissures appearing in that facade.\n\nShe'll chalk it up to the pressure of everyone doubting her husband's competence. His fitness for the office he technically holds.\n\nI most often hear Jill Biden compared to Edith Wilson, but that's wrong in my eyes. Her husband was compromised in office and I believe Edith did what she did as much out of love for him as anything else.\n\nJill Biden knows Joe Biden should never have run to begin with.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "beege_welborn@hotair.com", "name": "Beege Welborn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plagiarism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnacle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barnacle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slag", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_S._Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hunter S.

We will continue to fight'.\n\nAnd her determination to keep the drum beating for the 81-year-old candidate has been seized upon by conservatives who are painting her as a Lady Macbeth character.\n\nMegyn Kelly, a former Fox News anchor, called her a \"power-hungry aspirant\" running a \"shadow presidency\", while the Drudge Report declared: \"Cruel Jill clings to power\". Harriet Hageman, a Republican congresswoman for Wyoming, said Jill was guilty of \"elder abuse\" for \"rolling President Biden out on stage to engage in a battle of wits while unarmed\".\n\nEven her first husband, Bill Stevenson, to whom she was married from 1970 to 1975, chimed in, saying: \"I just don't understand why she is so adamant about defending him and keeping him in the race since it appears that he's struggling.\"\n\nIn a TV interview on Monday, Trump speculated: \"I think Jill would like to see him stay, she's having a good time.\"\n\nHowever, in a speech in Wilmington, North Carolina, Jill, 73, painted herself as a supportive wife rather than an ambitious political spouse or someone who had grown accustomed to the trappings of the White House.\n\n\"For all the talk out there about this race, Joe has made it clear that he's all in,\" Jill, who also visited Georgia and Florida, said. \"That's the decision he's made -- and just as he has always supported my career, I am all in too.\"\n\nThose who know her also insist that she has no personal desire for power. Elizabeth Alexander, her communications director, said she sees her role as \"an act of service\" to the nation.\n\nBut many are asking why, as her husband's closest confidante and most trusted sounding board, she does not urge him to drop out, for the sake of his health and his legacy. She has not been shy about confronting Biden's political ambitions in the past.\n\n* Joe Biden's health: how mentally fit is the president?\n\nIn the early years of their relationship -- during which she refused three marriage proposals -- she was famously unenthusiastic about her husband's political aspirations, and she vetoed a presidential run for the 2004 election.\n\nThis time she insists it is different because of what is at stake. \"As commander-in-chief, President Biden wakes up every morning ready to work for you,\" she told a crowd of military veterans and their families in North Carolina, noting how Trump is said to have called those who died in the line of duty \"suckers\" and \"losers\". Trump denies the claim.\n\nShe added: \"Donald Trump wakes up every morning thinking of one person and one person only: himself.\"\n\nIt was a \"business as usual\" approach, but the strain was evident. Normally a relaxed and sunny figure, who takes pride in her calm demeanour, she snapped -- albeit with a smile -- at the journalists demanding her take on her husband's battle for survival.\n\n\"Why are you screaming at me?\" she said, pausing on the tarmac before boarding her plane. \"You know me.

But while Biden in particular could be pushed aside to make way for someone else, they currently exist in a state of political symbiosis. Biden and Trump may hate each other, but each owes much of his political viability to the failures of his opponent.\n\nThe Rattler is a weekly newsletter from JD Tuccille. If you care about government overreach and tangible threats to everyday freedom, this newsletter is for you.\n\nNobody likes them\n\nIn April, an AP-NORC poll found that \"the public generally believes that the presidencies of Joe Biden and Donald Trump have done more harm than good, but each president is viewed negatively on different issues.\" Specifically, about half of respondents said Biden had harmed the United States on the cost of living, immigration, and foreign relations. A similar share said Trump had harmed voting rights, election security, foreign relations, abortion, and climate change.\n\nUnsurprisingly, that same month, Pew Research reported that \"voters have little overall confidence in either candidate on a number of key dimensions, including fitness for office, personal ethics, and respect for democratic values.\" Forty-nine percent of them said they favored replacing Biden and Trump as the major-party presidential nominees.\n\nAs of Tuesday, Trump had an approval rating of 38.6 percent, according to ABC News/FiveThirtyEight (57.9 percent disapproval). That's low, but it's higher than Biden's 37.4 percent (56.8 percent disapproval). These are two political candidates who appear to threaten to be dead weight for their respective political parties, hurting their chances of winning at the polls. But in truth, each has a secret weapon: their much-hated opponent.\n\n\"Biden can probably only win if he runs against a candidate as unpopular as Trump,\" CNN senior reporter Harry Enten said last September. \"Trump can probably only win if he runs against a candidate as unpopular as Biden.\"\n\nParties could do better\n\nPolls confirm the weakness of both men. While Biden is falling further and further behind Trump after a disastrous debate performance that highlighted his cognitive decline, voters narrowly prefer Vice President Kamala Harris over the former president, 42% to 41%, and former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, 43% to 41%, according to a recent Bendixen & Amandi poll.\n\nAlong the same lines, a CBS News/YouGov poll from January showed Trump beating Biden 50% to 48%. But Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis edged Biden 51% to 48%, and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley edged the incumbent 53% to 45%.\n\nVoters from all major parties chose relatively weak candidates, bolstered by equally questionable decisions from their counterparts across the political spectrum.\n\nDisturb the balance\n\nOf course, things have changed in recent weeks, after the presidential debate that was supposed to showcase Joe Biden's dynamism had exactly the opposite effect. The incumbent's jumble of incoherent words and lackluster demeanor have not only raised questions about his ability to campaign for four more years in the White House, but also serious concerns that whoever was making the presidential decisions was not the person behind the podium that night.\n\n\"Even some in the West Wing policy process don't know exactly what policy issues are getting to the president and how,\" Semafor's Ben Smith said, according to an unnamed government official. \"The big decisions are made in an opaque circle that includes White House chief of staff Jeff Zients (who speaks to the president regularly) and the back end is done.\"\n\nThe fallout from that disastrous debate and the sobering interviews that followed have upended the symbiotic political relationship that had balanced Biden's obvious failures with Trump's glaring flaws. National and battleground polls show Donald Trump increasingly ahead of Joe Biden, with averages putting the Republican's national advantage at anywhere from 2% to more than 3%. That has leading Democrats battling over whether Biden should be replaced as the party's standard-bearer heading into the election.\n\nA new candidate without Biden's cognitive deficits and political baggage could well erase Trump's advantage. Voters who have resigned themselves to voting for the Republican candidate simply because he is not Biden might decide differently if Democrats offered another option. That is, they might do so if it were a less bad option.\n\nFor now, the most likely replacement is Vice President Kamala Harris, who would inherit the Biden-Harris campaign apparatus and, more importantly, the money. But despite a slight edge in the Bendixen & Amandi poll, she is not widely liked (37.1% approve, 51.2% disapprove). Harris has a reputation as an authoritarian former prosecutor who mistreated her staff until they resigned en masse, and as an intellectual lightweight who is simply not up to the limited demands of the vice presidency, let alone the White House.\n\nThe candidates who remain in the running?\n\nReplacing Biden with Harris might simply be trading a disabled candidate for one who would have no obvious advantage heading into the race, other than a greater likelihood of living to see Election Day.\n\nFor his part, Biden (or someone acting on his behalf) insists that he is \"firmly committed to staying in the race, to seeing this race through to the end\" and that he \"would not run again if I were not absolutely convinced that I am the best person to beat Donald Trump in 2024.\"\n\nUnless Biden or his entourage changes their minds, it appears he will have a chance to try. With his leadership position in the Republican Party and his lead in the polls, Trump is the GOP's surefire nominee. Regardless of what so many Americans want, the two mutually dependent rivals seem destined to once again present voters with a choice between struggling and unpopular candidates.\n\nOf course, the real problem here is not just the candidates, but the parties and a political system that offer such flawed options to a nation of 330 million people. If the best candidates they can find are viable candidates only because they balance their respective horrors, then a better way to screen potential candidates needs to be found, as well as broader access to the ballot for potential candidates.\n\nTo this day, we are stuck with options that few people want. May the least terrible choice, if there is one, prevail.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

We observed more churn between those who favored either Biden or Trump and the \"Other\" category.\n\nAbout 4% of Biden's and 6% of Trump's supporters in the earlier wave shifted to \"Other\" post-debate. At the same time, 6% of \"Other\" shifted to Biden, and another 6% shifted to Trump.\"\n\nTherefore, there really isn't any statistical support for the claim that voters have abandoned Joe Biden or that there's some urgent need for Democrats to replace their nominee.\n\nThere are a bunch of very rich white men in positions of privilege still calling for Joe Biden to drop out, and they need to zip it all up.\n\nRob Reiner, Stephens Colbert and King, George Clooney, and other rich white dudes who won't be impacted by Project 2025 at all are calling for Joe Biden--again, the most successful President since the 1960's--to step down and be replaced by *checks notes* nobody with a track record like his.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump not only had yet another unhinged meltdown last night in Florida, he's having another one at Mar-A-Lago as I write this. NO ONE is talking about his disastrous rally or the Epstein Files (except a few House Democrats).\n\nSo please, stop helping the MSM help Trump, and help us keep our freedom instead of just letting fascists take over because Joe Biden had one bad night.", "source": {"uri": "hillreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HillReporter.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tara_dublin@hillreporter.com", "name": "Tara Dublin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Rochester", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Rochester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northeastern University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutgers_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rutgers University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Reiner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Reiner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Colbert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Colbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fascism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Communication", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Communication", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Student", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Student", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Astronomy,_Alternative", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Astronomy, Alternative", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Shift_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Shift Work", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://hillreporter.com/fp/static/_d_3274457d-8b27-48a3-a865-09ce625dcb77.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716125", "eventUri": "eng-9716125", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 458365380, "relevance": 2}

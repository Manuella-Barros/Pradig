Batten Down with jockey Junior Alvarado was an 8-1 favorite to win the Ohio Derby, but led the entire 1 and 1/8 mile race from start to finish to win the $300,000 first-place prize. Batten Down won the Ohio Derby with a time of 1:50.20. Trainer William Mott labeled Batten Down as a \u201clate developer -- who\u2019s finally getting his act together.\u201d Mott, who has never had a horse win the Ohio Derby, stated that his strength and aggressiveness have improved in workouts leading up to the derby. Jockey Junior Alvarado believes that Batten Down has a big upside. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of talent, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s figured out how to use it, but we\u2019ve been working with him, and he showed that he has a lot of talent,\u201d stated Alvarado. Alvarado believed Batten Down was not phased by the high temperature at race time and \u201cwas as cool as a cucumber.\u201d Favored horse Catching Freedom finished in fourth place. Gould\u2019s Gold trained by Kentucky Derby-winning trainer Kenneth McPeek finished in second place. Copper Tax finished in third place.

{"id": 243298550, "title": "Flames select Matvei Gridin at No. 28 overall in NHL Draft", "text": "BIG SHOT Gridin won the USHL\u2019s scoring title this past season, notching 38 goals and 83 points in 60 outings with the Muskegon Lumberjacks. His stat-sheet included 10 tallies on the power-play, and seven that stood as game-winners. Scouts seem to agree that his wicked shot is among his best attributes. It could get even better as he adds some muscle to his 6-foot-1, 185-pound frame.

He\u2019ll need time to mature, but the hope is he\u2019ll eventually join a cast of wingmen in Calgary that includes Matt Coronato, Sam Honzek, Jakob Pelletier, Martin Pospisil and Connor Zary. All of those guys are 24-and-under.", "summary": "The Calgary Flames clearly believe that Matvei Gridin will be worth the wait. And they weren\u2019t willing to wait to find out if the winger would still be available in the second round of the 2024 NHL Draft. The Flames selected Gridin at No. 28 overall, a bit of surprise since many analysts and mock-drafters [&#8230;]", "url": "https://calgaryherald.com/sports/hockey/nhl/calgary-flames/flames-select-matvei-gridin-at-no-28-overall", "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/calgaryherald/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cp172520163.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 03:16:43", "author": "Wes Gilbertson", "authors": ["Wes Gilbertson"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": 0.179}

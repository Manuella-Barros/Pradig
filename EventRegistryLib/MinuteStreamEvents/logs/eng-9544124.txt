With more than 7% of the U.S. adult population, 4% of the Canadian adult population and 20% of persons in the U.S. ages 18-25 who are LGBTQI+, there is a critical need to train health care professionals on their specific healthcare needs. LGBTQI+ people experience a higher prevalence of tobacco, alcohol, substance use, and mental health concerns like anxiety, depression and suicidality, as well as elevated cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality.\n\nThe Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) recommends core competencies regarding LGBTQI+ health-related content. Researchers at Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine and Boston Medical Center (BMC), report time dedicated to these topics did increase in 2022, as compared to a study done in 2011; but they also found the breadth, efficacy, or quality of instruction continues to vary substantially.\n\n\"Despite the increased hours, the numbers still fall short based on recommended LGBTQI+ health competencies from the AAMC,\" says lead author Carl G. Streed, MD, MPH, FACP, FAHA, associated professor of medicine at the school. \"While most deans of medical education reported their institutions' coverage of LGBTQI+ health as 'fair,' 'good,' or 'very good,' there continues to be a call from UME leadership to increase curricular content.

However, the number of hours in the required curriculum, as well as number of LGBTQI+ health-related topics covered, remained varied from school to school.\n\nAccording to the researchers, gaps in UME curricula and outcomes are well documented and persist in the face of calls to action. \"Consequently, student comfort with caring for LGBTQI+ populations has lagged. Similar gaps in knowledge and comfort have been reported internationally. These results are contemporary with our findings, suggesting that even a median of 11 hours of LGBTQI+ content is insufficient,\" explains Streed, who also is research lead of the GenderCare Center at BMC.\n\nStreed believes that successful incorporation of LGBTQI+ health into UME requires thoughtfully developed LGBTQI+ health competencies and objectives with appropriate instructional methods and assessments to ensure mastery. \"While the optimal solution to improving LGBTQI+ training is likely institution- and context-dependent, without a mandate from governing bodies such as the AAMC we will continue to see a dearth of physicians prepared to care for these populations.

This made Dominica the sixth country in the Commonwealth Caribbean - and the fourth in the Eastern Caribbean - to decriminalise same-sex relations through the courts, and the first in 2024.\n\nSimilar decisions were made in Antigua and Barbuda, St Kitts and Nevis and Barbados in 2022 - but progress then threatened to stall. Change in Dominica revives the hopes of LGBTQI+ activists in the five remaining English-speaking Caribbean states - Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, St Lucia and St Vincent and the Grenadines - that still criminalise same-sex relations. Sooner than later, one of will be next. A small island has made a big difference.\n\nThe criminalisation of consensual gay sex in the Anglophone Caribbean dates back to the British colonial era. All former British colonies in the region inherited identical criminal laws against homosexuality targeting either LGBTQI+ people in general or gay men in particular. They typically retained them after independence and through subsequent criminal law reforms.\n\nThat's what happened in Dominica, which became independent in 1978. Its 1998 Sexual Offences Act retained criminal provisions dating back to the 1860s. Section 16 of that law made sex between adult men, described as 'buggery', punishable with up to 10 years' imprisonment and possible compulsory psychiatric confinement.\n\nThe offence listed in section 14, 'gross indecency', was initially punishable by up to five years in jail if committed by two same-sex adults. A 2016 amendment increased the penalty to 12 years.\n\nAs in other Caribbean countries with similar provisions, prosecutions for these crimes have been rare in recent decades, and have never resulted in a conviction. But they've been effective in stigmatising LGBTQI+ people, legitimising social prejudice and hate speech, enabling violence, including by police, obstructing access to essential social services, particularly healthcare, and denying people the full protection of the law.\n\nChange has begun only in the past decade, but it's been rapid. Bans on same-sex relations were overturned by the courts in Belize in 2016 and Trinidad and Tobago in 2018. More soon followed.\n\nThe legal case\n\nIn July 2019, an unnamed gay man identified as 'BG' filed a legal case challenging sections 14 and 16 of the Sexual Offences Act. The defendants named in the complaint were the Attorney General, the Bishop of Dominica's capital Roseau, the Anglican Church and the Methodist Church. The Dominica Association of Evangelical Churches was also listed as an interested party.\n\nThe lawsuit was supported by Minority Rights Dominica (MiRiDom), the country's main LGBTQI+ advocacy group, and three international allies: the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network, the University of Toronto's International Human Rights Program and Lawyers Without Borders. The law was challenged as discriminatory and an enabler of violence against LGBTQI+ people.\n\nThe High Court heard the case in September 2022, and on 22 April 2024, Justice Kimberly Cenac-Phulgence issued a ruling setting out the reasons why sections 14 and 16 violated the applicant's constitutional rights to liberty, freedom of expression and privacy, and were therefore null and void.\n\nThe backlash\n\nLGBTQI+ advocates around the world welcomed the court ruling, as did UNAIDS - the United Nations agency leading the global effort to end HIV/AIDS. But resistance wasn't long in coming.\n\nReligious institutions, which hold a lot of influence in Dominica, were quick to decry gains in LGBTQI+ rights as losses in moral values. The day after the ruling was announced, Dominica's Catholic Church published a statement reaffirming its position that sex should only take place within a heterosexual marriage and, while expressing compassion towards LGBTQI+ people, reiterated its belief in the centrality of traditional marriage and family. The Seventh-day Adventists expressed alarm about the potential of the court ruling to lead to same-sex unions and marriages. Some faith leaders voiced outright bigoty, with one prominent figure calling sexual acts between persons of the same sex an 'abomination'.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nHaving decriminalised same-sex relations, Dominica is now ranked 116th out of 198 countries on Equaldex's Equality Index, which rates countries according to their LGBTQI+ friendliness. There's clearly much work to be done. Outstanding issues include protection against discrimination in employment and housing, marriage equality and adoption rights. LGBTQI+ activists will also continue to push for the recognition of non-binary genders, the legalisation of gender change and the prohibition of conversion therapy.\n\nThe Equality Index makes clear that, as in all the Caribbean countries that have recently decriminalised same-sex relations, changes to laws remain far ahead of social attitudes, with considerable public homophobia. As the instant conservative reactions to the court ruling suggest, changing laws and policies isn't nearly enough. Shifting social attitudes must now be a top priority.\n\nDominican LGBTQI+ activists know this, which is why they've been working to challenge prejudice and foster understanding since long before launching their legal challenge - and why they see the court victory as not the end of a journey but a stepping stone to further change.\n\nThe challenge for Dominica's LGBTQI+ civil society is to replace the vicious circle of legal prohibition, which has reinforced social stigma, with a virtuous one in which legal progress normalises the presence and social acceptance of LGBTQI+ people, which in turn enables effective access to legally enshrined rights.\n\nBut they'll take heart from being part of a broader regional and global trend. While working to ensure rights are realised domestically, they'll also offer a powerful example that change can result to the circa 64 countries around the world that still criminalise gay sex, including the five holdouts in the Commonwealth Caribbean. More progress will come.", "source": {"uri": "ipsnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "IPS Inter Press Service - Global News Agency"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Kgobe says South Africa's constitution protects her right to transition.\n\n\"When I started with my transitioning, I remember I had to undergo consultations with local healthcare practitioners... none of them were equipped with that and most of them didn't even know what I was looking for people to say.\"\n\nKgobe says her work in the field of human rights advocacy has exposed her to information regarding organisations that provide services for transgender individuals.\n\n\"I generally feel that there has been so much support because there are organisations on the ground in our country that are advocating for transgender people to be able to access quality healthcare services and this includes hormonal replacement treatment and gender reassignment surgery.\"\n\nLGBTQI+ South Africans continue to celebrate the achievements that have been made. However, stigma, violence, bureaucracy and high rates of HIV continue to be a hurdle, particularly those outside major cities and towns.\n\nKgobe highlights the difficulties she is facing to get a new Identity Document that identifies her as a woman.\n\n\"Home Affairs issue on legal gender recognition where you'd have to go and properly change your name or even the gender marker is a problem. I have applied for mine a year ago, I haven't even received a communique from Home Affairs regarding the progress of the ID. I wouldn't register to vote because I felt like I'm going to face gender dysphoria. People would see me, but this is a guy and you look like a woman, whose ID is this? I always want to avoid anything that has to do with providing my legal documents because I'll be asked a lot of uncomfortable questions. It's still a challenge when it comes to gender recognition.\"\n\nThe freedom enjoyed by LGBTQI+ people in larger cities has been visible in South Africa through gay parades whereas in rural areas there is a lot of homophobia and other forms of discrimination.\n\nAdvocate Mpho Nefuri is also a thriving businesswoman who is supported by her family, children and wife of many years. She handles cases of individuals who've been discriminated against based on their sex, gender and sexual orientation. She adds that there are gaps when it comes to educating the population in rural areas.\n\n\"I am well conversant with the constitution but what happens with my grandmother, does she understand the core values of equality, do they understand that we are equal? What happens to the patriarchal system which has been endorsed by them from their youth up until now?\"\n\nSouth Africa has widely accepted the LGBTQI+ acronym, which now includes the plus symbol, which represents the diverse genders and sexual identities. Nefuri says people should have the right to choose their own identity and sexuality.\n\n\"I just hope and pray that young people will be able to open their eyes and irrespective of their sexual orientation, be able to understand where this political organisation is taking them but at this point in time we also have independent candidates where they will be able to say okay my name is Mpho, this is what I stand for I am going to canvass and push for the rights of LGBTQI+ this is the manifesto, this is what we want to achieve.\"\n\n\"The LGBTQI+ community in South Africa enjoys constitutional and statutory protection from discrimination.

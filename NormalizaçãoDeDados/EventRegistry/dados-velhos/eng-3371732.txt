Earlier this year, after several months of rumors and reporting, one of Australia's leading banks, the Macquarie Group, agreed to acquire the GIB for \u00a32.3 billion and committed to the GIB's established target of driving \u00a33 billion in new green energy investments.\n\nThis week, the Macquarie-led consortium behind the acquisition -- comprising Macquarie Group Limited (Macquarie), Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund 5 (MEIF5) and Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) -- successfully completed the acquisition of the GIB for the agreed upon sum of \u00a32.3 billion from the UK government.\n\nThe \u00a32.3 billion price tag ensures that all the UK taxpayer funding that was invested into the GIB since its creation back in 2012 has now been returned with a gain of approximately \u00a3186 million.\n\n\"We led the world in setting up the Green Investment Bank and it is now being copied by others,\" said Climate Change and Industry Minister Claire Perry. \"Now that it's in the private sector, it will be able to operate on an international level to tackle the global challenge of climate change. It is also perfectly placed to help us finance green initiatives for our Clean Growth Plan and realise the commitments set out in the Paris Agreement.\"\n\nMacquarie intends to ensure the GIB remains one of the leading investors in UK and Europe green infrastructure but is also looking to expand internationally.\n\n\"Combined with Macquarie's resources as the world's largest infrastructure investor, the Green Investment Group will be uniquely placed to continue in its pioneering role in the world's transition to a low-carbon economy,\" explained Daniel Wong, Head of Macquarie Capital Europe. \"We look forward to growing the Green Investment Group's capacity and its contribution to the UK and global renewables markets.\"\n\n\"Today marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter for the Green Investment Bank,\" added Lord Smith of Kelvin, Chair of the Green Investment Bank up to the completion of the transaction.\n\n\"Under Macquarie ownership, the business will have the support it needs to deliver a growing green impact, at home in the UK and now abroad.\"\n\n\"I'm confident that with this support the Green Investment Bank, nurtured so well through its early years by the UK Government, will go on to bigger and better things.\n\n\"If the Paris Agreement is to be delivered we need to see mature green infrastructure delivered quickly and at scale, alongside the rapid development of emerging technologies. To achieve this the world needs committed, innovative, specialist, experienced investors with access to deep and flexible pools of capital.

controversial deal\n\nGet Daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email\n\nThe UK Government has officially transferred ownership of the Green Investment Bank (GIB) to its new private sector owners.\n\nThe controversial \u00a32.3 billion sale of the Edinburgh-headquartered bank was agreed with a consortium led by Australian bank Macquarie in April.\n\nMacquarie's consortium, which includes Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund 5 (MEIF5) and Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), put up \u00a31.7 billion to buy the bank as well as assuming \u00a3600 million in liabilities in the UK-based Universities Superannuation Scheme for university professors.\n\nThe government will retain a 'Special Share' in GIB to protect its \"green purposes\", which will be managed by a new company, Green Purposes Company Ltd (GPC).\n\nMacquarie announced the completion of the sale on Friday in which it also announced the bank's name would be changed to Green Investment Group, a name change it says is necessary to \"overcome the legal and regulatory barriers to using the term\"Bank\" in many international markets\".\n\nUnder the terms of the sale, GIB's Edinburgh and London offices will be maintained with a new asset management office to be established in Edinburgh.\n\nGreen Investment Group will be led by Edward Northam, GIB's head of investment banking.\n\nShaun Kingsbury will step down as chief executive and will not join the Macquarie Group.\n\nDaniel Wong, head of Macquarie Capital Europe, said: \"Combined with Macquarie's resources as the world's largest infrastructure investor, the Green Investment Group will be uniquely placed to continue in its pioneering role in the world's transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n\"We look forward to growing the Green Investment Group's capacity and its contribution to the UK and global renewables markets.\"\n\nThe GIB was launched in November 2012 with \u00a33 billion of public money after being granted state aid permission from the European Commission.\n\nPlans to sell the bank were initially outlined in June 2015 when the government hired Bank of America Merrill Lynch to advise on the sale.\n\nThe think-tank E3G, which developed the concept for the Green Investment Bank, described the Government's move to sell as \"completely reckless\".\n\nE3G chief executive Nick Mabey warned privatisation of the bank threatens to \"destroy investor confidence, which in turn will damage both energy security and the UK economy\".\n\nThe Green Investment Bank reported a pre-tax profit of of \u00a3100,000 for the 2014/15 financial year, largely as a result of a \u00a33 million pre-tax profit booked for the second half of the year.\n\nThe bank had booked a \u00a35.7 million loss for the 2013/14 financial year, which GIB chief executive Shaun Kingsbury said was down to a number of projects still in the construction phase.\n\nKingsbury had forecast in the 2014/15 results the banks' investments \"should deliver a return for the taxpayer of eight per cent a year\".\n\nThe UK Government noted on the launch of the sale process last year, GIB had committed \u00a32.6 billion of capital to almost 70 green infrastructure projects across the UK since its launch \"helped mobilise a total of \u00a310.6 billion of investment\".\n\nLord Smith of Kelvin, chair of the Green Investment Bank up to the completion of the transaction, said: \"Today marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter for the Green Investment Bank.\n\n\"Under Macquarie ownership, the business will have the support it needs to deliver a growing green impact, at home in the UK and now abroad.\"\n\n\"I'm confident that with this support the Green Investment Bank, nurtured so well through its early years by the UK Government, will go on to bigger and better things.\"\n\nLord Smith added: \"If the Paris Agreement is to be delivered we need to see mature green infrastructure delivered quickly and at scale, alongside the rapid development of emerging technologies.\n\n\"To achieve this the world needs committed, innovative, specialist, experienced investors with access to deep and flexible pools of capital.\n\n\"The Green Investment Group will now have the platform to meet that market need and fulfil its full potential.\"\n\nRead

The consortium also includes Macquarie's in-house infrastructure fund and the Universities Superannuation Scheme, a pension fund for British higher education institutions.\n\nSir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrats leader, who started the bank as business secretary when in coalition with David Cameron's Conservatives, said the deal was \"a sad day for environment and green investment in the UK\" and that he had \"little confidence that new private owners have a green mission\".\n\nCable previously suggested the sale could be the \"final nail in the coffin\" for green Conservatism, when writing in the Guardian earlier this year before Macquarie was selected as the government's preferred buyer in April.\n\nThe government said the \u00a32.3bn deal ensured that all the taxpayer funding invested in the GIB since its creation, including set-up costs, would be returned with a gain of approximately \u00a3186m. Macquarie said it wanted the bank to \"remain one of the leading investors in green infrastructure in the UK and Europe, with added scope to further expand internationally\".\n\nThe government said Macquarie had committed to the GIB's target of lending \u00a33bn of investment in green energy projects over the next three years. \"Now that it's in the private sector, it will be able to operate on an international level to tackle the global challenge of climate change,\" said the climate change minister, Claire Perry.\n\nHowever, the privatisation leaves Britain without a key vehicle for supporting green projects, while fears have been raised that the bank could be broken up once taken into private hands. Concerns over Macquarie's intentions for the bank and criticism of the government's commitment to the environment have lingered since the deal was first announced.\n\n\"The government was repeatedly warned that selling the GIB to Macquarie could result in asset stripping and leave the bank unfit for purpose,\" said the Green party co-leader Jonathan Bartley. He said the completion of the sale was \"disastrous news for everyone who cares about the future of renewable energy\" and criticised the government for \"flogging off our future security to the highest bidder\".\n\nMinisters helped create a \"special share\" in the GIB to be held by a company with five independent trustees, who have the power to approve or reject any changes to the GIB's green purposes in the future, in an effort to allay fears over the bank's future involvement in green projects.\n\nThe government said it would continue to hold an interest in a small number of the GIB's existing green infrastructure investments, managed by the bank under its new owners until they can be sold in future.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri":

It has proved its investability.\"\n\n[Native Advertisement]\n\nThe government also insisted that the \u00a32.3bn deal with Macquarie represented a profit on the public money invested in the fund and the Australian bank insisted it would build on the GIB's legacy rather than dismantle it.\n\nMark Dooley, head of energy and infrastructure for Macquarie Capital in Europe, reiterated the pledge made by Macquarie in April to meet the GIB's target to make at least \u00a33bn of new investments over the next three years. While expanding the fund's reach into Europe for the first time, Mr Dooley, who is based in London, said much of the investment would continue to be made in the UK.\n\nLord Robert Smith, who was chairman of the GIB until completion of its privatisation on Friday, said Macquarie would provide a platform to access deeper pools of capital -- supporting global efforts to decarbonise the energy system. \"If the Paris [climate] agreement is to be delivered, we need to see mature green infrastructure delivered quickly and at scale, alongside the rapid development of emerging technologies,\" he

[Department of Energy and Climate Change/Flickr]\n\nBritain's green credentials were called into question on Friday (18 August) after the government announced it had completed the sale of the state-owned Green Investment Bank (GIB) to Australian investors Macquarie Group Limited.\n\nThe Edinburgh-based GIB, which will now change its name to the Green Investment Group, fetched \u00a32.3bn (\u20ac2.5bn), returning the full public investment and set-up costs plus around \u00a3186m (\u20ac204m).\n\nBut critics were not convinced that this amounts to a good deal for British taxpayers, or that the bank will be able to continue its mission under the new ownership.\n\nFounded in 2012 to speed up the UK's transition away from fossil fuels, the GIB has made significant investments in renewable energy and green infrastructure, such as smart metres and low-carbon transport systems. The bank began making a profit in 2016 and its future returns were projected to consistently reach 10%.\n\nA dubious record\n\nWestminster argues that the bank needed to become private to give it the freedom to operate on an international level and have insisted that this will make it better placed to ensure the UK reaches its Paris Agreement climate targets.\n\n\"The government has sneakily flogged off the Green Investment Bank under cover of the Parliamentary recess,\" Green MEP Molly Scott-Cato said on Friday. \"This underhand move is deeply irresponsible and shows contempt towards tackling climate change, one of the biggest challenges the world faces.\"\n\nEarly indications that the GIB's new owners intend to restructure the bank's assets and sell off some of its earliest investments have raised eyebrows, although the government insists it received assurances against asset stripping.\n\n\"The Macquarie Group, which will now operate the Green Investment Bank under a new guise, has a worrying and dubious track record of asset stripping and also has dismal environmental credentials,\" Scott-Cato added.\n\nNot on the right track\n\nA study published by the UCL Energy Institute in March 2017 warned that Britain would miss its target of an 80% reduction in annual CO2 emissions by 2050 unless it cuts emissions faster than currently planned.\n\nBut for Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable, Friday's sale \"does not inspire confidence\".\n\nCable, who was in the government when the GIB was founded in 2012, told the BBC the bank was doing good business and had \"managed to attract over \u00a310 billion (\u20ac11bn) of private investment [...] that would not otherwise have happened\".\n\nOver the last two-and-a-half decades Macquarie Group has invested billions of dollars in oil and gas exploration, as well as pipeline development and coal mining.\n\n\"This sale further jeopardises our chances of meeting our commitments under the Paris Agreement on climate change.

Instead, the technology will complement educators and help them deliver more impactful learning experiences,\" said prominent AI researcher and trainer Yasmine Al Rawi.\n\nIn the session moderated by Dr. Mania Suwaid, Al Rawi drew an inspiring parallel with Alan Turing, the British mathematician whose work during WWII involved breaking the Enigma cipher, to illustrate the groundbreaking impacts of AI.\n\n\"Schools are not just for academic training but are arenas for developing soft skills and creativity. Our educational institutions should embed futuristic technologies in their everyday work to improve efficiencies. A teacher in a class of 30 may not be able to give equal attention to all students, but if we have AI-aided applications that can monitor students' emotional responses while doing assignments and provide real-time assessment, it could be a game changer\", she opined.\n\n\"This kind of technology could enable educators to better understand students' struggles or ease with assignments, enhancing their ability to offer support even without direct supervision,\" Al Rawi further noted.\n\nDiscussing the need for responsible integration of AI in educational settings, Al Rawi pointed out the critical role of parents and teachers in instilling values in children.

Instead, the technology will complement educators and help them deliver more impactful learning experiences,\" said prominent AI researcher and trainer Yasmine Al Rawi.\n\nIn the session moderated by Dr. Mania Suwaid, Al Rawi drew an inspiring parallel with Alan Turing, the British mathematician whose work during WWII involved breaking the Enigma cipher, to illustrate the groundbreaking impacts of AI.\n\n\"Schools are not just for academic training but are arenas for developing soft skills and creativity. Our educational institutions should embed futuristic technologies in their everyday work to improve efficiencies.

She likened AI's introduction to past technological advances, such as television and the internet, and said, \"The focus should be on guiding children to use these tools responsibly and ethically.\"\n\nAl Rawi also mentioned Futurepedia, a platform showcasing the latest AI tools from picture-to-text and text-to-video conversions to natural language processing, which can assist teachers in creating innovative lesson plans for grades 1 through 12.

As an alternative, technology will support educators in their efforts to provide more meaningful learning opportunities, according to eminent AI researcher and trainer Yasmine Al Rawi.\n\nAl Rawi illustrated the revolutionary effects of artificial intelligence (AI) in a session led by Dr. Mania Suwaid by drawing an encouraging comparison with British mathematician Alan Turing, whose work during World War II involved cracking the Enigma cipher.\n\n\"Schools serve as spaces for the development of soft skills and creativity in addition to academic instruction. To increase productivity, our educational institutions ought to incorporate cutting-edge technologies into their daily operations. A teacher teaching a class of thirty students might not be able to offer each student equal attention, but she thought that \"it could be a game changer if we have AI-aided applications that can monitor students' emotional responses while doing assignments and provide real-time assessment.\"\n\n\"Technology of this kind could help teachers better understand students' difficulties or level of ease with assignments, improving their capacity to provide support even in the absence of direct supervision,\" Al Rawi added.\n\nAl Rawi emphasized the vital role that parents and teachers play in establishing values in children while talking about the necessity of integrating AI responsibly in educational settings. \"The focus should be on guiding children to use these tools responsibly and ethically,\" she said, drawing a comparison between the advent of AI and earlier technological advancements like television and the internet.\n\nAl Rawi also brought up Futurepedia, a website that features the newest artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, such as natural language processing and picture-to-text and text-to-video conversions, to help teachers create engaging lesson plans for students in grades 1 through 12. She also mentioned the existence of innovation hubs in Sharjah, such as the Sharjah Entrepreneurship Center (Sheraa), which help with the growth of fresh concepts and start-ups, including possible fintech ventures.\n\nThe UAE's wider adoption of AI demonstrates the country's dedication to utilizing cutting-edge technology, as seen by the Ministry of Interior's smart police efforts and general government operations. \"AI is essential for society's protection as well as the education sector,\" she said in closing.\n\nThe 15th Sharjah Children's Reading Festival is taking place at Expo Centre Sharjah until May 12 and offers a variety of events and discussions that are sure to interest and amuse both children and adults.

Instead, the technology will complement educators and help them deliver more impactful learning experiences,\" said prominent AI researcher and trainer Yasmine Al Rawi.\n\nIn the session moderated by Dr. Mania Suwaid, Al Rawi drew an inspiring parallel with Alan Turing, the British mathematician whose work during WWII involved breaking the Enigma cipher, to illustrate the groundbreaking impacts of AI.\n\n\"Schools are not just for academic training but are arenas for developing soft skills and creativity. Our educational institutions should embed futuristic technologies in their everyday work to improve efficiencies. A teacher in a class of 30 may not be able to give equal attention to all students, but if we have AI-aided applications that can monitor students' emotional responses while doing assignments and provide real-time assessment, it could be a game changer\", she opined.\n\n\"This kind of technology could enable educators to better understand students' struggles or ease with assignments, enhancing their ability to offer support even without direct supervision,\" Al Rawi further noted.\n\nDiscussing the need for responsible integration of AI in educational settings, Al Rawi pointed out the critical role of parents and teachers in instilling values in children. She likened AI's introduction to past technological advances, such as television and the internet, and said, \"The focus should be on guiding children to use these tools responsibly and ethically.\"\n\nAl Rawi also mentioned Futurepedia, a platform showcasing the latest AI tools from picture-to-text and text-to-video conversions to natural language processing, which can assist teachers in creating innovative lesson plans for grades 1 through 12. Furthermore, she noted the existence of innovation hubs such as the Sharjah Entrepreneurship Center (Sheraa) in Sharjah, which support the development of new ideas and startups, including potential startups in sectors like fintech.\n\nThe UAE's broader integration of AI, from smart policing initiatives by the Ministry of Interior to general government operations, illustrates the national commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technology. \"AI is vital not only in the education sector but also in safeguarding society,\" she concluded.\n\nThe 15th edition of the Sharjah Children's Reading Festival is running in Expo Centre Sharjah until May 12 and features a host of activities and talks that promise to engage and entertain kids and grown-ups alike. The latest edition has a strong lineup of authors and experts from varied industries.

Instead, the technology will complement educators and help them deliver more impactful learning experiences,\" Al Rawi explained.\n\nDr. Mania Suwaid, who moderated the session, facilitated a discussion where Al Rawi drew parallels between AI's potential impact and historical technological breakthroughs by individuals like Alan Turing, who helped decrypt the Enigma cipher during WWII. Al Rawi stated, \"Schools are not just for academic training but are arenas for developing soft skills and creativity. Our educational institutions should embed futuristic technologies in their everyday work to improve efficiencies. A teacher in a class of 30 may not be able to give equal attention to all students, but if we have AI-aided applications that can monitor students' emotional responses while doing assignments and provide real-time assessment, it could be a game changer.\"\n\nAl Rawi elaborated on how AI tools could help educators better understand and support students, \"This kind of technology could enable educators to better understand students' struggles or ease with assignments, enhancing their ability to offer support even without direct supervision.\"\n\nThe discussion also touched upon the ethical integration of AI in education, emphasizing the role of parents and teachers in guiding children to use such tools responsibly. Al Rawi likened the introduction of AI in education to the advent of television and the internet, stating, \"The focus should be on guiding children to use these tools responsibly and ethically.\"\n\nAl Rawi also introduced Futurepedia, a platform that demonstrates the latest AI tools ranging from picture-to-text and text-to-video conversions to natural language processing, which could aid teachers in crafting innovative lesson plans for students from grades 1 through 12. Additionally, she highlighted local initiatives like the Sharjah Entrepreneurship Center (Sheraa), which supports innovative startups, including those in education technology.\n\nThis insightful session underscored the UAE's commitment to integrating AI across various sectors, including education, as part of its broader strategy to employ cutting-edge technology in enhancing societal functions.\n\nThe 15th edition of the Sharjah Children's Reading Festival continues at Expo Centre Sharjah until May 12, offering a rich program of activities and talks designed to engage children and adults.\n\nRelated Items:AI in Education, AI Integration, Educational Technology, Exclusive, Future of Education, india, Live India, LIVE INDIA LIVE, Live India News, Personalized Learning, Sharjah Children's Reading Festival Recommended for you Anuj Sharma shares his working experience with Sanjay Leela Bhansali Was a bit nervous during quick loss of wickets : Faf du Plessis RCB Clinches Thrilling Four-Wicket Victory Over Gujarat Titans in IPL 2024", "source": {"uri": "liveindia.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "Live India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharjah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sharjah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sharjah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_and_Leeds_Festivals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reading and Leeds Festivals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Enigma machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alan Turing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Encryption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Educational technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjay_Leela_Bhansali", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sanjay Leela Bhansali"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural language processing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://liveindia.tv/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Sharjah-Childrens-Reading-Festival.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539479", "eventUri": "eng-9539479", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-30", "textStart": 1293, "textEnd": 1299}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-12", "textStart": 2954, "textEnd": 2960}], "sentiment": 0.5450980392156863, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

This initiative reflects the UAE's efforts to protect its cultural heritage on the international level. The inscription of sites on the World Heritage List contribute to their preservation and restoration in accordance with the UNESCO's international standards and helps to highlight these important local destinations to the public.\n\nCommenting on her appointment Sheikha Bodour said: \"I am honored to have been chosen as an ambassador for the World Heritage Nomination of Faya Palaeolandscape, which reflects the rich history of Sharjah as one of the most important Stone Age sites not only in the Arabian Peninsula, but in the world. Faya is home to many archaeological monuments that provide valuable insights into the history of the first human migration, making it a landmark worthy of inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage List. I will make every effort to ensure that the site is inscribed on this prestigious international list to preserve, share, and promote our cultural heritage for future generations.\n\n\"The Faya site allows scholars and interested parties to understand early human evolution and adaptation in the Arabian Peninsula desert. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Sharjah Archaeology Authority and the local community for their efforts in preserving our cultural heritage to share with the world,\" she added.\n\nHis Excellency Eisa Yousef, Director General of Sharjah Archaeology Authority (SAA), commended the nomination of Sheikha Bodour saying: \"The selection of Her Excellency Sheikha Bodour Al Qasimi gives great support to the nomination file, especially given her experience in working with international organizations, her academic interest in archaeology and cultural activities, and her keenness to enrich the archaeological studies of Sharjah, preserving and promoting the many ancient monuments that the emirate has to offer.\"\n\nFaya Palaeolandscape\n\nThe Faya Palaeolandscape is an outstanding example of a Stone Age desert landscape documenting early modern human occupation of the area from the Early Middle Paleolithic to the Neolithic period, during a time of varying climatic conditions in the Arabian Peninsula. The archaeological and palaeoenvironmental findings within the site represent one of the earliest and most continuous stratigraphic records of human occupation of an erratic desert landscape, with the oldest archaeological layer dating back approximately 210,000 years. Discoveries from the site record the evolution process from hunter-gatherer groups to pastoral nomadic herders with funeral practices which have allowed for new insights into human adaptation to their inhabited landscapes in extreme climates.\n\nAccording to scientists, short climatic changes every 20,000 years, made the area fluctuate between an arid desert and a pluvial environment with water gathering in lakes and flowing along the wadi channels. The geomorphological features along Jebel Faya record these processes, helping to uncover the mysteries of this important era in the region's history.\n\nThe extraordinary combination of the availability of water sources, raw material as well as shelters established the Faya Palaeolandscape as one of the earliest inhabited desert landscapes. The Faya Palaeolandscape fills a knowledge gap in the understanding of early human development and adaptation in the desert of the Arabian Peninsula and its habitation even during hyper-arid climatic conditions.\n\nIn February 2023, following a series of studies conducted by SAA in collaboration with experts and academic specialists to assess cultural value, global significance, archeological values, historical value, and conservation status of cultural heritage sites in Sharjah, the SAA inscribed four important cultural sites in Sharjah on UNESCO's World Heritage Tentative List. The properties listed are Mleiha, Late Pre-Islamic Center of a South-East Arabian Kingdom; The Rock Art of the Emirate of Sharjah; Wadi Al Helo: Testimony of Bronze Age Copper Production; and Faya Palaeolandscape.", "source": {"uri": "zawya.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zawya.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharjah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sharjah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sharjah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Heritage Site"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Archaeology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UNESCO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Qasimi", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Al Qasimi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arabian Peninsula"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_heritage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cultural heritage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Desert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excellency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Excellency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Age", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stone Age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Organization for Standardization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sultan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Atomic Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_evolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human evolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emirate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jebel_Faya", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jebel Faya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mleiha", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mleiha"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirate_of_Sharjah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emirate of Sharjah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Emirate of Sharjah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomadic_pastoralism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nomadic pastoralism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society", "label": "dmoz/Society", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Archaeology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Archaeology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://static.zawya.com/view/acePublic/alias/contentid/MWQ2YjE2OTYtMThjZS00/2/1-sheikhabodouralqasimi-jpg.jpeg?f=3%3A2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539479", "eventUri": "eng-9539479", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sharjah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5764705882352941, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

Instead, the technology will complement educators and help them deliver more impactful learning experiences,\" said prominent AI researcher and trainer Yasmine Al Rawi.\n\nIn the session moderated by Dr. Mania Suwaid, Al Rawi drew an inspiring parallel with Alan Turing, the British mathematician whose work during WWII involved breaking the Enigma cipher, to illustrate the groundbreaking impacts of AI.\n\nAlso Read | Press Freedom Index 2024 Rankings: China Among World's 10 Most Dangerous Countries for Media Professionals, Says Report.\n\n\"Schools are not just for academic training but are arenas for developing soft skills and creativity. Our educational institutions should embed futuristic technologies in their everyday work to improve efficiencies. A teacher in a class of 30 may not be able to give equal attention to all students, but if we have AI-aided applications that can monitor students' emotional responses while doing assignments and provide real-time assessment, it could be a game changer\", she opined.\n\n\"This kind of technology could enable educators to better understand students' struggles or ease with assignments, enhancing their ability to offer support even without direct supervision,\" Al Rawi further noted.\n\nDiscussing the need for responsible integration of AI in educational settings, Al Rawi pointed out the critical role of parents and teachers in instilling values in children. She likened AI's introduction to past technological advances, such as television and the internet, and said, \"The focus should be on guiding children to use these tools responsibly and ethically.\"\n\nAl Rawi also mentioned Futurepedia, a platform showcasing the latest AI tools from picture-to-text and text-to-video conversions to natural language processing, which can assist teachers in creating innovative lesson plans for grades 1 through 12. Furthermore, she noted the existence of innovation hubs such as the Sharjah Entrepreneurship Center (Sheraa) in Sharjah, which support the development of new ideas and startups, including potential startups in sectors like fintech.\n\nThe UAE's broader integration of AI, from smart policing initiatives by the Ministry of Interior to general government operations, illustrates the national commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technology. \"AI is vital not only in the education sector but also in safeguarding society,\" she concluded.\n\nThe 15th edition of the Sharjah Children's Reading Festival is running in Expo Centre Sharjah until May 12 and features a host of activities and talks that promise to engage and entertain kids and grown-ups alike.

Instead, the technology will complement educators and help them deliver more impactful learning experiences,\" said prominent AI researcher and trainer Yasmine Al Rawi.\n\nIn the session moderated by Dr. Mania Suwaid, Al Rawi drew an inspiring parallel with Alan Turing, the British mathematician whose work during WWII involved breaking the Enigma cipher, to illustrate the groundbreaking impacts of AI.\n\n\"Schools are not just for academic training but are arenas for developing soft skills and creativity. Our educational institutions should embed futuristic technologies in their everyday work to improve efficiencies. A teacher in a class of 30 may not be able to give equal attention to all students, but if we have AI-aided applications that can monitor students' emotional responses while doing assignments and provide real-time assessment, it could be a game changer\", she opined.\n\n\"This kind of technology could enable educators to better understand students' struggles or ease with assignments, enhancing their ability to offer support even without direct supervision,\" Al Rawi further noted.\n\nDiscussing the need for responsible integration of AI in educational settings, Al Rawi pointed out the critical role of parents and teachers in instilling values in children. She likened AI's introduction to past technological advances, such as television and the internet, and said, \"The focus should be on guiding children to use these tools responsibly and ethically.\"\n\nAl Rawi also mentioned Futurepedia, a platform showcasing the latest AI tools from picture-to-text and text-to-video conversions to natural language processing, which can assist teachers in creating innovative lesson plans for grades 1 through 12. Furthermore, she noted the existence of innovation hubs such as the Sharjah Entrepreneurship Center (Sheraa) in Sharjah, which support the development of new ideas and startups, including potential startups in sectors like fintech.\n\nThe UAE's broader integration of AI, from smart policing initiatives by the Ministry of Interior to general government operations, illustrates the national commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technology. \"AI is vital not only in the education sector but also in safeguarding society,\" she concluded.\n\nThe 15th edition of the Sharjah Children's Reading Festival is running in Expo Centre Sharjah until May 12 and features a host of activities and talks that promise to engage and entertain kids and grown-ups alike. The latest edition has a strong lineup of authors and experts from varied industries.

Dr. Sheikh Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Sharjah, inspected Al Lyyah Water Canal project in Sharjah, on Monday. The project spans 800 metres and aims to increase the flow of water from the Arabian Gulf to Khalid Lake.\n\nThe Sharjah Ruler reviewed the project's timeline, which showcased the steps of its implementation including two main bridges, a water canal, a breakwater, and a promenade.\n\nThe project, which commenced in January 2023, involves excavation work, bridge construction, and Dr. Sheikh Sultan was briefed on the progress and the methods of connecting the current project with adjacent projects such as Al-Alam Island and Khalid Lake.\n\nThe Sharjah Ruler also examined the future plans for the service projects to be established along the water canal. He familiarized himself with the architectural designs used in the project, including the 320-metre-long wave breaker, which will protect the canal walls. Additionally, he learned about the facilities that will serve the area and the water movement from Khalid Lake to the Arabian Gulf.\n\nThe Sharjah Ruler received a detailed explanation of the completion process of the breakwater and the canal tests to ensure the safety of the structures under extreme conditions and hurricanes. The tests proved the effectiveness of the canal and the breakwater in facilitating water flow to the island.\n\nThe upcoming phase of the project involves the construction of a new waterfront characterised by Islamic architecture that aligns with the architectural style of adjacent government entities and Al Jubail Market building, located opposite the canal.\n\nDuring the tour, The Sharjah Ruler was accompanied by Abdul Rahman bin Mohammad bin Nasser Al Owais, Minister of Health and Prevention; Youssef Khamees Al Othmani, Chairman of the Roads and Transport Authority; and Dr. Salah Butti Al Muhairi, Chairman of the Initiatives Implementation Authority.", "source": {"uri": "zawya.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zawya.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharjah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sharjah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sharjah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalid_of_Saudi_Arabia", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Khalid of Saudi Arabia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan_bin_Muhammad_Al-Qasimi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sultan bin Muhammad Al-Qasimi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakwater_(structure)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breakwater (structure)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esplanade", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Esplanade"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Gulf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Persian Gulf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sultan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_(Denmark)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Health (Denmark)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roads_and_Transport_Authority_(Dubai)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roads and Transport Authority (Dubai)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_architecture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic architecture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gamal Abdel Nasser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salah", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jubail", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jubail"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jubail"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Canals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Canals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Dentistry/Endodontics", "label": "dmoz/Health/Dentistry/Endodontics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 49}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539479", "eventUri": "eng-9539479", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

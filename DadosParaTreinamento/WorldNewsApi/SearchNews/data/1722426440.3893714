{"id": 243352832, "title": "Your Sky TV box just got a surprise upgrade and here's how to unlock it for free", "text": "You might be surprised to know that your Sky box isn't just about watching TV. Thanks to the launch of a new app on all of Sky's devices, there's now the option to get up off the sofa and do some exercise. The Mvmnt fitness service has actually been available via Sky Live (an accessory exclusively for Sky Glass TVs) since last year but now it's spreading its wings and landing on Sky Q and Sky Stream boxes. Sky Glass users who haven't signed up for the Sky Live camera can also now access it as well. This heart-pumping platform offers a swathe of fitness classes such as Pilates, strength training, cardio, meditation and yoga. A trainer takes you through each class and there are different levels depending on your current fitness. You can even do a quick 5-minute routine if you are running short on time. Of course, everything is shown on your TV so you don't have to race to the gym or feel intimated by Love Island wannabes surrounding you on the treadmill. The only main difference between using your Sky Q box and having Sky Live is that this interactive camera adds the bonus of unique feedback. Thanks to clever technology inside the device it can track and monitor movement in real-time so you know if you are getting things right. So, how do you find Mvmnt and how much does it really cost? If you fancy getting beach-ready for the summer holidays then you'll find Mvmnt in the app section of your device. There's currently a special offer which lets you gain full access for free although this only lasts for the first 5 weeks. After that, you'll need to pay \u00a37.99 per month to continue using it. Those who subscribe will get access to the mobile app which offers the option to browse and schedule workouts for the future, keep track of progress and squeeze in an extra workout when away from home. Speaking about the launch, Tim Benjamin, co-founder & CPO at Mvmnt said: \"Since our first launch of Mvmnt on Sky Live last year, we\u2019ve been working on a mass market evolution of Mvmnt to be compatible with Sky\u2019s non-camera devices, and bring us a huge step closer to our goal of making quality fitness coaching accessible at home, for every body. \u201cThis latest launch on Sky Glass, Sky Stream and Sky Q has successfully opened up access to Mvmnt\u2019s unrivalled coaching for millions of people, bringing them a fitness experience that supports and educates them with the coaching they need to make fitness an enjoyable part of everyday home life. \u201cWe\u2019ve adapted some of Mvmnt\u2019s best-loved technology for non-camera Sky devices, including our Practice Area, which allows users to master new movements before diving into a workout.\u201d", "summary": "All Sky users can now access a heart-pumping upgrade on their TV.", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/tech/sky-tv-update-fitness-app-33113475", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/tech/article33113500.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Sky-TV.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:18:25", "author": "Dave Snelling,Dave-Snelling", "authors": ["Dave Snelling", "Dave-Snelling"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.439}

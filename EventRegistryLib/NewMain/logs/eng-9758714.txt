At least 40 firefighting and civil protection teams responded to the incident.\n\nIn a statement, Casa Cuervo said it was assisting authorities with their investigation and would reinforce security controls at its facilities.\n\nThe mayor of Tequila, Alfonso Magallanes, shared a post on his Facebook page urging residents not to approach the factory due to the ongoing situation.\n\nJalisco state is the largest producer of agave, the key ingredient in tequila, generating nearly 75% of the nation's annual crop. The town of Tequila, which gives the liquor its name, is a center for tourism, receiving an average of more than one million visitors annually from Mexico and abroad, according to data from the mayor's office.\n\nIn February, Mexico's Chamber of Deputies approved a law to change National Tequila Day from the third Saturday of March to July 24, to coincide with the same date celebrated in the United States, its northern neighbor and largest trading partner.\n\nThe US is the largest market for Mexican tequila exports.

The next morning, a fire broke out at the distillery, though it's currently unclear whether anyone was inside the distillery at the time, according to the publication \"El Mexicano.\"\n\nSurveillance footage shared by the Times shows that around 4:30 p.m. on Tuesday, a burst of flames erupted from La Roje\u00f1a distillery, catapulting what appears to be a large metal tank into the air.

A more recent social media post from the JCPU reports that responders discovered a \"lifeless person\" inside a retention pit while cleaning up the wreckage from Tuesday's fire. \"With this discovery, there are 6 people dead as a result of the incident that occurred at the tequila company,\" Jos\u00e9 Cuervo said in a statement to El Mexicano.\n\nThe initial blast prompted evacuations, and a team of over 40 firefighters and civil protection officials reportedly arrived at the scene to control the fire and clean up debris. As of Tuesday night, the initial fire had been contained, and the mayor of Tequila lifted a temporary stay-at-home order.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, a fire ignited in the distillery's storage area, according to El Mexicano, possibly due to embers from the night before.

Off the track. It\u2019s the same. Full send. No filters. Always all in. He\u2019s the guy who obliterated the 400m hurdles world record by nearly a second at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, fending off Rai Benjamin in a race regarded as one of the greatest in history. Minutes later, he called out Benjamin\u2019s Nike super spikes as \u201cbullshit\u2019, because he believed their foam acted like a trampoline and gave his great rival an unfair advantage. For the next two years, the 28-year-old Norwegian continued to double down by wearing spikes with \u201cbullshit\u201d written on them. But on a shiny day in Paris, where he will defend his Olympic title this summer, Warholm has a confession. He has changed his mind. \u201cI\u2019m the biggest hypocrite in the whole world,\u201d he says, a little wistfully. \u201cIt\u2019s always like when you take that leap forward, it\u2019s impossible to go back. When you look at the world today, it\u2019s impossible to avoid technology. I\u2019m an old school kind of guy, so it takes time. But there are also some good things about it.\u201d There are caveats, but Warholm accepts that, just as with the move from cinder to modern tracks, change is inevitable. \u201cI\u2019ll always stand for what I said in the beginning: the comparison aspect is getting weaker and weaker,\u201d he says. \u201cWith, say, Jonathan Edwards, you can\u2019t compare his equipment to that of today. You\u2019re seeing an inflation in personal bests. But at the same time, it has created a lot of interest that was lacking in the sport. I see some good and bad. Right now, when there is an even playing field, the positives weigh heavier than the negatives.\u201d Warholm\u2019s confession comes as he prepares to run in Puma\u2019s new super spike, the Berserker, over 400m hurdles for the first time in Thursday\u2019s Oslo Diamond League meeting. The name is unusual, the design even more so. The front plate of the shoe is oversized, has very deep ridges, and, bizarrely, a toe extension at the end of it. Crucially, it also has foam Warholm believes is very fast and bouncy. \u201cPuma has the best formula in making foam now,\u201d says Warholm, who ran a low-key 300m hurdles in the shoe last week in 33.28sec \u2013 0.02 off his world best. \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if anyone has a better energy return. The carbon plate technology is better than it was in Tokyo and we\u2019ve trained my body to run in these shoes. I\u2019m struggling to see what we\u2019re lacking. Without going into details, I see some things I\u2019d have improved in my opponents\u2019 shoes.\u201d So how does the weird design work? \u201cWhen you land, you want the foam to compress and you want your calf to move over the centre of gravity and then release,\u201d he says. \u201cThe ridges are helping that movement. It shows me you can take the technology and make it even more extreme.\u201d Sceptics are yet to be convinced and have even suggested the toe flap could lead to Warholm tripping over. His response? To post an amusing video on Instagram, insisting he and Puma had done their research and showing him using the toe flap to open a bottle of beer before drinking from it. With the Olympics two months away, things are about to get serious. The Brazilian Alison dos Santos, who won the 2022 world championship when Warholm was recovering from a torn hamstring, has run a lightning quick 46.86 this season. Benjamin opened his campaign with a staggering 46.64. So could Warholm\u2019s 45.94 world record be under threat this summer? \u201cThere are no guarantees. I\u2019ve been saying before: \u2018Now I\u2019ll go to this race to break the world record\u2019, and it never happened. \u201cTokyo was not about breaking the world record, it was about winning Olympic gold. But it turned out to be a fantastic race, one for the history books. That\u2019s probably how world records are broken. It\u2019s the perfect day, with the perfect opponents and perfect equipment.\u201d But gold is all that matters to Warholm. That much was made clear at the Eugene world championships in 2022, when he still went hell for leather from the gun despite not being fully fit and came seventh. Would a more conservative approach have given him a chance of bronze behind Dos Santos and Benjamin? \u201cIt\u2019s not interesting to me,\u201d he says, shaking his head. \u201cI want the gold. And if I\u2019m not going to fight for the gold, I don\u2019t want to fight. Sometimes when you fight for the gold, you will get silver or bronze, but it\u2019s always going to be important for me to fight for the win. I don\u2019t want to go for silver.\u201d Warholm believes his new spikes, which carry the hashtag #BS down the side, will give him the edge at the Olympics. But he concedes they raise an interesting dilemma too. \u201cI\u2019m 100% sure I have the advantage now,\u201d he says. \u201cIs it fair? That\u2019s another question because if I have an advantage it\u2019s not fair.\u201d It is not a quandary he will be mulling over in the final 50 metres in Paris. Not with gold and glory on the line and Benjamin and Dos Santos on his tail.", "summary": "<p>The 400m hurdles Olympic champion once criticised a rival over their footwear but has changed his mind before defending his title</p><p>Karsten Warholm doesn\u2019t hold anything back.

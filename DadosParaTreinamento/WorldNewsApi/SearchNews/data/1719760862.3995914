In a statement today the DPC said its inquiry \u2018concerns the storage and retention of personal data contained in paper records held by the HSE via its use of external storage facilities, and breaches of security which were notified to the DPC by the HSE\u2019. It added: \u201cThe breaches notified to the DPC related to two specific locations which were accessed by unauthorised third parties, and the circulation of videos taken from these locations showing paper medical records located at these facilities.\u201d It is believed that one of the incidents relates to a video posted on TikTok in November, which showed a person going through boxes of patient records in the now-vacant St Conal\u2019s Psychiatric Hospital in Letterkenny in Donegal. The other incident is thought to have occurred at a Dublin facility. In response a HSE spokesperson said that the organisation \u2018takes all breaches of data protection seriously and manages all breaches of data protection in line with data protection legislation and HSE policy\u2019. In a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health this morning, HSE Chair Ciaran Devane said that the board of the health service was informed of the inquiry yesterday and will be discussing the issue of data security when it comes to physical records in future board meetings. Meanwhile, the DPC has issued its 2023 annual report. Last year the Commission issued 19 finalised decisions resulting in administrative fines totalling \u20ac1.55 billion. Among those penalties was a February 2023 decision to impose fines totalling \u20ac460,000 on Centric Health, following a ransomware attack affecting patient data held on Centric\u2019s patient administration system, where over 70,000 patients were affected. Some 2,500 patients were permanently affected as their data was deleted with no backup available. In June the DPC levied a fine of \u20ac22,500 on the Department of Health following an inquiry into the Department\u2019s processing of personal data in 29 litigation files related to legal actions being taken by people with special educational needs and their families. The inquiry was undertaken after public allegations in 2021 that the department had unlawfully collected and processed personal data about plaintiffs and their families taking the legal actions. \u201cIn its inquiry the DPC found evidence that the department sought information from the HSE about services that were provided to plaintiffs and their families,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe department also included broadly worded questions asking the HSE to share any other information which the HSE felt was worth mentioning. This broad question resulted in the provision of private information about the lives of plaintiffs and their families.\u201d", "summary": "<p>HSE informed commission of \u2018breaches of security\u2019</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.imt.ie/news/data-protection-commission-to-investigate-hse-over-online-videos-of-paper-records-29-05-2024/\">Data Protection Commission to investigate HSE over online videos of paper records</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.imt.ie\">Irish Medical Times</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.imt.ie/news/data-protection-commission-to-investigate-hse-over-online-videos-of-paper-records-29-05-2024/", "image": "https://d1l0gza1nowsqe.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/12/records-GettyImages-486105325-620.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:14:08", "author": "Michael Mchale", "authors": ["Michael Mchale"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.008}

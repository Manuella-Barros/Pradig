Season 2\u2019s penultimate episode showed Molly and Arthur (Nat Faxon) almost kissing, Sofia (Michaela Ja\u00e9 Rodriguez) and Isaac (O-T Fagbenle) having a massive fight, and John (Adam Scott) emerging from a failed rocket launch unscathed \u2014 only for Molly to dump him. (Yes, even though he went to Harvard, has a Presidential Medal of Freedom, flew in a fighter pilot with Tom Cruise, and is the proud owner of Tom\u2019s slick jacket.) So what exactly went down in Loot Season 2, Episode 10, \u201cWe Shouldn\u2019t Exist\u201d? We\u2019re breaking down the Season 2 finale with help from Loot\u2018s co-creators Alan Yang and Matt Hubbard. Looking for a Loot Season 2 finale recap? Decider\u2019s Ending Explained article has you covered. Read on for a detailed breakdown of Episode 10\u2019s biggest moments, including behind-the-scenes insight and inspiration from Yang and Hubbard. Loot Season 2 Ending Explained: Episode 10 \u201cWe Shouldn\u2019t Exist\u201d Recap When Loot\u2018s finale kicks off, Molly and the Wells Foundation are on the road to success. But we\u2019ve seen her get burned before, so can her ambitious dream to secure fellow billionaire funding and expand Space for Everyone become a reality? With Grace (Ana Gasteyer) on board and ready to use her money to help fund Molly\u2019s vision, the women do a cover shoot for a Vanity Fair issue boldly titled, \u201cWe Shouldn\u2019t Exist: A New Type Of Billionaire.\u201d Their press does the trick and successfully makes waves in the billionaire circle, with Norman Lofton \u2014 a man ten times richer than Molly \u2014 offering to travel from his home in Wyoming for a tour of a Space for Everyone hotel. After a turbulent trip on the jet Molly chartered leads to lots of Norman puke, Loot\u2018s leading lady pulls out all the stops to impress her billionaire guest in hopes of convincing him to invest. But before Norman Palooza starts, Arthur asks Molly to chat about their almost kiss. It\u2019s clear Molly is excited and waiting for Arthur to make another move. Instead, he apologizes and says it was a big mistake, leaving her horrified. Molly scrambles to save face, agreeing that they both got caught up in the moment. She reminds Arthur that she\u2019s his boss and they\u2019re really good friends, then says she\u2019s so cool she\u2019s \u201cMr. Freeze\u201d before awkwardly excusing herself. UGH! Ahead of Norman\u2019s tour, Ainsely takes a moment to share her love for Sofia, telling her it\u2019s incredible that she always put others before herself and spends all day helping people only to return \u201chome to a cold, lonely apartment\u2026alone.\u201d Burn! Her words strike a nerve, inspiring an epiphany within Sofia that she fully realizes at the most inopportune time \u2014 right in the middle of their Norman meeting. The billionaire is greeted with a tower of his favorite hamburgers made by David Chang, which he can\u2019t eat, of course, because of all the vomiting. (Cue Nicholas telling Loot\u2018s chef to \u201cScram! Move, bitch!\u201d) After Sofia excuses herself from the crucial presentation, Molly follows and learns she can\u2019t stop thinking about Isaac. Sofia acknowledges the reasons why a relationship between them wouldn\u2019t work, then admits she loves him, prompting some A+ advice from Molly that she should listen to herself. \u201cDo you love him? Then none of those things matter. If you love someone then you just have to take the leap,\u201d Molly says. Despite the chaotic plane ride and Sofia\u2019s absence (and with help from a choir of children singing \u201cHighway To The Norman Zone), Norman leaves Space for Everyone very impressed and ready to invest \u2014 after he sleeps on the big decision, of course. In an unexpected twist, a successful day leads into a messy, chaotic night. After getting a voicemail from a woman saying \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you\u201d in Korean, Nicholas wonders if his birth mother tracked him down after all these years. He decides to get drunk and return the call while hanging out with Howard and many, many unfiltered voicemails later, it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s intrigued \u2014 and even happy \u2014 at the thought that his biological mom sought him out. When the woman calls back, however, she says there\u2019s been a miscommunication: She\u2019s a casting director in Seoul and wants Nicholas to audition for a new show \u201clike Squid Game but much more violent and sexual.\u201d Oh yeah, and the job would require him to move to Korea for six months! Needless to say, Nicholas feels let down. And he\u2019s not the only one. Loot Meets Eyes Wide Shut While Molly\u2019s at home feeding her dogs, she gets a letter from Norman inviting her to his house. Spoiler alert: It\u2019s massive! He\u2019s not such a simple man after all! She\u2019s taken to a creepy red carpeted room where Norman (sitting in a literal throne) and a group of other masked mystery people are waiting to intimidate her into quitting her progressive billionaire talk. \u201cYour activity\u2019s threatened our way! You must cease them immediately. Obey our command or you will face the most dire of consequences,\u201d Norm orders. Molly flicks on the lights, asks WTF is going on, and challenges Norm to face her face-to-face. He reluctantly accepts, telling her to quit the \u201cbullshit\u201d and explaining the room full of masked billionaires likes the way things work, aka in their favor! Molly declines his invite to join the dark side, saying, \u201cThe world is changing. People\u2019s eyes are opening.\u201d She adds that she and Grace will find people to partner with who actually care about humanity, but Grace takes off a mask and reveals Norm bought her loyalty with a news station and a soccer team. Even in the face of a friendship betrayal, Molly stands her ground, says \u201cFUCK THESE OLD WHITE GUYS!\u201d and storms out with her head held high \u2014 right before Norm\u2019s pal Ellen DeGeneres arrives. (Yes, Loot burned Ellen!) If the masked finale scene felt familiar, co-creator Alan Yang says there\u2019s a good reason. \u201cIt\u2019s a wild idea. We rewrote the finale a few times. And we came upon this idea that it\u2019s essentially a shot for shot remake of Eyes Wide Shut by Stanley Kubrick and Tom Cruise walking into that room. So if you watch that movie, you\u2019ll see it\u2019s almost exactly the same,\u201d Yang told Decider over Zoom. \u201cIt\u2019s the idea that we had this sort of very \u2018down-to-earth billionaire.\u2019 And he drives a Camry, and eats the same hamburger for lunch every day. But really, there\u2019s something more nefarious going on. And we really wanted to set up some obstacles for Molly, and get her to understand that there are forces in this world that are really conspiring against her, and ultimately, are against people who are trying to make it in this world. That was a bigger picture look at it. But it\u2019s pretty scary when you have a cabal of evil billionaires going against you as Molly does.\u201d Sofia And Molly Take The Leaps Now, at long last, the romance portion of Loot\u2018s Season 3 finale. The show checks back in with Sofia, who flew to New Orleans to catch Isaac\u2019s jazz band and make amends. \u201cI was on the verge of accomplishing everything I ever wanted in my life, but once you were gone, none of it meant anything,\u201d she screams to Isaac in an A+ rom-com moment. The two get back together, seal their reunion with a kiss, and text a photo announcing the good news to Molly. As she reads Sofia\u2019s message \u2014 \u201cI took the leap. No regrets.\u201d \u2014 Molly finally realizes she needs to take a leap herself and rushes to Arthur\u2019s house to confess her true feelings. In yet another iconic rom-com worthy moment, Molly knocks on Arthur\u2019s door and makes an impassioned speech, saying, \u201cI know we had that conversation earlier, and I know that there\u2019s a million reasons why it would never work out between us, but I know we feel something for each other. And when two people have a connection like that, I think that they owe it to each other to go for it. So here I am. And I can\u2019t believe that I showed up here in the middle of the night like a psycho, but I\u2019m not backing off. In fact, I\u2019m doubling down. And I\u2019m gonna put my hands around you, and I\u2019m gonna lean in, and here we go!\u201d At long last, Molly and Arthur share a kiss, and for a moment, it\u2019s magical. Arthur reciprocates, everything\u2019s perfect, and then, a light turns on and Arthur\u2019s GIRLFRIEND (yeah, remember her?!) asks, \u201cArthur? What\u2019s going on?!\u201d If you\u2019re thinking now would be a great time for Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cRing the Alarm\u201d to blare, you\u2019re right. And now, co-creator Matt Hubbard addresses the question on everyone\u2019s mind. \u201cWhat the heck, Arthur?!\u201d \u201c\u2026What Arthur now knows about what Molly feels about him, and what he may secretly feel about her will certainly come up pretty quickly,\u201d he says, discussing ideas for Season 3. \u201cThey\u2019ll have to make some decisions about what they do with each other. And I think no matter what they do, it will be complicated\u2026They are from vastly different worlds, in some ways, right? Molly has been a billionaire for 25 years. And Arthur has like three pairs of khakis. So there will be issues between them. And that\u2019s really fun to write.\u201d While it sounds like there may be hope for another shot at romance between Molly and Arthur should Loot continue, this certainly marks the end for them in the Season 2 finale. The next time we see Molly she\u2019s furiously racing to her private jet with suitcase in hand and Nicholas tailing her trying to find out what\u2019s wrong. She hops on the plane, denies his invitation to talk things out, and says, \u201cI want you to get me out of here. As far away as possible. Anywhere! You decide, I give up.\u201d The season ends with Molly ready to drown her sorrows with some alcohol and viewers ready to ask a whole lot of questions. For starters, is the duo headed to Korea now that it\u2019s Nicholas\u2019 choice? Will he audition for that show? Live there for six months? Search for his birth mom?! We need a Season 3 now! \u201cAll those things are on the table,\u201d co-creator Matt Hubbard told Decider. \u201cWe love all that stuff. And we are trying to figure out what is the funniest way to start this season? What are things that will allow us \u2014 like Nicholas\u2019 birth parents \u2014 to explore these characters in a little bit more depth? And how do we keep putting them in conflict with each other? So yeah, we\u2019re excited about all those possibilities.\u201d While we wait to hear more updates on the future of Loot, check out everything Decider knows about Loot Season 3 here.

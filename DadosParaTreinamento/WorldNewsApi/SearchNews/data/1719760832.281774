This comes a day after Atishi appealed to the people of the city to conserve water amid high temperatures and a supply crisis. On Tuesday, the temperature at two stations in Delhi \u2014 Mungeshpur and Narela \u2014 recorded a maximum temperature of 49.9 degree Celsius. Atishi also directed the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) to deploy 200 teams across the Capital from 8 am on Thursday to check for wastage. She also ordered the disconnecting of existing illegal water connections on construction sites or commercial establishments which divert water supply meant for domestic purposes. Blaming Haryana for not releasing adequate water through the river channel as well as the Munak Canal, Atishi said that in places where water was supplied twice a day, the frequency would be reduced to once daily to ensure that parched areas could be supplied water every day. She also said if the Haryana government does not release the required water to the national capital, the government will approach the Supreme Court.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/fine-for-water-wastage-in-delhi-teams-to-keep-an-eye-9359299/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/PTI05_29_2024_000127A.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:06:54", "author": null, "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.122}

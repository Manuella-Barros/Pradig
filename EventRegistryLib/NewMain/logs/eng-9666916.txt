With seven stomach-churning inversions, the 4,124-foot long coaster ties another steel inverted roller coaster record. Themed to a wailing mythological messenger from the underworld with flowing white hair and gleaming eyes, Banshee features the following succession of breath-taking thrills: A 167-foot lift hill, 150-foot curved first drop, a dive loop, a vertical loop encircling the lift hill, a zero-gravity roll, a pair of batwing inversions, outside loop, spiral, in-line roll and carousel, all at speeds up to 68 mph!

struck by the Banshee ride at Kings Island around 8pm on Wednesday, according to park officials and Mason police.\n\nA witness said he had hopped a fence to try to get his lost item, WXIX reported.\n\nThe coaster was traveling at its top speed of 68mph when it hit the man and caused him 'traumatic injury', early emergency dispatches indicated.\n\nEmergency responders found the man critically injured in a restricted area, police said.\n\nHe was rushed to West Chester Hospital and airlifted to University of Cincinnati Medical Center.\n\nKings Island on Wednesday night stated that the man 'entered a restricted, fenced area of the Banshee roller coaster and is believed to have been struck by the ride'.\n\nThe park stated that its 'safety and first aid personnel responded immediately to the situation and contacted local emergency responders' and that 'Kings Island's focus continues to be on the welfare of the guest and his family'.\n\nIt is closed amid an investigation into the incident.\n\nThe man's identity and an update on his condition were not released by authorities as of early Thursday.\n\nBanshee is 4,124 feet long and ties another steel inverted coaster for record length, according to the park's website.\n\n'Themed to a wailing mythological messenger from the underworld with flowing white hair and gleaming eyes, Banshee features the following succession of breath-taking thrills,' states the site.\n\n'A 167-foot lift hill, 150-foot curved first drop, a dive loop, a vertical loop encircling the lift hill, a zero-gravity roll, a pair of batwing inversions, outside loop, spiral, in-line roll and carousel, all at speeds up to 68 mph!'\n\nIt reaches top speed midway through the course instead of at the first drop like the majority of coasters.\n\nState Department of Agriculture officials went to the site on Thursday 'to conduct a full re-inspection of the ride and an investigation to ensure the ride was operating in accordance with Ohio's law and rules', the agency's spokeswoman, Meghan Harshbarger, told WXIX.\n\nThe man was struck 10 months after a teenage girl standing near a roller coaster at Dutch Wonderland in Pennsylvania was hit in the head by a 'box cutter type device' that fell out of a rider's pocket.", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri":

With seven stomach-churning inversions, the 4,124-foot long coaster ties another steel inverted roller coaster record. Themed to a wailing mythological messenger from the underworld with flowing white hair and gleaming eyes, Banshee features the following succession of breath-taking thrills: A 167-foot lift hill, 150-foot curved first drop, a dive loop, a vertical loop encircling the lift hill, a zero-gravity roll, a pair of batwing inversions, outside loop, spiral, in-line roll and carousel, all at speeds up to 68 mph! As a result of the natural terrain underneath Banshee, riders experience an elevation change of 208 feet from the highest point of the ride - the 167-foot tall lift hill - and the lowest point with the batwing inversions. The top speed of 68 mph is not reached until the midway point of the ride rather than the first drop as riders experience on most other roller coasters.\n\nBack in August 2015, a guest at Cedar Point was struck and killed after park officials said he entered a restricted, fenced area of the Raptor.", "source": {"uri": "wkyc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "wkyc.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kings Island"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banshee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Banshee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mason, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mason, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WLWT", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "WLWT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_roller_coaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inverted roller coaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_coaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roller coaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_roller_coaster_elements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of roller coaster elements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raptor_(Cedar_Point)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raptor (Cedar Point)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_coaster_inversion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roller coaster inversion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_hill", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lift hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedar_Point", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cedar Point"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cedar Point"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_loop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vertical loop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carousel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carousel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Guides", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Attractions", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Feet", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Feet", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Endurance", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Endurance", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://media.wkyc.com/assets/WKYC/images/2a68d15b-c10e-4fb4-b479-3114df299deb/2a68d15b-c10e-4fb4-b479-3114df299deb_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666916", "eventUri": "eng-9666916", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mason, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-08-", "textStart": 2074, "textEnd": 2085}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

That tragedy came after dozens of riders were trapped upside down on a ride at Oaks Amusement Park in Portland on Friday.\n\nWhile rare, accidents and injuries at theme parks do happen. According to the Consumer Production Safety Commission, there were 1,299 injuries from amusement park accidents in the U.S. in 2019, the last year for which data is publicly available.\n\nThe map below looks at the different park tragedies over the years in the U.S.\n\nA 38-year-old man entered a restricted area of the Banshee roller-coaster ride on Wednesday and was struck by an oncoming car, according to the theme park.\n\nHe was airlifted to University of Cincinnati Medical Center following a trauma alert, and was in critical condition as of Thursday morning.\n\nA probe into the incident is underway.\n\nOn Friday, emergency crews rescued 28 people who ended up stuck on the AtmosFear drop tower. They were left dangling upside down and in midair for about 30 minutes.\n\nThe park said the ride stopped at about 2:55 p.m. Emergency responders arrived at about 3:20 p.m. Crews were then able to get the riders down safely within minutes.\n\nA park guest filmed the event on TikTok, showing the ride upside at a 90-degree angle while people remained strapped to their seats.\n\nWhile the guest was filming, the amusement park made an announcement for all guests to \"vacate the park immediately.\"\n\nAll passengers on the AtmosFear were assessed by Portland Fire and Rescue and Medical Response. One rider with pre-existing medical conditions was sent to the hospital to be evaluated \"out of an abundance of caution,\" according to a press release.\n\nOn Oct. 1, 2016, a man and a 14-year-old girl suffered minor injuries when an e-cigarette exploded on the Hogwarts Express ride.\n\nA 67-year-old man died after riding Star Tours on Oct. 24, 2016. He had a pre-existing heart condition.\n\nA maintenance worker at the Ohio theme park was critically injured after being struck in the head by a moving train on the Flight Deck ride on June 12, 2015. A passenger sustained a serious hand and leg injury.\n\nThat same summer at the same park, a guest was killed after he entered a restricted, fenced in area and was struck by a roller coaster.\n\nThe coroner said the man, 45-year-old James Young II, was looking for a lost cellphone. He had ridden the Raptor coaster and lost some of his personal items during it. He attempted to retrieve them and was struck by a train in operation.\n\nThe sprawling amusement park outside Atlanta was famous for a Batman ride that decapitated a park guest on June 28, 2008. A passing train hit the teenager while they were retrieving a lost hat.\n\nThe victim was with another boy who also entered the restricted area, but he was not injured.\n\nA 45-year-old woman fell from the Twist and Shout coaster at the Arkansas park on July 30, 2006 due to centripetal force. She fell about 11 feet and was taken to the hospital.\n\nInspectors decided the park guest was too large for the ride, so the restraints did not work properly. A report from the Arkansas Department of Labor said the ride operator should not have let her occupy more than one seat on the ride.\n\nThe Des Moines, Iowa park's famous Tornado roller coaster injured three people when a piece of wood left over from an inspection fell onto a car on July 24, 2006.\n\nOn April 14, 2004, a woman fell out of one of the Dollywood Express carriages while it was in motion at Dolly Parton's amusement park in Tennessee. An investigation found a drink was spilled on the woman and she in turn lost her balance and fell out of the train.\n\nShe was taken to UT Medical Center and released a day later.\n\nThe Chicago park's Raging Bull attraction saw a fatality on May 3, 2003. Erica Emmons, an 11-year-old, died from a heart condition after riding the coaster. It was initially reported that Emmons choked on her gum, but an autopsy discovered she had a previously unknown heart condition.\n\nA 28-year-old man with Down syndrome opened his seat restraints on the Denver park's Rainbow ride on May 26, 2002. The ride was in motion, and he stood up, falling to his death.\n\nWitnesses said he unlatched his seat belt and maneuvered out of the lap restraints.\n\nIn one of the most notorious roller-coaster disasters in history, a mother and her son were killed and two others injured when a series of maintenance failures on the Wild Wonder ride in Cape May, New Jersey led to a car flying off the tracks on Aug. 28, 1999. An investigation found the anti-rollback mechanisms on their car were replaced with unapproved parts.\n\nOn Aug. 22, 1999, a 12-year-old boy fell from the Drop Tower in Ohio and died. His family claimed the shoulder harnesses were not locked properly. An investigation was inconclusive, and no charges were ever filed.\n\nOn July 11, 1999, a woman sued the Denver theme park because of injuries she said she obtained on the Mind Eraser roller coaster, which is marketed as a \"monster coaster\" that suspends riders through rollovers, dives, and double corkscrew spins at speeds greater than 55 mph, according to the park's website. The plaintiff said the ride gave her a bloody eye, slurred speech and memory loss. At least 21 other people also complained of injuries from the ride.\n\nOn Sept. 7. 1998, a 25-year-old man was struck by the dangling legs of a rider from the Flight Deck ride at the Ohio park. There were allegedly issues with his ability to understand the warning signs. He entered the ride's restricted area to retrieve a hat.\n\nHe was pronounced dead an hour later at the hospital. The rider's leg was broken.\n\nThe former Houston park's Excalibur roller coaster struck a 51-year-old employee on Aug. 9, 1997 while they were working on a section of the track. A signal had been sent to the operator indicating that the track was clear.\n\nA woman fell from Matterhorn Bobsleds at Disney's California park and was hit by another car on Jan. 3, 1984. She was killed.\n\nAn operator at the 1880s-themed park in Branson, Missouri switched a train on the Fire In The Hole ride to the service area, unaware it contained riders. One man died when he struck the low overhang.\n\nIn what's considered the worst U.S. theme park accident on record, a fire destroyed the Haunted Mansion attraction, trapping and killing eight teenagers on May 11, 1984.\n\nSix Flags Great Adventure and its parent company Six Flags were indicted for aggravated manslaughter and accused of recklessly causing the deaths.\n\nProsecution argued in trial that the park ignored repeated warnings from safety consultants who told them to install sprinklers or smoke alarms.\n\nThe defense argued the fire was arson, and a jury found the the park not guilty in a criminal trial. Six Flags ended up paying millions in civil damages to the victims' families.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Officials did not release information about the man's identity but police say he has been critically injured.\n\nThe Independent emailed King's Island for comment.\n\nThe park shut down the ride as officials conducted an investigation.\n\nThe man had reportedly approached a greeter at the ride and said that he had left something behind and wanted to retrieve it. The employee told him there was nothing they could do until the ride closed for the evening.\n\nThe witness said that the man wandered near the ride and went through a restricted gate.

With seven stomach-churning inversions, the 4,124-foot long coaster ties another steel inverted roller coaster record. Themed to a wailing mythological messenger from the underworld with flowing white hair and gleaming eyes, Banshee features the following succession of breath-taking thrills: A 167-foot lift hill, 150-foot curved first drop, a dive loop, a vertical loop encircling the lift hill, a zero-gravity roll, a pair of batwing inversions, outside loop, spiral, in-line roll and carousel, all at speeds up to 68 mph! As a result of the natural terrain underneath Banshee, riders experience an elevation change of 208 feet from the highest point of the ride - the 167-foot tall lift hill - and the lowest point with the batwing inversions. The top speed of 68 mph is not reached until the midway point of the ride rather than the first drop as riders experience on most other roller coasters.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_roller_coaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inverted roller coaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banshee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Banshee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_coaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roller coaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_roller_coaster_elements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of roller coaster elements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raptor_(Cedar_Point)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raptor (Cedar Point)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kings Island"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_coaster_inversion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roller coaster inversion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedar_Point", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cedar Point"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cedar Point"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_hill", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lift hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_loop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vertical loop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carousel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carousel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Skating/Roller_Skating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Skating/Roller Skating", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Guides", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Attractions", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Feet", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Feet", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/rewrite-this-title-Report-Man-struck-by-Banshee-roller-coaster.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666916", "eventUri": "eng-9666916", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

{"id": 243354892, "title": "Anthony Gordon: England forward to mark bike crash with cycling celebration if he scores", "text": "Meanwhile, Gordon says England \"need to perform and give people what they want to see\" if they would like criticism over their performances to stop. England have been questioned for the way they played during the group stage of Euro 2024 and were booed by supporters following the 0-0 draw with Slovenia, with empty cups thrown at manager Gareth Southgate. The Newcastle forward is one of the players supporters are calling to come into the team for the match against Slovakia in an attempt to get England\u2019s attack firing. The Three Lions scored just two goals as they topped Group C but Southgate said that \"things are starting to come together\". Talking about criticism, Gordon said: \u201cI don't really care about stuff like that, I actually think of it in a positive way. \u201cIf people are being negative it's only because they expect a lot from you, which is a positive thing. If we want that to stop, we just need to perform and give people what they want to see.\u201d The 23-year-old made his debut for England in March and has had an excellent campaign for Newcastle, with 12 goals with 11 assists in 48 games. However, a lot of England\u2019s key players occupy the forward positions and Gordon only played his first minutes of the competition as an 89th-minute substitute in England's final group game against Slovenia. His cameo caught the eye of many and was praised by former England captain Wayne Rooney, who said Gordon should be brought into the starting XI. But Gordon has said he is \"not that guy\" to ask manager Southgate for more minutes. \u201cI just like to try my best and control the controllables,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cI think if I train to the very best of my ability, do the best I can every day, that\u2019s my way of giving him a headache in terms of selection, and the rest I can't control. \u201cTry my best and make selection as hard for him as I possibly can. When or if I\u2019m needed, I\u2019ll be more than ready.\u201d", "summary": "England forward Anthony Gordon says he will do a cycling celebration if he scores at Euro 2024 after an electric bike accident.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cv2gx30zjjxo", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_sport/e8e7/live/9626ccc0-356c-11ef-bbe0-29f79e992ddd.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:23:25", "author": "Alex Howell", "authors": ["Alex Howell"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.02}

According to one of his top veepstakes candidates, the negative reception was actually a sign that Trump is getting more popular. Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC), a frontrunner to become Trump\u2019s vice-presidential pick, appeared Sunday morning on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, and was immediately grilled on the Libertarian National Convention ordeal. \u201cI saw a wave of red hats at the Libertarian convention,\u201d the senator explained to host Dana Bash. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s popularity continues to increase.\u201d Scott then quickly pivoted away from the boo-fest. \u201cHe\u2019s not just going to the Libertarian convention, he\u2019s also doing rallies in the Bronx,\u201d he continued, referring to Thursday afternoon event (with its comically overstated crowd size). \u201cHe\u2019s doing something I consider a 50-state strategy,\u201d the senator continued. \u201cI give him a lot of credit in going to places where Republicans have not gone before. If we\u2019re going to win this election cycle, we must go where we\u2019re not invited.\u201d The former president was invited by the Libertarian Party to deliver a primetime address at its highly eccentric election-year confab. The Daily Beast\u2019s Mini Racker reported from the room that as soon as he took the stage, \u201cthe former president was met with a sound he was not accustomed to: boos. They broke out as soon as he appeared, and never died down, marking one of the most negative receptions Trump has ever received.\u201d Trump was met with another flood of boos when he practically begged the room to give him a warmer reception, and again when he urged the Libertarian Party to nominate him for president. At one point during the evening, a group of libertarians turned around to shout down a red MAGA hat-donning group of Trump supporters chanting his name. \u201cI think it was a bad idea\u201d to invite Trump to speak, libertarian activist Marta Howard told The Daily Beast before the speech. \u201cNot all publicity is good publicity.\u201d", "summary": "<figure><img src=\"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1019,w_1814,x_2048,y_308/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_585/fl_lossy,q_auto/Screenshot_2024-05-26_at_9.59.29_AM_okxaoz\"><figcaption>CNN</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/donald-j-trump\">Donald Trump</a> was met with overwhelming boos on Saturday night as <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/swamp-creature-trump-gets-shouted-down-as-he-begs-for-libertarian-nomination\">he begged the Libertarian Party</a> for its <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/2024-presidential-election\">2024 nomination</a>.

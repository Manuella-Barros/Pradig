Grateful to be a part of this Indian film that\u2019s made history, as an Intimacy Coordinator. Thanks Divya and Hridu for being so vulnerable and creating absolute magic.

The scene is shot in a Ratnagiri forest with Divya Prabha, playing a Hindu woman whose parents keep sending her marriage proposals from Kerala, and Hridu Hussain, whose character is a young Muslim man working in the hospital where his beloved works as a nurse. Naina shared that every member of the cast and crew was immersed and in unison to create the gem of a film.

It means so much that Payal and the entire team were keen on getting an IC on board, and gave me so much space and respect to create.\u201d \u201cThank you @zicdrop @ohshitharshit for always supporting and thinking of me.

grassroots group passed an initial certification.\n\nThat means county recorders who will review a 5 percent sampling of the signatures over the next three weeks could reject 30 percent and the voter referendum would still make the ballot.\n\nThe measure is temporarily on hold until the signature certification process concludes. The law extends eligibility to all 1.2 million Arizona students by 2022 but caps enrollment at about 30,000.\n\nVoucher backers say they give parents more choice, while opponents argue they siphon money from cash-starved public schools.\n\nIf the law is blocked until the November 2018 election, it would be a major defeat for Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, the Legislature's Republican majority and Trump administration Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.\n\nDucey championed the expansion, while DeVos is a big proponent of private school vouchers and formerly led the school choice group American Federation for Children, which lobbied for the law in this year's legislative session.\n\nCertification is considered fairly likely, even by state Elections Director Eric Spencer, who certified more than 108,000 of the signatures. He said backers \"should be pretty confident that at least 70 percent of the people that signed this are actually registered voters.\"\n\nStanding in the way are school voucher backers. Americans for Prosperity, a conservative group that backs Ducey and is funded by billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, has already filed one lawsuit and others are certain to come if the referendum is certified for the ballot.\n\nThe lawsuit targets paid circulators who school choice proponents contend weren't legally qualified to collect signatures.\n\nThe group's lawyers also sent letters to Spencer asking him to invalidate the entire referendum because the introduction of the petition sheets incorrectly referred to this year's legislative session.\n\nTim La Sota, a lawyer who represents voucher proponents, called the secretary of state's certification review \"fairly superficial.\"\n\n\"There are many, many more signatures that are invalid but that the secretary of state does not have a duty to disqualify,\" La Sota said in a statement Saturday.\n\nHe also said the petition sheet fails to correctly identify what law is being referred to voters.\n\n\"We are confident that there are not enough legitimate signatures for this referendum to go the ballot,\" he said.\n\nRoopali DeSai, an attorney for the grassroots group Save Our Schools Arizona whose volunteers collected the signatures, said she believes they will prevail in court.\n\n\"I think their claim is baseless and desperate and I think that we have complied with the law and our petitions are legally sufficient,\" she said late Friday.\n\nVoucher-backers also wanted Spencer to invalidate potentially tens of thousands of signatures for various other purported flaws. He eventually eliminated nearly 2,000 signatures, but said it is outside his legal authority to eliminate others under what he called \"creative legal arguments.\"\n\nSpencer sent a letter to the attorney for the group late Friday and suggested he might raise the issue with a judge.\n\nArizona first passed a voucher program, technically called Empowerment Scholarship Accounts, for disabled students in 2011. The program differs from traditional vouchers by giving state funding directly to parents, who can use the cash to pay for private school tuition, home-schooling or other education expenses.\n\nThe program has been repeatedly expanded and now covers a third of all students, including children attending failing schools, those living on Indian reservations, foster children and children of military members.\n\nDespite those changes, only about 3,500 students now use it to and more than half are disabled.", "eventUri": "eng-3374387", "timeCrawl": "18:22:00", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T18:22:00Z"}

Barring litigation, that critical step will decide whether the referendum makes the ballot.\n\nCounty election officials will review signatures against voter registration rolls to ensure they are from qualified voters; those that are not will be discarded. Spencer said not enough signatures were collected in La Paz County to require that a sample be validated there.\n\nCounty recorders must validate 3,767 signatures, or about 70 percent for the referendum to qualify for the ballot, Spencer said. The group can afford to lose about 30 percent, he said.\n\n\"That's a pretty healthy margin,\" Spencer said.\n\nBut opponents have been building a case to challenge whether Save Our Schools Arizona met all legal requirements as they gathered those signatures. Their complaints include circulators qualifications, the description of the session in which lawmakers passed the measure, and handwriting irregularities.\n\nAttorney Joe Kanefield, an election-law expert, said Save Our Schools appears to have a legitimate chance at qualifying the measure for the ballot. \"Given their numbers, the chances are pretty good that it's going to qualify,\" he said, unless legal challenges are successful.\n\nSave Our Schools Arizona spokeswoman Dawn Penich-Thacker said the group worked hard to follow the law.\n\n\"Every signature represents an Arizona parent, retiree and business owner who spent 90 days in the summer heat to stand up for our schools, for our students and for the future of our state,\" she wrote in an email to The Arizona Republic. \"Every signature represents a rebuke of Gov. (Doug) Ducey and the state lawmakers who chose profit over people.\"\n\nDucey's spokesman has said the Republican governor wants to see the voucher expansion go into effect.\n\nFoes of the referendum could not be reached for comment late Friday.\n\nSB 1431 made all 1.1 million Arizona students eligible to apply for the voucher program, which grants tax dollars to parents for private-school tuition or other education expenses. While broadening eligibility, the bill capped the number of recipients at 30,000 by 2022.\n\nPrior to expansion -- which Ducey and GOP lawmakers narrowly muscled through the Legislature in April -- the program had been limited to certain students, including those with special needs, in poor-performing schools or from military families.\n\nThree months ago, when the coalition of parents and public-education supporters convened at the state Capitol and announced intentions to overturn a school-voucher law, they were given little chance at success by the state's political establishment.\n\nFollow the reporter on Twitter @yvonnewingett and reach her at yvonne.wingett@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4712.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nSave Our Schools Arizona slams vetting process for school-voucher referendum\n\nArizona's new school-voucher program is on hold.

That sets the stage for county recorders to do their own verification.\n\nSpencer rejected efforts by attorneys of pro-voucher supporters to strike even more names from the more than 110,000 submitted to call for the referendum on the new law.\n\nIn some cases, he said, there is no legal basis for the objections. And, in others, he told the lawyers that if they want to pursue their claims they need to do it before a judge - something vouchers supporters already have started with a lawsuit in Maricopa County Superior Court.\n\nThey have their work cut out for them.\n\nSpencer concluded petitions with more than 108,000 signatures survived the first test, far more than the 75,321 that ultimately need to be found valid.\n\nThe next step is for county recorders to do a name-by-name check of a random sample that Spencer has prepared for each. But given how many signatures above the minimum cleared the first hurdle, the recorders need to find that only 69.6 percent of their samples are valid.\n\nHanging in the balance is whether voters will get the last word on legislation to make vouchers of state money to attend private and parochial schools available to any public school student.\n\nThe vouchers, formally known as Empowerment Scholarship Accounts, were first approved in 2011 to help parents of students with disabilities who said their children cannot get the help they need in public schools.\n\nSince then, supporters have nibbled away at the restrictions. Among those now eligible for vouchers are foster children, children living on reservations and those attending schools rated D or F.\n\nSB1431, approved with only Republican votes, eliminates any requirements, and about the only limit is that total vouchers enrollment cannot exceed about 30,000 by 2023, a provision inserted solely to get the necessary votes to pass the measure. But that cap can be removed at any time by future lawmakers.\n\nIf sufficient signatures on referendum petitions are determined to be valid, SB1431 cannot take effect unless and until voters give their approval at the 2018 general election.\n\nIn doing the initial screening, Spencer's office discarded 216 petition sheets because the required sworn affidavit of the circulator was unsigned or otherwise incomplete. Others were disqualified over problems like not having the required notary seal or the failure to have attached a copy of the measure being referred.\n\nAnd more than 1,900 individual signatures were disqualified for things like missing information.\n\nBut Spencer said some of the complaints by those who want an expanded voucher program have no basis.\n\nFor example, attorney Kory Langhofer argued that Spencer should not count anyone whose signature looks like their printed name. Langhofer, who represents Americans For Prosperity, a group funded by the Koch Brothers who support vouchers, argued that a signature must be significantly distinguishable from a printed name to be considered a true \"signature.\"\n\nSpencer rejected that argument.\n\n\"Many Arizonans use a signature that substantially mirrors their printed name,\" he wrote to Langhofer in response. \"As long as the petition signature matches the elector's voter registration record, it is irrelevant how much that signature varies from the signer's printed name for purposes of our review.\"\n\nSpencer also rebuffed Langhofer's contention that signers must include both a city or town as well as a zip code. He said one or the other is sufficient to check the signer's identity.\n\nAnd he said there's nothing wrong with someone using \"ditto marks\" to show that information about an address or date is the same as the person who signed above.\n\nIn some cases, Spencer told Langhofer that his complaints need to be resolved by a judge.\n\nFor example, Langhofer contends that some people who were gathering signatures were doing so for money. But he charged that they had not first registered with the Secretary of State's Office as required by law.\n\nTo buttress his arguments, Langhofer said some of those who did not register had been paid circulators for prior petition drives. Spencer said that hardly qualifies as proof.\n\nBut Spencer said just because an individual acted as a paid circulator during a past election cycle doesn't necessarily mean he or she is acting as a paid circulator during the current election cycle and therefore \"misrepresented his or her status as a 'volunteer.'\" And he told Langhofer if he has actual substantiation to the contrary, it is \"better presented to a court of law after consideration of testimonial evidence.\"\n\nIn a prepared statement, Dawn Penich-Thacker, spokeswoman for the Save Our Schools group that circulated the referendum petitions, said the organization is already anticipating a court fight. She said voucher supporters, including Americans for Prosperity and the American Federation for Children, have \"a scorched earth policy to silence the voice of Arizona voters through pricey, frivolous lawsuits and baseless legal challenges.\"", "eventUri": "eng-3374387", "timeCrawl": "20:16:00", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T20:16:00Z"}

She made the commitment on Sunday after saying both she and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer want taxes on working people to be lower, while noting she would not put forward \u201cunfunded proposals.\u201d She has also declined to set a timeline for increasing defence spending to 2.5 percent of the economy. Speaking to BBC One\u2019s \u201cSunday With Laura Kuenssberg\u201d programme, Ms. Reeves said, \u201cWe certainly won\u2019t be increasing income tax or national insurance if we win the election. The Labour frontbencher also said there is \u201cnot going to be a return to austerity\u201d under Labour, with commitments to boost frontline services a \u201cdown payment on the changes that we want to make.\u201d \u201cBut in the end, we have to grow the economy, we have to turn around this dire economic performance,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make any cuts to public spending which is why we\u2019ve announced the immediate injection of cash into public services,\u201d the shadow chancellor added. \u201cSo that money for our NHS, the additional police\u201413,000 additional police and community officers\u2014and the 6,500 additional teachers in our schools, they are all fully costed and fully funded promises because unless things are fully costed and fully funded, frankly, you can\u2019t believe they\u2019re going to happen.\u201d Ms. Reeves said Labour will be \u201cunlike the Conservatives, who have already racked up \u00a364 billion of unfunded tax cuts in just three days of this campaign. \u201cI will never play fast and loose with the public finances, I will never put forward unfunded proposals,\u201d she said. However, the shadow chancellor didn\u2019t rule out public spending cuts when challenged on her plans. Asked when Labour would increase defence spending to 2.5 percent of GDP, Ms. Reeves said: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to put a timetable on that. \u201cWe\u2019ve committed to do in government a strategic defence review to make sure that we\u2019re getting value for money for all of our spending, including on defence where some of the procurement costs of purchasing new equipment have, frankly, got out of control under this government,\u201d she said. Ms. Reeves also insisted Labour \u201cwill end fire and rehire\u201d after a union criticised the party for excluding an outright ban on the practice in the final version of its workers\u2019 rights package. The shadow chancellor said she is \u201csorry that Sharon feels like that\u201d\u2014after Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said the plans now have \u201cmore holes than Swiss cheese\u201d\u2014but defended the pledges. \u201cWe will end fire and rehire which has seen companies \u2026 sack all their staff and then try and bring them back on worse contracts,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is deplorable and we will not allow that to happen.\u201d On Saturday, Sir Keir defended Labour\u2019s decision to rebrand its package of workers\u2019 rights pledges from the \u201cNew Deal for Working People\u201d to \u201cLabour\u2019s plan to make work pay,\u201d saying there had been \u201cno watering down\u201d of the plans. \u201cIt\u2019s also something which I think employers and good businesses would say, \u2018looking at the detail of it, this is what we\u2019re doing in good businesses,\u2019\u201d he told the BBC. Elements of the deal include a \u201cright to switch off,\u201d a proposed ban on \u201cexploitative\u201d zero hours contracts and stronger employment rights from day one of a new job. The party has also said it wants to empower adult social care professionals and trade unions that represent them to negotiate a sector-wide agreement for pay, terms, and conditions. Several unions have backed the plans, saying they represent a vital step towards better protections for employees. But Unite suggested the wording had been softened, with a previous proposal to ban zero hours contracts revised to refer only to \u201cexploitative\u201d zero hours contracts. Labour has also said on Sunday that it would revive Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s plan to ban young people from smoking, which was dropped following his surprise call for a July 4 general election. The abandoned Tobacco and Vapes Bill proposed to ban the selling of tobacco products to anyone born on or after Jan. 1, 2009. Asked about Labour\u2019s plan, shadow work and pensions secretary Liz Kendall said: \u201cIf we\u2019re elected we will make that happen and make it less likely that young people will smoke than vote Tory.\u201d", "summary": "The shadow chancellor made the promise and said there's no going back to 'austerity,' but did not rule out spending cuts.", "url": "https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/no-income-tax-or-national-insurance-rises-under-labour-reeves-5657379", "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/05/26/id5657410-Rachel-Reeves-300x180.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:39:33", "author": "Lily Zhou", "authors": ["Lily Zhou"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.115}

In 2021, village officials told WCPO they were hoping a state grant of over $800,000 could help transform the village from a recovering coal plant community to a waterfront destination for boaters, bikers and history buffs.\n\nNow, the funding they will receive is more than 14 times that amount.\n\nWith it, New Richmond officials plan to construct a river marina, a trail connecting to waterfront access, an amphitheater, a boat ramp, a natural landscape terrace and connections to the US-52 bike trail.\n\nIn 2021, a New Richmond official likened the project to Cincinnati's Smale Park, but on a smaller scale.\n\nThe Village of New Richmond is the largest waterfront municipality in Clermont County; Founded in 1814, it was once a bustling hub for steamboat building along the banks of the Ohio River, just 20 miles east of Cincinnati.\n\nSlim Sallee Park Redevelopment for Village of Higginsport\n\nHigginsport will receive $6,303,288 in funding for the redevelopment of a currently-abandoned ballfield, according to DeWine's announcement.\n\nThe space will instead be transformed into a seven-acre community park.\n\nThe park will feature a public gathering space with intentional connections to the Ohio River; a boat dock and launch from the park itself will provide access to recreational activities that don't currently exist in Higginsport.\n\nIn addition to the boat dock and launch, the village intends to construct a fishing pier, a bridge and a mural to create a transformational space where visitors and residents alike can enjoy plenty of outdoor activities.\n\nRipley Riverfront East improvements in Ripley, Ohio\n\nIn Brown County, the village of Ripley, Ohio will receive the most funding of any project in the Greater Cincinnati region funded through the state's initiative.\n\nRipley will receive a whopping $16,387,086 for its project -- on top of $3 million the village already received.\n\n\"We already received approximately $3 million worth of funding to build a recreational boat dock,\" said Wayne Gates, village administrator of Ripley. \"So we had a $3 million dock project that is currently in the works, we expect to begin construction this year. So when you add the $16.4 million from the Appalachian community grant program, that means that $20 million is going to be infused into downtown Ripley to completely change the way that downtown looks, the way it serves its residents and the way it serves visitors to the community.\"\n\nAccording to the announcement from DeWine, Ripley's riverfront will carve out better access to nearby Underground Railroad sites and other sites with historical significance in the area.\n\nIn addition to that, Ripley also plans to create a new public gathering space that will improve the public's access to the riverfront.\n\nGates said he and other Ripley officials have been working with nearby communities on both sides of the Ohio River -- including Higginsport and New Richmond -- to create a regionally-cohesive tourism strategy to tout a regional identity.\n\n\"We are hoping that this grant and the economic development that comes with it will allow us to continue to build our foundations of historic and recreational tourism,\" said Grant.\n\nHe pointed out visitors who choose to stay in the region have a bevvy of options of interest, from Serpent Mound in Adams County to the birthplace of President Ulysses S. Grant in Clermont County to waterfront recreational opportunities aplenty in between.\n\nIn all, DeWine announced a total 21 new economic projects that will be funded through a total of $152 million awarded throughout Ohio.\n\nWatch Live:\n\nWCPO 9 News at 5PM\n\nMore local news: Thousands of elementary students participate in Market Madness Three years after Ohio AG sues Doug Evans, pollution violations continue OHSAA announces preliminary 2024 winter sports divisions and representation", "source": {"uri": "wcpo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WCPO"}, "authors": [{"uri": "felicia_jordan@wcpo.com", "name": "Felicia Jordan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Appalachia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripley,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ripley, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ripley, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Richmond,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Richmond, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Richmond, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clermont_County,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clermont County, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Clermont County, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_DeWine", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike DeWine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liberty County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liberty County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_County,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brown County, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brown County, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walkability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

Spanning 17 riverfront projects, this funding will increase access to local waterways, revitalize historic riverfront downtowns and create opportunities for tourism and recreation.\n\n\"Since our founding in 2003, the Ohio River Way has been championing a new vision of thriving communities that embrace the Ohio River,\" explained Brewster Rhoads, Chair of the Ohio River Way and founder of the Ohio River Paddlefest. \"This historic investment marks the biggest milestone yet in making that vision a reality.\"\n\nThe projects encompass a wide range of improvements including river-to-downtown connections, downtown redevelopment, streetscape enhancements, and the addition of new boat ramps, docks, and parks. These initiatives are designed to improve walkability within communities and boost tourism by enhancing the riverfronts.\n\n\"When we launched this program, we asked our Appalachian communities to think big, and that's exactly what they did,\" said Governor DeWine. \"The projects we're announcing today were developed by those living in our Appalachian riverfront communities because no one knows what's needed to make this region thrive better than those who live here.\"\n\nSecuring this funding required significant collaboration between leaders in communities and organizations along the Ohio River. As part of this process, the Ohio River Way was on the ground in river towns connecting local leaders with each other, working with community planners and helping envision how this funding could best be used.\n\nThe 17 riverfront communities receiving funding include Beverly, Portsmouth, Marietta, Gallipolis, Sardis, Higginsport, Ironton, South Point, Burlington, Ripley, Racine, Proctorville, New Richmond, Pomeroy, McConnelsville, Middleport and Zanesville.\n\nMark Noll, Executive Director of the Ohio River Way, remarked, \"We are thrilled by Ohio's game-changing riverfront investments in communities along the Ohio River. The river is a vital asset that deserves to be celebrated, and these investments will greatly enhance access to recreation, boost tourism and stimulate economic development, significantly improving the quality of life for our residents.\"\n\nFunding for Ohio's Wonderful Waterfronts Initiative is part of the larger Appalachian Community Grant Program, which has committed $500 million to Ohio's 32-county Appalachian region. The Ohio River Way is committed to working alongside the state and these communities to ensure the success of these transformative projects.

The projects we're announcing today were developed by those living in our Appalachian riverfront communities because no one knows what's needed to make this region thrive better than those who live here,\" DeWine said in a press release.\n\nThe stop in Proctorville Monday was one of many throughout the state for DeWine, who announced $152 million for communities in 12 counties.\n\nThe village of Proctorville was awarded $5,206,800.\n\n\"Critical improvements will be made to the Proctorville Lock 27 site, including repairs and enhancements of a 1,400-foot sea wall. The redevelopment also includes the creation of a full-service marina capable of housing 100 riverboats, the installation of a boat launch, a floating dock, a boat house, shelter houses, recreational equipment, lighting, and a bicycle/pedestrian trail connection,\" the press release said.\n\nBurlington was awarded $1,003,660.\n\n\"The riverfront Burlington Park will be redeveloped to include the construction of a small floating dock, ADA access, park facility improvements, sidewalks, benches, and a river observation area for visitors. Additionally, a large shelter house will be constructed to house a farmers market and community events. A trail interconnection will also be made to the nearby Burlington 37 cemetery,\" the release said.\n\nThe village of South Point was awarded $1,274,700.\n\n\"The village of South Point's riverfront park is a unique stop along the river, allowing views of three states and the southernmost point of Ohio. Improvements to the park include the construction of a floating dock, reconstruction of a retaining wall on the overlook, installing ADA access from the docks up to the park, shelter house improvements, lighting, sidewalks and a riverfront bike-pedestrian path along 1st Street,\" the release said.\n\nThe city of Ironton was awarded $5,277,310.\n\n\"The city of Ironton plans to complement two projects including current riverfront recreation investments by constructing a multi-use trail, sea walls to accommodate large vessel docking, amenities for full boat services, improvements to circulation trails, and lighting enhancements. Ironton will also renovate the nearby historic Ro-Na Theatre including finishes of walls and ceilings, leveling of floors, HVAC, lighting, trims, balcony, historic railings, restrooms, upstairs space, and fa\u00e7ade features,\" the release said.\n\n\"Ohio's Wonderful Waterfront\" projects are funded through the Appalachian Community Grant Program, according to the governor's website.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_DeWine", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike DeWine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlington,_Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Burlington, Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Burlington, Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proctorville,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Proctorville, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Proctorville, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Appalachia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Point,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Point, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Point, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_dock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dry dock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Waterway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downtown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_County,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawrence County, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lawrence County, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironton,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ironton, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ironton, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(water_navigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lock (water navigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverboat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riverboat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slipway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slipway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seawall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidewalk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sidewalk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bicycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

Now, the Mahoning Valley is getting a flood of grant money to help its riverfront.\n\nOhio Governor Mike DeWine announced the City of Warren will receive $4.3 million supporting the new Warren waterway trail that connects the city's four waterfront parks.\n\nThe money will also build a new pedestrian bridge over the Mahoning River to connect Perkins Park to Courthouse Square.\n\n\"What we are seeing across Ohio is more and more communities are I wouldn't say discovering the river but rediscovering and kind of provisioning,\" DeWine said. \"We focused this money on our 32 Appalachian counties. I think these are counties that get neglected by Columbus, and I think there is some truth to that.\"\n\nThe grants all come from the Appalachian Community Grant Program's Wonderful Waterfronts Initiative, focusing on funding projects along Ohio's rivers and lakes.\n\nThursday's announcement was one of two from DeWine's office. The second takes aim at removing dams along the Mahoning River, providing an additional $5 million to open up 32 miles of unobstructed river.\n\n\"As soon as the dams come down, the river is going to be restored to its natural flow. It's going to move those core sediments out, they wash downstream. They wash away. So you're going to see an improvement in water quality immediately,\" said Ohio EPA Director Ann Vogel.\n\nBy the time it's all said and done, nine dams will be taken down.\n\nDeWine's initiative pumps about $14.2 million into Mahoning and Trumbull counties alone, hoping to revitalize the riverfronts, attract visitors ans support local businesses.\n\n\"It's really a great asset that we have is our water. It's one of the great things we have. It's great for recreation, it's great for tourism. It's great for getting people into our local communities.

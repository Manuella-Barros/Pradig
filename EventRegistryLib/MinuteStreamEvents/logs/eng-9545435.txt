A humiliating 4-0 defeat to New York Red Bulls in late March was followed by elimination from the Concacaf Champions Cup at the hands of Mexican side Monterrey in early April.\n\nFormer USMNT defender Taylor Twellman posted a damning statistic on X, comparing the Argentinian manager's record in Miami to that of the man he replaced at Chase Stadium, Phil Neville.\n\n\"What if I told you that Tata Martino has a lower win % in MLS than Phil Neville did at Inter Miami ... would you believe me?!\" Twellman wrote. \"Neville finished his spell in south Florida with a win rate of just 38.9% while currently Martino's is at 38.2%.\"\n\nMeanwhile, reports in Spain suggested Martino could be replaced by Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez, with Miami making contact with the coach who, at the time, was due to leave his post at Barcelona this coming summer. Xavi has since agreed to stay on at the Camp Nou for another year.\n\nAfter the hammering at the hands of the Red Bulls, there was an air of resignation to Martino's comments to the media, as the 61-year-old accused his players of lacking commitment.\n\n\"There is not much to say, except that we were outmatched from start to finish,\" Martino said. \"When a team enters a game without the desire to win, without spirit, without competing, and the other side just wants to win the game, they are going to win it.\"\n\nThe key mitigating factor in Miami's underperformance was an injury crisis. Ahead of the team's sixth league game of the season, nine members of Martino's squad were listed as unavailable due to injury, more than any other team in the league. They drew 1-1 against New York City FC with an absentee list headlined by Lionel Messi, who missed a month with a hamstring strain.\n\nMiami's lopsided approach to roster construction - built around the acquisition of expensive superstars - means their squad is top-heavy in terms of talent and unable to absorb a spate of injuries, especially when their high-earning, big names are unavailable.\n\nWhen, in early April, Messi returned, Miami's fortunes reversed. The eight-time Ballon d'Or winner couldn't prevent the Champions Cup elimination: he clearly still lacked sharpness in the second-leg loss to Monterrey. But his league form has been absurd - the 36-year-old has scored seven goals and provided eight assists in five MLS games since his return, taking him to the top of the goals and assists charts - including a record five assists in a rout of the Red Bulls.\n\nNow that Miami are rolling, it's evident why they hired Martino in the first place.\n\nJust as the club co-owned by David Beckham has chased superstars on the pitch, Martino arrived last summer with a weighty resume and reputation to complement the players he oversees. His reputation was first built in South America. He won the Paraguayan Primera Divisi\u00f3n four times in the early to mid-2000s, with Libertad and then Club Cerro Porte\u00f1o. In charge of Paraguay between 2007 and 2011, he guided them to the quarter-finals of the 2010 World Cup - the nation's best-ever finish - and a Copa Am\u00e9rica final. He then took Newell's Old Boys in his native Rosario to an Argentinian title.\n\nHe worked with Messi for a season at Barcelona and then again during a two-year stint at the helm of Argentina, reaching another two Copa Am\u00e9rica finals.\n\nAfter two and a half years in charge of Mexico, Martino arrived at Inter Miami with proven MLS pedigree thanks to an MLS Cup triumph and an MLS Coach of the Year award with Atlanta United in 2018.\n\nHis vast experience, array of achievements and personal history with Messi was reflected in the contract, reportedly worth $5m a year, he signed at Chase Stadium. And while Miami's commitment of financial resources to players in midfield and attack - even full-back Jordi Alba is more of an asset going forward than defensively - has resulted in a porous backline, with 18 goals conceded in 12 MLS games so far this season, there is evidence of Martino's coaching nous higher up the pitch.\n\nAlthough his only trophy during his single season as Barcelona manager was a Super Cup, the Catalans were a fearsome attacking force under his charge, scoring 100 La Liga goals as they finished runners-up to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Martino's Atlanta were the highest scorer in MLS in the 2018 regular season, too, with 70 goals.\n\nWith Messi and Luis Su\u00e1rez leading the line, Miami are of course blessed with a level of attacking talent the envy of MLS. But the coordinated support of the team's wingers and full-backs, the careful spacing of players moving forward in unison providing passing lanes for Messi, has been a hallmark of their forward play, a result of Martino's work on the training pitch.\n\nMiami have scored 32 goals in 12 MLS games, by far the highest tally in the league - only LA Galaxy and Phil Neville's Portland Timbers have broken the 20 goal mark. With their Messi-less malaise now behind them, their ambition of winning multiple trophies this season is back in view and Martino's position appears as assured as ever, proving player health is often intrinsic to coaching success.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_baldi@theguardian.com", "name": "Ryan Baldi", "type":

And they want to see him score, just like you'd want to see Shohei Ohtani ding one over the fence, or Patrick Mahomes fizz a couple of touchdown passes, or Caitlin Clark swish a bunch of deep threes, and so on.\n\nBut while Messi's goals have filled highlight reels for nearly two decades now, American fans are swiftly finding out that there is something arguably more enjoyable and definitely more exquisite than seeing him slam the ball into the net.\n\nIt is when the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner creates goals, like he did a ridiculous five times in Inter Miami's 6-2 victory over New York Red Bulls on Saturday, that his true genius is on full display. If you didn't see the game, go watch the highlights. If you've already seen the highlights, go watch them again.\n\nIt is different level stuff, wizardry that is beyond the comprehension of even most elite soccer players, let alone us regular folk who just like to watch. Just when it looked like the buzz was wearing off a little after the electrifying start to Messi's American adventure last year, well, here it is again.\n\nAccompanied by some of his old buddies from Barcelona, Messi is having a blast. With Sergio Busquets marshalling the midfield, Luis Suarez ready to pounce on any scoring chances and Messi's favorite workout partner Jordi Alba in the squad but temporarily injured, a smile is never too far from his face.\n\nMessi is MLS' joint top scorer with 10, matched only by his pal Suarez, while his 12 assists is five clear of the next closest on the list. All despite having missed four of Inter's 12 games, with the team clear at the top of the Eastern Conference and with the league's best overall record.\n\nMessi-fever might not be quite as frenetic as when he scored that dream free-kick to win his first game last July and led the team to the Leagues Cup title, but make no mistake, things are still bubbling along nicely. As for all that hyperbolic talk about this being the most important signing in MLS history? It almost, somehow, feels like an understatement.\n\n\"I always say the same thing,\" Miami head coach Tata Martino told reporters. \"It is redundant to talk about him. Messi makes the difference, always. He participated in six goals. I don't think we will ever see anything like that again.\"\n\nMLS hadn't seen anything like it before. His performance against New York made him the first player in league history to either assist in five goals in the same game or to have a role in six. The effort somehow overshadowed Suarez's sublime hat-trick, with Martino describing their connection as \"just like the old days.\"\n\nThe first assist wasn't anything particularly special, a nice simple touch into the path of new signing Mathias Rojas, who smacked in a long-range strike with his left foot.\n\nThe others? Sublime.\n\nMessi scored after 49 minutes to put his team 2-1 up, then got down to the business of take over the game like an All-Pro quarterback matched up against high schoolers.\n\nInter's third was a work of art, Messi sending a pass to Rojas that bypassed two Red Bulls defenders by inches, and wrong-footed everybody except the recipient.\n\nNext was a lovely, curved cross for Suarez, again threading the needle of a packed penalty area. Then a series of give-and-go to provide Suarez once more. Then, finally, a pace-shifting ball with the outside of his left that drew in goalkeeper Carlos Coronel, allowing Suarez to sneak around him and score again.\n\nOn Monday, Messi was named MLS Player of the Matchday for the third time in four weeks, to go alongside his Player of the Month award. Inter, at the early point of the campaign, looks like a puzzle for which there may be no solution.\n\nAll of which is to say it might be time to reevaluate your spectatorial priorities.\n\nWhen Messi decides his focus is going to be to set up others, it is breathtaking. It is tricky and trigonometry and seeing the game in a whole different way. The sport is slower for Messi than for everyone else, a tapestry exclusive to his mind.\n\nObviously, unless its your hometown team that he's scoring against, or perhaps even if it is, no one is going to say no to a Messi goal.\n\nBut when he becomes the provider-in-chief, for Inter or for Argentina, it's a different kind of treat.", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The Argentine great was directly responsible for six goals as his Inter Miami side claimed a 6-2 win over New York Red Bulls on Saturday (May 4).\n\nMessi has been on the top of his game all season despite having to deal with some injury problems at the start of the campaign. The 36-year-old forward was named as the league's Player of the Month for April as he returned from injury with renewed vigor.\n\nLionel Messi made major headlines when he scored one and assisted five more, all in the second half, to help his side record a 6-2 win against New York Red Bulls. For context, the Red Bulls trounced Inter Miami 4-0 in their meeting earlier this season when Messi was out injured.\n\nDoyle was impressed by the Argentine great, but believes he can still do more this season, placing a chance of this happening at 70%. In a chat with MLS Extratime, the pundit also claimed that with Messi, Inter Miami can score more than eight goals in a game this season.\n\nHe said:\n\n\"I think pretty strongly, there's like a 70% chance that he breaks this record this year, that he ends a game with seven-goal contributions. I also think there's a pretty good chance that Inter Miami break the all-time record for goals in a game, which is eight.\"\n\nLionel Messi leads the way for goals and assists in the MLS, with 10 goals and 12 assists to his name in only eight appearances. Teammate Luis Suarez follows closely behind with 10 goals and five assists, with the pair re-enacting their deadly partnership in Florida.\n\nLionel Messi contract napkin goes on sale in auction\n\nThe famous paper napkin on which Lionel Messi's first-ever Barcelona contract was written, has gone on sale at an auction. The auction is being run by international auction house Bonhams until May 17, with a starting price of \u00a3220,000.\n\nThe napkin was signed on December 14, 2000 by then-Barcelona director Carles Rexach to sign the Argentine, then aged 13. Messi had impressed on trial in September, but the club were reluctant to sign him from outside Europe.\n\nHis agents Josep Maria Minguella and Horacio Gaggioli informed the director that the 13-year-old, who had returned home to Argentina, would be offered to Real Madrid. As a result, Rexach invited both men to a restaurant, where he quickly drafted the contract on a napkin, which was then signed by all three men.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sulayman_salahudeen@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Sulayman Salahudeen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pundit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Red Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carles_Rexach", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carles Rexach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Auctions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Auctions", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/2b5cd-17152556294952-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545435", "eventUri": "eng-9545435", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 350, "textEnd": 355}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 1960, "textEnd": 1966}, {"amb": false, "date": "2000-12-14", "textStart": 2030, "textEnd": 2047}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Also the son of Arsenal icon Ian Wright, he is well-versed in the art of goalscoring - growing up in a sporting household before embarking on a successful career.\n\nThe retired striker is perfectly placed, therefore, to provide his insight into what opposition players must be thinking as they pit their wits up against Messi in the US. The eight-time Ballon d'Or has started the new MLS season in sterling form, with 12 strikes in 11 appearances so far this term already.\n\nIn his most recent outing for Inter Miami, he notched five assists - a record in MLS - and a goal en route to a 6-2 demolition of the Red Bulls to keep them top of the Eastern Conference after 12 matches. As usual, partner-in-crime Luis Suarez scored a hat-trick.\n\nREAD MORE: Patrick Mahomes admits he was 'nervous' before meeting Lionel Messi in NFL superstar's home city\n\nREAD MORE: Lionel Messi sets MLS record as Luis Suarez scores hat-trick in Inter Miami rout\n\nEx-New York Red Bulls forward Wright-Phillips was simply left in awe at the Argentine's performance as he waxed lyrical about the superstar's brilliance. Speaking to MLSsoccer.com, he said: \"Ultimately what we're seeing is, he can't be stopped. You get tight, he's going to roll you, drop the shoulder and get by you.\n\n\"The thing you have to do - and I'm making it sound easy sat here - is stop the supply,\" he continued, as he provided some insight into what opposition defenders face when coming up against a player of the winger's quality. \"I know that's not easy but once that ball gets to Messi's feet, forget about it. You're in trouble, it's too late.\n\n\"The numbers, I love to see them and look at them. He will look back and say what I have done there is amazing, but it's just how easy the game comes to him. The first touch is always good. The weight of his pass to a team-mate is always good. How he drives and goes by players, is always top level. Watching him is unbelievable.\"\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nBradley Wright-Phillips gave his take on how MLS defenders can stop Lionel Messi from exerting his influence in games\n\nMiami head coach Tata Martino was also left amazed by what he had witnessed from his captain, as the Herons pulled off a historic victory. He reflected: \"Well, I always say the same thing, it is redundant to talk about him because he always seems to do something new,\"\n\n\"And well, if something was missing, it was this. To have an impact on the six goals a team scores, this is going to be difficult to see again. All of them had a phenomenal impact in the match. But well, Leo has probably done something historic, which is five assists, one goal in the league.\n\nThe ex-Barcelona boss added: \"I can't forget Luis' three goals, Mati\u0301as' two goals. The first one by Matias was good, both were great,\" Martino said when asked about his favorite score from the match. For the technical gesture and Leo's pass, I'll take Luis' scissors kick (in the 68th minute). That's the one for me.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_beattie@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Tom Beattie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Wright-Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bradley Wright-Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d'Or", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballon d'Or"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Wright", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ian Wright"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Red Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(MLS)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (MLS)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerardo_Martino", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gerardo Martino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_kick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bicycle kick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32753926.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2150979784.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545435", "eventUri": "eng-9545435", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

His aching knees won't be able to handle the MLS grind, they said. He is past his prime, they declared.\n\nThink again.\n\nSuarez, the Uruguayan forward known as \"El Pistolero\" (The Gunslinger) has shown in 11 MLS appearances that although he might be a bit slower, he can still be as lethal as he was at Liverpool and Barcelona. His knees are holding up just fine, so far.\n\nAnybody who witnessed Suarez's hat trick Saturday during a 6-2 drubbing of the New York Red Bulls could see he still has his trademark touch. It wasn't just that he scored three goals in the span of 12 minutes; although that, alone, is remarkable. It was how he scored them.\n\nFor the first one, he was a bit behind Messi's entry pass, so he twisted in mid-air, and launched a scissor-kick volley from 12 yards out. The second came from an exquisite give-and-go, a perfectly timed sequence in the midst of a clot of defenders, born of many years playing alongside each other. To complete the hat trick, Messi found Suarez hovering close to goal, the way he does, and then the Uruguayan made a quick move to get around the New York goalkeeper and struck from a sharp angle.\n\nMessi assisted on all three of Suarez's goals. Each time, Suarez broke into a huge grin and hugged his longtime friend and scoring partner.\n\n\"Their partnership in the second half was like old times,\" Inter Miami coach Tata Martino said. \"When they find each other and their teammates can back them up, they are very influential in the game.\"\n\nMessi and Suarez are tied atop the MLS Golden Boot standings with 10 goals apiece. Messi's have come in eight games, Suarez's in 11. The dynamic duo has also combined for 17 assists, 12 for Messi, five for Suarez.\n\n\"What we saw tonight is surprising because it hasn't been seen before in our sport, but as a teammate and knowing Leo, nothing surprises me because that's the quality player he is,\" Suarez said. \"As a teammate, it's different playing on the field with him because we have played together a long time, so we know each other so well, sometimes we make moves without even looking at each other. That was another plus for our team.\"\n\nAsked if there is a healthy competition between he and Messi to be the team's leading scorer, Suarez shook his head, and replied: \"No, no. It's not like that. We played together a long time at Barcelona, and it was always like this... each helping the other. In 2015-16, Leo and Neymar helped me win the Golden Boot.\n\n\"The competition is to see your teammate happy and work together to win. Note that [Saturday], Leo broke a league mark with five assists, something that had not been seen before, and that shows what kind of teammate he is.\"\n\nSuarez's performance capped a week in which he attended an NBA playoff game between the Miami Heat and the Boston Celtics, and the Miami Grand Prix at Hard Rock Stadium.\n\n\"It's nice to have events in two to enjoy and share with family, but my focus is always on this team, from the day-to-day training to doing what we have to do to win,\" Suarez said.\n\nSuarez, a native of Salto, Uruguay, rose to fame in Europe when he signed with Dutch club Ajax in 2007. He scored 81 goals in 110 games for Ajax and then moved to the English Premier League, where Liverpool bought him for $29 million. He scored 69 goals in 110 games with Liverpool and left for Barcelona.\n\nHe and Messi quickly formed a powerful partnership, and Suarez scored 198 goals in six seasons for the Spanish club. He won four La Liga titles, a European Golden Shoe, and a Champions League trophy with Barcelona.\n\nSu\u00e1rez left Barcelona in the summer of 2020. He joined Spanish club Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and critics said game was on the decline. He responded by scoring 21 goals in 32 games and was a big reason Atl\u00e9tico won its first La Liga title in seven years. He spent two seasons with Atletico and then moved back to Uruguay to join his boyhood team, Nacional. He led Nacional to the Primeira Division title, scored eight goals in 16 appearances over six months with the club and left for Gremio in Brazil.\n\nSuarez said reuniting with former Barcelona teammates Messi, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba is a dream come true. His bond with Messi is especially strong.\n\nSuarez's wife, Sofia Balbi, whom he started dating at age 15, became good friends with Messi's wife, Antonela Roccuzzo. His children, Delfina, Benjamin, and Lautaro, have grown up with Messi's three sons and they are in school together in Fort Lauderdale.\n\n\"It's nice to remember the great moments we lived together in the club we all dreamed about, Barcelona, and one of the motivations for me coming here was to reunite with them,\" Suarez said in his introductory press conference. \"But more than anything, we are very ambitious, very professional and we are committed to showing the young talented Inter Miami players that your age doesn't matter, what matters is the commitment you have on and off the field.\"", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michelle_kaufman@miamiherald.com", "name": "Michelle Kaufman", "type": "author",

And then, Lionel Messi took over. Messi assisted Matias Rojas for the equalizer in the second half and then scored the go-ahead goal in the 50th minute. From there, Messi assists Rojas again and Luis Suarez three times for the Uruguayan's first hat-trick in MLS. Suarez accomplished the feat in just 12 minutes.\n\nWith the world talking about the former Barcelona duo once again after the game, thoughts began to circle around what other records Inter Miami could break this season. No record is safe with this Inter Miami team firing on all cylinders.\n\nHere are some other MLS records Lionel Messi and Inter Miami could break this season.\n\nConsidering Inter Miami scored six on the weekend, this record feels like it's only a matter of time before it's smashed. The record is currently held by the Los Angeles Galaxy scoring eight in a single game against the Dallas Burn. This record has stood for 26 years.\n\nThe highest scoring game in MLS history saw the LA Galaxy beat the Colorado Rapids 7-4 back in 1998. There have been games with 10 total goals, most recently between D.C. United and Real Salt Lake in 2015. Inter Miami certainly could take this record, but if it's topped the Herons will have likely conceded a number of goals in a game as well. Perhaps a 7-5 thriller is on the cards at some point this year.\n\nYep, Galaxy hold the record for biggest winning margin from the same game they put eight past Dallas Burn. If Inter Miami smash the most goals in a single game record, this will likely fall as well.\n\nYet another record held by LA Galaxy, the most wins in a row is sat at 15. Now, a caveat to this record. From 1996-1999, MLS games could not end in a draw. If there was a tie at the end of regulation, there would be a penalty shootout to determine the winner. Of course, that's changed now so this is probably the most difficult of the bunch to break. Still, never say never with Lionel Messi.\n\nBoth Columbus Crew and FC Dallas hold the record for longest undefeated streak in MLS history at 19. Arguably, this is a more reasonable record to break considering draws qualify as being undefeated. The number of games is larger yes, but it allows Inter Miami to draw some games. As of writing, Miami is on a four-game winning streak with 12 played. If the Herons stack up some more wins, this might not be all that improbable.\n\nLos Angeles Galaxy - 85 (1998), Los Angeles FC - 85 (2019)\n\nThis is a no-brainer and likely the most obvious record to be shattered by the end of the season. Inter Miami has amassed 32 goals in 12 games so far this season. LAFC fell just one goal short in 2019 breaking its rival's record that's stood for 26 years. Inter Miami has 22 games left to score 33 goals.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Red Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LA_Galaxy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LA Galaxy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Vanzeir", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dante Vanzeir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Dallas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Dallas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.C._United", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "D.C.

It was 6-2 for the Herons, with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez putting on a vintage show. Messi was the best player in the match, but it was Suarez who scored a hat-trick.\n\nCan these guys keep on impressing? Judging by the 2024 MLS odds, the answer is yes. The Herons are -106 favorites to beat CF Montreal in Canada this coming Saturday.\n\nCF Montreal is 3-3-4 in the 2024 MLS, with a score differential of 13-20. This makes their offense one of the least productive in the conference, while their defense is the worst in the East.\n\nThe good news for the Canadians is that Saturday's game is played on their turf. At home, they're undefeated in the 2024 MLS, with a 1-1-0 record and a score difference of 4-3. The most impressive thing is that their two home games were against two pretty tough teams - last season's MLS Supporters' Shield winner FC Cincinnati and Orlando City.\n\nHowever, Inter Miami is just better than both of those teams. Still, CF Montreal did manage to beat the Herons in each of their last two duels. There is a caveat, however - Lionel Messi did not play in either of those games.\n\nWith Lionel Messi on the field, Inter Miami looks like a real world-beater. The Herons have been superb since he returned from an injury, winning each of their last four games in the MLS. In those four, they scored a total of 16 goals.\n\nOf those 16 goals, Messi scored 6, while also assisted for another nine. What this basically means is that he was involved in 15 of his team's 16 goals scored in the last four weeks.\n\nInter Miami's defense hasn't been as impressive, but they really don't need to be great. Even if they concede some goals, Messi will be there to save the day.\n\nThere's no stopping Messi and the Herons. We don't think there's a single team in the 2024 MLS that could pull it off, let alone a mediocre team such as CF Montreal. That's why our CF Montreal vs. Inter Miami prediction is an easy win for the visiting team.", "source": {"uri": "gamblingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GamblingNews"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessie_carter@gamblingnews.com", "name": "Jessie Carter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CF_Montr\u00e9al", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CF Montr\u00e9al"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(MLS)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (MLS)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saputo_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saputo Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Red Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Cincinnati", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Cincinnati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_City_SC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orlando City SC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supporters'_Shield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supporters' Shield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_turf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial turf"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/National_Lacrosse_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/National Lacrosse League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.gamblingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/foot-on-ball-soccer-sports-news.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545435", "eventUri": "eng-9545435", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 164, "textEnd": 170}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

He scored twice in the 2022 World Cup final against France, a match that ended 3-3 with Argentina prevailing 4-2 on penalty kicks.", "source": {"uri": "naharnet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Naharnet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Busquets", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Busquets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d'Or", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballon d'Or"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordi_Alba", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordi Alba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "http://images1.naharnet.com/images/260960/w140.jpg?1714478541", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545435", "eventUri": "eng-9545435", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Since joining the club in 2023, Messi's impact has been nothing short of transformative, both on and off the field.\n\nFollowing the expiration of his contract with Paris Saint-Germain, Messi made a seismic shift to the United States, signing with the Herons. Led by club co-owner David Beckham, the allure of Miami's vibrant atmosphere and promising prospects undoubtedly played a pivotal role in Messi's decision.\n\nRecord-breaking success for Inter Miami\n\nUnder Messi's stewardship, Inter Miami has experienced a meteoric rise in revenue streams, shattering previous records in merchandise sales and ticket purchases. Xavier Asensi, the team's general director, highlighted the staggering financial growth catalyzed by Messi's presence. Asensi remarked, \"With the arrival of Messi, we have gone from having a budget of earning just over 60 million to ending up billing around 125 or 130. This year I hope we will start billing around 200 million dollars, or more.\"\n\nWatch Messi live. Every club, every match, including playoffs. Subscribe now to MLS Season Pass!\n\nExploiting the MLS calendar\n\nOne key advantage afforded to Inter Miami is the flexibility of the MLS calendar, which allows the club to capitalize on various revenue-generating opportunities. By strategically scheduling preseason tours to regions such as Saudi Arabia and the Far East, Inter Miami maximizes their earning potential.\n\nAsensi emphasized, \"Whatever Inter Miami can earn on a preseason tour, it is above what a professional football club has ever won. There are several factors, such as the fact that the big European clubs can do their tours at the same time, which is in the summer. We can do them when no one at that level can do them, which is in January or February. With Leo, obviously we try to pull behind him in this sense and adapt the structure so that this can happen, but 80 percent of zero is zero. If Messi were not there, what we are talking about would not exist.\" Messi's star power amplifies the allure of these tours, drawing global attention and bolstering Inter Miami's brand on a global scale.\n\nWhat's next for Lionel Messi and Inter Miami\n\nAs Messi continues to dazzle on the field, his off-field influence remains equally huge. Inter Miami's growing fan base and heightened international profile reflect the enduring appeal of having a footballing icon within their ranks. With Messi generating MVP buzz and spearheading Inter Miami's quest for MLS Cup glory, the club's trajectory appears bound for continued success.\n\nLionel Messi's arrival at Inter Miami has ushered in a new era of prosperity and prestige for the club. Through astute management and strategic leveraging of Messi's star power, Inter Miami has transcended conventional boundaries, positioning themselves as trailblazers in the world of professional football. As Messi's time at the club unfolds, the possibilities for Inter Miami seem boundless, with the potential for further achievements on the horizon.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fremont_farkas@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Fremont Farkas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goal (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Beckham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Beckham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLS_Season_Pass", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MLS Season Pass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xavier University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLS_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MLS Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Service_Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Service Clubs", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Clubs", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/OFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/OFC", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/nter-Miami-news-Lionel-Messi-puts-the-Herons-above-all-clubs-with-tricky-loophole.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545435", "eventUri": "eng-9545435", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Instead, the Messi discourse is always divided into extremes. That phenomenon hasn't changed since Messi's move to MLS, either; in fact, it's only intensified. Everything he does is some type of referendum. No game is just a game; it's also a statement on the bigger picture.\n\nIn recent weeks, the narratives have gone into overdrive.

He replied in the negative, revealing that working to help each other was more important to him.\n\n\"No, no. It's not like that. We played together for a long time at Barcelona, and it was always like this, each helping the other. In 2015-16, Leo and Neymar helped me win the Golden Boot.\n\n\"The competition is to see your teammate happy and work together to win.

The Argentine has arguably been the biggest legend in Blaugrana history, and eyebrows were raised about the conditions that reportedly forced Messi's departure from Barca.\n\nIn a recent interview, former Barcelona president Sandro Russell opened up about the controversial transfer and current president Joan Laporta's role in it. Russell mentioned that he would never let Messi leave the club for free.\n\n\"No, I would never allow that for free. If he wants to leave, then we will try to do what is necessary to benefit the club, but for free, never.\" Russell said (via Barca Universal).\n\nRussell was then asked whether he would blame Joan Laporta or Barcelona's financial woes for Lionel Messi's departure. The former chief was diplomatic in his answer, saying:\n\n\"I don't know. Since I don't know the details, I can't say anything. What I know is what I read in the newspapers, but each newspaper tells you something different.\"\n\nRussell admitted it was a \"big loss\" to let Messi go.\n\n\"Of course, it is a big loss. All you have to do is watch what is happening in Miami and the American League, the league is alive thanks to him. We are talking about the best player in history,\" Russell said.\n\nLionel Messi left the Catalan club as a free agent in August 2021 as one of the most decorated players of the club. In 778 appearances across competitions, he scored 672 goals and provided 303 assists.\n\nHe won four Champions League titles, 10 La Ligas, seven Copa Del Reys, eight Supercopa de Espana, and three FIFA Club World Cups with the club. He was part of both of Barcelona's historic treble-winning sides in 2009-10 and 2014-15.\n\nLionel Messi's transfer saga with Barcelona at a glance\n\nOn August 5, 2021, Barcelona formally announced that Lionel Messi will not continue at the club. After months of multiple reports suggesting that he would renew, Messi left the club as a free agent to join Paris St-Germain.\n\nThe departure came shortly after Joan Laporta named Josep Maria Bartomeu as the club's president amid several financial woes. As per Barca's official statement, Messi had reportedly agreed to a formal contract and the club felt likewise, but he could not continue due to the Spanish La Liga regulations.\n\n\"Despite FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi having reached an agreement and the clear intention of both parties to sign a new contract today, this cannot happen because of Spanish LaLiga regulations on player registration. As a result of this situation, Messi shall not be staying on at FC Barcelona,\" Barca's official website declared.\n\nBarca was reportedly unable to extend Messi's contract due to his salary cap, despite the player agreeing to reduce his salary by 50%, per ESPN.\n\nIn the summer of 2023, Lionel Messi again became a free agent after his contract with PSG ended. Multiple reports linked Messi to the Blaugrana once again, but the player ultimately signed for the MLS club Inter Miami last season.\n\nFollowing his signing for the Herons, Lionel Messi sat for an elaborate interview with SPORT and Mundo Deportivo, saying he was \"excited to return\" to Barca and he missed the club. However, he added that he did not want to leave \"his future at someone else's hands.\"\n\nLionel Messi also expressed his desire to say goodbye to Culers in the same interview, much like his former teammates Xavi and Iniesta.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pratyasha_sarkar@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Pratyasha Sarkar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Laporta", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joan Laporta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treble_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Treble (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Club_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA Club World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercopa_de_Espa\u00f1a", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josep_Maria_Bartomeu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josep Maria Bartomeu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mundo_Deportivo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mundo Deportivo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr\u00e9s_Iniesta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andr\u00e9s Iniesta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xavi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/OFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/OFC", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/2b7a9-17150609943744-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545435", "eventUri": "eng-9545435", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

For me and a lot of other people, his status was never in any doubt - it was already undisputed. The World Cup put him in a place where it could never be erased.\n\n\"Having Messi in Major League Soccer is spectacular. His arrival brings both him and MLS a lot of exposure worldwide.\"\n\nScouted from his time at Ghanaian side Tema Youth, Paintsil has spent the last eight years turning out in European football with Ferencvaros, Genk and Ankaragucu.\n\nEarlier this year he signed with LA Galaxy and is enjoying a promising debut campaign in the United States, notching four goals and four assists for Greg Vanney's side, who currently sit third in the Western Conference table.\n\nBorn and raised in Le Mans prior to developing his skills in Lorient's academy, Gabon international Bouanga flitted between the top two tiers of French football before moving to LAFC in 2022.\n\nLast season he really came into his own, ending up MLS' top scorer with 20 goals, including a late consolation effort in LAFC's MLS Cup final defeat to Columbus Crew.\n\nThis season he's picked up where he left off, notching six goals and two assists in his first 11 MLS appearances of 2024.\n\nREAD NEXT: Lionel Messi's record-breaking obscenities have put him on the path to another Ballon d'Or\n\nTRY A QUIZ: Can you name every MLS Golden Boot winner since 2005?\n\nVenzeir, who received once cap for Belgium back in 2021, has started off the 2024 campaign in fine fettle.\n\nLast season he notched just two goals and one assist for New York Red Bulls, having played a peripheral squad role, but in 2024 he's thriving with the responsibility of more regular starts.\n\nSo far this campaign the forward averages a direct goal contribution every 78 minutes. That's a ratio only bettered by the two star names at the top of this list.\n\nFinland won't be at Euro 2024 this summer, allowing long-serving stalwart Lod to focus on his club matters with Minnesota United.\n\nThe 31-year-old midfielder is one appearance short of a century in MLS for Minnesota. He's been a consistently solid performer for the club, and is now into his sixth campaign.\n\nLod's notched five assists in his last five MLS appearances and recently caught the eye by scoring one and setting up the other two in Minnesota's 3-0 victory over Charlotte FC.\n\nOnce a regular in the Premier League, nowadays Benteke is enjoying himself up top for D.C. United.\n\nHe notched 14 goals in his first full season with the club, in which he was coached by Wayne Rooney, but looks likely to better that return in 2024 with eight goals in nine appearances under new boss Troy Lesesne.\n\nREAD: The 16 former Premier League stars currently playing in MLS: Tottenham icon, Liverpool cult hero...\n\nLike Espinoza, Acosta is an experienced Argentinian that is yet to get a call-up for the national team.\n\nA product of the Boca Juniors academy, the attacking midfielder's career has taken him from D.C. United to Liga MX side Atlas and back to Major League Soccer with FC Cincinnati, where he's found a settled home since 2021.\n\nLast season, Acosta was named MLS' Most Valuable Player after his starring role in Cincinnati's Supporters Shield victory, and the 2024 campaign is shaping up to be another strong one for the 29-year-old.\n\nThere are whispers that he's begun a citizenship process and is aiming to represent the USMNT on home soil in the 2026 World Cup. Watch this space.\n\n\"Chicho\" Arango was named the MLS Newcomer of the Year in 2021, won both the MLS Cup and Supporters Shield with LAFC the following year, and is now in the form of his life for Real Salt Lake.\n\nSeven of his nine goals and two of his assists this season have come in his last six MLS appearances. There's no stopping him at the moment.\n\nHe hasn't been capped by Colombia since 2021, but keep up this kind of form and he might just make their Copa America squad this summer.\n\nSince being let go by Barcelona four years ago, Suarez has been on a mission to enjoy the twilight years of his career, lifting silverware with Atletico Madrid, Gremio and boyhood Uruguayan club Nacional before reuniting with old pal Messi at Inter Miami.\n\nHe might be 37 and considerably less mobile, but he hasn't lost that eye for goal. The veteran has either scored or assisted in seven of his last eight MLS starts for Inter Miami, while his second-half hat-trick against New York Red Bulls - each goal assisted by Messi, of course - underlined his game-changing ability at this level.\n\nThe eight-time Ballon d'Or winner is making mincemeat of MLS defences as everyone expected he might.\n\nThe most ridiculous thing is that Messi tops this list having played fewer minutes than anyone else, with injuries limiting him to starting just seven of Inter Miami's 12 MLS outings so far.\n\nMessi is both the top scorer and top assister in the 2024 MLS season so far, averaging a direct goal contribution every 35 minutes.

It's no surprise he's running riot.\n\nOn the night last week when Lionel Messi notched a goal and five assists against the New York Red Bulls, the presence of any Red Bulls at all felt merely incidental. Each time he picked up the ball, one of the greatest soccer players of all time found himself staring at more open lanes than the Florida Turnpike.\n\nIn the buildup to those five assists, Messi took nearly 20 touches before playing the killer pass to a teammate. But no defender touched Messi even once. Instead, they backed off, guessing what he might do next and trying to cut off passing lanes.\n\nIn other words, they let Messi do whatever he wanted.\n\nFor Messi, who will turn 37 next month, this wasn't the story of just one night. It's been the entire season, his first full year in the U.S. Not only does he now lead Major League Soccer in goals (10) and assists (12), he's also cruising through this American campaign untroubled by defenders. More than ever before in his career, Messi's opponents are too spooked or too overmatched -- or both -- to even try to take the ball off him.\n\n\"Messi makes the difference, always,\" Miami coach Tata Martino said.\n\nMLS defenders are learning the hard way what the rest of the world has known for 15 years: when you dive in on Messi, one of two things can happen. You can either be embarrassed by a moment of trickery, or you can risk injuring the most valuable asset that Major League Soccer has ever had. It's hard to say which would be more damaging to a defender's career.\n\nSo instead, defenders these days simply tend to stand back. This season, Messi has been dispossessed just 1.3 times per game on average, according to data from WhoScored. That's barely half as often as the 2.5 times per game he lost the ball to a defender in Spain's La Liga from 2009 to 2021 and still lower than the 2 times a game he was dispossessed over his pair of seasons at Paris Saint-Germain in France.\n\nWhen defenders can't win the ball fairly, their other recourse has historically been to foul him. But MLS teams aren't managing that either. This season, Messi is only suffering a foul once every 61 minutes in a Miami jersey. Compare that to how often he was hacked down during his prime in Spain (every 30 to 35 minutes, on average) and a larger pattern emerges: the closest defenders are getting to Messi these days is when they ask for his shirt at the final whistle.\n\n\"This is the biggest problem against this quality: when you have open space against Lionel Messi,\" Red Bulls head coach Sandro Schwarz said.\n\nCoaches who have faced him know that putting defenders near enough to smell Messi's shampoo is the only hope they have of stopping him. Give him too much respect or too much room and he can wreak havoc in an instant. Former Saudi Arabia manager Herv\u00e9 Renard memorably reminded his players of this in a fiery halftime speech at the 2022 World Cup. The man-to-man coverage, he felt, was a little lax.\n\n\"Take your phone!\" he shouted at one player. \"You can take a picture with him if you want!\"\n\nOpposing teams have always known this. They were prepared to resort to extreme tactics even as far back as 2006, when Messi was first emerging as a Barcelona starter. Chelsea's scouting report ahead of a Champions League knockout game that year said as much. \"If option is to foul him,\" then-scout Andre Villas-Boas wrote, \"it is important to do it outside the box and as early as possible.\"\n\nBut that relies on getting close enough to foul him in the first place.\n\nPart of the challenge stems from simple respect for everything that this 5-foot-7 genius from Argentina has accomplished -- the league titles in Spain and France, the Champions League trophies, the hundreds of goals, and the 2022 World Cup. But some of it is also pure bemusement at how Messi operates on the pitch.\n\nMuch of the time, he seems to be wandering as he drifts into wide swaths of open field away from the action. He doesn't help his teammates defensively, nor does he do anything resembling pressing. Yet the Messi Stroll has always been a key feature of his game.\n\nHe paces around, bides his time, and springs into action from unconventional spots between defenders. The moment anyone gets close, Messi can pick out a pass to a teammate and the problems really begin -- especially when that teammate is his former Barcelona teammate Luis Su\u00e1rez. No player in the world has been on the receiving end of more Messi assists.\n\n\"I think it surprises a lot of people,\" Su\u00e1rez said after Messi set him up for three goals against New York. \"At this age, he's still trying to improve himself...and you can only feel the joy of what he's doing for soccer.\"", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [],

A humiliating 4-0 defeat to New York Red Bulls in late March was followed by elimination from the Concacaf Champions Cup at the hands of Mexican side Monterrey in early April.\n\nFormer USMNT defender Taylor Twellman posted a damning statistic on X, comparing the Argentinian manager's record in Miami to that of the man he replaced at Chase Stadium, Phil Neville.\n\nRelated: MLS power rankings: Columbus Crew continue to make history\n\n\"What if I told you that Tata Martino has a lower win % in MLS than Phil Neville did at Inter Miami ... would you believe me?!\" Twellman wrote. \"Neville finished his spell in south Florida with a win rate of just 38.9% while currently Martino's is at 38.2%.\"\n\nMeanwhile, reports in Spain suggested Martino could be replaced by Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez, with Miami making contact with the coach who, at the time, was due to leave his post at Barcelona this coming summer. Xavi has since agreed to stay on at the Camp Nou for another year.\n\nAfter the hammering at the hands of the Red Bulls, there was an air of resignation to Martino's comments to the media, as the 61-year-old accused his players of lacking commitment.\n\n\"There is not much to say, except that we were outmatched from start to finish,\" Martino said. \"When a team enters a game without the desire to win, without spirit, without competing, and the other side just wants to win the game, they are going to win it.\"\n\nThe key mitigating factor in Miami's underperformance was an injury crisis. Ahead of the team's sixth league game of the season, nine members of Martino's squad were listed as unavailable due to injury, more than any other team in the league. They drew 1-1 against New York City FC with an absentee list headlined by Lionel Messi, who missed a month with a hamstring strain.\n\nMiami's lopsided approach to roster construction - built around the acquisition of expensive superstars - means their squad is top-heavy in terms of talent and unable to absorb a spate of injuries, especially when their high-earning, big names are unavailable.\n\nWhen, in early April, Messi returned, Miami's fortunes reversed. The eight-time Ballon d'Or winner couldn't prevent the Champions Cup elimination: he clearly still lacked sharpness in the second-leg loss to Monterrey. But his league form has been absurd - the 36-year-old has scored seven goals and provided eight assists in five MLS games since his return, taking him to the top of the goals and assists charts - including a record five assists in a rout of the Red Bulls.\n\nNow that Miami are rolling, it's evident why they hired Martino in the first place.\n\nJust as the club co-owned by David Beckham has chased superstars on the pitch, Martino arrived last summer with a weighty resume and reputation to complement the players he oversees. His reputation was first built in South America. He won the Paraguayan Primera Divisi\u00f3n four times in the early to mid-2000s, with Libertad and then Club Cerro Porte\u00f1o. In charge of Paraguay between 2007 and 2011, he guided them to the quarter-finals of the 2010 World Cup - the nation's best-ever finish - and a Copa Am\u00e9rica final. He then took Newell's Old Boys in his native Rosario to an Argentinian title.\n\nHe worked with Messi for a season at Barcelona and then again during a two-year stint at the helm of Argentina, reaching another two Copa Am\u00e9rica finals.\n\nAfter two and a half years in charge of Mexico, Martino arrived at Inter Miami with proven MLS pedigree thanks to an MLS Cup triumph and an MLS Coach of the Year award with Atlanta United in 2018.\n\nRelated: Barcelona coach Gerardo Martino's ideology shaped by Old Boys' network | Jonathan Wilson\n\nHis vast experience, array of achievements and personal history with Messi was reflected in the contract, reportedly worth $5m a year, he signed at Chase Stadium. And while Miami's commitment of financial resources to players in midfield and attack - even full-back Jordi Alba is more of an asset going forward than defensively - has resulted in a porous backline, with 18 goals conceded in 12 MLS games so far this season, there is evidence of Martino's coaching nous higher up the pitch.\n\nAlthough his only trophy during his single season as Barcelona manager was a Super Cup, the Catalans were a fearsome attacking force under his charge, scoring 100 La Liga goals as they finished runners-up to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Martino's Atlanta were the highest scorer in MLS in the 2018 regular season, too, with 70 goals.\n\nWith Messi and Luis Su\u00e1rez leading the line, Miami are of course blessed with a level of attacking talent the envy of MLS. But the coordinated support of the team's wingers and full-backs, the careful spacing of players moving forward in unison providing passing lanes for Messi, has been a hallmark of their forward play, a result of Martino's work on the training pitch.\n\nMiami have scored 32 goals in 12 MLS games, by far the highest tally in the league - only LA Galaxy and Phil Neville's Portland Timbers have broken the 20 goal mark. With their Messi-less malaise now behind them, their ambition of winning multiple trophies this season is back in view and Martino's position appears as assured as ever, proving player health is often intrinsic to coaching success.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

With the Argentinian superstar continuing to wow home and away crowds across the MLS, fans can expect another packed house and high ticket prices online.\n\nTICKETS: See Lionel Messi and Inter Miami CF starting $212.\n\nNot only has Messi led Inter Miami to the very top of Major League Soccer's Eastern Conference, but he continues to smash MLS records along the way. He contributed to all six goals in Inter Miami's 6-2 win over New York last weekend, enabling teammate Luis Suarez's hat trick, and breaking the MLS record for assists by a single player in one game, at five. Just a week prior, he shattered the attendance record at New England's Gillette Stadium, drawing a crowd of more than 65,000.\n\nAll of which explains why tickets to Inter Miami vs. Montreal this weekend won't come cheap, with the lowest price available at the time of publishing at $212 from resellers like StubHub, VividSeats and SeatGeek. Those prices are a slight discount over standard admission rates from CF Montreal, which start at $309 Canadian, or about $224 USD.\n\nHere are the cheapest tickets available for the Inter Miami CF vs. CF Montreal MLS game on Saturday, May 11:\n\nPrices listed are as of the time of publishing, and are subject to change and additional fees. Prices listed in USD. The average resale ticket price for an Inter Miami CF game, according to SeatGeek, is $350.\n\nMontreal is a reasonable trip for fans in the Northeast and New England who want to see the biggest star in soccer before he retires. From Syracuse, New York, by car, it's four hours of driving time, and less than two hours from Burlington, Vermont. Even fans in Boston can get there in five hours, by car. If you're making the haul, find discounted Hotel rates on Hotels.com, and if you're thinking of flying, get the best deals on flights from Expedia.\n\nMiami commands the Eastern conference with a 7-3-2 record as they prepare to visit The Impact this week. Montreal currently sits 11th in the Eastern Conference with a 3-3-4 record, with some ground to cover if they want to be a playoffs contender. They lost 4-1 to Nashville on May 4, and drew 1-1 with Forge FC in the Canadian Championship quarterfinal on Tuesday.\n\nMessi has now scored 10 goals in eight MLS appearances for Inter this season, and proves pivotal during every game he's on the field. Inter felt his absence for a stretch earlier in the season, but he has returned at full force for the last six games. Montreal beat Inter Miami when they met on March 10, but Messi was absent during the match.", "source": {"uri": "syracuse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "syracuse"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

As they look to solidify their position as a dominant force in American soccer, the club is eyeing reinforcements in the upcoming transfer window to complement their star-studded lineup. With Messi leading the charge, Inter Miami's ambition knows no bounds as they seek to build a squad capable of challenging for domestic and international honors.\n\nSergio Ramos (Sevilla)\n\nSergio Ramos, the seasoned defender with a wealth of experience, could be a valuable addition to Inter Miami's backline. Despite his age, Ramos remains formidable on the pitch, offering leadership and defensive solidity. His partnership with Messi at PSG showcased their chemistry, making him an intriguing prospect for Miami's defensive setup. With his winning mentality and vast trophy cabinet, Ramos could provide invaluable guidance to Miami's younger defenders while shoring up their defense in crucial moments.\n\nLuka Modric (Real Madrid)\n\nLuka Modric's impending departure from Real Madrid presents an opportunity for Inter Miami to secure the services of a seasoned playmaker. With his exceptional passing range and tactical intelligence, Modric could form a formidable midfield duo alongside Sergio Busquets. His arrival would provide valuable mentorship to young talents within the squad while adding creativity to Miami's midfield. Modric's ability to control the game's tempo and unlock opposition defenses could prove instrumental in Inter Miami's pursuit of silverware, elevating the team's attacking prowess to new heights.\n\nNeymar (Al-Hilal)\n\nThe tantalizing prospect of reuniting Lionel Messi and Neymar on the field has captured the imagination of football fans worldwide. While Neymar's current injury status may pose a hurdle, his undeniable talent and flair make him a coveted target for Inter Miami. Despite salary constraints, Beckham's influence and Neymar's desire for a reunion could pave the way for a potential move to Florida. Neymar's electrifying dribbling skills and eye for goal would add a new dimension to Miami's attack, providing Messi with a world-class partner to wreak havoc on opposing defenses. His arrival would boost Inter Miami's on-field performances and elevate the club's global profile, attracting fans and sponsors alike.\n\nAntoine Griezmann (Atletico Madrid)\n\nAntoine Griezmann's admiration for MLS and his dream of playing alongside Messi again make him an intriguing target for Inter Miami. His versatility and creative prowess would add depth to Miami's attacking options, offering a valuable alternative to Messi in the final third. Griezmann's experience at the highest level of European football would bring a winning mentality to the squad, instilling confidence and belief among his teammates. With his ability to score goals and create chances, Griezmann could form a deadly partnership with Messi, unlocking defenses and propelling Inter Miami to success in domestic and international competitions.\n\nAndres Iniesta (Emirates Club)\n\nAndres Iniesta's illustrious career and timeless class make him an appealing prospect for Inter Miami. Despite his age, Iniesta's footballing intelligence and technical ability remain unmatched. His potential role as a utility player or mentor could prove invaluable to Miami's squad, offering invaluable experience and leadership both on and off the pitch. Iniesta's ability to dictate the tempo of the game and control possession would provide stability to Miami's midfield, allowing Messi and his teammates to flourish in the attacking third. His presence in the squad would enhance Miami's on-field performances and inspire the next generation of footballers in the United States.\n\nAs Inter Miami seeks to consolidate their position at the summit of MLS, the club's pursuit of these high-profile targets reflects their ambition and desire for continued success. With Lionel Messi leading the charge, the addition of experienced campaigners like Ramos, Modric, Neymar, Griezmann, and Iniesta could elevate Miami to heights in the upcoming season. As the summer transfer window approaches, all eyes will be on DRV PNK Stadium as Inter Miami looks to strengthen their squad and solidify their status as a footballing powerhouse in the United States. With a blend of experience, talent, and star power, Inter Miami is poised to make a statement in the MLS and beyond, ushering in a new era of dominance under the guidance of Lionel Messi and their marquee signings.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fahad_hamid@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Fahad Hamid", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Modri\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luka Modri\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Griezmann", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antoine Griezmann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Ramos", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Ramos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neymar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neymar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr\u00e9s_Iniesta", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Andr\u00e9s Iniesta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevilla_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sevilla FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Hilal_SFC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al Hilal SFC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dribbling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dribbling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Busquets", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Busquets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atl\u00e9tico_Madrid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atl\u00e9tico Madrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Beckham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Beckham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirates_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emirates Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Jai_Alai/Frontons", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Jai Alai/Frontons", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Inter-Miami-news-5-players-David-Beckham-could-target-in-the-2024-transfer-window.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545435", "eventUri": "eng-9545435", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

However, just over a month ago, head coach Gerardo 'Tata' Martino was facing intense scrutiny after a devastating 4-0 defeat to New York Red Bulls and elimination from the Concacaf Champions Cup.\n\nRumors began to swirl that Martino could be replaced by Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez, but those worries were put to rest as Xavi has agreed to stay at Barcelona. Despite the setbacks, Martino called out his players for their lack of commitment after a recent defeat, pointing to an injury crisis as a contributing factor to their underperformance.\n\nThe team received a major boost with the return of superstar Lionel Messi, who has propelled Miami to the top of the goals and assists charts in the MLS. Martino's coaching skills and his experience working with top teams and players, including Messi, have been crucial to Miami's attacking success.\n\nDespite struggling defensively, Miami has managed to score the highest number of goals in the league this season. With their formidable attacking talent and Martino's strategic coaching approach, the team has reignited their aspirations of clinching multiple trophies this season.\n\nAs Inter Miami continues to push forward in their quest for success, all eyes will be on Martino and his talented squad as they look to maintain their momentum and secure silverware in the MLS.

Messi, Arango, Puig", "body": "A third of the way into the 2024 regular season, we take a look at the front-runners for the Landon Donovan MVP Award.\n\nMLS Matchday 11 concluded on Sunday evening with a goalless draw on the West Coast between Seattle Sounders and LA Galaxy. In both the East and the West the table is starting to take shape, with Inter Miami and Real Salt Lake leading their respective conferences.\n\nWe're roughly a third of the way through the regular season and a few of the league's elite stars are also starting to emerge from the rest. Every year the league's Most Valuable Player is given the Landon Donovan MVP Award. The reigning MVP is Luciano Acosta who starred for 2023 Supporters' Shield winners FC Cincinnati. Acosta's win was the third time in five seasons that the league's MVP was awarded to a member of the team that lifted the Supporters Shield.\n\nWith that in mind, here's a look at three early front-runners for the 2024 Landon Donovan MVP Award...\n\nWill Lionel Messi win the MLS MVP?\n\nIn short, probably yes. The Inter Miami captain sparked a dramatic mid-season turnaround in 2023 but fell just short of leading his team to the playoffs. This time around, with the team better-suited to his extraordinary talents, Lionel Messi is the outright favourite to be crowned the league's best player at the conclusion of the 2024 regular season.\n\nHis Inter Miami sit top of Eastern Conference, albeit having played one extra game, and Messi leads the league for both goals and assists. He has managed that despite only starting in 58% of their MLS games so far. Taking the phrase 'Most Valuable Player' literally, Messi has a pretty convincing case. Inter Miami have won six of the seven games that he has started, winning just one of the four matches that he missed.\n\nSaturday's second half demolition of a strong New York Red Bulls team, with Messi recording an MLS-record five assists, was the latest in a string of jaw-dropping performances for the Argentine.\n\nChicho Arango leads RSL to the top\n\nMessi may grab the headlines but he is not the only MLS star enjoying a historic start to the campaign. Real Salt Lake pulled off a major coup last summer when they tempted 2022 MLS Cup winner Christian 'Chicho' Arango back to the league. The Colombian impressed in 2023 but his performances have gone to another level this year and he has led RSL to the top of the Western Conference.\n\nNamed club captain over the off-season, Arango is central to this exciting RSL attack and head coach Pablo Mastroeni has been full of praise for the striker. Salt Lake play a more measured, defensively compact style than Messi's Miami and that has placed greater offensive burden on Arango. The 29-year-old has certainly delivered. He has either scored (nine) or assisted (seven) 89% of Real Salt Lake's goals this season, 16 of their 18 MLS strikes. If RSL can clinch top spot in the Western Conference, Arango could have a real MVP claim.\n\nCan Riqui Puig make history with LA Galaxy?\n\nIn the 28-year history of the MLS MVP, midfielders rarely win the award. Passing, controlling, non-scoring midfielders like Riqui Puig are very rarely named the league's best. But if he can restore LA Galaxy to the level of genuine MLS Cup contenders the Spaniard would have a real claim to be named MVP. After a period of relentless success the Galaxy have struggled in the past decade, failing mount a realistic push for MLS Cup. In fact, in the past seven seasons they have made it to the post-season only twice.\n\nIn 2024, however, the Galaxy sit third in the Western Conference and are just two points adrift of leaders RSL. Puig has been at the heart of the team this year and has recorded the most passes in the league, beating out former Barcelona teammate Sergio Busquets. He has only provided three goals and two assists across ten MLS appearance but his vision has facilitated impressive performances from Joseph Paintsil and Dejan Joveljic while also helping with defensive stability.\n\nSpeaking to AS USA earlier this year, Puig made clear that he's targeting real success in his third season at the club: \"This year we no longer have excuses. The first year I arrived was one of adaptation, the second we had many injuries, but this year we have to produce our best football. It's a very important year for us, for the players, for the club and for the coach.\"", "source": {"uri": "as.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "as"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_m_haffey@as.com", "name": "Sean M.

Here's what caught our eye:\n\nJustin Ruderman: Lionel Messi (Inter Miami)\n\nI'm starting to wonder if there will ever be an edition of Justin and Favian's Weekly MLS Awards which Lionel Messi is not included. Probably not.\n\nNonetheless, this week he earned every bit of it.\n\nFor the first time in MLS history, a player assisted five goals in a single match. Just because he's Messsi, he scored a goal as well. \"Oh, and he did it in just one half.\"\n\nInter Miami is one third of the way through the MLS season and the MVP race may already be over. The only guy who might be able to catch him is the man Messi assisted for a hat trick but he'd probably need the Argentinian's help to do so which presents quite a conundrum. I'd put my money on the world champion.\n\nFavian Renkel: Luis Suarez (Inter Miami)\n\nImagine this: You score a hat trick with some beautiful goals in under 20 minutes, plus an assist, totaling four impactful goal contributions. You'd think you'd easily clinch Player of the Matchday, right? Wrong. Not when you're teammates with Lionel Messi. There he is, outshining you with five assists and a goal, making six historic goal contributions. This is the routine for Luis Suarez at Inter Miami, where even his first hat trick for the team is overshadowed by Messi's historic performance. Having to constantly take the backseat to all the fanfare must get tiring, but not for Suarez.\n\nThe Uruguayan happily plays the role of the sidekick as Messi takes center stage week in and week out. It's a good thing Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi are best friends, because there could be an issue on other teams or between other players. Due to the friendship and the experience these two have together, this is just a little friendly competition for MLS MVP between the two at this point, as they are the only two players in the league to have been named Players of the Month so far this season.\n\nWith Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi leading the MVP power rankings, this is the first time I can confidently say that a team has two genuine MVP candidates, despite the saying, \"A team with two MVP candidates has zero candidates\". From sharing Yerba Mates to possibly sharing the MVP trophy, I can guarantee this isn't the last time you will see Justin and I talking about Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez as our picks for Players of the Week.\n\nThe elephant in the room will be a topic of discussion throughout the season: Can the sidekick Suarez outshine his hero and secure the MLS MVP trophy all for himself?\n\nJR: Obed Vargas (Seattle Sounders)\n\nBut Justin, Seattle drew 0-0 with Galaxy! How could Obed Vargas be YPOTW?\n\nDon't forget, the Sounders played twice this week! Due to a rain delay earlier this season, Seattle finished their game against the Union on Tuesday, winning 3-2 as Vargas netted his first MLS goal.\n\nEven outside of his pinpoint curler to become the youngest Sounder to score for the club in their MLS era, the 18-year-old American was still the best player on the pitch in Chester. Vargas completed the most dribbles (5), won the most tackles (6) with a 100% success rate, and won the most duels (15) of any player in the match.\n\nThat elite performance led to a second start of the week on Sunday against the Galaxy when Jo\u00e3o Paulo's return to the lineup led to Vargas being employed as a right winger. It's not his natural position but one that head coach Brian Schmetzer still trusted him in more than the genuine wingers on the roster such as L\u00e9o Ch\u00fa due to his midweek performance. Although Seattle was unable to score against LA, the decision was clearly correct as Vargas caused Galaxy's defense the most trouble on the day.\n\nA midweek masterclass with the cherry on top from a noteworthy performance out of position earns Vargas his deserved recognition from me. Expect to hear his name more and more as he develops.\n\nFR: Jack McGlynn (Philadelphia Union)\n\nJust as Justin's pick, Obed Vargas, played twice this week, my pick for young player of the week, Jack McGlynn, also had two matches. With two games under his belt, the youngster shone for an offense that has struggled a bit as of late.\n\nWith two goals in two games, McGlynn had to be on this list, and you will see him later with one of the goals. The 20-year-old was able to open his account for the season and does not appear to be looking back. The Union have been struggling a bit ever since their were knocked out of being able to qualify for the Club World Cup with the elimination of CF Monterrey, yes they were Brandon Vazquez fans for a bit, they haven't been playing like their usual selves. Union Legend Andre Blake even took to Instagram to make some cryptic tweets about it not being the same love anymore.\n\nEven with the downward spiral that the Union are headed to, this is a great opportunity for a young player like McGlynn to make his mark and finally take over this team. This is the season that everyone is expecting Jack to make that jump in his play. Let's see if this is the start of that and Jack can truly become the player he's destined to be for the Union.\n\nJR: Jack McGlynn (Philadelphia Union)\n\nD.C. United was up 2-1 at halftime and clung to their lead for nearly the entire second half. That is until Jack McGlynn took matters into his own hands to ensure the Union left the nation's capitol with a point.\n\nOpening up on his left foot 25 yards from goal, the Union homegrown struck a swerving, dipping rocket into the opposite top corner. Postage stamp.\n\nThe American youth international simply hit a perfect shot from his position on the pitch. The initial direction caused D.C. goalkeeper Alex Bono to take one step in the wrong direction before turning back on himself as the ball bent backwards into the back of his net. It was so well hit that Bono surely wasn't getting there anyway, but the misdirection makes McGlynn's goal all the more impressive. The 20-year-old has already scored some beautiful goals in his Union career but this one surely has to be top of the pile.\n\nFR: Federico Bernadeschi (Toronto FC)\n\nBernadeschi is undoubtedly one of the standout players in Major League Soccer, and he's starting to shine even more as a leader for Toronto FC under John Herdman. At the beginning of the season, Toronto showed strength with impressive wins led by Insigne and Bernadeschi. However, a couple of weeks ago, Insigne got injured, and many feared that Toronto would struggle, especially considering their last-place finish the previous year. Surprisingly, even without their star player, Toronto FC has risen to become one of the top three teams in the Eastern Conference, thanks to other superstars stepping up during Insigne's absence.\n\nBernadeschi, particularly, has been the point person in this offense and has been burdening the load as his costar recovers. While his only criticism of Bernadeschi in MLS has been his difficulty finding the net consistently, but he finally found the back of the net for the first time this MLS season with a rebound of a blocked penalty. With the monkey off his back, Bernadeschi scored for a second time and this goal stole the show.\n\nWho thought Inter Miami wasn't going to win the Supporters' Shield?\n\nThe league leaders hosted third-place New York Red Bulls in what was expected to be a close, high-scoring affair. Only one of those came to fruition, however.\n\nBehind historic performances from our two POTW nominations, Lionel Messi and Luis Su\u00e1rez, Miami completely battered RBNY 6-2 to return the favor after losing 4-0 at Red Bull Arena earlier this season. The Herons may not be sufficiently clear at the top of the table to make such a statement yet I'm sure most would agree they are heavy Supporters' Shield favorites due to their legendary attacking duo.\n\nMessi and Su\u00e1rez now sit tied with 10 goals each atop the MLS Golden Boot race as well as first (Messi; 19) and second (Su\u00e1rez; 15) in direct goal contributions. Good luck stopping this team when those two are on a roll.\n\nFR: San Jose Earthquakes\n\nThe San Jose Earthquakes dominated LAFC at Levi's Stadium this weekend in front of a crowd of 43,000 people who witnessed this Quakes team emerge from the ruins of a season destined for the wooden spoon. The match between the two California teams wasn't even close, but it was more about how the Quakes were playing now than about LAFC's woes.\n\nIs it too early to say that the San Jose Earthquakes are back? With Hernan Lopez and Cristian Espinoza running the team, anything is possible. Luckily for the people of San Jose, MLS is a long season, and in the past, the first 10 games do not tend to matter as much in the grand scheme of things.\n\nIt's crazy to think about the impact a brand-new, historic DP signing can have on a team that was once destined to win the wooden spoon this year. While everyone else in the league was acquiring shiny new DPs to bolster their squads during the off-season, the Quakes chose to stay put. This decision may have been the right one for Leitch, the Quakes GM, and Luchi Gonzalez, the Quakes Head Coach, as they secured one of the best players from the Argentinian league.\n\nWith the blood of soccer legend Diego Maradonna running through his veins, Hernan is destined to achieve great things in the Black and Blue. It's only a matter of time before we see all the other Earthquake players around him start to perform at his level.\n\nCristian Espinoza, a former MVP candidate just last year, will now have more space to whip in crosses and rack up all the assists in this offense. Hernan makes the Quakes not so one-dimensional with their offensive approach, and this one-two Argentinian punch is a duo that can keep up with the rest of the league without any problem.\n\nKeep an eye on the Quakes because I see their stock rising dramatically in the next couple of months.\n\nJR: Parity league\n\nThe pressure on MLS owners to loosen the purse strings and league roster restrictions in the process is neverending but this weekend we saw the other side of that wonderful American debate. In a show of parity, the two teams at the bottom of each conference table won their matches on Saturday.\n\nThe New England Revolution took down the Fire in Chicago while the San Jose Earthquakes knocked off the reigning Western Conference champions in a dominant victory as Favian described. Both teams have been extremely poor in the first third of the season. So much so that even with their wins, they remain at the bottom of their respective conference. However, that is the perfect proof of the parity in this league. Steve Cherundolo put it perfectly.\n\nQuality will continue to have room for improvement but there is no question that the parity of MLS makes for one of if not the most entertaining league in world football. Don't forget to appreciate it.\n\nFR: Luciano Acosta makes history back to back Matchdays\n\nLuciano Acosta was able to make history in back-to-back Matchdays with being the all-time leading goalscorer in FC Cincinnati history and now having the fastest goal in FC Cincinnati history. All this was done with two completely different hairstyles and tons of confidence coming from the reigning MLS MVP. In this week matchup versus Orlando City, Acosta was able to score the lone goal of the match only 17 seconds into the match, to shock everyone in attendance at Inter&Co. Stadium. Not Inter Miami's Stadium, but the home of Orlando City or the \"Purple Team\".\n\nWith having Lionel Messi in the league, the MVP understands that he has to have a phenomenal season to even compete with the reigning World Cup Winner. That's what Luciano Acosta has exactly done approximately 1/3 through the season.\n\nLet's see if Lucho can keep breaking records and trying out different hairstyles.", "source": {"uri": "sbisoccer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SBI Soccer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "favian_renkel@sbisoccer.com", "name": "Favian Renkel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obed_Vargas", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Obed Vargas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_McGlynn", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jack McGlynn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Vargas", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eduardo Vargas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landon_Donovan_MVP_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Landon Donovan MVP Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LA_Galaxy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LA Galaxy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Insigne", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Insigne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Sounders_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Sounders FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L\u00e9o_Ch\u00fa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "L\u00e9o Ch\u00fa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Vazquez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Vazquez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Bono", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Bono"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Blake", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andre Blake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supporters'_Shield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supporters' Shield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose_Earthquakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Jose Earthquakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Schmetzer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brian Schmetzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.C._United", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "D.C.

While Griezmann has previously stated his commitment to Atletico, the allure of a new challenge in the United States may prove irresistible. However, the financial intricacies of any potential transfer remain a point of contention, given Griezmann's existing contract with Atletico Madrid, which extends for another two years.\n\nThe David Beckham Connection\n\nAdding intrigue to the speculation, Griezmann recently had a personal encounter with David Beckham, co-owner of Inter Miami and a footballing icon in his own right. Describing Beckham as an \"idol,\" Griezmann's admiration for the former Manchester United and Real Madrid star suggests a potential affinity for Inter Miami's vision and ambitions. Beckham's instrumental role in luring Messi to the United States underscores the club's ability to attract top talent, further fueling anticipation about Griezmann's potential move.\n\nWhile the prospect of a move to MLS may tempt Griezmann, his immediate focus remains on the European Championship, scheduled from mid-June to mid-July. With France among the favorites to clinch the title, Griezmann's primary objective will be representing his country and vying for glory on the international stage.

And I always had the plan to bring the greatest player to ever play the game in my opinion to our team. Luckily, it happened.'\n\nKimmel pressed Beckham about his claim that Messi is the greatest soccer player ever, but the late-night host admitted the former Los Angeles Galaxy and Manchester United star has an opinion that holds more weight than others.\n\n'I think everyone's got their own opinions, there's a lot of great players to have played the game over the years.

'There was only 13 teams in the league, now there's almost 30. It's in a different position than what it is when I first came.'\n\n'He's always loved Miami,' Beckham continued.

Their bond transcends competition.\n\nThe dynamic duo of Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi has once again united, this time not under the banner of Barcelona but on the sun-soaked pitches of Inter Miami in the MLS. As close friends and former teammates, their on-field chemistry is undeniable, but with both vying for the MLS Golden Boot, will their camaraderie be tested by the heat of competition?\n\nA Friendly Rivalry Turning Serious for the MLS Golden Boot\n\nDespite their pursuits of goal-scoring glory, Suarez and Messi have maintained a bond forged over years of shared triumphs and mutual respect. Suarez's recent hat-trick heroics against the New York Red Bulls catapulted him to the top of the MLS goal-scoring charts alongside Messi, igniting speculation of a potential rivalry between the two prolific forwards. However, Suarez swiftly quashed any notion of animosity, emphasizing their collaborative spirit reminiscent of their days in Barcelona.\n\nIn an interview with the Miami Herald, Suarez eloquently expressed his perspective: \"No, no. It's not like that. We played together for a long time at Barcelona, and it was always like this, each helping the other. In 2015-16, Leo and Neymar helped me win the Golden Boot. The competition is to see your team-mate happy and work together to win. Note that [against the Red Bulls], Leo broke a league mark with five assists, something that had not been seen before, and that shows what kind of team-mate he is.\"\n\nHis words echo the sentiment of teamwork and camaraderie that has defined their relationship both on and off the pitch. Suarez's acknowledgment of Messi's record-breaking five assists in a single match speaks volumes about their selflessness and dedication to each other's success. In a league where individual accolades often take precedence, their shared history and genuine camaraderie transcend the pursuit of personal glory.\n\nAs they embark on their MLS journey together, Suarez and Messi are poised to leave an indelible mark on the league through their goal-scoring exploits and their enduring friendship and mutual support. While the race for the Golden Boot may intensify as the season progresses, the bond between these two footballing maestros remains unbreakable, serving as a testament to the power of friendship amidst the competitive fervor of professional sports.\n\nIn conclusion, while Suarez and Messi may find themselves in a friendly competition for MLS goal-scoring supremacy, their shared history and camaraderie ensure that their pursuit of individual accolades does not overshadow their collective objectives. As they continue to dazzle fans with their on-field brilliance, their partnership serves as a reminder that even amid competition, true friendship prevails.\n\nTheir reunion in Miami signifies a new chapter in their illustrious careers and a continuation of the legacy they built together at Barcelona. As they don the colors of Inter Miami, they carry with them the hopes and dreams of fans worldwide, united in their pursuit of success on the pitch and their unwavering friendship off it. So, while the race for the MLS Golden Boot may be underway, one thing remains certain: Suarez and Messi are not just teammates; they are brothers in arms, bound by a shared passion for the beautiful game.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fahad_hamid@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Fahad Hamid", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Red Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Herald", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Herald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neymar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neymar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Friendship", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Friendship", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Competitions", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rope_Skipping/Clubs_and_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rope Skipping/Clubs and Teams", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Awards/Golden_Globe_Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Awards/Golden Globe Awards", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Camp_and_Competition_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Camp and Competition Companies", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Lionel-Messi-and-Luis-Suarez-set-to-battle-for-the-MLS-Golden-Boot.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545435", "eventUri": "eng-9545435", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

It also set new high marks for assists and goal contributions in one MLS game.\n\nIt was a masterclass second half from Miami, forever overshadowing the fact that the Red Bulls went into halftime with a 1-0 lead.\n\nBefore breaking down how Miami scored six goals in 45 minutes, thanks in large part to Messi, it's important to understand the opponent. New York's season was off to a great start entering Saturday night, having lost just once in their first 10 games. Emil Forsberg has swiftly acclimated to his new starring role in midfield, homegrown players Daniel Edelman and John Tolkin have continued to impress and last year's marquee signing Dante Vanzeir has been a chance-creating machine. On Saturday, the roles reversed with Forsberg setting up Vanzeir's second goal of the season.\n\nThey've also found success despite a notable departure from their football group's guiding principles. The Red Bulls appointed former Hertha BSC manager Sandro Schwarz as head coach this offseason. Seemingly, that appointment also came with approval to abandon the dogmatic Red Bull DNA, allowing his team to defend differently than years past.\n\nPlaying with a similarly positioned defensive line -- the average opponent has been flagged offside 26 meters from goal in both 2023 and 2024 -- the Red Bulls have traded some of that energy expending from high pressing for additional intentionality in possession. They're more selective with their passes instead of forcing it upfield, going from a 71.6% completion rate in 2023 to 80.7% this year.\n\nThat focus on retention extends to their backline, which is far less likely to hoof it down the center of the pitch than in bygone seasons.\n\nIt's important to stress that this year's New York Red Bulls are a good team who have been doing good things for the majority of the season. It's also worth emphasizing that this is a good team that's still working on encoding a new coach's scheme into its second-nature decision making.\n\nWith that said, here's how Miami forced them into one of the worst 45-minute windows that any MLS team has ever experienced.\n\nMiami usually begins sequences 45.6 meters from Drake Callender's net -- average for an MLS team since 2019. They also like stringing together long series of passes. 14.3% of Miami's sequences this season involve nine or more passes. That's second-highest in the league (trailing the LA Galaxy), and is also higher than any team has recorded in a full season since the start of 2019. On Saturday, they raised that rate to 17.6% of their sequences against New York.\n\nThe most lethal example came just after halftime. A misplayed ball by Frankie Amaya led to Miami clearing it off an opponent for a throw-in. Fourteen passes later, they were back on level terms.\n\nMiami takes its time to plot its course upfield. Inviting pressure into their defensive half declutters the part of the field that serves as Messi's playground. Given some relatively limited mobility at play, relying on progressing upfield on the dribble would be an arduous task. Instead, slinging passes is the solution -- and doing so effectively requires plenty of open space, hence the recirculations.\n\nEventually, four Red Bulls commit to pressing, and there's enough room for some home cooking. Sergio Busquets -- remember him? He's become weirdly anonymous as we discuss Miami -- knocks the ball into the space to his right before cleanly hitting a 45-meter pass to Messi, with midfielder Mat\u00edas Rojas darting forward to add another option.\n\nMessi serves as an unconventional hold-up forward in these cases: obviously far more diminutive than the usual battering ram, but his technical ability in tight spaces and otherworldly reading of a live game can be even more effective. Plus, he's generally accepted as the focal point of every defense's game-planning. He's the fire, they're the moths. It often goes up in flames.\n\nHere, Suarez can't win an aerial duel, with the ball falling to Andres Reyes, who hits it wide to Kyle Duncan. The right back tries a give-and-go with Wikelman Carmona.\n\n(Note: Here we will refer to an Argentine, a Colombian, a Paraguayan, and a Uruguayan -- and plenty of players from the United States. It could also have mentioned a Brazilian and an Ecuadorian from Miami's bench. Fight back that Copa Am\u00e9rica fever while you can.)\n\nFrom there, Rojas converges as Carmona looks upfield. To him, any forward progress is a risk, and he seems to retain possession -- one of those breaks from past principles. The indecision leaves him facing his own goal as Rojas pokes around him to knock the ball off of his shin to where Suarez is, having only just returned to his feet. Suarez helps the ball get to Messi, and you've seen what happens next hundreds of times over the years.\n\nIn a way, the goal happens because Suarez plays possum rather than in spite of the tumble. New York let its guard down around the Uruguayan, and some smart two-man pressing manipulated the Red Bulls enough to bring Suarez back into the play. The decision-making is suspect, but this Suarez-to-Messi goal is really the product of two supporting players' industry.\n\nIn Brazil, Mat\u00edas Rojas' biggest strengths were progressing the ball with his passing, shooting at relative volume, outpacing his expected goals with his goal output and being proactive at challenging opponents in possession. The Paraguayan joined Miami within budget last month after freeing himself from contract constraints with Corinthians thanks to unpaid image rights disputes.\n\nRojas would be the best or second-best player on at least eight other MLS teams. Amongst Miami's ex-Barcelona bunch, he's more of a grizzled character actor than a leading man.\n\nIn just his second MLS appearance, Rojas (who came on at halftime) is already forging a partnership in the build-up with Messi. The duo weaves through the Red Bull midfield, as multiple opponents are now committing fully to any opportunity to win back the ball and regain a foothold before this gets ugly. Unfortunately, it also leaves them just out of position when a lunge doesn't pay off.\n\nThe pair gets from midfield to the box in seven seconds, finessing through five opponents in the central channel with absolute precision. You get the sense that Rojas is really going to enjoy playing with Messi.\n\nSince making his regular season debut in August, Miami is 8-2-1 when Messi is in the starting lineup. All three teams that managed to nick a result forced Miami to shoot beyond 18 yards on at least 35% of their attempts. Miami has a record of 2-2-1 when taking shots outside the box that often and 6-0-0 when taking at least two-thirds from inside the box. It's a small sample size, but the theory makes sense in concept: it's harder to convert from long-range and hard to avoid players between the ball and goal.\n\nGranted, making Miami shoot deep still isn't a winning lottery ticket for your career. The one team to beat Miami when Messi started was Charlotte FC, who silenced Miami 1-0 on October 21 to secure a spot in the play-in round of the MLS Cup Playoffs. The coach behind that performance, Christian Lattanzio, was fired two weeks later and is still unemployed.\n\nThis past weekend, the Red Bulls were not among those five teams to force over a third of Miami's shots to come from long distance.\n\nIn the past, Messi would take a ball like Suarez's from Frame III, dart toward the box on his left foot, and make a goalkeeper look silly. Whether to protect his hamstring or set records for fun, he looks to play distributor as New York hurries back into its shape. The midfield is gassed, leaving the Red Bulls' backline to fend for themselves.\n\nIt's hard to explain why two center backs would simultaneously decide not to at least get into Suarez's space as Messi sets up to pass at the edge of the box. Perhaps Sean Nealis (the closer center back, top in the gif) wanted to be ready in case Messi rounded his teammates and dribbled toward goal. No matter the intention, it probably didn't go according to plan, as Suarez is in the right spot to swing a leg and get in on the scoring.\n\nMiami has been far better at pressing from the front in 2024, forcing opponents into turnovers in their defensive third to create short-distance attacking moments. Through a dozen games, 21.7% of Miami's possession sequences began in the attacking third. This approach caters to Suarez and Messi's lack of mobility at this stage in their careers.\n\nOn Saturday, Miami began its possessions in the final third for just 9.9% of its sequences. That's the lowest rate since Messi joined, with the previous being 13.8% against the Red Bulls last August. Doing so limited the potential for quick-strike counters and required a team of veterans to log more yards. In theory, this would help.\n\nIn practice, that task is made easier when the veteran team is on a hot streak and the more youthful one is frustrated and tired.\n\nEdelman, Red Bulls' 21-year-old midfielder, gets beaten with a classic on-ball Messi feint, and his begging for assistance goes unanswered. Messi and Suarez are off, and the Red Bulls more closely resemble a herd of deer staring down some hot pink headlights.\n\nThe pair picked the defense apart through good footwork, smart passing and second-nature trust in a teammate's decision-making concurrent with your own. Even if Suarez isn't the runner he used to be, he's still brilliant in the final third.\n\nMore of the same, really. Suarez and Messi are out there having a catch in the \"Field of Dreams\", and everyone around them may as well be a ghost.\n\nThat doesn't take away from a couple of brilliant individual tricks in the sequence, from Messi's outer-boot assist to Suarez's control to get around goalkeeper Carlos Coronel and finish from a quickly closing angle.\n\nCoronel registered -2.73 goals prevented when comparing six conceded goals to the expected goals on target he faced. How bad is that? Since the start of 2019, there have been 4,711 times where a goalkeeper has played all 90 minutes in an MLS game. Only four among those thousands had a worse rate in any one contest, each ultimately conceding six or seven goals.\n\nThere wasn't one obvious error that Miami exploited, and the Red Bulls' midfield and forward lines largely played well. The reality remains that Miami is just that good when Messi and Suarez start. The duo has made a mockery of more illustrious competitions and opponents throughout their careers.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors":

Here's what we know.", "body": "Memo to Inter Miami fans: Enjoy dynamic duo Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez in May, because come June, both top MLS scorers could be taking a hiatus from the league while they play in the Copa America tournament.\n\nThey could miss as many as seven MLS games in June and July, depending on how far their national teams advance.\n\nThere was never any doubt that Messi, captain of Argentina's World Cup winning squad in 2022, would be on the roster for the upcoming Copa America, which kicks off June 20, is being played across 14 U.S. cities and concludes July 14 with the championship game at Hard Rock Stadium.\n\nArgentina is the defending Copa America champion and Messi is expected to be a major attraction at the Albiceleste's three group stage games in the Copa opener vs. Canada in Atlanta June 20, the June 25 game against Chile in New Jersey, and the June 29 game against Peru at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens.\n\nBut Suarez's status with the Uruguay national team is not as clear. The 37-year-old \"Pistolero\" (gunslinger) has not played in his national shirt since the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Coach Marcelo Bielsa left Suarez off the roster for a pair of March friendlies, but according to reporter Rodrigo Romano of DSports in Uruguay, Suarez, who has scored 10 goals in 11 MLS games, was included in the provisional roster for the Copa America.\n\n\"Bielsa called up 35 players. With a minimum of 35 and a maximum of 55, he opted for the minimum. Luis Su\u00e1rez is included,\" Romano reported on Wednesday.\n\nThe deadline for participating teams to submit their preliminary rosters was May 5. The final roster for each nation is due by June 12. Provisional rosters can be anywhere between 35 and 55 players, and the final roster cap is 23 players.\n\nSuarez, who joined Inter Miami in June, has been among the league's best players. He has 12 goals and seven assists across all competitions and is tied with Messi atop the MLS Golden Boot race with 10 goals. If he makes the final Uruguay roster, he would not have to travel far for the first game, as Uruguay plays Panama at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens on June 23.\n\nOther Inter Miami players who could be called up for national team duty include goalkeeper Drake Callender (USA), midfielder Matias Rojas (Paraguay), and forward Leo Campana (Ecuador).\n\nMiami games that fall from mid-June to late-July are: on the road vs. Philadelphia on June 15, home vs. defending MLS champion Columbus on June 19, on the road vs. Nashville June 29, on the road vs. Charlotte July 3, on the road July 6 vs. Cincinnati, home vs. Toronto on July 17 and home vs. Chicago on July 20.\n\nBecause of the potential absences, coach Tata Martino has been stressing how critical it is for Inter Miami to rack up points in the standings early in the season, which it has. Miami leads the Eastern Conference and the Supporters Shield race with 24 points and leads MLS with 32 goals and a plus-14 goal differential.\n\nAlba back from injury\n\nJordi Alba, who missed the past three games with a hamstring injury, returned to training on Wednesday morning. His status for the road game Saturday at Montreal is unknown, but he participated in practice with the team.\n\nFranco Negri has been filling in at left back for Alba and said he has learned a lot from the former FC Barcelona star.\n\n\"I have learned from Jordi's calm demeanor and the time he takes to make decisions because I tend to be more anxious,\" Negri said. \"I am trying to learn from all of them, from Busi, Suarez, Leo, mainly how calm they are on the ball and trying to see the field the way they do. The passes they make are ridiculous, it motivates you to have them as teammates and my main takeaway has been their calmness on the field.\"\n\nNegri, Freire mourn death of Menotti\n\nInter Miami's Argentinean players commented on the death this week of Cesar Luis Menotti, the legendary player and coach of Argentina's 1978 World Cup championship team.\n\n\"He was a grand figure in Argentina and all of the soccer world is mourning,\" Freire said. \"He had a big impact on our style of play and we have to respect his family and send condolences from all the players.\"\n\nNegri added: \"A very tragic loss for the entire soccer world because he was well known world-wide. In my case, I was at his school studying to be a coach, so, his fundamentals, his way of playing the game was highly respected. A lot of the world's coaches have said it, so may he rest in peace.\"\n\nNegri said he completed his courses to be a coach after three years in the program and all he has left to get his license is his on-field training hours. He is also studying for a master's degree in sport administration.\n\n\"As players we do have obligations, but in the afternoon we have plenty free time and I wanted to prepare myself for the future to stay in the sport,\" Negri said.", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michelle_kaufman@miamiherald.com", "name": "Michelle

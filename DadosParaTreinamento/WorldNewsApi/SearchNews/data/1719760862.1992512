{"id": 225063406, "title": "Weather Network predicts warm summer, wildfire risks in some regions", "text": "Wildfires and smoke risks are also top of mind in the Prairies, where drought is a major concern, and a very warm summer is expected across Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Alberta, however, will see a \"typical\" summer and many regions could get a break from severe dry periods if an active storm south of the border shifts north, bringing rain totals to near normal. Precipitation levels in recent months bode well for farmers, Scott added. \"This winter was not looking good,\" he said. \"We didn't have a lot of snowfall, but Mother Nature turned on the taps and we've got a quite a bit of moisture lately, so we're going into the growing season in better shape than it was looking like just a few months ago.\" Relief is also in sight for British Columbia, where heat is forecast to be \"less persistent and less severe\" than it has been in the past few years. Though dry periods are anticipated, scattered showers and thunderstorms are expected to be more numerous and widespread than in past years. \"Back three years ago, we had the devastating heat wave in B.C.\" Scott said. \"While we can't rule out the risk of heat wave, this does not look like a record hot summer for B.C., which I think is pretty good news for most people.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 29, 2024.", "summary": "\"We'd be very surprised, very surprised, if this didn't turn out overall as a warm summer,\" Chris Scott, the Weather Network's chief meteorologist, said in an interview.", "url": "https://www.nationalobserver.com/2024/05/29/news/weather-network-warm-summer-wildfire-risks", "image": "https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/nationalobserver.com/files/styles/nat_social/public/img/2024/05/29/f3830b568e4aeb2480407ea5f4b46f3f67876d6041a1bac7f34f40d2a6496ee3.jpg?itok=jyFIXI9y", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:12:50", "author": "Tara Deschamps", "authors": ["Tara Deschamps"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": 0.083}

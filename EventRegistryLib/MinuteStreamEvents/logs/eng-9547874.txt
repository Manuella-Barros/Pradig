In the weeks following, O'Reilly began feuding with the Undisputed Kingdom, which includes two of his former Undisputed Era stablemates, Adam Cole and Roderick Strong. As he now looks toward the future, O'Reilly is hoping to expand his reach to even more members of the AEW roster.\n\nIn a recent episode of Casual Conversations with The Classic, O'Reilly was asked to identify some of his desired first-time opponents. In response, O'Reilly pointed toward former FTW Champion HOOK.\n\n\"I'd like to wrestle HOOK a lot,\" O'Reilly said. \"He's really good. He uses legitimate technique, and I appreciate that. Those are people that all work well with.\"\n\nLooking further down the line, O'Reilly noted that is also keen on facing one of AEW's newest signees, Will Ospreay, at the AEW All In event in London.\n\n\"Considering it's Wembley [Stadium] and it could potentially be home turf for him, how could I not say Will Ospreay [as my All In dream opponent]? The guy is just a phenomenal talent,\" O'Reilly said. \"You watch him and it's like 'Wow.' You're like watching history happen before your eyes right when you see him wrestle.\"\n\n\"Recently on Dynamite, we wrestled for the first time ever. We had never touched. I thought we had good chemistry, so yeah if I'm fantasy booking, I'd love to wrestle Will. I'd love to wrestle Will on Dynamite any week of the year. but Wembley. Could you imagine a better environment to wrestle a guy like that?' I don't think so.\"\n\nAs O'Reilly mentioned, he and Ospreay recently shared the ring for the very first time.

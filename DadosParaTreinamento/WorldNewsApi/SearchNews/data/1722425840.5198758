{"id": 243231680, "title": "Biden Administration Opposes Surgery for Transgender Minors", "text": "The Biden administration said this week that it opposed gender-affirming surgery for minors, the most explicit statement to date on the subject from a president who has been a staunch supporter of transgender rights. The White House announcement was sent to The New York Times on Wednesday in response to an article reporting that staff in the office of Adm. Rachel Levine, an assistant secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services, had urged an influential international transgender health organization to remove age minimums for surgery from its treatment guidelines for minors. The draft guidelines would have lowered the age minimums to 14 for hormonal treatments, 15 for mastectomies, 16 for breast augmentation or facial surgeries, and 17 for genital surgeries or hysterectomies. The final guidelines, released in 2022, removed the age-based recommendations altogether. \u201cAdm. Levine shared her view with her staff that publishing the proposed lower ages for gender transition surgeries was not supported by science or research, and could lead to an onslaught of attacks on the transgender community,\u201d an H.H.S. spokesman said in a statement on Friday evening.", "summary": "The statement followed a report in The Times that a federal health official had urged the removal of age minimums from treatment guidelines for transgender minors.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/health/transgender-surgery-biden.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/28/science/28surgery/28surgery-facebookJumbo.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:37:07", "author": "Noah Weiland,Teddy Rosenbluth", "authors": ["Noah Weiland", "Teddy Rosenbluth"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.342}

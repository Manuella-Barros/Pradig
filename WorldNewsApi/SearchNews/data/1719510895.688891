The plane, which was headed from Doha to Dublin, was met by emergency services on landing in the Irish capital just before 1pm on Sunday. Dublin Airport Authority (daa) said in a statement: \"Qatar Airways flight QR107 from Doha landed safely as scheduled at Dublin Airport shortly before 13.00.\" As reported by the Mirror, emergency responders - including airport police and fire crews - met the aircraft on landing. The DAA added: \"The Dublin Airport team continues to provide full assistance on the ground to passengers and airline staff.\" It comes just days after a 73-year-old British man died when a plane from London to Singapore suffered extreme turbulence and plunged 6,000ft in a matter of seconds. Geoffrey Ralph Kitchen, who reportedly had a pre-existing heart issue, was travelling on the Singapore Airlines flight with his wife when he was killed. His wife was injured and is being treated in hospital. There were 211 passengers and 18 crew on board - including 47 passengers from the UK and four Irish nationals. The Boeing 777 plane left the UK on Monday evening at 10.17pm local time. However, flight SQ321 experienced severe turbulence over Myanmar. Data collected from Flightradar showed how the plane suddenly dropped 6,000ft as it approached the coast of Thailand. It made an emergency landing at Bangkok. One passenger on board the flight said the plane suffered a \"dramatic drop\", meaning people not wearing a seatbelt were \"launched immediately into the ceiling\". Another passenger, Jerry, who was travelling to his son's wedding, told the BBC the day was \"the worst of my life\". Speaking with a bandage covering part of his head, he said: \"Things were going very smoothly at first. I'd just been to the loo, came back, sat down, bit of turbulence, and suddenly the plane plunged. I don't know how far, but it was a long way. (It was) so sudden, there was no warning at all, and I ended up hitting my head on the ceiling, my wife did.\" He added: \"Some poor people walking around ended up doing somersaults. It was absolutely terrible, and then suddenly it stopped and it was calm again, and the staff did their best to tend to the injured people. There were a lot of them and some of the staff are injured themselves, so they did a sterling job.\" Images posted on social media showed damage to the ceiling of the cabin, and food, cutlery and other debris strewn on the floor after the incident. Singapore Airlines said in a statement: \"Singapore Airlines flight SQ321, operating from London Heathrow to Singapore on May 20, encountered severe turbulence en route. We can confirm that there are injuries and one fatality on board. Singapore Airlines offers its deepest condolences to the family of the deceased.\" Don't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign up to our daily newsletter here.", "summary": "The Qatar Airways plane, which was headed from Doha, was met by emergency services on landing in the Irish capital just before 1pm on Sunday.", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/mid-air-horror-12-people-32896356", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32896178.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Qatar-787-Ln-58-air-to-air.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:36:09", "author": "Ryan Carroll,Ryan Fahey", "authors": ["Ryan Carroll", "Ryan Fahey"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.537}

Manish Sisodia's bail in Delhi liquor policy case today", "body": "Sisodia was arrested in February 2023Supreme Court had reserved its order on Sisodia's bail pleaDelhi High Court had termed the case as grave misuse of power\n\nThree days after it reserved its order, the Supreme Court on Friday is set to pronounce its verdict on the bail plea filed by former Delhi Deputy Chief Minister, Manish Sisodia, in the Delhi liquor policy case.\n\nSisodia has been behind bars since his arrest in February last year.\n\nDuring the last court hearing, investigating agencies Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) were asked what would be the \"end of the tunnel\" for the trial.\n\nA bench of justices BR Gavai and KV Vishwanathan had questioned this, pointing out that there are 493 witnesses in the case, assuming that even if 50 per cent are dropped, it comes to nearly 250.\n\nThe court had asked the agency lawyers to be realistic and see what's happening on the ground.\n\nThe court had also questioned the Enforcement Directorate about whether the rise in alleged profit margins in the Delhi excise policy was enough to indicate that a crime was committed by Sisodia.\n\nThe court had remarked that the prima facie guilt aspect may not be correct as even the chargesheet is arguably based on suspicion.\n\nRepresenting both, the CBI and the ED, Additional Solicitor General (ASG) SV Raju stated that Sisodia had been delaying the trial and was seeking inspection of the unreliable documents.\n\nThe ASG had blamed Sisodia for ruining the lives of several families due to the liquor policy and stated that being from a party that has come into power based on anti-corruption, Sisodia is involved in corruption that runs into hundreds of crores.\n\nManish Sisodia was arrested by the CBI on February 26, 2023, for alleged corruption in the formulation and implementation of the Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22 after multiple rounds of questioning.\n\nShortly after, the ED arrested Sisodia in a money laundering case stemming from the First Information Report (FIR) filed by the CBI on March 9 last year, following questioning at the Tihar Jail.\n\nSisodia resigned from the Delhi cabinet on February 28.\n\nHe is presently under investigation by both the CBI and the ED for his alleged role in corruption and money laundering.\n\nOn March 31, the trial court dismissed Sisodia's bail application in a corruption case investigated by the CBI, referring to him as the prima facie architect of the alleged liquor scam.\n\nThis was followed by the dismissal of bail in the ED case as well.\n\nAs the lower court's decision was challenged, a Delhi High Court judge refused to grant him bail, stating that the allegations against him were \"very serious in nature\" and that the excise policy was formed \"in conspiracy for undue advantage.\"\n\nThis was despite Sisodia's lawyers arguing that he had been singled out in the case, and he was being accused of conspiracy in relation to a policy that was vetted by others.\n\nThe Supreme Court denied him bail and granted him liberty to seek bail again if the trial is delayed.\n\nWhile pronouncing the order, the court also stated that a money trail of Rs 338 crore was \"tentatively established\" in the case.\n\nThe Supreme Court, however, allowed Sisodia to move for bail again within three months if the trial proceeds sloppily or slowly.\n\nIn May this year, Delhi's Rouse Avenue Court rejected Sisodia's bail plea on grounds of a delay in the trial.\n\nThe court dismissed his contention that the proceedings in the case had been delayed or protracted or moving at a snail's pace.\n\nThe court, in strongly worded remarks, said there was a concerted effort by Sisodia and the other accused to cause delay in the matter.\n\n\"It is apparent that Sisodia individually, and along with different accused, has been filing one or the other application/making oral submissions frequently, some of them frivolous, that, too, on a piecemeal basis, apparently as a concerted effort to accomplish the shared purpose of causing a delay in the matter,\" the court said.\n\nThe court observed that the steady progression of the case, despite the apparent attempts to slow down its progress, cannot, by any standards, be equated with a \"snail's pace\".\n\nThe court opined that the 'so-called delay' caused in the progression of the case is also clearly on account of reasons attributable to the applicant.\n\nSisodia's bail plea was again turned down in May this year, this time by the Delhi High Court, which said that the matter involved \"grave misuse of power\" and \"breach of public interest\" by the AAP leader.\n\nThe high court also said that Sisodia was a very powerful and influential person within the power corridors of the Delhi government as he had the responsibility of 18 portfolios in the city dispensation.\n\nIt also noted that the material collected during the investigation showed that the applicant 'subverted' the process of making the policy by 'fabricating' public feedback to suit his \"predetermined goal\".\n\nLater, granting no relief to Sisodia, the Supreme Court's vacation bench in June disposed of his bail plea asking him to revive the bail plea after the final chargesheet was filed in the Delhi excise policy case.\n\nThe disposal of the petition had come after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for investigating agencies ED and CBI, had told the bench that, \"They will complete their probe in the Delhi excise policy case within two weeks, and file the chargesheet before the trial court.\"", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

However, due to a delay in initiating the trial, Sisodia sought bail again, only to have his plea dismissed by the Delhi High Court on May 21.

The court had expressed serious doubts over the trial's timely conclusion, considering the large number of witnesses and accused listed by the CBI and ED.\n\nThe agencies have alleged that Sisodia and other accused were intimidating witnesses who had turned approvers.

This decision comes after Sisodia spent 17 months in jail.\n\nA bench consisting of Justices BR Gavai and KV Viswanathan granted bail to Sisodia, setting conditions that include a bail bond of \u20b910 lakh with two sureties, the surrendering of his passport, and reporting twice a week on Mondays and Thursdays to the Investigating Officer. The court has also instructed Sisodia not to attempt to influence witnesses or tamper with evidence.\n\nThe Supreme Court had reserved its order on this case on August 6. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) had argued that the petition was premature, contending that Sisodia should have first sought relief from the trial court.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision to grant bail reflects ongoing concerns about the length of the legal process and Sisodia's extended detention. The case highlights the challenges faced in legal proceedings involving high-profile figures and complex cases.\n\nThis ruling marks the third time Sisodia had approached the Supreme Court for bail. Previously, on October 30 of last year, the top court denied bail but allowed Sisodia the option to renew his plea if the trial did not progress within a reasonable time frame. As the trial faced delays, Sisodia sought bail again on grounds of the protracted legal process. The Delhi High Court rejected his plea on May 21, prompting Sisodia to approach the Supreme Court once more in June.\n\n(This is a developing story.

The order was reserved on Tuesday.\n\nThis is the third time Sisodia has approached the top court for bail. Last year, on October 30, the top court refused to grant him bail but kept a window open by allowing him to revive his bail plea if the trial fails to conclude in the next six to eight months or proceeds at a snail's pace.\n\nRead Here | Documents show Manish Sisodia's neck-deep involvement in Delhi excise \"scam\": ED to SC\n\nAs the trial failed to begin in six months, Sisodia sought bail on the grounds of delay, but the Delhi high court rejected his plea on May 21. He approached the top court in June when ED told a vacation bench that it would be filing its complaint (or charge sheet) by July 3. Recording this submission, the court refused to go into the merits of the petition. Last month, Sisodia filed his third plea for bail, taking a second shot against the high court order of May 21.\n\nAfter hearing elaborate arguments by senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for Sisodia, and additional solicitor general (ASG) SV Raju for the investigating agencies, the bench raised serious doubts over the possibility of the trial ending soon.\n\nCBI had listed 493 witnesses and 57 accused, while the ED case had 224 witnesses and 40 accused. Raju submitted that the trial was at a crucial stage and nearly eight to 10 witnesses, who are working under the Delhi government, could be influenced as they have turned approvers, and recorded statements against the accused, following which they have allegedly been threatened by some of the accused.\n\nSinghvi told the court that in matters of personal liberty, courts have weighed in favour of individual freedom, and by delaying the trial, the petitioner's right to speedy trial guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution stood violated. While the investigation agencies claimed that the delay was due to frivolous applications filed by Sisodia and other accused, the court had its doubts over such a claim as the October 30 decision only intended delay in trial without attributing it either by the accused or the prosecution.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisodia_Dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sisodia Dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manish_Sisodia", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manish Sisodia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excise", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Excise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Senior counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trial court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Singhvi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Singhvi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chargesheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chargesheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedy_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speedy trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solicitor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/08/08/1600x900/Manish-Sisodia--ANI-_1723138807780.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801755", "eventUri": "eng-9801755", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-30", "textStart": 776, "textEnd": 786, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "-05-21", "textStart": 1221, "textEnd": 1227, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-03", "textStart": 1354, "textEnd": 1360}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

He further added that these witnesses could be influenced. He also said that there is evidence that he has destroyed phone records.\n\nASG had blamed Sisodia for filing various miscellaneous applications related to the supply of unrelated documents. He also said that the trial could have proceeded irrespective of further investigation.\n\n\"The delay is totally attributable to the accused,\" ASG said.\n\nSenior Advocate AM Singhvi, appearing for Sisodia, had said that seventeen months are already over which is almost half of the minimum possible sentence in the case.\n\nHe has also countered probe agencies allegations on profit margin and said that it was the cabinet decisions taken after deliberations with many officials including then LG.\n\nASG Raju on Monday said that one cannot arbitrarily increase the profit margins without reason. He has further added that Sisodia is not an innocent person picked up for political reasons but he is neck-deep in the scam.\n\nHe further added that there is evidence pointing to his involvement. He further said that he was deputy Chief Minister with 18 portfolios and responsible for all cabinet decisions.\n\nEarlier, Senior Advocate Singhvi apprised the top court about the June 4th order, whereby the probe agency has stated that the investigation in the excise policy case would be concluded and the final charge sheet would be filed expeditiously and at any rate on or before July 3, 2024, and immediately thereafter, the trial court will be free to proceed with a trial.\n\nOn June 4, the top court also gave him the liberty to revive his prayer afresh after filing the final charge sheet.\n\nSisodia now sought to revive his application, challenging the Delhi High Court order that dismissed his bail plea.\n\nOn June 4, the top court disposed of Sisodia's plea after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta submitted that the investigation would be concluded and the final charge sheet would be filed expeditiously and at any rate on or before July 3 and immediately thereafter, the trial court will be free to proceed with trial.\n\nSisodia sought a revival of his plea challenging the Delhi High Court's order on May 21.\n\nIn February 2023, Sisodia was arrested by the CBI for alleged irregularities in the framing and implementation of now-scrapped Delhi's new excise policy.\n\nThe policy was withdrawn amid allegations of foul play by the opposition. Sisodia is currently in judicial custody.\n\nAccording to the CBI, Sisodia had played the most vital role in the criminal conspiracy and he had been deeply involved in the formulation as well as the implementation of the said policy to ensure the achievement of the objectives of the said conspiracy.

Besides, he will have to report to the investigating officer every Monday and Thursday between 10-11 am.\n\nSisodia had sought bail contending that he has been in custody for 17 months and the trial against him has not yet started. The ED and the CBI had opposed his bail pleas. He was nabbed by the CBI on February 26, 2023, for purported irregularities in the formulation and implementation of the now-scrapped Delhi excise policy 2021-22.\n\nThe following month, the ED arrested him in the money laundering case stemming from the CBI FIR on March 9, 2023. He resigned from the Delhi cabinet on February 28, 2023.\n\nHere's a timeline of events to Manish Sisodia's legal battle:\n\nNovember 2021: Delhi government introduces a new excise policy\n\nJuly 2022: Lieutenant Governor V K Saxena recommends a CBI probe into alleged irregularities in the formulation and implementation of the policy\n\nAugust 2022: CBI and ED register cases in connection with alleged irregularities\n\nAugust 2022: CBI raids the residence of then Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia as well as others\n\nFebruary 26, 2023: Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrests Sisodia for his alleged role in the Delhi excise policy \"scam\".\n\nMarch 9: Enforcement Directorate (ED) arrests Sisodia in a money-laundering case stemming from the CBI's FIR.\n\nMarch 31: Trial court rejects Sisodia's bail plea in the CBI's corruption case.\n\nApril 28: Trial court dismisses Sisodia's bail plea in the money-laundering case.\n\nMay 30: Delhi High Court rejects Sisodia's bail plea in the CBI case.\n\nJuly 3: Delhi High Court junks Sisodia's bail plea in the money-laundering case.\n\nMay 2: Sisodia moves Delhi High Court seeking bail in both corruption and money laundering cases.\n\nMay 21: Delhi High Court denies bail to Sisodia.\n\nJuly 16: Supreme Court agrees to hear Sisodia's pleas seeking bail, and seeks responses from the CBI and the ED.\n\nAugust 6: Supreme Court reserves verdict on Sisodia's bail pleas in both cases.\n\nIn November 2021, the Delhi government, under Arvind Kejriwal's leadership, introduced a new excise policy aimed at modernising alcohol sales in the city. However, this move received mixed reviews, with some applauding its progressive approach while others raised concerns about its potential financial and public health implications.\n\nThe Delhi government implemented the policy on November 17, 2021, but scrapped it at the end of September 2022 amid allegations of corruption.\n\nIn July 2022, Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena recommended a CBI investigation into Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22 after the Delhi chief secretary reported violations in the policy. The excise department was headed by Manish Sisodia. Following this, the ED and CBI had registered cases alleging that irregularities were committed while modifying the Excise Policy.\n\nThe Lieutenant Governor reportedly found substantive indications of \"financial quid pro quo\" at the top political level. Sisodia was accused of undue financial favours to the liquor licensees much after the tenders had been awarded and thus caused huge losses to the exchequer.", "source": {"uri": "mid-day.com",

The bench said High Court and trial court is playing safe in matters of bail and bail cannot be denied as a matter of punishment and it is high time the courts realise that bail is a rule and jail is an exception.\n\n\"Right to speedy trial is a sacrosanct right. Recently in Javed Gulam Nabi Shaikh case, we dealt with this angle and we noted that when court, state or agency cannot protect the right to speedy trial then bail cannot be opposed saying that crime is serious,\" the bench said and added \"It will be travesty of justice to note that he has to be relegated to trial court again. Procedures cannot be made a mistress of justice. In our view the liberty reserved will have to be construed as liberty to revive the petition after filing of chargesheet. Thus, we do not entertain the preliminary objection (by CBI, ED) and this is rejected.\"\n\nThe bench further said, \"We have noted judgments where it says in period of long incarceration bail can be granted. The triple test is not applicable in the present case. We have considered trial court and High Court orders as well. Single judge and special judge has considered application on merits. We see no error in order of special judge who dealt the case on merits. But now the question is whether trial court and High Court has considered right to speedy trial properly.\"\n\nDuring the arguments on bail pleas of Sisodia, the top bench had asked the central agencies where they see the \"end of the tunnel\" in these cases.\n\nAdditional Solicitor General (ASG) SV Raju, who appeared for the central agencies, opposed Sisodia's bail pleas before the court, accusing Sisodia and other accused persons in the case of delaying the trial by taking five months for inspecting documents which were not relevant to the trial.\n\nSenior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who appeared for Sisodia, argued for grant of bail to Sisodia and denied the charge of the central agencies that Sisodia was responsible for delay in the trial of the cases.\n\nSisodia moved the Supreme Court against the May 21 order of the Delhi High Court refusing to grant him bail in money laundering and corruption cases.\n\nThe Supreme Court on June 4 disposed of bail pleas of Sisodia and granted him liberty to revive his bail pleas after the final prosecution complaint and charge sheet are filed before the trial court. Sisodia later moved the top court seeking to revive his bail pleas.\n\nThe Supreme Court earlier in October last year dismissed bail pleas of Sisodia in both case, however, it had granted him liberty to move a fresh bail plea before the trial court after three months if there was a change in the circumstances or trial got protracted.\n\nThe CBI arrested Sisodia in the excise policy-linked corruption case in February last year and later he was also arrested by the ED in the money laundering case from Tihar Jail.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nitish_k_singh@news9live.com", "name": "Nitish K Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisodia_Dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sisodia Dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedy_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speedy trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trial court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manish_Sisodia", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manish Sisodia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senior counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Singhvi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Singhvi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tihar_Jail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tihar Jail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor_General_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solicitor General of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi High Court"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/manish-sosodia-pti.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801755", "eventUri": "eng-9801755", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 469, "textEnd": 477}, {"amb": false, "date": "-05-21", "textStart": 2664, "textEnd": 2670}, {"amb": false, "date": "-06-04", "textStart": 2792, "textEnd": 2798}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

He is coming out after almost 2 years, it should have been done earlier,\" Tharoor told ANI.\n\nSharing similar sentiments, Aam Aadmi Party MP Sanjay Singh expressed joy over the Supreme Court granting bail to Sisodia, calling it a victory of truth and a big relief for the party.\n\n\"This is the victory of truth. As I have said earlier, there is no truth/evidence in this case. Our leaders were forcibly put in jail. Manish Sisodia was kept in jail for 17 months...

Sisodia is currently in judicial custody.\n\nAccording to the CBI, Sisodia had played the most vital role in the criminal conspiracy and he had been deeply involved in the formulation as well as the implementation of the said policy.(ANI)", "source": {"uri": "aninews.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asian News International (ANI)"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_News_International", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Asian News International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashi_Tharoor", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shashi Tharoor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manish_Sisodia", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manish Sisodia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisodia_Dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sisodia Dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dictatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Kejriwal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arvind Kejriwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyendra_Kumar_Jain", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satyendra Kumar Jain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saurabh_Bhardwaj", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saurabh Bhardwaj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detention_(imprisonment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detention (imprisonment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crime"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://d3lzcn6mbbadaf.cloudfront.net/media/details/ANI-20240809082328.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801755", "eventUri": "eng-9801755", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 19, "textEnd": 27}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Sisodia, who has been in jail for 17 months, received regular bail in cases investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) related to the now-scrapped excise policy.\n\nA bench comprising Justices BR Gavai and KV Viswanathan ordered Sisodia to provide a bail bond of \u20b910 lakh with two sureties, surrender his passport, and report to the Investigating Officer twice a week on Mondays and Thursdays. The court also emphasized that Sisodia must not attempt to influence witnesses or tamper with evidence. The apex court had reserved its decision on August 6.\n\nThe bench rejected the ED's request to prevent Sisodia from visiting the Delhi secretariat or the Chief Minister's office, unlike the restrictions placed on Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal when he was granted interim bail to campaign for the Lok Sabha elections.\n\nSisodia had previously approached the Supreme Court for bail twice. His initial plea was denied in October 2022, but the court allowed him to reapply if the trial did not conclude within six to eight months. When the trial failed to begin within six months, Sisodia sought bail on the grounds of delay, but his plea was rejected by the Delhi High Court on May 21. He then approached the Supreme Court again in June, but the court declined to hear his case after the ED promised to file its chargesheet by July 3. Sisodia filed his third bail application last month, challenging the high court's earlier decision.\n\nSisodia was arrested by the CBI in February 2023, followed by his arrest by the ED a month later. The case against him stems from allegations of irregularities in the excise policy, initially raised by Delhi Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena in July 2022. Alongside Sisodia, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and AAP MP Sanjay Singh have also faced scrutiny in the ED's investigation.

on the accusations of alleged irregularities in the formulation and implementation of the Delhi excise policy 2021-22, which was scrapped later.\n\nThe Enforcement Directorate (ED) arrested him in the money laundering case stemming from the CBI FIR on March 9, 2023.\n\nManish Sisodia resigned from the Delhi cabinet on February 28, 2023.\n\nHe had sought bail contending that he has been in custody for 17 months and the trial against him has not yet started.\n\nAccording to the CBI, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), through the now-scrapped Excise Policy, extended 'unfair' benefits to some vendors, in return of which, the party received monetary benefits.\n\nThe same was used in Punjab and Goa assembly polls by the party, as per the CBI chargesheet.", "source": {"uri": "dnaindia.com", "dataType":

Sisodia, who has been in custody for 17 months, was a central figure in the alleged Delhi excise policy scam. Atishi expressed her relief and gratitude for the decision, emphasising the triumph of truth and the impact of Sisodia's work on Delhi's education system.\n\n\"Today, the truth has won, the students of Delhi have won,\" Atishi said with visible emotion. \"He was put in jail because he provided good education to poor children.\"\n\nAAP MP Sanjay Singh also expressed his joy over the Supreme Court's decision, calling it a significant victory for the party. He criticised the central government, accusing it of unjustly targeting Sisodia and other AAP leaders.\n\n\"This is the victory of truth,\" Singh stated. \"There is no truth or evidence in this case. Our leaders were forcibly put in jail. Manish Sisodia was kept in jail for 17 months... I thank the Supreme Court that we got justice and the decision has come in favour of AAP. Every worker is excited. I pray that Arvind Kejriwal and Satyendra Jain also come out of jail soon. This is a slap on the dictatorship of the central government.\"\n\nSingh further emphasised the relief this decision brings to the party and its supporters. He questioned the justification for Sisodia's lengthy incarceration, noting that no incriminating evidence was found at Sisodia's home.\n\nThe Supreme Court, in its ruling, highlighted that it would be a \"travesty of justice\" if Sisodia were to be sent back to the trial court without bail. The verdict was delivered by a bench comprising Justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan, who had reserved their judgement on August 6.\n\nSisodia, the former Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi, had sought bail on the grounds that the trial in his case had not yet commenced, despite his prolonged detention. The bail plea was opposed by both the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate (ED), who are investigating the corruption and money laundering charges linked to the alleged Delhi excise policy scam.\n\nSisodia was originally arrested by the CBI on February 26, 2023, for his alleged involvement in irregularities related to the excise policy. Following this, the ED arrested him on March 9, 2023, on charges of money laundering.

The apex court's decision comes after Sisodia had spent 17 months in custody without a trial. Pronouncing the order, the bench observed that this delay had deprived him of his right to a speedy trial. At the same time, the bench laid down four conditions for his bail.\n\nThe conditions include furnishing a bail bond of \u20b910 lakh with two sureties, surrendering his passport to the police station, reporting to the investigating officer twice a week (on Mondays and Thursdays), and abstaining from attempting to influence witnesses or tamper with evidence. The SC also rejected the Enforcement Directorate (ED)'s request to impose restrictions on Sisodia's access to the secretariat or Chief Minister's office.\n\nThe court ruled that it would be unreasonable to force Sisodia to seek bail from lower courts, emphasizing that \"bail not jail\" is the rule. Sisodia was also allowed to inspect lengthy documents. The court stated that there is \"not even the remotest possibility of trial being completed\" in the foreseeable future, citing 495 witnesses and thousands of documents. It said that detaining Sisodia indefinitely in the hopes of a speedy trial would violate Article 21's right to personal liberty.\n\nSisodia was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on February 26, 2023, for alleged irregularities in the Delhi excise policy 2021-22.

The court also imposed various conditions including surrendering the passport and not influencing witnesses.\n\nExpressing joy over Sisodia's bail, Delhi Minister and AAP leader Saurabh Bharadwaj said that it is a big day for Indian democracy.\n\n\"This is a Big day for Indian democracy. The country's biggest court has said today will prove to be a milestone... No crime was proven, you kept him in jail for 17 months without proving it. Can the central government return Manish Sisodia's 17 months to his family? The Supreme Court has not put any condition on Manish Sisodia. This means that he can come to his office and resume his work. He will have to go to the police station every Monday and Thursday to mark his presence in Delhi...\" said Bharadwaj.\n\nCongress MP Manickam Tagore also congratulated Sisodia for securing bail.\n\n\"We all know that ED has been misused by BJP for a long time. They are using it as a political tool to silence the opposition. Manish Sisodia's release has shown that the legal system has taken a long time to give justice to him,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's wife Sunita Kejriwal said, \"In God's house, there is delay, not darkness.\"\n\nAAP MP Swati Maliwal too expressed happiness and said, \"I am happy that he got the bail. I hope he will lead the Delhi govt and will work well.\"\n\nLaunching a scathing attack against Manish Sisodia, BJP leader Dushyant Kumar Gautam said that there is no need to be so happy as the Supreme Court has only granted bail. \"Manish Sisodia has not been proven guilty but has only been granted bail. He won't be spared.\"\n\nIn February 2023, Sisodia was arrested by the CBI for alleged irregularities in the framing and implementation of now-scrapped Delhi's new excise policy.\n\nThe policy was withdrawn amid allegations of foul play by the opposition.

After 17 months of incarceration, he is set to be released.\n\nJustices BR Gavai and KV Viswanathan of the bench ordered Sisodia to post a \u20b910 lakh bail bond with two sureties, surrender his passport, and appear before the Investigating Officer twice a week on Monday and Thursday. He was also instructed not to attempt to influence witnesses or tamper with evidence. The Supreme Court had reserved its judgment on the case on August 6.\n\nFurthermore, the bench declined the ED's request to bar Sisodia from visiting the Delhi secretariat or the Chief Minister's office, a restriction that was imposed on Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal when he was granted interim bail during the Lok Sabha election campaign.\n\nThe CBI and ED contended that Sisodia's petition was not admissible since he was obliged to first seek redress from the trial court.\n\nThis marked Sisodia's third attempt to obtain bail from the apex court. On October 30 last year, the court denied his bail application but allowed him the option to reapply if the trial did not conclude within six to eight months or progressed very slowly.\n\nWhen the trial did not commence within six months, Sisodia applied for bail citing the delay, but his application was rejected by the Delhi High Court on May 21. He then petitioned the Supreme Court in June, following the ED's indication to a vacation bench that it would file its complaint (or charge sheet) by July 3.\n\nAfter noting this statement, the court chose not to delve into the merits of the petition. Last month, Sisodia filed his third bail application, challenging the high court's May 21 decision.", "source": {"uri": "pragativadi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pragativadi: Leading Odia Dailly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "itishree_sethy@pragativadi.com", "name": "Itishree Sethy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisodia_Dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sisodia Dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Odisha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Odisha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manish_Sisodia", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manish Sisodia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_deputy_chief_ministers_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of deputy chief ministers of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chief_ministers_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of chief ministers of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Kejriwal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arvind Kejriwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chargesheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chargesheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trial court"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Surety_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Surety Bonds", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://pragativadi.com/core/uploads/2024/05/Manish-Sisodia-allowed-to-meet-his-ailing-wife-once-a-week-under-ED-CBI-custody.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801755", "eventUri": "eng-9801755", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 787, "textEnd": 795}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-30", "textStart": 1284, "textEnd": 1294}, {"amb": false, "date": "-05-21", "textStart": 1621, "textEnd": 1627, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-03", "textStart": 1779, "textEnd": 1785}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Previously, the Delhi High Court had denied his bail petition. Sisodia must post a bond of Rs 10 lakh.\n\nWhen granting bail to Sisodia, the Supreme Court noted that lower and high courts have been overly cautious about granting bail. The court emphasized that bail should not be used as a punishment and that bail is the rule, while jail is the exception. The court set three conditions for Sisodia's bail: he must surrender his passport, post a bond of Rs 10 lakh, and provide two sureties.\n\nManish Sisodia was arrested in February 2023\n\nThe last hearing in the case was on July 29, when the ED requested more time to file an affidavit. Following this, the Supreme Court postponed the hearing. Sisodia was arrested by the CBI on February 26 last year and by the ED on March 9. He resigned from the Delhi Cabinet two days after his arrest.\n\nAfter Manish Sisodia was granted bail, the Aam Aadmi Party was really happy and felt like it was a victory for them, they posted on X \"Sach ki jeet hui\".\n\nAlso Read: Supreme Court To Review Petition Challenging Hijab, Burqa Ban In Colleges Today", "source": {"uri": "news24online.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News24"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simran_rajpal@news24online.com", "name": "Simran Rajpal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manish_Sisodia", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manish Sisodia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisodia_Dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sisodia Dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dalit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shiva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burqa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burqa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hijab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Surety_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Surety Bonds", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://news24online.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Manish-Sisodiya.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801755", "eventUri": "eng-9801755", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-10", "textStart": 144, "textEnd": 153}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 966, "textEnd": 973}, {"amb": false, "date": "-02-26", "textStart": 1121, "textEnd": 1132}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-09", "textStart": 1160, "textEnd": 1167}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Pronouncing the verdict, a bench headed by Justice B.R. Gavai said that Sisodia has been deprived of his right to a speedy trial, considering the fact that he suffered incarceration of more than 17 months and the trial in the case has not yet commenced.\n\n\"In the matter of liberty, every day counts,\" remarked Justice Gavai-led Bench. On Tuesday, the Bench, also comprising Justice K.V. Viswanathan, reserved its judgment after hearing the oral arguments raised by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) S.V. Raju, representing the central agencies, and senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who appeared on Sisodia's behalf. During the hearing, the CBI and the ED told the apex court that a Rs 100 crore bribe was demanded by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for the Goa elections, out of which Rs 45 crore has been traced in the course of the investigation.\n\n\"A Rs 100 crore bribe was demanded to be used for Goa elections. Out of which we have been able to trace 45 crore. We have digital evidence. There is a lot of evidence,\" the ASG said, adding that Sisodia was in charge of the Excise Department of the Delhi government and co-accused Vijay Nair was tasked to receive the kickbacks.\" They wanted to make money out of this exercise. There is evidence to show that this particular gentleman (Sisodia) engineered emails and told certain interns to write a particular type of email,\" Raju said. Manish Sisodia Arrested: CBI Seeks 5-Day Custody of Delhi Deputy CM, He Claims No Evidence Against Him in Excise Policy Scam Case.\n\nOn the other hand, Singhvi contended that the AAP leader has been in custody for 17 months and should be granted bail on the grounds of delay in the conclusion of the trial. Singhvi also prayed that Sisodia be released on interim bail. He said his wife has \"a very very bad medical condition\" and is \"virtually like a vegetable\". In its judgment delivered on October 30 last year, the SC had denied bail to the former Deputy CM but said that if the trial proceeds slowly in the next three months, he may apply for bail afresh.\n\nSpecial Judge Kaveri Baweja of the Rouse Avenue Court had on April 30 refused to grant bail to Sisodia who was seeking regular bail a second time. Denying bail, the trial court order noted that delays in the case proceedings were largely due to actions attributable to Sisodia himself, dismissing his claims of undue delay. Subsequently, the Delhi High Court denied bail to Sisodia, saying that he failed to pass the triple test for grant of bail in the corruption case and the twin conditions required under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002. Manish Sisodia Is Innocent, His Arrest is Dirty Politics, Says Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal.\n\nChallenging this, the former Deputy CM filed special leave petitions before the Supreme Court. Last month, the apex court had disposed of the pleas seeking bail in corruption and money laundering cases after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta gave an undertaking that the final charge sheet/complaint in the liquor policy case would be filed by July 3. Meanwhile, a court here extended the judicial custody of Sisodia, till August 9 in the corruption case and till August 13 in the money laundering case. He was produced through video conferencing from Tihar Jail upon expiry of the previously granted judicial custody.\n\n(The above story first appeared on LatestLY on Aug 09, 2024 11:44 AM IST.

This paved the way for Sisodia to walk out of jail almost one and a half years after he was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation in the case.\n\nAccording to Dainik Jagran, Sisodia is expected to come out of Delhi's Tihar Jail in the evening on Friday. Before the release, Manish Sisodia must be presented before the trial court after receiving a copy of the Supreme Court's order.\n\nThe bail bond will be submitted before the trial court, after which the trial court will issue the release order. Once the release order is issued, Sisodia will be released from Tihar Jail based on it. This process will likely be completed by this evening, and Sisodia may be released either late tonight or on Saturday morning.\n\nThe apex court asked Sisodia to fill a personal bond of Rs 10 lakh with two sureties of a similar amount. He was also asked to submit his passport before being released on bail. During the bail hearing, the apex court also made scathing remarks over how he was kept in jail and denied the bail.\n\n\"Manish Sisodia is in custody for 17 months and trial has not yet commenced; this deprives his right to a speedy trial.

The high court and trial court are playing safe in matters of bail... Bail is the rule, and jail is an exception,\" the court noted in its bail order.\n\nGranting the bail to the AAP leader, the top court noted that it would be a travesty of justice to relegate him to the trial court for seeking bail in these cases.", "source": {"uri": "english.jagran.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jagran English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisodia_Dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sisodia Dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manish_Sisodia", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manish Sisodia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trial court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dainik_Jagran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dainik Jagran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tihar_Jail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tihar Jail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Excise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedy_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speedy trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 51}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://imgeng.jagran.com/images/2024/08/09/article/image/Sisodia Arrest-1723200119369.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801755", "eventUri": "eng-9801755", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

It directed that Sisodia be released on bail on a personal bond of Rs 10 lakh with two sureties of the like amount.The former deputy chief minister has also been asked to surrender his passport.\n\nSisodia, who served as Delhi's deputy chief minister, was initially arrested by the CBI on February 26, 2023, for his alleged involvement in irregularities related to Delhi's 2021-22 Excise Policy. The ED subsequently arrested him on March 9, 2023, in connection with the money laundering investigation.\n\nHere's what the court said while granting bail to Manish Sisodia:\n\nDelay in trial as a valid ground for bail\n\nThe Supreme Court emphasized that delay in trial and prolonged imprisonment are valid grounds for granting bail, even in cases under stringent laws like the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).\n\n\"Manish Sisodia is in custody for 17 months and trial has not yet commenced; this deprives his right to speedy trial,\" the top court said.\n\n\"Right to speedy trial is a sacrosanct right... Bail cannot be opposed saying that the crime is serious. In matters of liberty, every day count,\" it added.\n\nViolation of fundamental rights\n\nThe top court also noted that keeping an accused in prolonged detention with the hope of completing the trial amounts to a violation of their fundamental rights.\n\n\"Keeping an accused in jail for long time in hope of completion of trail amounts to violation of fundamental rights of accused,\" the Supreme Court said.\n\n'Bail as rule, jail as exception'\n\nThe top court noted that high court and trial court is playing safe in matters of bail. 'It is high time trial courts, high courts recognise principle of bail is rule and jail is exception', the apex court said.\n\nRejection of plea for uniform conditions\n\nThe CBI and ED had requested the Supreme Court to impose bail conditions similar to those applied to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.\n\nHowever, the court rejected this plea, stating that each case needs to be treated on its own merits rather than applying uniform conditions across the board.\n\nRejection of trial court relegation\n\nThe Supreme Court also ruled that relegating Sisodia to the trial court to seek bail would be a travesty of justice.\n\n'No case of tampering evidence'\n\nAdvocate representing Manish Sisodia, Rishikesh Kumar said, \"The court has said that if you have the evidence then there is no case of tampering. If you have kept him in jail for so long, it's against the principles of bail. Be it the case of ED or section 45, the cardinal rule of bail is applied there. And keeping this in mind, that Manish Sisodia has already been in jail for 17 months, the Supreme Court dismissed all the pleas of ED and granted him bail. The court has also said that the statement of ED in court that trial will end in 6-8 months, it doesn't seem it will.\"\n\nThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

After 17 months of being jailed, Sisodia is set to be released following the Court's decision. A bench of Justices BR Gavai and KV Viswanathan issued the bail order, overturning both the trial court's and Delhi High Court's decisions that had attributed the trial delays to Sisodia.\n\nThe Supreme Court found that keeping Sisodia in custody for an indefinite period violated his right to a speedy trial.\n\nSupreme Court grants bail to AAP leader Manish Sisodia with conditions to surrender passport\n\nThe top court's decision was influenced by several key observations:\n\n1. The bench noted that Sisodia had been in custody for approximately 17 months with no commencement of the trial, which amounted to a deprivation of his right to a speedy trial.\n\n2. The Court stressed that the prolonged detention without trial was a denial of Sisodia's fundamental rights. The trial court and High Court should have given due consideration to this aspect.\n\n3. The Court highlighted that Sisodia has deep roots in society and there was no substantial risk of him fleeing. It was determined that conditions could be imposed to mitigate any potential concerns.\n\n4. The Supreme Court condemned the lower courts for failing to consider the injustice of prolonged detention without trial. The Court stated that relegating Sisodia back to the trial court for bail would be a 'travesty of justice.'\n\n5. The bench observed that most of the evidence in the case was documentary and already in possession of the ED and CBI, reducing concerns about tampering.\n\nMukesh Ambani's Reliance lays off 42,000 staff in FY24; Netizens quip 'salary spent on wedding'\n\n6. The Court stressed that keeping Sisodia behind bars for an indefinite period would deny his fundamental rights. The Court acknowledged that Sisodia's societal ties and lack of fleeing risk justified granting bail.\n\n7. The Supreme Court noted that it would be unfair to subject Sisodia to continued incarceration when the trial had not yet started. The delays in the trial process warranted the Court's intervention.", "source": {"uri": "newsable.asianetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisodia_Dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sisodia Dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manish_Sisodia", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manish Sisodia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedy_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speedy trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trial court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliance_Industries", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reliance Industries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukesh_Ambani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mukesh Ambani"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://static-gi.asianetnews.com/images/01heyms3zxz7ea7h3jzdkenv76/Manish-Sisodia-1699687993341.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801755", "eventUri": "eng-9801755", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 29, "textEnd": 37}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

As I have said earlier, there is no truth/evidence in this case. Our leaders were forcibly put in jail. Manish Sisodia was kept in jail for 17 months...

The order was delivered by a bench of justices, BR Gavai and KV Viswanathan.\n\nThe court also imposed various conditions, including surrendering the passport and not influencing witnesses.\n\nThe top court was hearing Sisodia's appeal, challenging the Delhi High Court order that dismissed his bail plea in the cases being probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate.\n\nIn February 2023, Sisodia was arrested by the CBI for alleged irregularities in the framing and implementation of now-scrapped Delhi's new excise policy.\n\nThe policy was withdrawn amid allegations of foul play by the opposition.

Gavai said that Sisodia has been deprived of his right to a speedy trial, considering the fact that he suffered incarceration of more than 17 months and the trial in the case has not yet commenced.\n\n\"In the matter of liberty, every day counts,\" remarked Justice Gavai-led Bench.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Bench, also comprising Justice K.V. Viswanathan, reserved its judgment after hearing the oral arguments raised by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) S.V. Raju, representing the central agencies, and senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who appeared on Sisodia's behalf.\n\nDuring the hearing, the CBI and the ED told the apex court that a Rs 100 crore bribe was demanded by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for the Goa elections, out of which Rs 45 crore has been traced in the course of the investigation.\n\n\"A Rs 100 crore bribe was demanded to be used for Goa elections. Out of which we have been able to trace 45 crore. We have digital evidence. There is a lot of evidence,\" the ASG said, adding that Sisodia was in charge of the Excise Department of the Delhi government and co-accused Vijay Nair was tasked to receive the kickbacks.\n\n\"They wanted to make money out of this exercise. There is evidence to show that this particular gentleman (Sisodia) engineered emails and told certain interns to write a particular type of email,\" Raju said.\n\nOn the other hand, Singhvi contended that the AAP leader has been in custody for 17 months and should be granted bail on the grounds of delay in the conclusion of the trial.\n\nSinghvi also prayed that Sisodia be released on interim bail. He said his wife has \"a very very bad medical condition\" and is \"virtually like a vegetable\".\n\nIn its judgment delivered on October 30 last year, the SC had denied bail to the former Deputy CM but said that if the trial proceeds slowly in the next three months, he may apply for bail afresh.\n\nSpecial Judge Kaveri Baweja of the Rouse Avenue Court had on April 30 refused to grant bail to Sisodia who was seeking regular bail a second time. Denying bail, the trial court order noted that delays in the case proceedings were largely due to actions attributable to Sisodia himself, dismissing his claims of undue delay.\n\nSubsequently, the Delhi High Court denied bail to Sisodia, saying that he failed to pass the triple test for grant of bail in the corruption case and the twin conditions required under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002.\n\nChallenging this, the former Deputy CM filed special leave petitions before the Supreme Court. Last month, the apex court had disposed of the pleas seeking bail in corruption and money laundering cases after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta gave an undertaking that the final charge sheet/complaint in the liquor policy case would be filed by July 3.\n\nMeanwhile, a court here extended the judicial custody of Sisodia, till August 9 in the corruption case and till August 13 in the money laundering case. He was produced through video conferencing from Tihar Jail upon expiry of the previously granted judicial custody.", "source": {"uri": "thestatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Statesman"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisodia_Dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sisodia Dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manish_Sisodia", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manish Sisodia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liquor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Singhvi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Singhvi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oral argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedy_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speedy trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Goa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Senior counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor_General_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solicitor General of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickback_(bribery)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kickback (bribery)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_deputy_chief_ministers_of_Maharashtra", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of deputy chief ministers of Maharashtra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tushar_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tushar Mehta"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.thestatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Untitled-design-4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801755", "eventUri": "eng-9801755", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-30", "textStart": 2088, "textEnd": 2098}, {"amb": false, "date": "-04-30", "textStart": 2318, "textEnd": 2326}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-03", "textStart": 3162, "textEnd": 3168}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 3242, "textEnd": 3250}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-13", "textStart": 3283, "textEnd": 3292}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

As I have said earlier, there is no truth/evidence in this case. Our leaders were forcibly put in jail. Manish Sisodia was kept in jail for 17 months...

What the country's biggest court has said today will prove to be a milestone... No crime was proven, you kept him in jail for 17 months without proving it. Can the central government return Manish Sisodia's 17 months to his family? The Supreme Court has not put any condition on Manish Sisodia. This means that he can come to his office and resume his work. He will have to go to the police station every Monday and Thursday to mark his presence in Delhi,\" Bharadwaj told ANI.\n\nSupreme Court on Friday granted bail to Manish Sisodia in Delhi excise policy irregularities cases. The order was delivered by a bench of justices, BR Gavai and KV Viswanathan. The court also imposed various conditions, including surrendering the passport and not influencing witnesses.\n\nThe top court was hearing Sisodia's appeal, challenging the Delhi High Court order that dismissed his bail plea in the cases being probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate.\n\nIn February 2023, Sisodia was arrested by the CBI for alleged irregularities in the framing and implementation of now-scrapped Delhi's new excise policy.\n\nThe policy was withdrawn amid allegations of foul play by the opposition. Sisodia is currently in judicial custody.\n\nAccording to the CBI, Sisodia had played the most vital role in the criminal conspiracy and he had been deeply involved in the formulation as well as the implementation of the said policy.

He cannot again start from square one, the trial court, and climb up the ladder till the Supreme Court for bail. Grant of bail is not a snakes and ladders game.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court noted that the AAP leader has suffered incarceration of 17 months and that the trial has not yet commenced.\n\nThe Court noted that Sisodia had been denied the right to a speedy trial and the trial court and the High Court ought to have given due weightage to this.\n\nDismissing the contentions of the ED and CBI that the delay in the trial can be attributed to Sisodia, Justice Gavai said, \"When we specifically asked the ASG to show any order where the trial court found any application to be frivolous, not one was shown. We find that the finding of delay by the appellant is not supported by the record.\"\n\nThe Court said that relegating the former Deputy CM to the trial court for relief would be a \"travesty of justice\".\n\n\"A citizen cannot be made to run from pillar to post. June 4 order recorded that it did not go into merits...Procedures cannot be made a mistress of justice,\" Justice Gavai said while dismissing the central agencies' preliminary objections to the bail plea.\n\nJustice Gavai noted that the Supreme Court in its order on June 4 had recorded an undertaking from Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who appeared for both the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), that the final chargesheet/prosecution complaint would be filed in the trial court on or before July 3.\n\nAt the start of the day's proceeding, the bench asked, \"How the central agencies justify the delay in the trial?\"\n\nAppearing for Sisodia, Senior Advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi had approached the Supreme Court asserting that the trial had not begun despite assurances from the probe agencies in October 2023 that it would be concluded within six to eight months.\n\nAdditional Solicitor General (ASG) S V Raju appearing on behalf of the ED and CBI said the delay came from Sisodia's side who had sought one document after the other in court.\n\n\"Our trial would have commenced and these documents were unwarranted but just because of these applications. Delay is completely attributable to them and not to the agency. Speedy trials cannot be fitted in a straight jacket formula. It is case-by-case basis and they do not want this to be heard on merits. So the best option for them is to delay it,\" Raju apprised the Supreme Court.\n\nJustice Viswanathan then said that had the accused been on bail, he would have tried to delay the trial. But that was not the case here.\n\n\"Delay may happen on the accused side if they are on bail,\" Justice Viswanathan reasoned.\n\nRaju said the accused could also deliberately delay the trial and use the situation to seek bail and added that among the 400-odd witnesses, the ED could have the important ones to testify first.\n\nThe Supreme Court noted that the ED has to establish an unbroken chain of evidence linking Sisodia with the liquor lobby in the excise scam case.\n\n\"We know it is difficult to establish the chain as everything is done undercover... but that is where your competence lies,\" the bench said.\n\nThe court observed that except a statement made by businessman Dinesh Arora, an accused-turned-approver in the case, there was no proof against Sisodia.\n\nSisodia was

Today, is the day that the man behind the education revolution of Delhi has been granted bail,\" she said.\n\n\"Today, truth has triumphed, and education has won, the children have won,\" an emotional atishi said.\n\nShe alleged that he was sent to jail because he provided good education to children and allocated 25 per cent of the budget to education. This made him an excellent education minister, atishi said.\n\nA bench of justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan said Sisodia has been in custody for 17 months and trial has not yet commenced, depriving him of the right to speedy trial.\n\nSisodia was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on February 26 last year for purported irregularities in the formulation and implementation of the now-scrapped Delhi excise policy 2021-22.\n\nThe Enforcement Directorate (ED) arrested him in the money laundering case stemming from the CBI FIR on March 9 last year. He resigned from the Delhi cabinet on February 28 in 2023.\n\nSisodia had sought bail contending that he has been in custody for 17 months and the trial against him has not yet started. The ED and the CBI had opposed his bail pleas.\n\nIn a post on X in Hindi, AAP MP Raghav Chadha said, \"The whole country is happy today as Manish Sisodia, the hero of Delhi education revolution, got bail. I express my gratitude to the Honourable Supreme Court from the bottom of my heart.\" \"Manish ji was kept behind bars for 530 days. His crime was that he gave a better future to the children of the poor. Dear children, your Manish uncle is coming back,\" he said.\n\nHailing Sisodia's bail as a \"victory of truth\", AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh, said, \"This verdict is a slap on the Centre's dictatorship. He was in jail for 17 months. His life was destroyed in those months. He could have worked for the education of children during that time.\" \"We hope that other leaders of the party, Arvind Kejriwal and Satyendar Jain, will also get bail and justice. I bow down before the Supreme Court for this verdict,\" he added. This verdict is a big boost for the AAP, Singh said.\n\nDelhi Chief Minister and AAP supremo Kejriwal was arrested on March 21 by the ED in connection with the excise policy case. In May, he was granted interim bail for Lok Sabha poll campaigning. He surrendered on June 2. He was arrested on June 26 by the CBI in the case from the Tihar jail. Though the chief minister has been granted interim bail by the apex court in the ED case, he continues to be in jail because of the CBI case.\n\nFormer Delhi Health minister Satyendar Jain is in jail in a different money laundering case lodged by ED.\n\nAtishi said, \"We are happy that he (Sisodia) will be out but there is still pain in our hearts because Kejriwal is still in jail. Truth will prevail, and just as Sisodia has been granted bail, Kejriwal will also be released,\" she added.\n\nCelebrations erupted at the AAP office after the verdict as sweets were distributed and dhol beats rent the air.

Gavai said that Sisodia has been deprived of his right to a speedy trial, considering the fact that he suffered incarceration of more than 17 months and the trial in the case has not yet commenced.\n\n\"In the matter of liberty, every day counts,\" remarked Justice Gavai-led Bench.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Bench, also comprising Justice K.V. Viswanathan, reserved its judgment after hearing the oral arguments raised by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) S.V. Raju, representing the central agencies, and senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who appeared on Sisodia's behalf.\n\nDuring the hearing, the CBI and the ED told the apex court that a Rs 100 crore bribe was demanded by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for the Goa elections, out of which Rs 45 crore has been traced in the course of the investigation.\n\n\"A Rs 100 crore bribe was demanded to be used for Goa elections. Out of which we have been able to trace 45 crore. We have digital evidence. There is a lot of evidence,\" the ASG said, adding that Sisodia was in charge of the Excise Department of the Delhi government and co-accused Vijay Nair was tasked to receive the kickbacks.\n\n\"They wanted to make money out of this exercise. There is evidence to show that this particular gentleman (Sisodia) engineered emails and told certain interns to write a particular type of email,\" Raju said.\n\nOn the other hand, Singhvi contended that the AAP leader has been in custody for 17 months and should be granted bail on the grounds of delay in the conclusion of the trial.\n\nSinghvi also prayed that Sisodia be released on interim bail. He said his wife has \"a very very bad medical condition\" and is \"virtually like a vegetable\".\n\nIn its judgment delivered on October 30 last year, the SC had denied bail to the former Deputy CM but said that if the trial proceeds slowly in the next three months, he may apply for bail afresh.\n\nSpecial Judge Kaveri Baweja of the Rouse Avenue Court had on April 30 refused to grant bail to Sisodia who was seeking regular bail a second time. Denying bail, the trial court order noted that delays in the case proceedings were largely due to actions attributable to Sisodia himself, dismissing his claims of undue delay.\n\nSubsequently, the Delhi High Court denied bail to Sisodia, saying that he failed to pass the triple test for grant of bail in the corruption case and the twin conditions required under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002.\n\nChallenging this, the former Deputy CM filed special leave petitions before the Supreme Court. Last month, the apex court had disposed of the pleas seeking bail in corruption and money laundering cases after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta gave an undertaking that the final charge sheet/complaint in the liquor policy case would be filed by July 3.\n\nMeanwhile, a court here extended the judicial custody of Sisodia, till August 9 in the corruption case and till August 13 in the money laundering case. He was produced through video conferencing from Tihar Jail upon expiry of the previously granted judicial custody.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.co.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times, India Edition"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisodia_Dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sisodia Dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedy_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speedy trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manish_Sisodia", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manish Sisodia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liquor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Singhvi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Singhvi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oral argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_deputy_chief_ministers_of_Maharashtra", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of deputy chief ministers of Maharashtra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Senior counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Goa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor_General_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solicitor General of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickback_(bribery)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kickback (bribery)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tushar_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tushar Mehta"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://data1.ibtimes.co.in/en/full/801468/aap-leaders-ecstatic-over-manish-sisodias-bail-call-it-victory-truth.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801755", "eventUri": "eng-9801755", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-30", "textStart": 2057, "textEnd": 2067}, {"amb": false, "date": "-04-30", "textStart": 2287, "textEnd": 2295}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-03", "textStart": 3131, "textEnd": 3137}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 3211, "textEnd": 3219}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-13", "textStart": 3252, "textEnd": 3261}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Singhvi also prayed that Sisodia be released on interim bail.\n\nHe said his wife has \"a very very bad medical condition\" and is \"virtually like a vegetable\".

Last month, the apex court disposed of the pleas seeking bail in corruption and money laundering cases after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta gave an undertaking that the final charge sheet/complaint in the liquor policy case would be filed by July 3.\n\nMeanwhile, a court here extended the judicial custody of Sisodia, till August 9 in the corruption case and till August 13 in the money laundering case.

Manish Sisodia Gets Bail: Supreme Court Grants Bail to AAP Leader in Delhi Excise Policy Case, Party Calls Verdict 'Victory of Truth'.\n\n\"It is thus clear that there is not even a remotest possibility of the trial being concluded in the near future. In our view, keeping the appellant behind bars for an unlimited period of time in the hope of speedy completion of trial would deprive him of the Fundamental Right of Liberty given under Article 21 of the Constitution.\" The Bench, also comprising Justice KV Viswanathan held that on account of a long period of incarceration running for around 17 months and the trial not having commenced, the senior AAP leader has been deprived of his right to speedy trial.\n\n\"The right to speedy trial and Right to Liberty are sacrosanct rights. On denial of these rights, the trial court as well as the High Court, ought to have given due weightage to this factor,\" it said, setting aside the orders of the court below denying bail to Sisodia.

Though various applications have been filed by different accused persons, in so far as the present appellant (Sisodia) is concerned, he has filed only 13 applications in the CBI matter and 14 in ED matter. It would reveal that some of the applications are for seeking permission to meet his ailing wife, permission to file vakalatnama, to put signature on documents, seeking permission to sign cheques, etc.\n\n\"Most of the applications are for supply of missing documents and legible copies of documents, and some of the applications are for inspection of un-relied upon documents. \"It is further to note that all these applications have been allowed by the learned trial court....We find that the finding of the learned trial judge that it is the appellant who is responsible for delaying the trial is not supported by the record.\"\n\nThe top court ruled that the accused is entitled to take a reasonable time to inspect the trial record involving 69,000 pages and cannot be denied inspection of documents for a fair trial. Rejecting the contention that Sisodia if granted bail may tamper with the evidence, the Supreme Court said that the prosecution case majorly stems from documentary evidence, which has already been seized by the CBI and the ED.\n\nTo rule out the possibility of influencing witnesses by the accused, imposing stringent conditions, the apex court asked Sisodia to furnish bail bonds in the sum of Rs. 10 lakh with two sureties of like amount. It ordered Sisodia to surrender his passport with the special court and to report to the investigative officer on every Monday and Thursday between 10 to 11 A.M.\n\n\"The appellant shall not make any attempt to either influence the witnesses or to tamper with the evidence,\" it added.

Former Delhi DY CM To Walk Out Of Tihar Jail After Over 17 Months Since His Arrest", "body": "New Delhi: The Supreme Court has granted bail to former Delhi Deputy Chief Minister and AAP leader Manish Sisodia in both the Enforcement Directorate and CBI cases related to the Excise Policy.\n\nThe bench of Justices B.R. Gavai and K.V. Viswanathan ordered Sisodia to be released on payment of \u20b910 lakh in bail bonds, with conditions such as surrendering his passport, reporting to the police station every Monday, and not tampering with evidence or influencing witnesses while out on bail.\n\nSupreme Court's Verdict On Sisodia\n\nOn the day the judgement was reserved, the bench pointed out an apparent inconsistency in the ED's positions. The ED claimed that the trial could have started if Sisodia had not delayed it by filing unnecessary applications, but at the same time, it requested time until July 3, 2024, to gather data and file a final chargesheet/prosecution complaint.\n\nOfficial Statement\n\nJustice Viswanathan observed, \"The last chargesheet comes on 28th June...then you tell the Supreme Court we are in the process of filing supplementary...this means that even you felt unless all chargesheets were filed...trial can't start...Now to say that you could have proceeded and they delayed...some inconsistency is there.\"\n\nThe judge also asked the ED to realistically state when the trial could be expected to begin and end. In response, ASG Raju stated that the agencies would like to examine at least 8 witnesses each before (and if) Sisodia was permitted to be released, as there was apprehension of his influencing witnesses.\n\nBrief History Of Sisodia VS ED & CBI Case\n\nThe AAP leader was arrested by the CBI on February 26, 2023, for his alleged role in the \"scam,\" and the ED arrested him in a money-laundering case originating from the CBI First Information Report on March 9, 2023. The Delhi High Court had rejected his bail application on May 21, and a Vacation Bench of the apex court of Justices Aravind Kumar and Sandeep Mehta had also refused bail to Sisodia on June 4. However, the Bench gave the AAP leader liberty to revive his plea for bail afresh as soon as the final charge sheet and prosecution complaint had been filed by the CBI and ED, respectively, in the case.\n\nThe Supreme Court noted that there is \"not even a remotest possibility of trial being completed\" in the near future considering the 495 witnesses and thousands of documents running into lakhs of pages. To keep Sisodia under custody for an unlimited period of time in the hope of a speedy completion of the trial would result in a grave violation of the fundamental right to personal liberty under Article 21.\n\nDismissed Appeals For Bail\n\nSisodia, a prominent lawyer, has been facing multiple legal challenges in the CBI and ED cases. The Delhi High Court dismissed his second bail plea in May, citing a misuse of power and breach of trust. The Supreme Court dismissed another set of bail pleas in October, but Sisodia continued to face challenges. In June, the Supreme Court dismissed his previous petitions and granted him liberty to revive his bail after the final charge sheet and prosecution complaint were filed.", "source": {"uri": "freepressjournal.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Free Press Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisodia_Dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sisodia Dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chargesheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chargesheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manish_Sisodia", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manish Sisodia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_information_report", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First information report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2024-08-09/ndhepebt/manish sisodia.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801755", "eventUri": "eng-9801755", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-28", "textStart": 964, "textEnd": 973}, {"amb": false, "date": "-05-21", "textStart": 1859, "textEnd": 1865}, {"amb": false, "date": "-06-04", "textStart": 1986, "textEnd": 1992}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

He now has to go back to the trial court, where his plea for regular bail in the CBI's excise policy case will be argued. The Supreme Court has already granted him interim bail in the ED's PMLA case originating from the CBI's case.\n\nMinister Saurabh Bharadwaj said, \"Without any proof, any witnesses Manish Sisodia was arrested. The court has said that a game of snakes and ladders is going on in the country right now... the court had said that within six months the trial would begin but now we are in August and the trial has still not started. The court also said that if the trial did not begin within six to eight months then he should be granted bail. The court also said something very important: when it comes to bail, each and every citizen matters and that bail is a matter of personal right. Do our High Court and lower courts not understand this?\"\n\nSisodia is a founding member of AAP and a close confidant of party chief Arvind Kejriwal. Earlier this year, during a hearing in the Rouse Avenue Court, the CBI said that during questioning Kejriwal had said Sisodia was the one who recommended privatisation of liquor stores in the city under the now-scrapped excise policy. The AAP saw this as an attempt to create a misunderstanding between its top two leaders, with Kejriwal saying in court, \"I did not make any statement that Manish Sisodia is guilty. Manish Sisodia is absolutely innocent. Their aim is to defame us. I told the CBI yesterday that these are absurd allegations.\"\n\nAccording to sources, while he was out on interim bail, Kejriwal and his wife went to meet Sisodia's family away from the media glare. Sisodia has stayed by Kejriwal's side, even as several other former party leaders have fallen away, calling the Delhi CM a dictator. This includes Kumar Vishwas, who has not resigned from AAP but has become a vocal critic. Vishwas was close friends with Sisodia and his family before the falling out.\n\nKnown as a leader who can calm troubled waters, Sisodia served as the much-needed push to several projects and policies even when the bureaucracy was less than forgiving with other ministers. This, however, will be the first time that Sisodia does not return to the government. He has been a Deputy CM thrice now: first during the 49-day AAP government in 2013-14, in 2015 and again in 2020.\n\nWith the Assembly elections expected to be held next February, his primary role will be to ensure that there are boots on the ground and that MLAs are not lured away.\n\n\"Organisationally, AAP has suffered over the past four months. After Arvind Kejriwal was arrested, there have been murmurs of discontent within. This has only risen since the AAP contested Lok Sabha polls alongside Congress but did not win a single seat. There is also a lot of disillusionment because the MLAs are not able to fulfil promises made to the people because of the hurdles being raised by the office of the L-G and the bureaucracy. While there is not much Manish ji can do about the latter, organisationally his release is very valuable,\" said an AAP insider.\n\nSisodia's and AAP's troubles are far from over, though. In granting him bail, the court said that it did not see any error in the order of the trial court or the High Court in considering the merits of the case but was granting him bail as there was \"not the remotest possibility of the trial concluding in near future\".\n\nThis means that bail has only been granted because the trial had not started even though Sisodia remained in jail for nearly 18 months.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mallica_joshi@indianexpress.com", "name": "Mallica Joshi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisodia_Dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sisodia Dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manish_Sisodia", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manish Sisodia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Kejriwal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arvind Kejriwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excise", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Excise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_Corporation_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Municipal Corporation of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saurabh_Bhardwaj", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saurabh Bhardwaj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumar_Vishwas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kumar Vishwas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trial court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bureaucracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Surety_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Surety Bonds", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/08/Manish-Sisodia-1.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801755", "eventUri": "eng-9801755", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Sisodia, former deputy CM of Delhi, had sought bail on the ground that he has been in custody for 17 months and the trial against him has not yet started.On August 9, 2024, Manish Sisodia, former Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi, was granted bail by the Supreme Court in the high-profile Delhi excise policy case. Sisodia's release marks a significant development in the case, but several key figures are still in jail. Here's a look at who is still behind bars and their current status.\n\nAAP leader Manish Sisodia, who received relief today, was first arrested by the CBI on February 26, 2023, for his suspected role in irregularities concerning the excise policy. He was later detained by the ED on March 9, 2023, on money laundering charges. Although he has been granted bail, Sisodia continues to be a key figure in the ongoing investigation.\n\nRead more: Manish Sisodia granted bail by Supreme Court in Delhi excise policy case\n\nAAP leader Sanjay Singh was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in October 2023 for his involvement in the Delhi liquor scam. After spending six months in custody, Singh was granted bail by the Supreme Court.\n\nDelhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal faces continued judicial custody. On August 9, 2024, a Delhi court extended Kejriwal's custody until August 20 in a case brought by the CBI. The court's decision followed concerns raised by the CBI about potential witness tampering and ongoing investigations. Kejriwal, arrested by the ED on March 21, 2024, and later by the CBI on June 26, 2024, remains in Tihar Jail. Though the Supreme Court granted interim bail to Kejriwal in the ED case on July 12, he continues to be lodged in Tihar jail in connection with the case as he has not furnished the bail bond.\n\nSatyendra Jain, who was arrested by the ED on May 31, 2022, for money laundering allegations, resigned from his ministerial positions nine months later. Jain remains in custody as the investigations into his role in the scam continue.\n\nK Kavitha, a BRS MLC, is another prominent figure still held in connection with the Delhi liquor scam. Arrested by the ED on March 15, 2024, Kavitha was initially placed in judicial custody for 15 days. She was later re-arrested by the CBI on April 11, 2024, while still in Tihar Jail. Her involvement in the scam continues to be under investigation.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manish_Sisodia", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manish Sisodia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_deputy_chief_ministers_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of deputy chief ministers of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Kejriwal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arvind Kejriwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chief_ministers_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of chief ministers of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Rashtra_Samithi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bharat Rashtra Samithi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tihar_Jail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tihar Jail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jainism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyendra_Kumar_Jain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satyendra Kumar Jain"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-112394505,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-1472435,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801755", "eventUri": "eng-9801755", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 106, "textEnd": 114}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-20", "textStart": 1422, "textEnd": 1431}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-12", "textStart": 1767, "textEnd": 1774}, {"amb": false, "date": "2015-03-", "textStart": 2245, "textEnd": 2253}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-04-", "textStart": 2363, "textEnd": 2371}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

In our experience, it appears that the trial courts and high courts appear to play safe in grant of bail,\" the top court stated.\n\nIt added that it did not see any error in the order of the trial court or High Court in considering the merits of the case but was granting Sisodia bail as there is not the remotest possibility of the trial concluding in near future.\n\nReacting to the decision, AAP Rajya Sabha MP and senior leader Sanjay Singh called it a \"victory of truth\". \"As I have said earlier, there is no truth/evidence in this case. Our leaders were forcibly put in jail. Manish Sisodia was kept in jail for 17 months...

His crime was that he gave a better future to the children of the poor.\"\n\nFacing allegations of providing kickbacks to liquor vendors, Sisodia was arrested by the ED and the CBI on February 26, 2023, and March 9, 2023, respectively. The charges levelled by the ED are under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA), which carries restrictive bail conditions under Section 45 of the Act.\n\nUnder the PMLA, the burden of proof is reversed and the accused must show that prima facie (at face value) they have not committed the crime and are not likely to commit any offence while on bail. In addition, the CBI has charged Sisodia with accepting bribes under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manish_Sisodia", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manish Sisodia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisodia_Dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sisodia Dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trial court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dalit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament,_Rajya_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burden of proof (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raghav_Chadha", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raghav Chadha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevention_of_Money_Laundering_Act,_2002", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickback_(bribery)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kickback (bribery)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prima_facie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prima facie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevention_of_Corruption_Act,_1988", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Kejriwal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arvind Kejriwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyendra_Kumar_Jain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satyendra Kumar Jain"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Surety_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Surety Bonds", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/08/Sisodia-CBI.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801755", "eventUri": "eng-9801755", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

I express my heartfelt gratitude to the Hon'ble Supreme Court. Manish ji was kept behind bars for 530 days. His crime was that he gave the children of the poor a better future. Dear children, your Manish uncle is coming back.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court, in its ruling delivered by Justices BR Gavai and KV Viswanathan, highlighted the injustice of prolonging Mr. Sisodia's imprisonment without any significant progress in the trial. \"Incarceration of 18 months... Trial not having even commenced and the appellant has been deprived of the right to a speedy trial. The trial court and High Court ought to have given due weightage to this,\" Justice Gavai remarked.\n\nAAP's Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh also welcomed the verdict, describing it as a \"slap on the Centre's dictatorship.\" He emphasized the impact of Mr. Sisodia's time in jail, saying, \"He was in jail for 17 months. His life was destroyed in those months. He could have worked for the education of children during that time.\" Singh expressed hope that other AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal and Satyendar Jain, would also receive justice. \"I bow down before the Supreme Court for this verdict,\" he added.\n\nMr. Sisodia was initially arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on February 26, 2023, in relation to the Delhi excise policy 2021-22, which has since been scrapped. On March 9, 2023, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) also arrested him on charges of money laundering linked to the CBI's investigation. Mr. Sisodia subsequently resigned from his ministerial post on February 28, 2023.\n\nIn response to the Supreme Court's decision, Delhi Education Minister Atishi posted a single phrase on X (formerly Twitter): \"Satyamev Jayate\" (Truth Alone Triumphs).\n\nThe Supreme Court's deliberations on the case were extensive, with the court pressing the investigative agencies for a timeline on when the trial might conclude. With 493 witnesses listed in the cases against Mr. Sisodia, the court demanded clarity on how long the legal process would take.\n\nThe case reached the Supreme Court after Mr. Sisodia's bail pleas were previously rejected by the Delhi High Court on May 21 and by a trial court on April 30.", "source": {"uri": "lagatar24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lagatar English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisodia_Dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sisodia Dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manish_Sisodia", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manish Sisodia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raghav_Chadha", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raghav Chadha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Honourable", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Honourable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament,_Rajya_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Appeal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trial court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atishi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atishi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Kejriwal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arvind Kejriwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyendra_Kumar_Jain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satyendra Kumar Jain"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://lagatar24.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/images.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801755", "eventUri": "eng-9801755", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-05-21", "textStart": 2689, "textEnd": 2695}, {"amb": false, "date": "-04-30", "textStart": 2720, "textEnd": 2728}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Besides, he will have to report to the investigating officer every Monday and Thursday between 10-11 am.\n\n\"We find that, on account of a long period of incarceration running for around 17 months and the trial even not having been commenced, the appellant (Sisodia) has been deprived of his right to speedy trial,\" the bench said.\n\n\"As observed by this court, the right to speedy trial and the right to liberty are sacrosanct rights. On denial of these rights, the trial court as well as the high court ought to have given due weightage to this factor,\" it said.\n\nOver a period of time, the court had observed that trial courts and high courts have forgotten a very well-settled principle of law that bail is not to be withheld as a punishment, the bench said while referring to earlier judgments.\n\n\"From our experience, we can say that it appears that the trial courts and the high courts attempt to play safe in matters of grant of bail. The principle that bail is a rule and refusal is an exception is, at times, followed in breach,\" it said.\n\nThe bench said on account of non-grant of bail even in straightforward open and shut cases, the apex court is flooded with a huge number of bail petitions. This adds to the huge pendency.\n\nKeeping Sisodia behind bars for an unlimited period of time in the hope of speedy completion of trial would deprive his fundamental right to liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution, the judges said.\n\n\"In the present case, the appellant (Sisodia) is having deep roots in society. There is no possibility of him fleeing from the country and not being available for facing the trial. In any case, conditions can be imposed to address the concern of the state,\" it said.\n\nThe bench set aside the May 21 verdict of the Delhi High Court which had dismissed Sisodia's pleas seeking bail in both these cases.\n\nSisodia had sought bail contending that he has been in custody for 17 months and the trial against him has not yet started. The ED and the CBI had opposed his bail pleas. He was nabbed by the CBI on February 26, 2023 for purported irregularities in the formulation and implementation of the now scrapped Delhi excise policy 2021-22. The following month, the ED arrested him in the money laundering case stemming from the CBI FIR on March 9, 2023. He resigned from the Delhi cabinet on February 28, 2023.

Gavai said that Sisodia has been deprived of his right to a speedy trial, considering the fact that he suffered incarceration of more than 17 months and the trial in the case has not yet commenced.\n\n\"In the matter of liberty, every day counts,\" remarked Justice Gavai-led Bench.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Bench, also comprising Justice K.V. Viswanathan, reserved its judgment after hearing the oral arguments raised by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) S.V. Raju, representing the central agencies, and senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who appeared on Sisodia's behalf.\n\nDuring the hearing, the CBI and the ED told the apex court that a Rs 100 crore bribe was demanded by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for the Goa elections, out of which Rs 45 crore has been traced in the course of the investigation.\n\n\"A Rs 100 crore bribe was demanded to be used for Goa elections. Out of which we have been able to trace 45 crore. We have digital evidence. There is a lot of evidence,\" the ASG said, adding that Sisodia was in charge of the Excise Department of the Delhi government and co-accused Vijay Nair was tasked to receive the kickbacks.\n\n\"They wanted to make money out of this exercise. There is evidence to show that this particular gentleman (Sisodia) engineered emails and told certain interns to write a particular type of email,\" Raju said.\n\nOn the other hand, Singhvi contended that the AAP leader has been in custody for 17 months and should be granted bail on the grounds of delay in the conclusion of the trial.\n\nSinghvi also prayed that Sisodia be released on interim bail. He said his wife has \"a very very bad medical condition\" and is \"virtually like a vegetable\".\n\nIn its judgment delivered on October 30 last year, the SC had denied bail to the former Deputy CM but said that if the trial proceeds slowly in the next three months, he may apply for bail afresh.\n\nSpecial Judge Kaveri Baweja of the Rouse Avenue Court had on April 30 refused to grant bail to Sisodia who was seeking regular bail a second time. Denying bail, the trial court order noted that delays in the case proceedings were largely due to actions attributable to Sisodia himself, dismissing his claims of undue delay.\n\nSubsequently, the Delhi High Court denied bail to Sisodia, saying that he failed to pass the triple test for grant of bail in the corruption case and the twin conditions required under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002.\n\nChallenging this, the former Deputy CM filed special leave petitions before the Supreme Court. Last month, the apex court had disposed of the pleas seeking bail in corruption and money laundering cases after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta gave an undertaking that the final charge sheet/complaint in the liquor policy case would be filed by July 3.\n\nMeanwhile, a court here extended the judicial custody of Sisodia, till August 9 in the corruption case and till August 13 in the money laundering case. He was produced through video conferencing from Tihar Jail upon expiry of the previously granted judicial custody.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"},

Sisodia, a prominent leader of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), had been imprisoned in connection with the Delhi excise policy case, which also involved allegations of corruption and money laundering.\n\nSisodia's legal ordeal began on February 26, 2023, when the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrested him over alleged irregularities in the formulation and execution of the Delhi excise policy. This arrest followed multiple rounds of questioning by the CBI. Just over a week later, on March 9, 2023, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) took Sisodia into custody in a related money laundering case, further extending his detention.\n\nThe Supreme Court, comprising Justices B.R. Gavai and K.V. Viswanathan, issued the bail order today, citing Sisodia's prolonged incarceration and the lack of progress in his trial as reasons for granting relief. The bench noted that Sisodia had been held for 17 months without the commencement of his trial, which undermined his right to a speedy trial. The justices emphasized that it would be unjust to force Sisodia to remain in detention while awaiting trial.\n\nALSO READ: Delhi Police Foils Potential Terror Attack: ISIS Operative Rizwan Ali In Custody\n\n- November 2021: The Delhi government introduced a new excise policy.\n\n- July 2022: Lieutenant Governor V.K.

These, the central agencies said, included the ones seeking copies of documents annexed with the final reports in two separate cases lodged by them.\n\nA division bench of Justices B.R. Gavai and K.V. Vishwanathan, however, said the probe agencies had failed to establish that Sisodia filed any \"frivolous\" application. The judges rejected that argument as well as similar observations made by the trial court and the Delhi High Court that Sisodia had slowed the trial.\n\nThe bench took note of the voluminous documents filed by the CBI and the ED in their respective chargesheets, and said the AAP leader could not be denied these papers, including the ones on which the agencies were not relying. This, it held, would take \"substantial time\".\n\nThis could not be a reason to keep Sisodia behind bars, the bench added, while reiterating the well-established bail jurisprudence that \"bail cannot be denied as a matter of punishment\".\n\nThe judgment also reminded trial courts and high court that \"bail is a rule and jail is an exception\" and that the two fora should not \"play safe\" in matters of bail.\n\nThe ED and CBI's request to ask Sisodia to apply afresh before the trial court was also rejected. The bench noted that Sisodia was given the liberty to revive his plea after the chargesheet was filed, which had already been done.\n\n\"Now, relegating Sisodia to trial court and then the HC would be like playing a game of snake and ladder,\" the bench observed.\n\nWhile stipulating bail conditions for Sisodia, the judges declined to entertain an oral request made by the investigating agencies to impose a similar restriction as was put on Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal -- that Sisodia would not visit the CM's office.\n\nThis now means if Sisodia is re-inducted as a minister in the Delhi government, he can attend office and take decisions.\n\nThe bail conditions also include a bail bond of Rs 10 lakh and two sureties of the same amount, as well as visiting the offices of the CBI and the ED twice a week. The two days fixed are Monday and Thursday.\n\nAlso read: Multiple applications by Sisodia delaying trial in excise policy case, says CBI -- 'we can't be blamed'\n\nSisodia successful in 2nd attempt in SC\n\nSisodia had moved the Supreme Court after the Delhi High Court rejected his second bail plea on 21 May. In doing so, the high court noted that Sisodia's case depicted a grave misuse of power and breach of trust.\n\nThe high court further said the material collected in the matter showed that Sisodia \"subverted the process of making the excise policy by fabricating public feedback to suit his goal\". It upheld the trial court's prima facie finding on Sisodia's alleged involvement in the case.\n\nThe trial court and high court decisions came on Sisodia's second attempt to get bail. In October last, the top court dismissed his first set of bail pleas (in the CBI and ED cases). But it had allowed him to apply fresh if there was no progress in the trial in three months. Subsequently, Sisodia moved the trial court and, on rejection, appealed in the HC.\n\nThereafter, Sisodia appproached the SC, that on 4 June had disposed of his bail plea against the May judgment of the high court after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta assured it that the final chargesheet/prosecution complaint in the liquor policy case would be filed on or before 3 July.\n\nBut the SC had granted him liberty to revive his plea for bail after the final complaint or chargesheet was filed.\n\nOn Friday, the judges observed that when Sisodia knocked on the top court's doors again in June, a period of seven months had already lapsed from its first order in October 2023.\n\n\"It will be a travesty of justice to note that he has to be relegated to trial court again. Procedures cannot be made a mistress of justice. In our view, the liberty reserved will have to be construed as liberty to revive the petition after filing of chargesheet,\" the bench said, while not entertaining the ED and CBI's preliminary objection to Sisodia's bail plea.\n\nThe bench went on to examine the argument over the delay in the trial, while commenting that neither the high court nor the trial court had \"properly\" considered the aspect of right to speedy trial. Both, it weighed in, dealt with the case on merits.\n\nIt faulted the courts below for opining that Sisodia had caused the delay.\n\n\"A perusal of compliance report by assistant director of ED shows that 70 to 80 days are taken to prepare one copy of the clone of the unrelied data. Though various applications were filed by several accused, he filed only 13 applications in the CBI case and 14 applications in the ED case. All applications were allowed by the trial court. Some were challenged before HC as well,\" the court said, indicating the agencies too were responsible for the delay.\n\nThe bench also said that eight chargesheets were filed by the ED and the probe had to be completed by 3 July. The statement by law officers that trial would end within six months was self contradictory, the court remarked.\n\n\"If the probe was to end on July 3, then the trial could never end within six months of the first order,\" the judges said.\n\nThe court further noted that Sisodia had been deprived of the right to speedy trial, which was \"a sacrosanct right\". No agency, it added, can oppose bail if it cannot protect the right to speedy trial. \"Article 21 applies irrespective of the crime,\" the bench asserted.\n\nSince there was \"no remote possibility of completion of trial within time\", then \"keeping him behind bars for the purpose of completion of trial will be nothing but a violation of Article 21\", the court said.\n\nOn the CBI and ED's argument that Sisodia could tamper with evidence when on bail, the court remarked he has \" deep roots in society and agencies' apprehension that he will flee is unsustainable\". Moreover, it said the case largely depended on documents that were in CBI and ED custody.\n\n(Edited by Tikli Basu)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bhadra_sinha@theprint.in", "name": "Bhadra Sinha", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisodia_Dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sisodia Dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chargesheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chargesheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trial court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dalit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Delhi High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_bench", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Division bench"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Excise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisprudence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jurisprudence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chief_ministers_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of chief ministers of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prima_facie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prima facie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Kejriwal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arvind Kejriwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Surety_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Surety Bonds", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Manish-Sisodia-granted-bail.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801755", "eventUri": "eng-9801755", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-05-21", "textStart": 2629, "textEnd": 2635}, {"amb": false, "date": "-06-04", "textStart": 3435, "textEnd": 3441}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-03", "textStart": 3666, "textEnd": 3672, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

In our view, keeping the appellant behind bars for an unlimited period of time in the hope of speedy completion of trial would deprive him of the Fundamental Right of Liberty given under Article 21 of the Constitution.\"\n\nThe Bench, also comprising Justice KV Viswanathan held that on account of a long period of incarceration running for around 17 months and the trial not having commenced, the senior AAP leader has been deprived of his right to speedy trial.\n\n\"The right to speedy trial and Right to Liberty are sacrosanct rights. On denial of these rights, the trial court as well as the High Court, ought to have given due weightage to this factor,\" it said, setting aside the orders of the court below denying bail to Sisodia.\n\nFurther, the apex court, in its judgment, noted that Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Raju, who appeared on behalf of central agencies, could not point out a single order of the trial court terming any of the applications filed by Sisodia as \"frivolous\".\n\nIt said, \"It has been submitted on behalf of the ED that hundreds of applications have been filed for supply of un-relied upon documents, the record would not substantiate the said position. Though various applications have been filed by different accused persons, in so far as the present appellant (Sisodia) is concerned, he has filed only 13 applications in the CBI matter and 14 in ED matter. It would reveal that some of the applications are for seeking permission to meet his ailing wife, permission to file vakalatnama, to put signature on documents, seeking permission to sign cheques, etc.\n\n\"Most of the applications are for supply of missing documents and legible copies of documents, and some of the applications are for inspection of un-relied upon documents.\n\n\"It is further to note that all these applications have been allowed by the learned trial court....We find that the finding of the learned trial judge that it is the appellant who is responsible for delaying the trial is not supported by the record.\"\n\nThe top court ruled that the accused is entitled to take a reasonable time to inspect the trial record involving 69,000 pages and cannot be denied inspection of documents for a fair trial.\n\nRejecting the contention that Sisodia if granted bail may tamper with the evidence, the Supreme Court said that the prosecution case majorly stems from documentary evidence, which has already been seized by the CBI and the ED.\n\nTo rule out the possibility of influencing witnesses by the accused, imposing stringent conditions, the apex court asked Sisodia to furnish bail bonds in the sum of Rs. 10 lakh with two sureties of like amount.\n\nIt ordered Sisodia to surrender his passport with the special court and to report to the investigative officer on every Monday and Thursday between 10 to 11 A.M.\n\n\"The appellant shall not make any attempt to either influence the witnesses or to tamper with the evidence,\" it added.\n\nThe SC refused to accept ASG Raju's submission that Sisodia should not be allowed to visit the Delhi CM's office or Delhi Secretariat.\n\nIn its judgment delivered on October 30 last year, the top court had denied bail to the former Deputy CM but said that if the trial proceeds slowly in the next three months, he may apply for bail afresh.\n\nSpecial Judge Kaveri Baweja of the Rouse Avenue Court had on April 30 refused to grant bail to Sisodia who was seeking regular bail for a second time.\n\nDenying bail, the trial court order noted that delays in the case proceedings were largely due to actions attributable to Sisodia himself, dismissing his claims of undue delay.\n\nSubsequently, the Delhi High Court denied bail to Sisodia, saying that he failed to pass the triple test for grant of bail in the corruption case and the twin conditions required under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002.\n\nChallenging this, the former Deputy CM filed Special Leave Petitions before the Supreme Court.\n\nLast month, the apex court had disposed of the pleas seeking bail in corruption and money laundering cases after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta gave an undertaking that the final charge sheet/complaint in the liquor policy case would be filed by July 3.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.co.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times, India Edition"}, "authors": [],

PTI\n\nOn Friday, the Supreme Court granted bail to AAP leader Manish Sisodia.\n\nThe AAP leader has been in custody for 17 months in the corruption and money laundering cases linked to the alleged Delhi excise policy scam.\n\nThe apex court bench comprising justices BR Gavai and KV Viswanathan said Sisodia had been deprived of the right to a speedy trial.\n\nThe AAP hailed the decision as \"victory of truth\" and added that it hoped that other jailed leaders of the party \"will also get justice.\"\n\nSisodia, the former deputy chief minister of Delhi, was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on February 26, 2023 for purported irregularities in the formulation and implementation of the now-scrapped Delhi excise policy 2021-22.\n\nThe Enforcement Directorate (ED) arrested him in the money laundering case stemming from the CBI FIR on March 9, 2023.\n\nSisodia resigned from the Delhi cabinet on February 28, 2023.\n\nHe argued that has been in custody for 17 months and the trial against him has not yet started.\n\nThe ED and the CBI had opposed his bail pleas.\n\nThe apex court said that Sisodia was entitled to a speedy trial and that denying him bail and sending his case back down to the lower courts would be like 'making him play snakes and ladders,' as per NDTV.\n\n\"In a matter pertaining to the life and liberty of a citizen, which is one of the most sacrosanct rights guaranteed by the Constitution, a citizen cannot be made to run from pillar to post,\" the court said.\n\nThe court said Sisodia cannot be kept behind bars for \"unlimited time\" without a trial.\n\n\"Incarceration of 18 months&mldr; Trial not having even commenced and appellant has been deprived of right to speedy trial,\" Justice Gavai.\n\n\"Keeping appellant behind bars for unlimited time will deny fundamental right. Appellant has deep roots in society&mldr; no apprehension of fleeing. Anyway&mldr; conditions can be imposed.\"\n\n\"Trial court and High Court ought to have given due weightage to this. Courts have forgotten that bail ought not to be withheld as punishment. Principle bail is the rule and jail an exception&mldr;\" the court added.\n\n\"Bail can't be rejected as punishment (of the accused),\" the court said as per NDTV**.**\n\nAs per NDTV, this is because of the three big AAP leaders who were arrested in the liquor policy case, just Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal remains behind bars.\n\nKejriwal had secured bail after being arrested by the ED.\n\nHowever, he remains in jail after being arrested by the CBI.\n\nIn April, AAP leader Sanjay Singh got bail after spending six months in jail.\n\nAs per Indian Express, Sisodia's release also comes as the AAP struggles to govern Delhi amid heavy monsoon showers.\n\nThe piece noted how the AAP has been badly hurt by the absence of both Kejriwal and Sisodia.\n\nThis, as it tussles with Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena, appointed by the Centre, and the bureaucrats.\n\nThe piece noted that Sisodia's return will help steady the party.\n\nThe development also comes as the AAP prepares for the upcoming Assembly polls in Delhi and Haryana.\n\nThe Indian Express piece added that the development will also boost the morale of the party cadre ahead of the polls.\n\nSingh, the AAP's Rajya Sabha MP, AAP Delhi state convener Gopal Rai, AAP national general secretary (organisation) Sandeep Pathak, and Delhi ministers Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj all met on Thursday to discuss the party strategy.\n\nThe AAP in July said that it will contest all 90 Assembly seats in Haryana.\n\nThe party contested the Lok Sabha polls in alliance with its INDIA bloc partner Congress in Haryana, Delhi and Gujarat.\n\nHowever, this alliance drew a blank in Delhi with BJP effecting a clean sweep for a third time. The AAP had contested from Kurukshetra but lost to the BJP.\n\nAfter the Lok Sabha poll results, Rai had said his party's alliance with the Congress was only for the Lok Sabha elections and had hinted that the ruling party in the city will go its own way the upcoming Assembly polls.\n\n'Victory of truth'\n\nIn a post on X in Hindi, party MP Raghav Chadha said, \"The whole country is happy today as Manish Sisodia, the hero of Delhi education revolution, got bail. I express my gratitude to the Honorable Supreme Court from the bottom of my heart.\" \"Manish ji was kept behind the bars for 530 days. His crime was that he gave a better future to the children of the poor. Dear children, your Manish uncle is coming back,\" Chadha said.\n\nHailing Sisodia's bail as a \"victory of truth\", AAP's Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh, said, \"This verdict is a slap on the Centre's dictatorship. He was in jail for 17 months. His life was destroyed in those months. He could have worked for the education of children during that time.\"\n\n\"We hope that other leaders of the party, Arvind Kejriwal and Satyendar Jain, will also get bail and justice. I bow down before the Supreme Court for this verdict,\" he added.\n\nThis verdict is a big boost for the AAP, he said.\n\nDelhi Education minister Atishi posted \"Satyamev Jayate\" on X.\n\nHowever, the BJP hit back at the AAP, saying that Sisodia wasn't free and clear.\n\n\"Manish Sisodia has got bail in the liquor policy scam case. The BJP always respects court's decision&mldr; but getting bail for an accused does not mean being free from the charges,\" party Delhi chief Virendra Sachdeva, said, \"Investigations are going on&mldr; court will see the evidence.\"\n\n\"Be it Arvind Kejriwal or Manish Sisodia or others&mldr; all of them have brokered the liquor policy scam and this decision will be in front of everyone in the 'court of the people',\" he declared.\n\nBJP MP Yogendra Chandolia told NDTV the AAP shouldn't get carried away.\n\n\"Look&mldr; this comes under the jurisdiction of the court, whether they grant bail or not. He was in jail for 17-18 months and was continuously trying&mldr; now on what terms and conditions he got bail will be known later. I would just like to say to AAP don't be too happy. Bail is just a relief&mldr; it is relief for a short time. The case will go on in the court&mldr; the agency has evidence,\" Chandolia said.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Raju, representing the central agencies, and senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who appeared on Sisodia's behalf.\n\nDuring the hearing, the CBI and the ED told the apex court that a INR 100 crore bribe was demanded by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for the Goa elections, out of which INR 45 crore has been traced in the course of the investigation.\n\n\"A INR 100 crore bribe was demanded to be used for Goa elections. Out of which we have been able to trace 45 crore. We have digital evidence. There is a lot of evidence,\" the ASG said, adding that Sisodia was in charge of the Excise Department of the Delhi government and co-accused Vijay Nair was tasked to receive the kickbacks.\n\n\"They wanted to make money out of this exercise. There is evidence to show that this particular gentleman (Sisodia) engineered emails and told certain interns to write a particular type of email,\" Raju said.\n\nOn the other hand, Singhvi contended that the AAP leader has been in custody for 17 months and should be granted bail on the grounds of delay in the conclusion of the trial.\n\nSinghvi also prayed that Sisodia be released on interim bail. He said his wife has \"a very very bad medical condition\" and is \"virtually like a vegetable\".\n\nIn its judgment delivered on October 30 last year, the SC had denied bail to the former Deputy CM but said that if the trial proceeds slowly in the next three months, he may apply for bail afresh.\n\nSpecial Judge Kaveri Baweja of the Rouse Avenue Court had on April 30 refused to grant bail to Sisodia who was seeking regular bail a second time. Denying bail, the trial court order noted that delays in the case proceedings were largely due to actions attributable to Sisodia himself, dismissing his claims of undue delay.\n\nSubsequently, the Delhi High Court denied bail to Sisodia, saying that he failed to pass the triple test for grant of bail in the corruption case and the twin conditions required under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002.\n\nChallenging this, the former Deputy CM filed special leave petitions before the Supreme Court. Last month, the apex court had disposed of the pleas seeking bail in corruption and money laundering cases after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta gave an undertaking that the final charge sheet/complaint in the liquor policy case would be filed by July 3.\n\nMeanwhile, a court here extended the judicial custody of Sisodia, till August 9 in the corruption case and till August 13 in the money laundering case. He was produced through video conferencing from Tihar Jail upon expiry of the previously granted judicial custody.", "source": {"uri": "easternmirrornagaland.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

However, SG's statement was taken on record.\n\n\"This court had granted liberty to appellant to revive his prayer...now relegating back to trial court would be making him play game of snakes and ladders.\n\n\"A citizen cannot be made to run from pillar to post. June 4 order recorded that it did not go into merits. This court noted assurance of SG that investigation would be completed and chargesheet would be filed before 3 july..\n\n\"It would be travesty of justice to relegate the appellant to trial Court. Liberty reserved by this court on 4 june to revive will have to be interpreted as reviving of prayer before this court. Not inclined to entertain preliminary objection.\n\n\"We have considered S. 45 PMLA objection. We have referred to oct 2023 judgment where it was said that delay in trial should be read into S.45. In view of long incarceration, rigors can be relaxed.\n\n\"The question is whether trial court and high court have considered delay in trial. In our view, there was ignorance of this court's order,\n\n\"Trial Court rejected appellant's contention that he did not contribute to delay. however, in one para, it recorded that...it would take 70-80 days to prepare one copy of digital unrelied documents.\n\n\"Present appellant only filed 14 and 13 applications in ED and CBI cases...most were for supply of missing documents...some were for inspection. All were allowed.\n\n\"When we specifically asked ASG to show any order where trial Court found any application to be frivolous, but not one was showed. We find that the finding of delay by appellant is not supported by record.\n\n\"Incarceration of 18 months...Trial not having been even commenced, appellant has been deprived of right to speedy trial...trial Court and HC ought to have given due weightage to this.\n\n\"Art 21 applies irrespective of nature of crime. Courts have forgotten that bail ought not to be withheld as punishment. Principle bail is the rule and jail an exception.\n\n\"It is high time that courts should recognise that jail is rule and bail an exception. in this case, 493 witnesses named. There is not remotest possibility that trial will conclude in recent future.\n\n\"Keeping appellant behind bars for unlimited time will deny fundamental right. Appellant is having deep roots in society. No apprehension of fleeing. Anyway conditions can be imposed.\n\n\"Insofar as tampering, most evidence is documentary. Already with ED/CBI. In the result, we ALLOW the appeals. Delhi High Court judgment is set aside. Appellant directed to be released.\n\n\"Appellant shall surrender passport. Shall report to IO on every Monday. Shall not attempt to influence witness.\"\n\nSisodia was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on February 26, 2023 for his alleged involvement in the purported irregularities in the

PTI\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday granted bail to former Delhi deputy chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party leader Manish Sisodia in connection with the liquor policy case. The apex court's decision came as a response to the prolonged detention of Sisodia highlighting the delay in the commencement of the trial and emphasised the constitutional right to a speedy trial as guaranteed by Article 21.\n\nWith nearly 495 witnesses and an overwhelming volume of documents yet to be examined, the Supreme Court recognised that there was no foreseeable conclusion to the trial in the near future. Consequently, the bench of Justices BR Gavai and KV Viswanathan allowed Sisodia's bail plea underscoring the necessity to balance the seriousness of the charges with the fundamental rights of the accused.\n\nHere are 10 key points from the Supreme Court decision granting bail to Sisodia in the liquor policy case:\n\n1. Supreme Court grants bail\n\nThe Supreme Court allowed the bail plea of Sisodia, who has been in custody for 17 months in the liquor policy case, citing the delay in trial proceedings.\n\n2. Right to speedy trial\n\nThe Supreme Court emphasised the constitutional right to a speedy trial noting that the prolonged incarceration without trial commencement violates Article 21, which guarantees personal liberty.\n\n3. Unlikely trial conclusion\n\nWith approximately 495 witnesses and thousands of documents to be reviewed, the Supreme Court acknowledged that completing the trial in the near future was improbable.\n\n4. No flight risk\n\nThe apex court concluded that Sisodia poses no flight risk due to his \"deep roots in society,\" and most of the evidence is already documented reducing the chance of tampering.\n\n5. Conditions on bail\n\nWhile the Supreme Court considered imposing conditions similar to those in the Arvind Kejriwal case, it rejected the request to restrict Sisodia from visiting the chief minister's office or the Delhi Secretariat.\n\n6. Critical of lower courts\n\nThe Supreme Court found errors in the trial court and the Delhi High Court's handling of the case, particularly their failure to consider the trial delay as a significant factor.\n\n7. Contradictory stance by agencies\n\nThe apex court noted the contradictory position of the ED and CBI, which claimed readiness to expedite the trial while simultaneously requesting more time for supplementary chargesheets.\n\n8. Prosecution's delay not attributable to Sisodia\n\nJustice BR Gavai clarified that Sisodia's requests for document inspections were legitimate for ensuring a fair trial and not responsible for the trial's delay.\n\n9. Reference to recent precedents\n\nThe Supreme Court referred to recent precedents that prevent investigating agencies from opposing bail solely based on the severity of the offence if they cannot guarantee a timely trial.\n\n10. Rejection of 'snake and ladder' argument\n\nThe Supreme Court dismissed the suggestion that Sisodia should seek bail from the trial court likening it to a \"snake and ladder\" game that would unjustly prolong his detention.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisodia_Dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sisodia Dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedy_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speedy trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manish_Sisodia", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manish Sisodia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_right", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional right"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_a_fair_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right to a fair trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Kejriwal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arvind Kejriwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trial court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-2024-05-21T132855.642-2024-05-97b8a6745e37b32eb7fc826195b869a4.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801755", "eventUri": "eng-9801755", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

In our view, keeping the appellant behind bars for an unlimited period of time in the hope of speedy completion of trial would deprive him of the Fundamental Right of Liberty given under Article 21 of the Constitution.\"\n\nThe Bench, also comprising Justice KV Viswanathan held that on account of a long period of incarceration running for around 17 months and the trial not having commenced, the senior AAP leader has been deprived of his right to speedy trial.\n\n\"The right to speedy trial and Right to Liberty are sacrosanct rights. On denial of these rights, the trial court as well as the High Court, ought to have given due weightage to this factor,\" it said, setting aside the orders of the court below denying bail to Sisodia.\n\nFurther, the apex court, in its judgment, noted that Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Raju, who appeared on behalf of central agencies, could not point out a single order of the trial court terming any of the applications filed by Sisodia as \"frivolous\".\n\nIt said, \"It has been submitted on behalf of the ED that hundreds of applications have been filed for supply of un-relied upon documents, the record would not substantiate the said position. Though various applications have been filed by different accused persons, in so far as the present appellant (Sisodia) is concerned, he has filed only 13 applications in the CBI matter and 14 in ED matter. It would reveal that some of the applications are for seeking permission to meet his ailing wife, permission to file vakalatnama, to put signature on documents, seeking permission to sign cheques, etc.\n\n\"Most of the applications are for supply of missing documents and legible copies of documents, and some of the applications are for inspection of un-relied upon documents.\n\n\"It is further to note that all these applications have been allowed by the learned trial court....We find that the finding of the learned trial judge that it is the appellant who is responsible for delaying the trial is not supported by the record.\"\n\nThe top court ruled that the accused is entitled to take a reasonable time to inspect the trial record involving 69,000 pages and cannot be denied inspection of documents for a fair trial.\n\nRejecting the contention that Sisodia if granted bail may tamper with the evidence, the Supreme Court said that the prosecution case majorly stems from documentary evidence, which has already been seized by the CBI and the ED.\n\nTo rule out the possibility of influencing witnesses by the accused, imposing stringent conditions, the apex court asked Sisodia to furnish bail bonds in the sum of Rs. 10 lakh with two sureties of like amount.\n\nIt ordered Sisodia to surrender his passport with the special court and to report to the investigative officer on every Monday and Thursday between 10 to 11 A.M.\n\n\"The appellant shall not make any attempt to either influence the witnesses or to tamper with the evidence,\" it added.\n\nThe SC refused to accept ASG Raju's submission that Sisodia should not be allowed to visit the Delhi CM's office or Delhi Secretariat.\n\nIn its judgment delivered on October 30 last year, the top court had denied bail to the former Deputy CM but said that if the trial proceeds slowly in the next three months, he may apply for bail afresh.\n\nSpecial Judge Kaveri Baweja of the Rouse Avenue Court had on April 30 refused to grant bail to Sisodia who was seeking regular bail for a second time.\n\nDenying bail, the trial court order noted that delays in the case proceedings were largely due to actions attributable to Sisodia himself, dismissing his claims of undue delay.\n\nSubsequently, the Delhi High Court denied bail to Sisodia, saying that he failed to pass the triple test for grant of bail in the corruption case and the twin conditions required under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002.\n\nChallenging this, the former Deputy CM filed Special Leave Petitions before the Supreme

In our view, keeping the appellant behind bars for an unlimited period of time in the hope of speedy completion of trial would deprive him of the Fundamental Right of Liberty given under Article 21 of the Constitution.\"\n\nThe Bench, also comprising Justice KV Viswanathan held that on account of a long period of incarceration running for around 17 months and the trial not having commenced, the senior AAP leader has been deprived of his right to speedy trial.\n\n\"The right to speedy trial and Right to Liberty are sacrosanct rights. On denial of these rights, the trial court as well as the High Court, ought to have given due weightage to this factor,\" it said, setting aside the orders of the court below denying bail to Sisodia.\n\nFurther, the apex court, in its judgment, noted that Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Raju, who appeared on behalf of central agencies, could not point out a single order of the trial court terming any of the applications filed by Sisodia as \"frivolous\".\n\nIt said, \"It has been submitted on behalf of the ED that hundreds of applications have been filed for supply of un-relied upon documents, the record would not substantiate the said position. Though various applications have been filed by different accused persons, in so far as the present appellant (Sisodia) is concerned, he has filed only 13 applications in the CBI matter and 14 in ED matter. It would reveal that some of the applications are for seeking permission to meet his ailing wife, permission to file vakalatnama, to put signature on documents, seeking permission to sign cheques, etc.\n\n\"Most of the applications are for supply of missing documents and legible copies of documents, and some of the applications are for inspection of un-relied upon documents.\n\n\"It is further to note that all these applications have been allowed by the learned trial court....We find that the finding of the learned trial judge that it is the appellant who is responsible for delaying the trial is not supported by the record.\"\n\nThe top court ruled that the accused is entitled to take a reasonable time to inspect the trial record involving 69,000 pages and cannot be denied inspection of documents for a fair trial.\n\nRejecting the contention that Sisodia if granted bail may tamper with the evidence, the Supreme Court said that the prosecution case majorly stems from documentary evidence, which has already been seized by the CBI and the ED.\n\nTo rule out the possibility of influencing witnesses by the accused, imposing stringent conditions, the apex court asked Sisodia to furnish bail bonds in the sum of Rs. 10 lakh with two sureties of like amount.\n\nIt ordered Sisodia to surrender his passport with the special court and to report to the investigative officer on every Monday and Thursday between 10 to 11 A.M.\n\n\"The appellant shall not make any attempt to either influence the witnesses or to tamper with the evidence,\" it added.\n\nThe SC refused to accept ASG Raju's submission that Sisodia should not be allowed to visit the Delhi CM's office or Delhi Secretariat.\n\nIn its judgment delivered on October 30 last year, the top court had denied bail to the former Deputy CM but said that if the trial proceeds slowly in the next three months, he may apply for bail afresh.\n\nSpecial Judge Kaveri Baweja of the Rouse Avenue Court had on April 30 refused to grant bail to Sisodia who was seeking regular bail for a second time.\n\nDenying bail, the trial court order noted that delays in the case proceedings were largely due to actions attributable to Sisodia himself, dismissing his claims of undue delay.\n\nSubsequently, the Delhi High Court denied bail to Sisodia, saying that he failed to pass the triple test for grant of bail in the corruption case and the twin conditions required under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002.\n\nChallenging this, the former Deputy CM filed Special Leave Petitions before the Supreme Court.\n\nLast month, the apex court had disposed of the pleas seeking bail in corruption and money laundering cases after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta gave an undertaking that the final charge sheet/complaint in the liquor policy case would be filed by July 3.", "source": {"uri": "thestatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Statesman"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The court also imposed various conditions including surrendering the passport and not influencing witnesses.\n\nThe top court was hearing Sisodia's appeal challenging the Delhi High Court order that dismissed his bail plea in the cases being probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate.\n\nDuring the hearing, Additional Solicitor General SV Raju, appearing for the probe agencies, had raised apprehension that witnesses may be influenced.\n\nASG Raju said that some important witnesses can be examined. He further added that these witnesses could be influenced. He also said that there is evidence that he has destroyed phone records.\n\nASG had blamed Sisodia for filing various miscellaneous applications related to the supply of unrelated documents. He also said that the trial could have proceeded irrespective of further investigation.\n\nSenior Advocate A M Singhvi, appearing for Sisodia, had said that seventeen months are already over which is almost half of the minimum possible sentence in the case.\n\nHe has also countered probe agencies' allegations on profit margin and said that it was the cabinet decisions taken after deliberations with many officials including then LG.\n\nASG Raju on Monday stated that one cannot arbitrarily increase the profit margins without reason. He has Earlier, further added that Sisodia is not an innocent person picked up for political reasons but he is neck-deep in the scam.\n\nHe further added that there is evidence pointing to his involvement. He further said that he was deputy Chief Minister with 18 portfolios and responsible for all cabinet decisions.\n\nOn June 4, the top court also gave him the liberty to revive his prayer afresh after filing the final charge sheet.\n\nIn February 2023, Sisodia was arrested by the CBI for alleged irregularities in the framing and implementation of now-scrapped Delhi's new excise policy.\n\nThe policy was withdrawn amid allegations of foul play by the opposition. Sisodia is currently in judicial custody.\n\nAccording to the CBI, Sisodia had played the most vital role in the criminal conspiracy and he had been deeply involved in the formulation as well as the implementation of the said policy to ensure the achievement of the objectives of the said conspiracy.

I'm currently at Sanjay Singh's residence, where he is providing detailed information to viewers. The breaking news is that Manish Sisodia has received bail after being behind bars for nearly 17 months. He has been granted bail in the Delhi Liquor Policy case, where the investigation has been ongoing, and his difficulties were compounded by his prolonged imprisonment.\n\nSisodia's bail comes on the condition of providing personal sureties of \u20b910 lakh each and surrendering his passport. The Supreme Court's comments indicated a favorable outcome for Sisodia, given the delay in the investigation. Last October, when Sisodia initially sought bail, the Supreme Court had denied it, noting that the investigation was expected to take 6-8 months. As the investigation continued to drag on, Sisodia approached the Supreme Court again, which acknowledged that delays should not be the responsibility of the accused and thus granted him bail.\n\nThis development brings relief to Sisodia and his family and suggests hope for the return of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal as well. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is celebrating this decision, seeing it as a significant boost for their leader and party morale.

Though the bench raised doubts about some of the money laundering allegations made by the ED, the bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and S V N Bhatti stated that there was \"one clear ground\" -- that wholesale liquor distributors made an excess profit of Rs. 338 Crore under the new liquor policy -- that was \"tentatively supported by material and evidence\".\n\nHowever, the court was sympathetic to Sisodia's argument that the trial had not begun and would likely take years, as there were over 450 witnesses for the CBI and the ED to examine. After the Centre gave assurances that the trial would be completed within a few months, the court held that Sisodia could \"move a fresh application for bail in case of change in circumstances, or in case the trial is protracted and proceeds at a snail's pace in next three months\".\n\nOn June 4, 2024, a vacation bench of the Supreme Court briefly heard a fresh bail plea filed by Sisodia but declined to entertain it any further, after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta gave assurances that the final chargesheet would be filed by July 3. The bench allowed Sisodia to approach the court again and revive his bail plea after the chargesheet was filed.\n\nThough the case was listed for hearing again on July 11, 2024, the proceedings were briefly delayed after Justice P V Sanjay Kumar recused himself from being a part of the bench. Finally, the court issued notice in his bail plea on July 16, when the case was placed before a bench comprising Justices B R Gavai, Sanjay Karol, and K V Viswanathan.\n\nWhat are the allegations against Manish Sisodia?\n\nFacing allegations of providing kickbacks to liquor vendors, Sisodia was arrested by the ED and the CBI on February 26, 2023, and March 9, 2023, respectively. The charges levelled by the ED are under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA), which carries restrictive bail conditions under Section 45 of the Act.\n\nUnder the PMLA, the burden of proof is reversed and the accused must show that prima facie (at face value) they have not committed the crime and are not likely to commit any offence while on bail. In addition, the CBI has charged Sisodia with accepting bribes under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ajoy_sinha_karpuram@indianexpress.com", "name": "Ajoy Sinha Karpuram", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisodia_Dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sisodia Dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liquor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjiv_Khanna", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sanjiv Khanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manish_Sisodia", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manish Sisodia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Excise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dalit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tushar_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tushar Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor_General_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solicitor General of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chargesheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chargesheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burden of proof (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevention_of_Money_Laundering_Act,_2002", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickback_(bribery)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kickback (bribery)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prima_facie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prima facie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevention_of_Corruption_Act,_1988", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Surety_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Surety Bonds", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/08/ch1800704.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801755", "eventUri": "eng-9801755", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-03", "textStart": 1397, "textEnd": 1403}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-16", "textStart": 1750, "textEnd": 1757}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-07-", "textStart": 1566, "textEnd": 1573}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Though it raised doubts on some of the charges levelled against him by ED, the court, however, said there is \"material and evidence\" which \"tentatively\" supports one of the charges under the PMLA, 2002. According to the charge, 14 wholesale distributors had earned \"excess profit\" of Rs 338 crore in a period of about 10 months during which the new excise policy was in operation between 2021 and 2022.\n\nIt also said the prosecution had assured that trial would be completed in six-eight months, and added that Sisodia could file a fresh bail application if the trial was protracted. Subsequently, the court also dismissed petitions seeking review of the October 10 order.\n\nOn June 4, 2024, a vacation bench of the SC declined to entertain Sisodia's bail plea after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta assured that the final chargesheet/prosecution complaint against him would be filed by July 3. Noting the assurance, the top court bench disposed of the bail plea and said Sisodia could revive it once the chargesheet is filed.\n\nReserving its verdict on Tuesday, the SC asked the ED to provide a realistic answer as to when it expects to conclude the trial in the case. While Sisodia has stressed on the delay in the commencement of the trial to seek bail, the ED, opposing this, has contended that the delay was being caused by the AAP leader himself by filing one application after the other.\n\n\"Realistically you tell me, when do you see the end of the tunnel considering there are 493 witnesses?,\" said Justice K V Viswanathan who was part of a two-judge bench hearing Sisodia's bail plea.

The decision, made on Friday morning, comes after a series of strong remarks from the court, emphasizing the importance of a \"speedy trial\" and condemning the lower courts' handling of the case.\n\nA bench comprising Justice BR Gavai and Justice KV Viswanathan highlighted that keeping the Aam Aadmi Party leader in jail for an \"unlimited time\" without commencing the trial was a violation of his fundamental rights. The court compared sending Mr. Sisodia back to the trial court to playing a game of \"snakes and ladders,\" underscoring the unpredictability and delays involved.\n\n\"Incarceration of 18 months... with the trial not even commenced, has deprived the appellant of his right to a speedy trial,\" remarked Justice Gavai. He questioned the lower courts' rationale, noting that the prolonged detention effectively denied Mr. Sisodia his fundamental rights.\n\nThe Supreme Court asserted that Mr. Sisodia has deep roots in society and poses no risk of fleeing. The bench criticized the lower courts for neglecting the principle that \"bail is the rule, and jail is the exception,\" and for seemingly using bail denial as a form of punishment.\n\nThe court also took issue with the lower court's argument that Mr. Sisodia had delayed the trial and should therefore remain in custody. Justice Gavai pointed out that with 493 witnesses named in the case, there was no realistic chance of concluding the trial in the near future, making prolonged detention unjustifiable.\n\nManish Sisodia was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on February 26, 2023, followed by an arrest by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) less than two weeks later. With this latest ruling, Mr. Sisodia has been granted bail in both cases. The Supreme Court's ruling emphasized that he could not be held in jail indefinitely while the prosecution delays setting a trial date.\n\nSenior advocate Abhishek Singhvi praised the verdict as a \"very prompt judgment,\" reflecting the urgency of the situation.

The order was reserved on Tuesday.\n\nThis is the third time Sisodia has approached the top court for bail. Last year, on October 30, the top court refused to grant him bail but kept a window open by allowing him to revive his bail plea if the trial fails to conclude in the next six to eight months or proceeds at a snail's pace.\n\nRead Here | Documents show Manish Sisodia's neck-deep involvement in Delhi excise \"scam\": ED to SC\n\nAs the trial failed to begin in six months, Sisodia sought bail on the grounds of delay, but the Delhi high court rejected his plea on May 21. He approached the top court in June when ED told a vacation bench that it would be filing its complaint (or charge sheet) by July 3. Recording this submission, the court refused to go into the merits of the petition. Last month, Sisodia filed his third plea for bail, taking a second shot against the high court order of May 21.\n\nAfter hearing elaborate arguments by senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for Sisodia, and additional solicitor general (ASG) SV Raju for the investigating agencies, the bench raised serious doubts over the possibility of the trial ending soon.\n\nCBI had listed 493 witnesses and 57 accused, while the ED case had 224 witnesses and 40 accused. Raju submitted that the trial was at a crucial stage and nearly eight to 10 witnesses, who are working under the Delhi government, could be influenced as they have turned approvers, and recorded statements against the accused, following which they have allegedly been threatened by some of the accused.\n\nSinghvi told the court that in matters of personal liberty, courts have weighed in favour of individual freedom, and by delaying the trial, the petitioner's right to speedy trial guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution stood violated. While the investigation agencies claimed that the delay was due to frivolous applications filed by Sisodia and other accused, the court had its doubts over such a claim as the October 30 decision only intended delay in trial without attributing it either by the accused or the prosecution.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisodia_Dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sisodia Dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Senior counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trial court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Singhvi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Singhvi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excise", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Excise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedy_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speedy trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solicitor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/08/09/1600x900/Manish-Sisodia-was-arrested-by-the-CBI-in-February_1723171150632_1723171160416.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801755", "eventUri": "eng-9801755", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-30", "textStart": 514, "textEnd": 524, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "-05-21", "textStart": 959, "textEnd": 965, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-03", "textStart": 1092, "textEnd": 1098}], "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

The case involves thousands of pages of documents and over a lakh pages of digitized documents. It is thus clear that there is not even the remotest possibility of the trial being concluded in the near future. In our view, keeping the appellant behind bars for an unlimited period of time in the hope of speedy completion of trial would deprive his fundamental right to liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution,\" the top court said.\n\nAlso Read | Supreme Court Says 'Not Even Remote Possibility of Trial Ending Soon, Manish Sisodia Can't Be Kept in Jail Indefinitely' While Granting Bail to AAP Leader.\n\nThe prolonged incarceration before being pronounced guilty of an offence should not be permitted to become punishment without trial, the top court reckoned, as it acknowledged that Sisodia has remained behind bars for many months.\n\nThe top court also underscored that Sisodia had been deprived of his right to speedy trial.\n\nA bench of justices, BR Gavai and KV Viswanathan, also imposed various conditions on Sisodia, including furnishing bail bonds for a sum of Rs 10 lakh with two sureties of the like amount. The top court also directed Sisodia to surrender his passport with the Special Court and to report to the Investigating Officer every Monday and Thursday between 10-11 am. The top court also directed that Sisodia shall not make any attempt either to influence the witnesses or to tamper with the evidence.\n\nWhile granting bail the court took note of the various facts which includes Sisodia deep roots in the society and no possibility of him fleeing away from the country.\n\n\"In the present case, the appellant (Sisodia) is having deep roots in society. There is no possibility of him fleeing the country and not being available to face the trial. In any case, conditions can be imposed to address the concern of the State,\" the top court said.\n\nThe top court further observed that, over a period of time, the trial courts and the High Courts have forgotten a very well-settled principle of law that bail is not to be withheld as a punishment.\n\n\"From our experience, we can say that it appears that the trial courts and the High Courts attempt to play safe in matters of grant of bail. The principle that bail is a rule and refusal is an exception is, at times, followed in breach. On account of non-grant of bail even in straight forward open and shut cases, this Court is flooded with huge number of bail petitions thereby adding to the huge pendency. It is high time that the trial courts and the High Courts should recognize the principle that \"bail is rule and jail is exception,\" the top court said.\n\nThe top court said that on account of a long period of incarceration running for around 17 months and the trial not having commenced, the appellant, Sisodia, has been deprived of his right to a speedy trial.\n\n\"As observed by this Court, the right to speedy trial and the right to liberty are sacrosanct rights. on denial of these rights, the trial court as well as the High Court ought to have given due weightage to this factor,\" the top court said.\n\n\"If the investigation itself was to conclude on or before July 3, 2024, the question is how could the trial have commenced prior to that? If the investigation itself was to conclude after a period of 8 months from the date of the first order of this Court, there was no question of the trial being concluded within a period of 6-8 months from the date of the first order of this Court. We find that both the High Court and the trial court have failed to take this into consideration,\" the top court said.\n\n\"In that view of the matter, we find that the finding of the learned trial judge that it is the appellant who is responsible for delaying the trial is not supported by the record,\" the top court said.\n\n\"The learned Single Judge of the High Court endorses the finding of the trial court on the ground that the accused persons have taken three months' time from October 19, 2023, to January 19, 2024, for inspection of \"un-relied upon documents\" despite repeated directions from the learned trial court to conclude the same expeditiously. It is to be noted that there are around 69,000 pages of documents involved in both the CBI and the ED matters,\" the top court said.\n\n\"Taking into consideration the huge magnitude of the documents involved, it cannot be stated that the accused is not entitled to take a reasonable time for inspection of the said documents. In order to avail the right to fair trial, the accused cannot be denied the right to have inspection of the documents including the un-relied upon documents,\" the top court said.\n\nSisodia has filed a plea seeking a revival of his plea challenging the Delhi High Court's order on May 21.\n\nIn February 2023, Sisodia was arrested by the CBI for alleged irregularities in the framing and implementation of now-scrapped Delhi's new excise policy.\n\nThe policy was withdrawn amid allegations of foul play by the opposition. Sisodia is currently in judicial custody.\n\nAccording to the CBI, Sisodia had played the most vital role in the criminal conspiracy and had been deeply involved in the formulation and implementation of the said policy to ensure the achievement of the objectives of the said conspiracy.

What Supreme Court Said", "body": "The Supreme Court, on Friday, granted bail to Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and former Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia in the corruption and money laundering cases related to the alleged Delhi excise policy scam. The bench, comprising Justices BR Gavai and KV Viswanathan, noted that Sisodia has been in custody for 17 months and trial has not yet commenced, depriving him of the right to speedy trial.\n\n\"It would be a travesty of justice to relegate him to the trial court for seeking bail in these cases,\" the bench said emphasizing that the principle of bail as a rule should be recognised by trial courts and high courts.\n\n\"Appeal allowed. Delhi High Court order is quashed and set aside. He is granted bail in both ED and CBI cases,\" the court ordered.\n\nThe court noted that Sisodia had been deprived of the right to speedy trial. \"Right to speedy trial is a sacrosanct right. Recently in Javed Gulam Nabi Shaikh case, we dealt with this angle and we noted that when court, state or agency cannot protect the right to speedy trial, then bail cannot be opposed saying that crime is serious. Article 21 applies irrespective of the nature of the crime,\" the Bench held, as per a Bar and Bench report.\n\nApex court noted that there is no remote possibility of completion of trial within time and keeping the AAP leader behind bars for the purpose of completion of trial will be a violation of Article 21. \"Sisodia has deep roots in society and he cannot flee. Regarding tampering evidence, case largely depends on documentation and thus it is all seized and there no chance of tampering,\" the Court said granting him bail.\n\nNoting that High Courts and trial courts appear to be \"playing it safe\" while routinely denying bail in criminal cases, the court said, \"It is high time that the trial courts and high courts recognise that the principle of bail is a rule and jail is an exception.\"\n\nThe top court also turned down the ED's argument that the delay in trial was due to various applications filed by Sisodia himself before the trial court.\n\n\"Perusal of compliance report by Assistant Director of ED shows that it will show 70 to 80 days to prepare one copy of the clone of the unrelied data. Though various applications were filed by several accused, but he filed only 13 applications in CBI case and 14 applications in ED case. All applications allowed by trial court,\" the bench said.\n\nED's request to bar the AAP leader from the Delhi Secretariat, like Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was barred from entering CM office, was also turned down by the top court.", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedy_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speedy trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manish_Sisodia", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manish Sisodia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trial court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bar (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Kejriwal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arvind Kejriwal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/08/09/92430dc557b4977db565a9837a735e2717231873865891061_original.jpg?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801755", "eventUri": "eng-9801755", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The case involves thousands of pages of documents and over a lakh pages of digitized documents. It is thus clear that there is not even the remotest possibility of the trial being concluded in the near future. In our view, keeping the appellant behind bars for an unlimited period of time in the hope of speedy completion of trial would deprive his fundamental right to liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution,\" the top court said.\n\nThe prolonged incarceration before being pronounced guilty of an offence should not be permitted to become punishment without trial, the top court reckoned, as it acknowledged that Sisodia has remained behind bars for many months.\n\nThe top court also underscored that Sisodia had been deprived of his right to speedy trial.\n\nA bench of justices, BR Gavai and KV Viswanathan, also imposed various conditions on Sisodia, including furnishing bail bonds for a sum of Rs 10 lakh with two sureties of the like amount. The top court also directed Sisodia to surrender his passport with the Special Court and to report to the Investigating Officer every Monday and Thursday between 10-11 am. The top court also directed that Sisodia shall not make any attempt either to influence the witnesses or to tamper with the evidence.\n\nWhile granting bail the court took note of the various facts which includes Sisodia deep roots in the society and no possibility of him fleeing away from the country.\n\n\"In the present case, the appellant (Sisodia) is having deep roots in society. There is no possibility of him fleeing the country and not being available to face the trial. In any case, conditions can be imposed to address the concern of the State,\" the top court said.\n\nThe top court further observed that, over a period of time, the trial courts and the High Courts have forgotten a very well-settled principle of law that bail is not to be withheld as a punishment.\n\n\"From our experience, we can say that it appears that the trial courts and the High Courts attempt to play safe in matters of grant of bail. The principle that bail is a rule and refusal is an exception is, at times, followed in breach. On account of non-grant of bail even in straight forward open and shut cases, this Court is flooded with huge number of bail petitions thereby adding to the huge pendency. It is high time that the trial courts and the High Courts should recognize the principle that \"bail is rule and jail is exception,\" the top court said.\n\nThe top court said that on account of a long period of incarceration running for around 17 months and the trial not having commenced, the appellant, Sisodia, has been deprived of his right to a speedy trial.\n\n\"As observed by this Court, the right to speedy trial and the right to liberty are sacrosanct rights. on denial of these rights, the trial court as well as the High Court ought to have given due weightage to this factor,\" the top court said.\n\n\"If the investigation itself was to conclude on or before July 3, 2024, the question is how could the trial have commenced prior to that? If the investigation itself was to conclude after a period of 8 months from the date of the first order of this Court, there was no question of the trial being concluded within a period of 6-8 months from the date of the first order of this Court. We find that both the High Court and the trial court have failed to take this into consideration,\" the top court said.\n\n\"In that view of the matter, we find that the finding of the learned trial judge that it is the appellant who is responsible for delaying the trial is not supported by the record,\" the top court said.\n\n\"The learned Single Judge of the High Court endorses the finding of the trial court on the ground that the accused persons have taken three months' time from October 19, 2023, to January 19, 2024, for inspection of \"un-relied upon documents\" despite repeated directions from the learned trial court to conclude the same expeditiously. It is to be noted that there are around 69,000 pages of documents involved in both the CBI and the ED matters,\" the top court said.\n\n\"Taking into consideration the huge magnitude of the documents involved, it cannot be stated that the accused is not entitled to take a reasonable time for inspection of the said documents. In order to avail the right to fair trial, the accused cannot be denied the right to have inspection of the documents including the un-relied upon documents,\" the top court said.\n\nSisodia has filed a plea seeking a revival of his plea challenging the Delhi High Court's order on May 21.\n\nIn February 2023, Sisodia was arrested by the CBI for alleged irregularities in the framing and implementation of now-scrapped Delhi's new excise policy.\n\nThe policy was withdrawn amid allegations of foul play by the opposition. Sisodia is currently in judicial custody.\n\nAccording to the CBI, Sisodia had played the most vital role in the criminal conspiracy and had been deeply involved in the formulation and implementation of the said policy to ensure the achievement of the objectives of the said conspiracy.

We have observed that when Sisodia approached this court a period of 7 months had lapsed from the first order of this court.\"\n\n\"However, we took note of the fact that a charge sheet shall be filed and trial would commence. Liberty was given to revive the plea after filing of chargesheet. Now relegating Sisodia to trial court and then HC will be like playing a game of snake and ladder,\" Justice Gavai said.\n\n\"It will be a travesty of justice to note that he has to be relegated to trial court again. Procedures cannot be made a mistress of justice. In our view the liberty reserved will have to be construed as liberty to revive the petition after filing of chargesheet. Thus, we do not entertain the preliminary objection and this is rejected,\" Justice Gavai said.\n\nSisodia was arrested under the Prevention of Corruption Act on February 26 last year, the ED arrested him under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) on March 9 of the same year.\n\n\"There are 493 witnesses in the trial.

Bail cannot be used as punishment\n\nThe bench, comprising justice BR Gavai and justice KV Viswanathan, emphasized that bail cannot be denied as a form of punishment.The court highlighted that Sisodia has been in custody for 17 months without a trial commencing, thus infringing on his right to a speedy trial. The justices noted that both the high court and trial court are playing safe in matters of bail and bail cannot be denied as a matter of punishment..\n\n2. Bail should be the rule, not jail\n\nThe Supreme Court bench stressed that it is time for lower courts to recognize that bail is the general principle and imprisonment is an exception. The court criticised the lower courts for not adhering to this principle and stated that it would be unjust to require Sisodia to return to the trial court for bail.\n\n3. No chance of trial being completed on time\n\nThe bench observed that there is no realistic prospect of the trial concluding in the near future. Keeping Sisodia in custody for an indefinite period due to delays in the trial would constitute a violation of his fundamental rights under Article 21 of the Constitution.\n\n4. Right to access documents\n\nRegarding concerns about evidence tampering, the court noted that the case relies heavily on documentation, which has already been seized, minimising the risk of tampering. Nevertheless, the court affirmed Sisodia's right to access and review the extensive documents involved in the case.\n\n(With agency inputs)\n\nThe TOI City Desk is an indefatigable team of journalists dedicated to bringing you the pulse of cities from across the nation, all day and all night.

The court further imposed conditions for bail, including the submission of bail bonds worth Rs 10 lakh, the surrender of his passport, and regular reporting to the Investigating Officer.\n\nWhile granting bail, the court took into account Sisodia's deep roots in society and the minimal risk of him fleeing the country. The court also criticized the tendency of lower courts to deny bail as a form of punishment, emphasizing that the right to a fair trial and liberty must be upheld.\n\n\"In the present case, the appellant (Sisodia) is deeply rooted in society. There is no likelihood of him fleeing the country and evading trial.

This has led to a flood of bail petitions in this Court, adding to the already massive caseload. It is high time that the principle that 'bail is the rule and jail is the exception' is recognized,\" the court emphasized.\n\nSisodia was arrested by the CBI in February 2023 for alleged irregularities in Delhi's now-scrapped new excise policy.

A bench of Justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan said on account of non-grant of bail even in \"straight forward open and shut cases\", the apex court was flooded with a number of bail petitions which adds to the huge pendency.\n\nThe bench granted bail to senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Manish Sisodia in the corruption and money laundering cases linked to the alleged Delhi excise policy scam, saying he has been deprived of his right to speedy justice as the trial has not yet commenced despite he being incarcerated for 17 months.\n\nReferring to a recent judgement of the apex court, the bench noted it had observed that over a period of time, the trial courts and the high courts have forgotten a very well-settled principle of law that bail is not to be withheld as a punishment.\n\n\"From our experience, we can say that it appears that the trial courts and the high courts attempt to play safe in matters of grant of bail. The principle that bail is a rule and refusal is an exception is, at times, followed in breach,\" the bench said in its 38-page verdict.\n\n\"It is high time that the trial courts and the high courts should recognise the principle that 'bail is rule and jail is exception',\" it said.\n\nThe bench said as observed time and again, prolonged incarceration before being pronounced guilty of an offence should not be permitted to become \"punishment without trial\".\n\nReferring to Sisodia's matter, the bench said a total of 493 witnesses have been named in the cases lodged by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED).\n\nIt noted that these cases involve thousands of pages of paper documents and over a lakh pages of digitised documents.\n\n\"It is thus clear that there is not even the remotest possibility of the trial being concluded in the near future. In our view, keeping the appellant (Sisodia) behind the bars for an unlimited period of time in the hope of speedy completion of trial would deprive his fundamental right to liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution,\" the bench said.\n\nIt directed that Sisodia be released on bail in both the cases on furnishing bail bonds of Rs 10 lakh with two sureties of the like amount.\n\nThe former deputy chief minister of Delhi was arrested by the CBI on February 26, 2023 over purported irregularities in the formulation and implementation of the now-scrapped Delhi excise policy 2021-22.\n\nThe ED arrested him in the money laundering case stemming from the CBI FIR on March 9, 2023.

AAP Rajya Sabha MP Raghav Chadha declared on X, \"the entire country is happy today as Manish Sisodia, hero of Delhi education revolution, got bail.\"\n\nAnother of Mr Sisodia's colleagues, Atishi, expressed joy and also said Arvind Kejriwal - AAP boss and Chief Minister, jailed since March in the same case -\"will also come out\".\n\nAtishi heads Delhi's Education Ministry after Manish Sisodia resigned post his arrest.\n\n\"Manish Sisodia has been granted bail today after being in jail for 17 months.

Party MP Yogendra Chandolia told NDTV the AAP shouldn't get carried away.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\n\"Look... this comes under the jurisdiction of the court, whether they grant bail or not.

The Supreme Court on Friday said that denial of bail cannot be a form of punishment. \"It is high time the courts realise that bail is a rule and jail is an exception,\" Justice BR Gavai said.\n\nThe Supreme Court has, however, asked Sisodia to surrender his passport.

The Court has also raised questions about the ED's investigation process.\"\n\nReacting to the judgment, AAP MP Sanjay Singh said it was a \"victory of truth\". He said the BJP had wasted 17 months of Manish Sisodia's life, time which could have been spent to build schools for Delhi children. \"This is the victory of truth. As I said earlier, there was no truth or evidence in this case. Our leaders were forcibly put in jail. Manish Sisodia was kept in jail for 17 months...

This is a slap on the dictatorship of the central government.\"\n\nAs soon as the bail order was announced, Sanjay Singh distributed sweets to AAP supporters who had gathered at his residence.\n\nAAP MP Raghav Chadha said that Manish Sisodia Manish was punished for giving a better future to the children of the poor. \"The whole country is happy today after Manish Sisodia ji, the hero of Delhi's education revolution, got bail. I express my gratitude to the honourable Supreme Court from the bottom of my heart. Manish ji was kept behind the bars of the jail for 530 days.

The bail was granted in both ED and CBI cases by a bench comprising Justices BR Gavai and KV Viswanathan, who overturned an earlier Delhi High Court order denying Sisodia's release. Sisodia must furnish a bail bond of Rs 2 lakh, surrender his passport, and report to the police station as part of his bail conditions.\n\nSisodia's release is seen as a major development for the AAP, which has suffered back-to-back setbacks following the arrest of three prominent leaders including party convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in the liquor policy case. Party leaders are now hoping for a similar judgement for Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.\n\nSo, How can SC observations on Manish Sisodia's Bail plea help Arvind Kejriwal?\n\nIn its ruling, the Supreme Court underscored the importance of the right to a speedy trial, stating that Sisodia's prolonged imprisonment without trial constituted a violation of his fundamental rights under Article 21 of the Constitution.\n\nALSO READ: 'If You Help Enemy': BNP Warns Of Strained Relations Over India's Support For Sheikh Hasina\n\nThe bench criticised the lower courts for denying bail as a form of punishment and noted that bail should be the general principle, and jail as an exception. The court also noted that the case against Sisodia heavily relies on documentation, which has already been seized, minimising the risk of evidence tampering.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision to grant bail to Sisodia could have significant implications for Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who is also facing charges related to the Delhi Excise Policy case. Kejriwal, who is currently lodged in Tihar Jail, has been battling similar charges of corruption and money laundering. The Supreme Court's observation on the right to a speedy trial and the criticism of the lower courts for not adhering to this principle may bolster Kejriwal's legal defense.\n\nALSO READ: 'Slap On Dictatorship': AAP Welcomes Top Court's Verdict As Manish Sisodia Gets Bail In Excise Policy Case\n\nThe former Delhi deputy chief minister's lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who also represents Arvind Kejriwal expressed optimism about the implications of the court's order, and said, \"This order will significantly benefit Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's case as well.\"\n\nKejriwal was initially arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in March 2024 and later taken into custody by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in June. While the Supreme Court granted him interim bail in the ED case, Kejriwal remains in judicial custody for the CBI case.

The court's decision allows him to challenge the charges under more favourable conditions, following earlier denials of bail by lower courts. #ManishSisodia #SupremeCourt #Bail #DelhiDeputyChiefMinister #ExcisePolicy #CBICase #EDCase #Justice #SpeedyTrial #LegalUpdate #IndianPolitics #CourtOrder #SisodiaBail #JudicialDecision #DelhiNews #BailGranted ~HT.318~GR.121~ED.102~PR.152~", "source": {"uri": "newsr.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "newsR"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisodia_Dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sisodia Dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manish_Sisodia", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manish Sisodia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atishi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atishi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hindustan Times"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Surety_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Surety Bonds", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://cdn.newsserve.net/newsR256.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801755", "eventUri": "eng-9801755", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

This is because Sisodia resigned from his position as deputy chief minister and from the Delhi Cabinet days after his arrest by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on February 26, 2023. Hence, he cannot hold any ministerial position until he is sworn in again.\n\nSisodia, accused in the first FIR filed by the CBI in the 2022 Delhi Excise Policy case, was arrested first by the CBI and two weeks later by the Enforcement Directorate. On Friday, the Supreme Court granted him bail in both cases, noting he had spent months in jail without a trial. The court ruled this deprived him of the right to a speedy trial under Article 21 of the Constitution.\n\nTo recall, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal -- who is also in jail in the same case -- has not yet resigned from his position. With the CM incarcerated no new minister or deputy chief minister can be appointed. According to reports, for Sisodia to be reinstated in the Council of Ministers and designated as Deputy CM, a proposal must be initiated by the Chief Minister and approved by the Lieutenant Governor (L-G).\n\nSo, while there is a vacant ministerial berth, Sisodia cannot assume these responsibilities without a proposal from Kejriwal. AAP leaders have suggested that Sisodia's attention will be primarily on his family, as his wife is battling Multiple Sclerosis. An AAP leader said, \"Of course, he will be involved in party affairs, but without a ministerial berth, he cannot be part of official meetings. His priority right now will be his family.\"\n\nAfter exiting jail, Sisodia is expected to visit his constituency in the near future. An AAP leader explained, \"While funds were released for work in his constituency in his absence over the past few months, there are several things for which his interventions will be needed.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisodia_Dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sisodia Dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_information_report", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First information report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tihar_Jail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tihar Jail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manish_Sisodia", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manish Sisodia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chief_ministers_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of chief ministers of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Kejriwal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arvind Kejriwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Ministers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Council of Ministers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/31419331723195565.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801755", "eventUri": "eng-9801755", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

The AAP denies any wrongdoing and says the cases against its leaders are politically motivated.\n\nMr Kejriwal was arrested on 21 March, days after the dates for the general election in India were announced.

The Delhi High Court's adverse remarks against the AAP leader in this regard have also been junked by the top court.\n\nBail can't be rejected as a punishment, said the Supreme Court, adding it's high time that trial courts & high courts realise that bail is the rule and jail an exception.\n\nSisodia will walk out of the walk out the jail on Friday evening or Saturday morning (as soon as the order is uploaded).", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manish_Sisodia", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manish Sisodia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trial court"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/02/02/657a1abfb2e7d925c7478df00e92df911706872130747934_original.jpg?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801755", "eventUri": "eng-9801755", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

If the investigation itself was to conclude on or before July 3, 2024, the question is how could the trial have commenced prior to that?\".\n\nIt noted this was the third time that Sisodia was seeking bail before the apex court in these two cases.\n\nThe former deputy chief minister of Delhi was arrested by the CBI on February 26, 2023 for irregularities in the formulation and implementation of the now-scrapped Delhi excise policy 2021-22.

The top court had then said that Sisodia can revive his bail petitions after the ED and CBI file their final prosecution complaint and charge sheet respectively.\n\n\"Now, relegating the appellant to again approach the trial court and thereafter the high court and only thereafter this court, in our view, would be making him play a game of 'Snake and Ladder',\" the bench said.\n\nIt said the apex court on June 4 had granted liberty to Sisodia to revive his prayer for bail after filing of the charge sheet.\n\n\"The trial court and the high court have already taken a view and in our view relegating the appellant again to the trial court and the high court would be an empty formality,\" it said.\n\n\"In a matter pertaining to the life and liberty of a citizen which is one of the most sacrosanct rights guaranteed by the Constitution, a citizen cannot be made to run from pillar to post,\" the bench observed.\n\nThe bench said in its June 4 order, the top court had noted the assurance given by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta that probe would be concluded and final complaint or charge sheet would be filed by July 3.\n\n\"It will be a travesty of justice to construe that the carefully couched order preserving the right of the appellant to revive his prayer for grant of special leave against the high court order, to mean that he should be relegated all the way down to the trial court,\" the bench said.\n\n\"The memorable adage, that procedure is a hand maiden and not a mistress of justice rings loudly in our ears,\" it said.\n\nThe bench said the liberty reserved by the apex court in its June 4 order will have to be construed as a liberty given to revive his prayer afresh after filing of final complaint or charge sheet.\n\n\"Undisputedly, the present appeals have been filed after the final complaint/charge-sheet has been filed by the respondents. In that view of the matter, we are not inclined to entertain the preliminary objection and the same is rejected,\" it said.\n\nThe bench also referred to the October 30 last year order of the apex court which had denied bail to Sisodia in both these cases.\n\n\"A perusal of the aforesaid (October 30 order) would reveal that this court was concerned about the prolonged period of incarceration suffered by the appellant. After considering various earlier pronouncements, this court emphasised that the right to speedy trial is a fundamental right within the broad scope of Article 21 of the Constitution,\" it noted.\n\nThe bench said in its October 30 last year order, the top court had recorded the assurance given by the prosecution that they shall conclude the trial by taking appropriate steps within next six to eight months.\n\nIt said the court had granted liberty to Sisodia to move a fresh application for bail in case of change in circumstances or in case the trial was protracted and proceeded at a snail's pace in next three months.\n\nThe bench also dealt with contentions raised by prosecution that since the conditions as provided under section 45 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) were not satisfied, Sisodia was not entitled to bail.\n\nSection 45 of PMLA pertains to offences to be cognisable and non-bailable and stipulates certain conditions for bail.\n\n\"It could thus clearly be seen that this court, in the first round of litigation between the parties, has specifically observed that in case of delay coupled with incarceration for a long period and depending on the nature of the allegations, the right to bail will have to be read into section 45 of PMLA,\" the bench said.\n\nThe former deputy chief minister of Delhi was arrested by the CBI on February 26, 2023 for the purported irregularities in the formulation and implementation of the now-scrapped Delhi excise policy 2021-22.\n\nThe ED arrested him in the money laundering case stemming from the CBI FIR on March 9, 2023. He resigned from the Delhi cabinet on February 28, 2023.

The Aam Aadmi Party leader will walk out of jail after 17 months.\n\nDuring the court hearing, the Supreme Court referred to the recent precedents that held that investigating agencies cannot oppose bail citing the seriousness of the offence if they cannot ensure a speedy trial.\n\nA bench of Justices BR Gavai and KV Viswanathan, which reserved the judgment on August 6, disagreed with the findings of the trial court and the High Court that the delay in trial was attributable to Sisodia.

Courts have forgotten that bail ought not to be withheld as punishment.

Appellant is having deep roots in society. No apprehension of fleeing. Anyway conditions can be imposed\n\n5-A citizen cannot be made to run from pillar to post. June 4 order recorded that it did not go into merits. This court noted assurance of SG that investigation would be completed and chargesheet would be filed before July, 3.\n\n6-It would be travesty of justice to relegate the appellant to trial Court. Liberty reserved by this court on 4 june to revive will have to be interpreted as reviving of prayer before this court. Not inclined to entertain preliminary objection.\n\n7- Keeping the appellant behind bars for unlimited time will deny the fundamental rights. Appellant is having deep roots in society. No apprehension of fleeing. Anyway conditions can be imposed.\n\n8-Insofar as tampering, most evidence is documentary. Already with ED/CBI. In the result, we allow the appeals. Del HC judgment is set aside. Appellant directed to be released.\n\n9-Appellant shall surrender passport. Shall report to IO on every Monday. Shall not attempt to influence witness.\n\n10- This court had granted liberty to appellant to revive his prayer...now relegating him back to trial court would be making him play game of snakes and ladders.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedy_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speedy trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manish_Sisodia", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manish Sisodia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excise", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Excise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Appeal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trial court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chargesheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chargesheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/08/09/600x338/Manish-Sisodia-was-arrested-by-the-CBI-in-February_1723183986106_1723183995917.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801755", "eventUri": "eng-9801755", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-06-04", "textStart": 2046, "textEnd": 2052, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 231, "textEnd": 239}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 908, "textEnd": 916}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

The court's decision has sparked widespread reactions, with leaders from various political camps expressing their opinions.\n\nBharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) working president KT Rama Rao welcomed the verdict, expressing hope that others named in the chargesheet, like K Kavitha and Arvind Kejriwal, would also receive relief. 'In India, there are many leaders who are being imprisoned even after the filing of chargesheet which is wrong. I welcome the Supreme Court's verdict,' said Rao.\n\nEchoing similar sentiments, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor supported the bail decision, lamenting that it should have come sooner. 'In our system, it's the rule - bail, not jail. He is coming out after almost 2 years; it should have been done earlier,' commented Tharoor.\n\nAAP MP Sanjay Singh and Delhi Minister Saurabh Bharadwaj also hailed the Supreme Court's order. Singh remarked that it was a victory of truth and a significant relief for the party.

There is no other corrupt party than AAP whose Chief Minister and various other ministers are in jail...The same excise policy was implemented in Punjab by the same people, then why the Central government has not initiated any action against Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann...\"\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday granted bail to Manish Sisodia in the excise policy irregularities cases. The order has been delivered by a bench of justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan. The court also imposed various conditions including surrendering the passport and not influencing witnesses.\n\nThe top court was hearing Sisodia's appeal challenging the Delhi High Court order that dismissed his bail plea in the cases being probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate.\n\nMeanwhile, Delhi Environment Minister and AAP leader Gopal Rai on Friday said that the verdict from the top court has given a clear message that there is a limit to dictatorship, no matter how strong it becomes.\n\n\"Entire Delhi and the country know Sisodia for its education sector revolution. The Supreme Court's verdict has given a clear message there is a limit to dictatorship, no matter how strong get becomes. The children of Delhi got direction because of Sisodia. They got into medicine and IITs due to Sisodia. When the entire country started feeling that there couldn't be any transformation in the country's education system, he did things that enabled the government schools to produce better results than the private schools,\" AAP's Gopal Rai.\n\nBadal also reacted on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024 and slammed BJP for doing \"politics of polarization\".\n\nOn the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, Badal said, \"They (Central government) do not refrain themselves from the politics of polarization. They don't want minorities to live in peace...We follow the Constitution which empowers us to practice any religion. Why are they interfering in the religious affairs of minorities?\"\n\nThe Waqf (Amendment) Bill, which seeks to \"effectively address\" issues related to the powers of the State Waqf Boards, registration and survey of waqf properties and removal of encroachments, was introduced in Lok Sabha.\n\nThe Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, which amends the Waqf Act, 1995, was introduced by Minority Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju.Opposition parties, including the Congress, DMK, NCP, Trinamool Congress and AIMIM, strongly opposed the introduction of the bill, saying its provisions were against federalism and constitutional provisions. While some members demanded the withdrawal of the bill, many suggested that it should be sent to a standing committee.\n\nRijijiu agreed to the suggestions for further scrutiny of the bill by a parliamentary committee.\"\n\nWe are not running away anywhere. So, if this has to be referred to any committee, I would like to speak on behalf of my govt - a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) be formed, this Bill be referred to it & detailed discussion be held,\" he said.\n\nRijijiu gave a detailed reply to the points raised by opposition parties and said the government was acting on recommendations made by a panel constituted when the Congress-led UPA government was in power.

His wife suffers from Multiple Sclerosis and has been quite unwell for the last few months,\" said an AAP leader.\n\nEarlier, Sisodia was granted the reprieve of meeting his wife at home twice a week in view of her illness.\n\n\"Sisodia ji will also be visiting his constituency soon. While funds were released for work in his constituency in his absence over the past few months, there are several things for which his interventions will be needed, including following up on the work that is expected to be carried out,\" said another leader.\n\nSisodia's place in the cabinet was taken by Atishi after his resignation. She took over three key portfolios - education, finance, and PWD, alongside several others.\n\nWhen he was minister and former minister Satyendar Jain was in jail in an unrelated case, Sisodia had 18 departments under him. At present, Atishi has over 13 departments assigned to her.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mallica_joshi@indianexpress.com", "name": "Mallica Joshi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "jatin_anand@indianexpress.com", "name": "Jatin Anand", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisodia_Dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sisodia Dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_information_report", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First information report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Ministers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Council of Ministers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manish_Sisodia", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manish Sisodia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Kejriwal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arvind Kejriwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chief_ministers_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of chief ministers of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atishi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atishi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyendra_Kumar_Jain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satyendra Kumar Jain"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Moving_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Moving Services", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Universal_Life_Church", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Universal Life Church", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/08/loksabha-70.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801755", "eventUri": "eng-9801755", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

The top court was hearing the Sisodia appeal challenging the Delhi High Court order that dismissed his bail plea in the cases being probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate.\n\nBut how did it all begin? Here's a look at the Delhi liquor scam case:\n\nIn July 2023, Lieutenant governor VK Saxena had recommended a CBI investigation into Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22 after a report by Delhi chief secretary established prima facie violations of various acts and rules in addition to \"deliberate and gross procedural lapses\" to provide \"undue benefits\" to liquor licensees. The excise department was headed by Sisodia.\n\nThe LG reportedly found substantive indications of \"financial quid pro quo\" at the top political level. Sisodia was accused of undue financial favours to the liquor licensees much after the tenders had been awarded and thus caused huge losses to the exchequer\n\nCiting sources in the government, a TOI report said the Excise Department allowed a waiver of Rs 144.36 crore singularly to the liquor cartel on the tendered license fee under the excuse of Covid-19 pandemic. The department also refunded earnest money of Rs 30 crore to the lowest bidder of the licence of Airport Zone, when it failed to obtain NOC from the airport authorities.\n\nAnother allegation was that the excise department in its 8 November 2021 order revised the formula of the calculation of rates of foreign liquor and removed the levy of import pass fee of Rs 50 per case on beer without approval of the L-G and the Cabinet, thus making it cheaper for retailers causing loss of revenue to the state exchequer. The chief secretary, according to the TOI report, also found lapses in the process of awarding licence for two liquor vends in each ward.\n\nSome of the decisions, it was alleged, were taken by Sisodia without due approval and these were attempted to be legalized by getting the stamp of a post-facto Cabinet decision.\n\nThe report by the chief secretary to the LG was said to be in accordance with Rule 57 of the Transaction of Business Rules 1993, which mandates the former to flag any deviation from laid down procedures to latter and the chief minister.\n\nThe probe agencies, including Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), had levelled several kinds of allegations, from violating government rules and procedures to money laundering. They had arrested several persons, including a few allegedly close to Sisodia who were accused of channeling the kickbacks. Businessman Dinesh Arora, alleged to be Sisodia's aide, turned approver in the case.\n\nThe Enforcement Directorate on March 21 had arrested Kejriwal in a money laundering case probe. This came hours after the Delhi High Court refused to grant any interim protection from coercive action to Arvind Kejriwal and said at this stage it was not inclined to grant an interim relief.\n\nCurrently, Kejriwal is in judicial custody till August 20, 2024, as directed by the Delhi High Court.\n\nEarlier, Kejriwal had for nine times skipped summons issued by the ED related to questioning in the Delhi liquor scam. The Aam Aadmi Party had been calling the summons against Kejriwal illegal and politically motivated. The party called central investigative agencies like the ED a political tool of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nThe party has been under ED lens for a long time now due to irregularities in the excise policy drafted by the Delhi government.\n\nHowever, the AAP has denied all allegations of a scam in the excise policy. Calling the investigation politically motivated, it has launched huge protests against the BJP.\n\nThe Enforcement Directorate (ED) had accused the AAP government in Delhi of using a part of the kickbacks from the liquor scam to fund AAP's campaign for Goa assembly election. The ED alleged that AAP's media head Vijay Nair in connivance had received kickbacks on behalf of leaders of AAP amounting to Rs 100 crore from the so-called \"South Group\". These funds were used in the election campaign of the AAP for Goa assembly. Cash payments to the tune of Rs 70 lakh were made to the volunteers who were part of the survey teams, the ED alleged.\n\nThe ED alleged the kickbacks were paid in advance to the AAP leaders through Nair by the South Group as part of an understanding. \"Against the kickbacks paid, the South Group secured uninhibited access, undue favours, attained stakes in established wholesale businesses and multiple retail zones (over and above what was allowed in the policy),\" the ED alleged. To recover the kickbacks paid in advance, the partners of the South Group were given 65% stake in IndoSpirits, the company which controlled the liquor distribution in Delhi, in collusion with the accused Sameer Mahendru, the managing director of the company, the ED alleged.\n\nAccording to the ED, prominent members of the South Group are Magunta Srinivasulu Reddy, a YSR Congress MP from Ongole constituency in Andhra Pradesh; his son Magunta Raghava Reddy; Sarath Reddy, a non-executive director,of Aurobindo Pharma; and K. Kavitha, the daughter of Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao.\n\nThe ED arrested Magunta Raghava Reddy after prolonged questioning. Raghava's name had cropped up in the initial inquiry into the scam several months before his arrest. However, his father had denied his involvement. The Magunta family has been in the liquor business for several decades now. They have been the South India distributors for the UB Group, which is based in Karnataka.\n\nThe CBI arrested a Hyderabad-based chartered accountant, Butchibabu Gorantla, for his alleged role in the formulation and implementation of the Delhi Excise Policy. Butchi Babu was formerly the chartered accountant of K. Kavitha. The CBI has accused Butchi Babu of causing wrongful gain to Hyderabad-based wholesale and retail licensees and their beneficial owners.\n\nIn November 2022, the ED arrested P. Sarath Chandra Reddy of the Hyderabad-based Aurobindo Pharma group and Binoy Babu of wine and spirits company Pernod Ricard under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Reddy is accused of being instrumental in alleged cartelisation of suppliers and playing a key role in routing of alleged kickbacks. Babu is also said to be a party to the alleged cartelisation process.\n\nAccording to the ED, Trident Chemphar Ltd, a group company of Aurobindo Pharma, controlled two zones in Delhi for liquor distribution, besides two zones by Avantika Contractors Pvt Ltd and one zone by Organomix Ecosystems, all controlled by Sarath. \"Sarath Reddy Penaka is a key partner of the South Group. The other partners are Magunta Srinivasulu Reddy, Raghav Magunta, Sarath Reddy and K Kavitha. The group gave Rs 100 crore kickbacks in advance to the AAP leaders through Vijay Nair,\" the ED has alleged in its chargesheet filed in a special PMLA court.\n\n\"He was effectively controlling five retail zones through his group company Trident Chemphar Pvt Ltd and proxy entities namely, Organomix Ecosystems and Sri Avantika Contractors in violation of the excise policy, which barred any person from controlling more than two retail zones,\" the ED claimed.\n\nThe ED alleged that Sarath Reddy was a key partner in the South Group, which had Sameer Mahendru, who owns liquor manufacturing units along with Pernod Ricard (PRI), as a partner. \"PRI had made Indo Spirits its wholesale distributor, wherein Indo Spirits was owned by Sameer Mahendru, Arun Ramachandra Pillai and Prem Rahul Manduri. Sarath Reddy along with others had financial interests in this entity through proxies. It has also been revealed that Sarath Reddy was putting the investment in Indo Spirits,\" the ED claimed. South Group controlled mine retail zones through a web of proxies and benami entities, according to the ED.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisodia_Dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sisodia Dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_secretary_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief secretary (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liquor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickback_(bribery)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kickback (bribery)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manish_Sisodia", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manish Sisodia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excise", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Excise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Kejriwal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arvind Kejriwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchequer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Exchequer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_(electoral_subdivision)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ward (electoral subdivision)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quid_pro_quo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quid pro quo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prima_facie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prima facie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cartel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurobindo_Pharma", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aurobindo Pharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Kavitha", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K.

The Bench of Justices B R Gavai and K V Viswanathan had reserved its judgment on August 6.\n\nTill now: The CBI arrested Sisodia under the Prevention of Corruption Act on February 26 last year while the Enforcement Directorate (ED) arrested him under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) on March 9 the same year.\n\nThe court allowed Sisodia to file a fresh bail application if the trial was drawn out and subsequently dismissed pleas to review the order. On June 4, a vacation Bench of the court refused to entertain Sisodia's bail pleas after the government assured that the chargesheet would be filed within a month. With the AAP leader seeking bail on the ground that the start of the trial had been delayed, the court on Tuesday asked realistically when the trial in the case would conclude. The verdict will be on Sisodia's bail petitions in both the CBI and ED cases.\n\nIn context: With the Capital's civic infrastructure coming under strain after heavy Monsoon showers recently, the AAP government has found it increasingly difficult to govern the city. It has not only floundered in the absence of its top two leaders -- CM Arvind Kejriwal and Sisodia -- it is also struggling amid tension in its ties with Lieutenant Governor V K Saxena and what it alleges is a recalcitrant bureaucracy.\n\nBut then again, as Mallica Joshi explains, the \"AAP government has not tried to find a way to work with the Centre, opting for confrontation instead\". A relief for Sisodia from the court will help stabilise the party after weeks of turbulence. And with the Assembly elections a handful of months away, Sisodia's return will give the party a much-needed lift.\n\nBig Congress rally in Karnataka\n\nThe Congress will hold a rally in Mysuru on Friday to counter the padayatra that the BJP and Janata Dal (Secular) are currently on to protest against alleged irregularities in the Mysore Urban Development Authority (MUDA). The name of Chief Minister Siddaramaiah's wife Parvathi has cropped up, with the BJP accusing the CM of being involved in the alleged scam.\n\nThe Congress's rally comes a day before the Opposition parties' seven-day padayatra from Bengaluru to Mysuru concludes on Saturday, The Congress is also scheduled to release a \"chargesheet\" against the Opposition parties, accusing them of widespread corruption during their rule in the state. Siddaramaiah himself has taken charge of the Friday rally. He was stationed in Mysuru for the past few days and on Wednesday oversaw the rally preparations. On Thursday, he returned to Mysuru after participating in some events in Bengaluru.\n\nIn context: For Siddaramaiah, the heat he is facing outside could potentially weaken his position within the party, where his great rival is Deputy CM D K Shivakumar. However, as Johnson TA wrote earlier this week, the Congress is expected to defend Siddaramaiah politically and legally by projecting the corruption charges against him as alleged attempts by the BJP-led Centre to destabilise a popularly elected government. Siddaramaiah is also not expected to resign. However, there are signs that the Congress is also preparing for the outcome where a possible change of guard is required in case developments do not favour Siddaramaiah.\n\nRecommended reading: As Siddaramaiah faces BJP-JD(S) heat, Shivakumar moves in to lead Cong play\n\nAlso happening today:\n\n1. In the Lok Sabha, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will introduce the Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024; Union Shipping Minister Sarbananda Sonowal will introduce the Carriage of Goods by Sea Bill, 2024, and the Bills of Lading Bill, 2024; and Union Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw will introduce the Railways (Amendment) Bill, 2024.\n\nUnion Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal will move that a Bill to enable representation for Scheduled Tribes (STs) in the Goa Assembly be passed by the Lok Sabha.

The Court highlighted that his 17-month-long imprisonment, combined with the fact that his trial is unlikely to conclude soon, violates his fundamental right to liberty and a speedy trial under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The Court also criticized the Delhi High Court and lower courts for not adhering to the principle that bail should be the norm and jail the exception.\n\nSisodia was released from Tihar Jail on Friday evening, where Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders and supporters gathered to welcome him. According to a senior AAP leader, Sisodia, who previously held key portfolios like finance, education, and PWD, is expected to be re-inducted into the cabinet. However, it remains unclear whether this will happen before or after CM Arvind Kejriwal, who is also in jail, secures bail. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) responded by pointing out that while Sisodia has been granted bail, he has not yet been cleared of the charges against him.", "source": {"uri": "southasiandaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SouthAsianDaily.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://southasiandaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-112.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801755", "eventUri": "eng-9801755", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 8}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 460933429, "relevance": 2}

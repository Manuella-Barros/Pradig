In a media briefing here this evening, Tripura ADC Chief Executive Member (CEM) C K Jamatia said, \"We had advertised for recruitment in 110 vacant posts of Sub Zonal Development Officer and Deputy Principal Officer positions in the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTAADC). We were hundred percent prepared to conduct the competitive examination for recruitment scheduled tomorrow (Sunday) from 12.30 pm \u2013 2.30 pm. We were ready with the examination centre, its in-charge, coordinator, invigilator, observers etc. However, we came to know that the answer keys were leaked. Due to this unavoidable circumstance, the examination has been postponed for the time being.\u201d He also said the ADC administration will announce the new dates for the recruitment examination after deciding the same in the next ten days. Meanwhile, the tribal council has decided to lodge a police complaint and initiate an administrative enquiry to figure out how the answer key for the recruitment examination was leaked. \"We have decided to lodge a complaint at the West Agartala police station. We shall arrange for proper punishment of those involved. We shall also take administrative action in this incident,\" he said. Asked if someone from the ADC administration is involved in the answer key leak, Debbarma denied to comment on the issue and said, \"We have been speaking of good governance where we focus on transparency. The recruitment board supervises the whole process, including setting the question paper, conducting the exams etc. Since we got information that the answer keys were leaked, we have decided to postpone the exams.\u201d He also said this is the first time the answer keys of the recruitment examinations were leaked in the Tripura ADC administration. He also said 26,000 applicants had applied for the posts, which were notified for recruitment for the first time in the last 20 years.

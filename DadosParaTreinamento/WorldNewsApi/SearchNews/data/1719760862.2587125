Nevertheless, that hasn't stopped beauty buffs from searching for the best option on the high street. One such product sold at Superdrug and Amazon has seriously impressed shoppers, who claim it works on reducing fine lines within days. What's more, it will cost you less than \u00a320. It's the Hada Labo Tokyo Wrinkle Corrector Eye and Mouth Cream, and it's garnering rave reviews from customers who say it has given them \"soft, plump skin\". The Japanese brand's anti-ageing cream has been \"specifically formulated to help reduce wrinkles and fine lines.\" Boasting ingredients like retinol, collagen, and not one but four types of hyaluronic acid, this moisturiser from the Japanese brand Hada Labo aims to hydrate, firm, and plump up the skin. A 15ml tube is priced at \u00a318.99 and can be purchased online from retailers such as Superdrug and Amazon. One ecstatic Superdrug customer said: \"Amazing!

But many Americans don\u2019t pay enough attention to planning their after-retirement finances \u2014 an oversight that could have serious repercussions on the quality of life they\u2019re able to sustain in their golden years. Don't miss Commercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years \u2014 but only the super rich could buy in. Here's how even ordinary investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or KrogerCost-of-living in America is still out of control \u2014 use these 3 'real assets' to protect your wealth today, no matter what the US Fed does or saysThese 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 \u2014 and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how Here are three careless mistakes that could keep you from winning at retirement. 1. Overlooking inflation Inflation could put a considerable dent in your nest egg \u2014 and ignoring or overlooking its effects could be a big mistake. If you retire today, the inflation rate you\u2019re expected to face over the next 30 years is 2.51%, according to a forecast by the Federal Reserve. On an annual basis, these increases may not seem like much, but they can add up over time. For example, at 2.51% per year, a grocery bill of $100 today will cost you over $125 a decade from now. Consider setting up a diversified portfolio and speaking to a financial adviser. Assets such as gold, real estate investment trusts and inflation-protected bonds may help your portfolio beat inflation, though they\u2019re not the right investments for everyone. You can also adjust your spending habits, like creating (and sticking to) a budget shopping around to lower your car insurance and reducing food costs through meal planning and coupons. 2. Paying too much tax on retirement income There are two ways you might be paying too much tax on your retirement income \u2014 not accounting for taxes on Social Security benefits and not planning for taxes on account withdrawals. For example, if you\u2019re jointly filing an income tax return with your spouse and your combined income exceeds $44,000 per year, up to 85% of your Social Security benefit can be taxed. You can use an online IRS tool to determine if your benefits are taxable. Read more: Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market \u2014 and are betting on these assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds Withdrawals from tax-advantaged accounts, such as 401(k)s and individual retirement accounts (IRAs), are taxed as ordinary income, so you\u2019ll need to account for this in your planning and budgeting as well. A financial planner can help you design a tax-efficient withdrawal strategy \u2014 but you\u2019ll want to start this process long before retirement since some strategies, such as a Roth conversion, may be more tax-efficient if executed over several years. 3. Not adapting your investment portfolio to life changes It\u2019s also important to plan for changes in your investment strategy before and after retirement. Retirees often fall into two camps: Those whose portfolios are too aggressive, opening them up to potentially large losses, and those whose portfolios are too conservative, creating the risk that their funds won\u2019t last as long as needed. When you retire, you may want to move to a more conservative portfolio to protect your gains and buffer your savings from stock market swings. But you could also balance this out by holding some stocks, so your savings will continue to grow (which also protects against inflation). You\u2019ll want to ensure your portfolio can support your planned income stream throughout your retirement, including required minimum distributions, and that they\u2019re as tax-efficient as possible as well. Financial planning is more than a savings strategy. It\u2019s important throughout your entire life \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t stop in retirement.

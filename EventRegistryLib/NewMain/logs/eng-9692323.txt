Iranians are voting in a snap election to replace the late hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi. (Alireza Sotakabr, ISNA via AP)DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) - Iran will hold a runoff presidential election to replace the late hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi, an official said Saturday, after an initial vote saw the top candidates not secure an outright win. The election this coming Friday will pit reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian against the hard-line former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili. Mohsen Eslami, an election spokesman, announced the result in a news conference carried by Iranian state television. He said of 24.5 million votes cast, Pezeshkian got 10.4 million while Jalili received 9.4 million. Parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf got 3.3 million. Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 206,000 votes. Raisi, a 63-year-old prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, died in a helicopter crash in May. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below. DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) - Seesawing results released early Saturday in Iran's presidential election put the race between little-known reformist Masoud Pezeshkian and hard-liner Saeed Jalili, with the lead trading between the two men as a runoff vote appeared likely. Iranian state television reported the results which did not initially put either man in a position to win Friday's election outright, potentially setting the stage for a second round of voting to replace the late hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi who died in a helicopter crash last month. So far, no turnout figures have been offered - a crucial component of whether Iran's electorate backs its Shiite theocracy after years of economic turmoil and mass protests. Voters faced a choice between the three hard-line candidates and Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon. After counting over 19 million votes, Pezeshkian had 8.3 million while Jalili held 7.18 million. Another candidate, hard-line parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, had some 2.67 million votes while Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 158,000 votes. Iranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50% of all votes cast. If not, the race's top two candidates will advance to a runoff a week later. There's been only one runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. As has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors. There had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, has also refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said. There's also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. In a documentary on the reformist candidate aired by state TV, one woman said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\"\u009d of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution. Raisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and a potential successor. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab. The voting came as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. In April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region - such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels - are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks. Meanwhile, the Islamic Republic continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build - should it choose to do so - several nuclear weapons. Despite the recent unrest, there was only one reported attack around the election. Gunmen opened fire on a van transporting ballot boxes in the restive southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, killing two police officers and wounding others, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. The province regularly sees violence between security forces and the militant group Jaish al-Adl, as well as drug traffickers. ___ Vahdat reported from Tehran, Iran.", "source": {"uri":

He said of 24.5 million votes cast, Pezeshkian got 10.4 million while Jalili received 9.4 million. Parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf got 3.3 million.

If not, the race's top two candidates will advance to a runoff a week later. There's been only one runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nEslami acknowledged the country's Guardian Council would need to offer formal approval, but the result did not draw any immediate challenge from contenders in the race.\n\nOut of Iran's 13 previous presidential elections since the Islamic revolution in 1979, only one has led to runoffs in 2005.\n\nThe Interior Ministry reported that more than 19,000,000 ballots had been counted so far.\n\nComing third in the early results is the conservative parliament speaker, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, with about 2,600,000 votes.\n\nThe fourth, Mostafa Pourmohammadi, a conservative cleric, had 158,314 votes.\n\nAround 61 million Iranians were eligible to cast ballots in the elections that were originally scheduled for 2025 but were brought forward by the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nThe Guardian Council, which vets electoral candidates in the country, had originally approved six contenders.\n\nBut a day ahead of the election, two candidates -- the ultraconservative mayor of Tehran Alireza Zakani and Raisi's vice president Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi -- dropped out of the race.\n\nIn the 2021 elections that brought Raisi to power, the Council disqualified many reformists and moderates, prompting many voters to shun the polls.\n\nThe turnout then was just under 49%-- the lowest in any presidential election in Iran.\n\nFriday's vote took place amid heightened regional tensions over the Gaza war, a dispute with the West over Iran's nuclear program and domestic discontent over the state of Iran's sanctions-hit economy.\n\nIran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has called on people to participate in the vote.\n\nOpposition groups, especially in the diaspora, meanwhile called for a boycott, questioning the credibility of elections.\n\nPezeshkian, 69, is a heart surgeon who has represented the northern city of Tabriz in parliament since 2008.\n\nHe served as health minister under Iran's last reformist president Mohammad Khatami, who held office from 1997 to 2005 and has endorsed Pezeshkian's bid in the current elections.\n\nPezeshkian criticized Raisi's government for a lack of transparency during nationwide protests triggered by the September 2022 death in police custody of Mahsa Amini.\n\nAmini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, had been arrested for allegedly violating the country's strict dress code for women.\n\nIn recent campaigning, Pezeshkian called for \"constructive relations\" with Washington and European capitals in order to \"get Iran out of its isolation\".\n\nUltraconservative Jalili, Iran's former nuclear negotiator, has maintained his uncompromising anti-West stance.\n\nThe 58-year-old has held several senior positions in the country, including in Khamenei's office in the early 2000s.\n\nHe is currently one of Khamenei's representatives in the Supreme National Security Council, Iran's highest security body.\n\nOn Saturday, Iranian reformist daily Sazandegi posted \"Long live hope\" on its front page, while the state-run daily Iran hailed the \"strong\" turnout.\n\nRegardless of the result, Iran's next president will be in charge of applying state policy outlined by the supreme leader, who wields ultimate authority in the country.\n\nEarlier, the local Tasnim news agency said militants in southeast Iran attacked a vehicle carrying ballot boxes in Sistan-Baluchistan province.\n\nTwo policemen were killed and others were injured in the attack, the agency added.", "source": {"uri": "dailysabah.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Sabah"}, "authors": [],

He said of 24.5 million votes cast, Pezeshkian got 10.4 million while Jalili received 9.4 million. Parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf got 3.3 million. Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 206,000 votes.\n\nRaisi, a 63-year-old prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, died in a helicopter crash in May.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) - Seesawing results released early Saturday in Iran's presidential election put the race between little-known reformist Masoud Pezeshkian and hard-liner Saeed Jalili, with the lead trading between the two men as a runoff vote appeared likely.\n\nIranian state television reported the results which did not initially put either man in a position to win Friday's election outright, potentially setting the stage for a second round of voting to replace the late hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi who died in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nSo far, no turnout figures have been offered - a crucial component of whether Iran's electorate backs its Shiite theocracy after years of economic turmoil and mass protests.\n\nVoters faced a choice between the three hard-line candidates and Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon.\n\nAfter counting over 19 million votes, Pezeshkian had 8.3 million while Jalili held 7.18 million. Another candidate, hard-line parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, had some 2.67 million votes while Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 158,000 votes.\n\nIranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50% of all votes cast. If not, the race's top two candidates will advance to a runoff a week later. There's been only one runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nAs has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors.\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, has also refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere's also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. In a documentary on the reformist candidate aired by state TV, one woman said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\"\u009d of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nRaisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and a potential successor. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\nThe voting came as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region - such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels - are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Republic continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build - should it choose to do so - several nuclear weapons.\n\nDespite the recent unrest, there was only one reported attack around the election. Gunmen opened fire on a van transporting ballot boxes in the restive southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, killing two police officers and wounding others, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. The province regularly sees violence between security forces and the militant group Jaish al-Adl, as well as drug traffickers.", "source": {"uri": "lethbridgeherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

(Atta Kenare / AFP)\n\nTEHRAN (AFP) - Iran's sole reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian and ultraconservative Saeed Jalili have qualified for a runoff presidential election after leading in the first round, an official said on Saturday.\n\nPezeshkian received over 10,400,000 votes and Jalili, a former nuclear negotiator, has more than 9,400,000, said Mohsen Eslami, spokesman of Iran's election authority.\n\n\"None of the candidates could garner the absolute majority of the votes; therefore, the first and second contenders who got the most votes will be referred\" for the second round, scheduled for next Friday, Eslami told a press conference.\n\nOut of around 61 million eligible voters, some 24,500,000 voters headed to the polls, he added, with a turnout of around 40 percent -- the lowest yet in the history of the Islamic Republic.\n\nOut of Iran's 13 previous presidential elections since the Islamic revolution in 1979, only one, in 2005, has led to a runoff.\n\nConservative parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf received about 3,383,340 votes and Mostafa Pourmohammadi, a conservative cleric, had 206,397 votes. The election authority counted a total of 1,056,159 spoiled ballots.\n\nThe elections were originally scheduled for 2025 but were brought forward by the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nThe Guardian Council, which vets electoral candidates in the Islamic Republic, had originally approved six contenders.\n\nBut a day ahead of the election, two candidates -- the ultraconservative mayor of Tehran, Alireza Zakani, and Raisi's vice president, Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi -- dropped out of the race.\n\nIn the 2021 elections that brought Raisi to power, the Council disqualified many reformists and moderates, prompting voters to shun the polls en masse.\n\nThe turnout then was just under 49%, which at the time was the lowest of any presidential election since the Islamic Republic was founded in 1979.\n\nDifferent camps\n\nFriday's vote took place amid heightened regional tensions over the Gaza war, a dispute with the West over Iran's nuclear program and domestic discontent over the state of the country's sanctions-hit economy.\n\nIran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had called on people to participate in the vote. But opposition groups, especially in the Iranian diaspora, called for a boycott of the vote, questioning the elections' credibility.\n\nPezeshkian, 69, is a heart surgeon who has represented the northern city of Tabriz in parliament since 2008.\n\nHe served as health minister under reformist president Mohammad Khatami, who held office from 1997 to 2005 and has endorsed Pezeshkian's bid in the current elections.\n\nPezeshkian criticized Raisi's government for a lack of transparency during nationwide protests triggered by the September 2022 death in police custody of Mahsa Amini.\n\nAmini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, had been arrested for allegedly violating the Islamic Republic's strict dress code for women.\n\nIn recent campaigning, Pezeshkian called for \"constructive relations\" with Washington and European countries in order to \"get Iran out of its isolation.\"\n\nHowever, Pezeshkian has been less welcoming of ties with Israel.\n\n\"God willing, we will try to have friendly relations with all countries except Israel,\" the reformist candidate told reporters in Tehran after casting his ballot at a local hospital.\n\nUltraconservative Jalili, Iran's former nuclear negotiator, has maintained his uncompromising anti-West stance.\n\nThe 58-year-old has held several senior positions in the Islamic Republic, including in Khamenei's office in the early 2000s. He is currently one of Khamenei's representatives in the Supreme National Security Council, Iran's highest security body.\n\nOn Saturday, Iranian reformist daily Sazandegi posted \"Long live hope\" on its front page, while the state-run daily Iran hailed the \"strong\" turnout.\n\nRegardless of the result, Iran's next president will be in charge of applying state policy outlined by the supreme leader, who wields ultimate authority in the country.\n\nEarlier, the local Tasnim news agency said militants in southeast Iran attacked a vehicle carrying ballot boxes in Sistan-Baluchistan province.\n\nTwo policemen were killed and others were injured in the attack, the agency added.", "source": {"uri": "timesofisrael.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "timesofisrael.com"}, "authors":

presidency runoff", "body": "Next week's Iranian presidential election runoff pits ultraconservative Saeed Jalili (left) against reformist Masoud Pezeshkian (right) - ATTA KENARE\n\nThe sole reformist in Iran's presidential election, Masoud Pezeshkian, will face the ultraconservative Saeed Jalili in a runoff, authorities said on Saturday, following a vote marred by historically low turnout.\n\nPezeshkian, 69, secured 42.4 percent of the vote, while Jalili, a 58-year-old former nuclear negotiator, came second with 38.6 percent, according to voting figures announced by Mohsen Eslami, spokesman for Iran's elections authority.\n\nConservative parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf was next with 13.8 percent of the vote, while the only other candidate, conservative cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi, received less than one percent.\n\n\"None of the candidates could garner the absolute majority of the votes,\" Eslami said, adding that those who finished first and second would face each other in a runoff next Friday.\n\nOnly slightly more than 40 percent of the 61 million electorate took part in Friday's first round -- a record low turnout for the Islamic republic.\n\nThe electoral authority said more than one million ballots were spoiled.\n\nOut of Iran's 13 previous presidential elections since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, only one has led to a runoff, which occurred in 2005.\n\nThe poll had been scheduled to take place in 2025 but was brought forward by the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nThe Guardian Council, which vets candidates, had originally approved six contenders.\n\nBut a day ahead of the election, two of them -- the ultraconservative mayor of Tehran Alireza Zakani and Raisi's vice president Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi -- dropped out.\n\nBoth candidates, after the release of the final results, asked their supporters to vote for Jalili in the July 5 runoff.\n\nGhalibaf followed suit later, asking \"all revolutionary forces and supporters\" to get behind Jalili's bid for the presidency.\n\nIn the 2021 election that brought Raisi to power, the Guardian Council disqualified many reformists and moderates, prompting many voters to shun the election.\n\nThe turnout then was just under 49 percent, which at the time was the lowest in any presidential election in Iran.\n\n- Different camps -\n\nFriday's vote took place amid heightened regional tensions over the Gaza war, a dispute with the West over Iran's nuclear programme and domestic discontent over the state of Iran's sanctions-hit economy.\n\nIran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had called on people to participate in the vote.\n\nOpposition groups, especially in the diaspora, meanwhile called for a boycott, questioning the credibility of elections.\n\nPezeshkian is a heart surgeon who has represented the northern city of Tabriz in parliament since 2008.\n\nHe served as health minister under Iran's last reformist president Mohammad Khatami, who held office from 1997 to 2005 and has endorsed Pezeshkian's bid in the current elections.\n\nPezeshkian criticised Raisi's government for a lack of transparency during nationwide protests triggered by the September 2022 death in police custody of Mahsa Amini.\n\nAmini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, had been arrested for allegedly violating the Islamic republic's strict dress code for women.\n\nIn recent campaigning, Pezeshkian called for \"constructive relations\" with Washington and European countries in order to \"get Iran out of its isolation\".\n\nJalili, Iran's former nuclear negotiator, has maintained his uncompromising anti-West stance.\n\nThe 58-year-old has held several senior positions in the Islamic republic, including in Khamenei's office in the early 2000s.\n\nHe is currently one of Khamenei's representatives in the Supreme National Security Council, Iran's highest security body.\n\nOn Saturday, the reformist newspaper Sazandegi ran the headline \"Long live hope\" on its front page, while the state-run Iran daily hailed what it called a \"strong\" turnout.\n\nRegardless of the result, Iran's next president will be in charge of applying state policy outlined by the supreme leader, who wields ultimate authority in the country.\n\nEarlier, the Tasnim news agency said militants in southeast Iran attacked a vehicle carrying ballot boxes in Sistan-Baluchistan province.\n\nTwo policemen were killed and others were injured in the attack, the agency added.", "source": {"uri":

Jalili secured over 9.4 million votes.\n\nAhead of the elections, Iran's main reformist coalition supported Pezeshkian, with former presidents Mohammad Khatami and moderate Hassan Rouhani endorsing his bid.\n\nPezeshkian's presidential campaign comes amid heightened regional tensions over Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, disputes with the West over Iran's nuclear program, and domestic discontent over economic hardship and curbs on political and social freedom.\n\nThe outspoken heart surgeon publicly criticized the Raisi government over the death in custody of Iranian Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini, who was arrested for allegedly violating the Islamic Republic's strict dress code for women. In a social media post, Pezeshkian called for an investigation into Amini's death following her death.\n\nIn recent campaigning, he has criticized the enforcement of mandatory hijab laws, which require women to cover their heads and necks in public since shortly after the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\n\"We oppose any violent and inhumane behavior towards anyone, notably our sisters and daughters, and we will not allow these actions to happen,\" he said.\n\nBorn on September 29, 1954, in Mahabad, in the northwestern province of West Azerbaijan, Pezeshkian has represented Tabriz in Iran's parliament since 2008, served as health minister in Khatami's government, and supervised medical teams during the Iran-Iraq war (1980-1988).\n\nIn 1993, Pezeshkian lost his wife and one of his children in a car accident. He never remarried and raised his remaining three children - two sons and a daughter - alone.\n\nCampaigning for Pezeshkian was Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran's former foreign minister who secured the landmark 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. That deal fell apart three years later.\n\nPezeshkian has called for reviving the accord - which aimed to curb Tehran's nuclear activity in return for sanctions relief - to end Iran's \"isolation.\"\n\n\"If we manage to lift the sanctions, people will have an easier life while the continuation of sanctions means making people's lives miserable,\" he said during one of his televised interviews.\n\nIf elected, Pezeshkian will implement state policy under Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate authority in Iran.\n\nSaeed Jalili\n\nUltraconservative former nuclear negotiator Jalili, who will face Pezeshkian in the presidential runoff, is known for his staunch anti-Western stance.\n\nJalili, 58, aims to unify Iran's fragmented conservative factions in the upcoming runoff.\n\nJalili, who secured over 9.4 million votes, is supported by a substantial base of hardline voters who embrace the slogan \"no compromise, no surrender\" to the West.\n\nBorn on September 6, 1965, in Mashhad, Jalili comes from a devout middle-class family. Known for his soft-spoken yet rigid, religious persona, he has held several senior roles throughout his career.\n\nCurrently, Jalili is one of Khamenei's representatives in the Supreme National Security Council, Iran's top security body.\n\nJalili served in the Iran-Iraq war, where he was injured by shrapnel, leading to the amputation of his right foot. From 2007 to 2013, he led negotiations on Iran's nuclear program, maintaining an uncompromising stance.\n\nCritics accused him of ideological rhetoric during negotiations with Western governments, rather than clearly articulating Iran's position.\n\nHe has vehemently opposed the 2015 nuclear deal, arguing it violated Iran's \"red lines\" by allowing inspections of nuclear sites.\n\nJalili holds a doctorate in political science from Emam Sadegh University in Tehran, an institution established to train the cadres of the Islamic Republic.\n\nIn the early 2000s, he was part of the supreme leader's office, responsible for key strategic reports.\n\nUnder hardline president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Jalili served as deputy foreign minister for Europe and South America.\n\nIn the 2013 presidential race, Jalili finished third, securing only 11 percent of the vote. In 2021, he withdrew his candidacy in favor of Raisi, who went on to win.\n\nPower in Iran ultimately lies with Khamenei, so the result will not herald any major policy shift on Iran's nuclear program or its support for militias across the Middle East. But the president runs the government day-to-day and can influence the tone of Iran's policy.\n\nRead more: Polls close in Iran after election to replace president killed in helicopter crash",

runoff election", "body": "Around 61 million Iranians were eligible to cast ballots in the election necessitated by the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi - RAHEB HOMAVANDI\n\nIran's sole reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian and ultraconservative Saeed Jalili have qualified for a runoff presidential election after leading in the first round, an official said on Saturday.\n\nPezeshkian got more than 10,400,000 votes and Jalili, a former nuclear negotiator, has more than 9,400,000, said Mohsen Eslami, spokesman of Iran's election authority.\n\n\"None of the candidates could garner the absolute majority of the votes, therefore, the first and second contenders who got the most votes will be referred\" for the second round, scheduled for next Friday, Eslami told a press conference.\n\nOut of around 61 million eligible voters, some 24,500,000 voters headed to the polls, he added, with a turnout of around 40 percent -- the lowest yet in the history of the Islamic republic.\n\nOut of Iran's 13 previous presidential elections since the Islamic revolution in 1979, only one has led to runoffs in 2005.\n\nConservative parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf received about 3,383,340 votes and Mostafa Pourmohammadi, a conservative cleric, had 206,397 votes.\n\nThe election authority counted a total of 1,056,159 spoiled ballots.\n\nThe elections were originally scheduled for 2025 but were brought forward by the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nThe Guardian Council, which vets electoral candidates in the Islamic republic, had originally approved six contenders.\n\nBut a day ahead of the election, two candidates -- the ultraconservative mayor of Tehran Alireza Zakani and Raisi's vice president Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi -- dropped out of the race.\n\nIn the 2021 elections that brought Raisi to power, the Council disqualified many reformists and moderates, prompting many voters to shun the polls.\n\nThe turnout then was just under 49 percent, which at the time was the lowest in any presidential election in Iran.\n\n- Different camps -\n\nFriday's vote took place amid heightened regional tensions over the Gaza war, a dispute with the West over Iran's nuclear programme and domestic discontent over the state of Iran's sanctions-hit economy.\n\nIran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had called on people to participate in the vote.\n\nOpposition groups, especially in the diaspora, meanwhile called for a boycott, questioning the credibility of elections.\n\nPezeshkian, 69, is a heart surgeon who has represented the northern city of Tabriz in parliament since 2008.\n\nHe served as health minister under Iran's last reformist president Mohammad Khatami, who held office from 1997 to 2005 and has endorsed Pezeshkian's bid in the current elections.\n\nPezeshkian criticised Raisi's government for a lack of transparency during nationwide protests triggered by the September 2022 death in police custody of Mahsa Amini.\n\nAmini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, had been arrested for allegedly violating the Islamic republic's strict dress code for women.\n\nIn recent campaigning, Pezeshkian called for \"constructive relations\" with Washington and European countries in order to \"get Iran out of its isolation\".\n\nUltraconservative Jalili, Iran's former nuclear negotiator, has maintained his uncompromising anti-West stance.\n\nThe 58-year-old has held several senior positions in the Islamic republic, including in Khamenei's office in the early 2000s.\n\nHe is currently one of Khamenei's representatives in the Supreme National Security Council, Iran's highest security body.\n\nOn Saturday, Iranian reformist daily Sazandegi posted \"Long live hope\" on its front page, while the state-run daily Iran hailed the \"strong\" turnout.\n\nRegardless of the result, Iran's next president will be in charge of applying state policy outlined by the supreme leader, who wields ultimate authority in the country.\n\nEarlier, the local Tasnim news agency said militants in southeast Iran attacked a vehicle carrying ballot boxes in Sistan-Baluchistan province.\n\nTwo policemen were killed and others were injured in the attack, the agency added.", "source": {"uri": "al-monitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

This announcement was made by Mohsen Eslami, spokesperson for Iran's election headquarters.\n\nVoters cast their ballots on Friday to elect a successor to President Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash on May 19. The votes from 58,640 polling stations across the country, and 344 abroad, have been counted, Eslami announced on Saturday. Over 61 million Iranians were eligible to vote in this election as reported by IRNA.\n\nThe results reveal a tight race between Pezeshkian and Jalili. After counting 24,535,185 votes, Pezeshkian led with 10,415,991 votes, while Jalili garnered 9,473,298. None of the four candidates secured more than 50% of the vote, prompting the second round. This election witnessed the lowest voter turnout since the Islamic Republic was established in 1979.\n\nAnother candidate, Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, received 3,383,340 votes, while Mostafa Pourmohammadi had 206,397. Pezeshkian led with 42.5% of the votes, followed by Jalili with 38.6%, according to the state news agency IRNA.\n\nOut of 60 million eligible voters, 24 million cast their ballots, resulting in a 40% turnout, Eslami reported. Amirhossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi and Alireza Zakani had withdrawn their candidacies before the election.\n\nUnder Iranian electoral law, a runoff between the top two candidates is held on the first Friday after the result announcement if neither wins 50%+1 of the votes.\n\nOn May 19, 2024, a helicopter carrying late President Ebrahim Raisi, late Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, and several other officials crashed while flying from Khudafarin to Tabriz, killing the president and his delegation.\n\nWHO IS MASOUD PEZESHKIAN?\n\nM\n\nasoud Pezeshkian, a former health minister under reformist president Mohammad Khatami, is a trained heart surgeon and lawmaker. He gained prominence for his opposition to the crackdown on the 2009 pro-democracy protests and violence by the morality police in 2022. After losing his wife and one of his children in a 1994 car crash, he dedicated much of his time to politics. Pezeshkian ran for president in 2013 and 2021 but was unsuccessful. The 69-year-old hails from an ethnically mixed family, with an Azeri father and a Kurdish mother.\n\nWHO IS SAEED JALILI?\n\nSaeed Jalili is an ultraconservative known for his tough stance against the West. He is a longtime top security adviser to Khamenei and a former IRGC soldier from the Iran-Iraq war. As the lead negotiator for the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers, he was known for his firm approach.\n\nIranian media describe him as a \"firm and meticulous negotiator\" who believes Iran's economic development should not depend on foreign influence. Jalili ran for president in 2013 and again in 2021, withdrawing in favour of Raisi, who eventually won.\n\nThe elections come at a delicate time for Iran, which is embroiled in escalating tensions with Israel and Western allies, triggered by the war in Gaza and the advancement of Iran's nuclear program. The vote also took place just two months after Iran and Israel exchanged fire for the first time as the Gaza conflict widened.\n\nThe Supreme Leader Khamenei of Iran is the final decision-maker in Iran, but the elected president will represent the Islamic Republic on the global stage. The US sanctions against Iran have left the economy quite weak, and high inflation.", "source": {"uri": "greaterkashmir.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Greater Kashmir"}, "authors": [],

Election", "body": "Iran's sole reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian and ultraconservative Saeed Jalili have qualified for a runoff presidential election after leading in the first round, an official said on Saturday.\n\nPezeshkian got more than 10,400,000 votes and Jalili, a former nuclear negotiator, has more than 9,400,000, said Mohsen Eslami, spokesman of Iran's election authority.\n\n\"None of the candidates could garner the absolute majority of the votes, therefore, the first and second contenders who got the most votes will be referred\" for the second round, scheduled for next Friday, Eslami told a press conference.\n\nOut of around 61 million eligible voters, some 24,500,000 voters headed to the polls, he added, with a turnout of around 40 percent -- the lowest yet in the history of the Islamic republic.\n\nOut of Iran's 13 previous presidential elections since the Islamic revolution in 1979, only one has led to runoffs in 2005.\n\nConservative parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf received about 3,383,340 votes and Mostafa Pourmohammadi, a conservative cleric, had 206,397 votes.\n\nThe election authority counted a total of 1,056,159 spoiled ballots.\n\nThe elections were originally scheduled for 2025 but were brought forward by the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nThe Guardian Council, which vets electoral candidates in the Islamic republic, had originally approved six contenders.\n\nBut a day ahead of the election, two candidates -- the ultraconservative mayor of Tehran Alireza Zakani and Raisi's vice president Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi -- dropped out of the race.\n\nIn the 2021 elections that brought Raisi to power, the Council disqualified many reformists and moderates, prompting many voters to shun the polls.\n\nThe turnout then was just under 49 percent, which at the time was the lowest in any presidential election in Iran.\n\nFriday's vote took place amid heightened regional tensions over the Gaza war, a dispute with the West over Iran's nuclear programme and domestic discontent over the state of Iran's sanctions-hit economy.\n\nIran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had called on people to participate in the vote.\n\nOpposition groups, especially in the diaspora, meanwhile called for a boycott, questioning the credibility of elections.\n\nPezeshkian, 69, is a heart surgeon who has represented the northern city of Tabriz in parliament since 2008.\n\nHe served as health minister under Iran's last reformist president Mohammad Khatami, who held office from 1997 to 2005 and has endorsed Pezeshkian's bid in the current elections.\n\nPezeshkian criticised Raisi's government for a lack of transparency during nationwide protests triggered by the September 2022 death in police custody of Mahsa Amini.\n\nAmini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, had been arrested for allegedly violating the Islamic republic's strict dress code for women.\n\nIn recent campaigning, Pezeshkian called for \"constructive relations\" with Washington and European countries in order to \"get Iran out of its isolation\".\n\nUltraconservative Jalili, Iran's former nuclear negotiator, has maintained his uncompromising anti-West stance.\n\nThe 58-year-old has held several senior positions in the Islamic republic, including in Khamenei's office in the early 2000s.\n\nHe is currently one of Khamenei's representatives in the Supreme National Security Council, Iran's highest security body.\n\nOn Saturday, Iranian reformist daily Sazandegi posted \"Long live hope\" on its front page, while the state-run daily Iran hailed the \"strong\" turnout.\n\nRegardless of the result, Iran's next president will be in charge of applying state policy outlined by the supreme leader, who wields ultimate authority in the country.\n\nEarlier, the local Tasnim news agency said militants in southeast Iran attacked a vehicle carrying ballot boxes in Sistan-Baluchistan province.\n\nTwo policemen were killed and others were injured in the attack, the agency added.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

"body": "TEHRAN: Iran's sole reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian and ultraconservative Saeed Jalili have qualified for a runoff presidential election after leading in the first round, an official said on Saturday.\n\nPezeshkian got more than 10,400,000 votes and Jalili, a former nuclear negotiator, has more than 9,400,000, said Mohsen Eslami, spokesman of Iran's election authority.\n\n\"None of the candidates could garner the absolute majority of the votes, therefore, the first and second contenders who got the most votes will be referred\" for the second round, scheduled for next Friday, Eslami told a press conference.\n\nOut of around 61 million eligible voters, some 24,500,000 voters headed to the polls, he added, with a turnout of around 40 percent -- the lowest yet in the history of the Islamic republic.\n\nOut of Iran's 13 previous presidential elections since the Islamic revolution in 1979, only one has led to runoffs in 2005.\n\nConservative parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf received about 3,383,340 votes and Mostafa Pourmohammadi, a conservative cleric, had 206,397 votes.\n\nThe election authority counted a total of 1,056,159 spoiled ballots.\n\nThe elections were originally scheduled for 2025 but were brought forward by the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nThe Guardian Council, which vets electoral candidates in the Islamic republic, had originally approved six contenders.\n\nBut a day ahead of the election, two candidates -- the ultraconservative mayor of Tehran Alireza Zakani and Raisi's vice president Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi -- dropped out of the race.\n\nIn the 2021 elections that brought Raisi to power, the Council disqualified many reformists and moderates, prompting many voters to shun the polls.\n\nThe turnout then was just under 49 percent, which at the time was the lowest in any presidential election in Iran.\n\nDifferent camps\n\nFriday's vote took place amid heightened regional tensions over the Gaza war, a dispute with the West over Iran's nuclear programme and domestic discontent over the state of Iran's sanctions-hit economy.\n\nIran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had called on people to participate in the vote.\n\nOpposition groups, especially in the diaspora, meanwhile called for a boycott, questioning the credibility of elections.\n\nPezeshkian, 69, is a heart surgeon who has represented the northern city of Tabriz in parliament since 2008.\n\nHe served as health minister under Iran's last reformist president Mohammad Khatami, who held office from 1997 to 2005 and has endorsed Pezeshkian's bid in the current elections.\n\nPezeshkian criticised Raisi's government for a lack of transparency during nationwide protests triggered by the September 2022 death in police custody of Mahsa Amini.\n\nIn recent campaigning, Pezeshkian called for \"constructive relations\" with Washington and European countries in order to \"get Iran out of its isolation\".\n\nUltraconservative Jalili, Iran's former nuclear negotiator, has maintained his uncompromising anti-West stance.\n\nThe 58-year-old has held several senior positions in the Islamic republic, including in Khamenei's office in the early 2000s.\n\nHe is currently one of Khamenei's representatives in the Supreme National Security Council, Iran's

There's been only one runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) - Early results in Iran's presidential election put hard-liner Saeed Jalili slightly ahead Saturday, followed closely behind by reformist Masoud Pezeshkian.\n\nThe early results, reported by Iranian state television, did not initially put Jalili in a position to win Friday's election outright, potentially setting the stage for a runoff election to replace the late hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi.\n\nIt also did not offer any turnout figures for the race yet - a crucial component of whether Iran's electorate backs its Shiite theocracy after years of economic turmoil and mass protests.\n\nWith over 10 million votes counted, Jaili had 4.26 million votes, followed by Pezeshkian with 4.24 million. Another candidate, hard-line speaker of the parliament Mohmmad Bagher Qalibaf, had some 1.38 million votes. Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had more than 80,000 votes.\n\nVoters faced a choice between the three hard-line candidates and the little-known reformist Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon. As has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors.\n\nThe voting came as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region - such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels - are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build - should it choose to do so - several nuclear weapons.\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains in house arrest, also has refused to vote with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere's also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. One woman in a documentary on Pezeshkian aired by state TV said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\"\u009d of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nIranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50% of all votes cast. If that doesn't happen, the race's top two candidates will advance to a runoff a week later. There's been only one runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nThe 63-year-old Raisi died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and a potential successor. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\nThis story has been corrected to say 10 million was the overall number of votes initially counted.", "source": {"uri": "lethbridgeherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Lethbridge Herald - News and Sports from around Lethbridge"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The second round is required if no candidate wins 50 percent of the vote, plus one.\n\nOut of Iran's 13 previous presidential elections since the Islamic revolution in 1979, only one has led to runoffs in 2005.\n\nThe Interior Ministry reported that more than 19,000,000 ballots had been counted so far.\n\nComing third in the early results is the conservative parliament speaker, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, with about 2,600,000 votes.\n\nThe fourth, Mostafa Pourmohammadi, a conservative cleric, had 158,314 votes.\n\nAround 61 million Iranians were eligible to cast ballots in the elections that were originally scheduled for 2025 but were brought forward by the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nThe Guardian Council, which vets electoral candidates in the Islamic republic, had originally approved six contenders.\n\nBut a day ahead of the election, two candidates -- the ultraconservative mayor of Tehran Alireza Zakani and Raisi's vice president Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi -- dropped out of the race.\n\nIn the 2021 elections that brought Raisi to power, the Council disqualified many reformists and moderates, prompting many voters to shun the polls.\n\nThe turnout then was just under 49 percent -- the lowest in any presidential election in Iran.\n\nFriday's vote took place amid heightened regional tensions over the Gaza war, a dispute with the West over Iran's nuclear programme and domestic discontent over the state of Iran's sanctions-hit economy.\n\nIran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has called on people to participate in the vote.\n\nOpposition groups, especially in the diaspora, meanwhile called for a boycott, questioning the credibility of elections.\n\n- Different camps -\n\nPezeshkian, 69, is a heart surgeon who has represented the northern city of Tabriz in parliament since 2008.\n\nHe served as health minister under Iran's last reformist president Mohammad Khatami, who held office from 1997 to 2005 and has endorsed Pezeshkian's bid in the current elections.\n\nPezeshkian criticised Raisi's government for a lack of transparency during nationwide protests triggered by the September 2022 death in police custody of Mahsa Amini.\n\nAmini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, had been arrested for allegedly violating the Islamic republic's strict dress code for women.\n\nIn recent campaigning, Pezeshkian called for \"constructive relations\" with Washington and European capitals in order to \"get Iran out of its isolation\".\n\nUltraconservative Jalili, Iran's former nuclear negotiator, has maintained his uncompromising anti-West stance.\n\nThe 58-year-old has held several senior positions in the Islamic republic, including in Khamenei's office in the early 2000s.\n\nHe is currently one of Khamenei's representatives in the Supreme National Security Council, Iran's highest security body.\n\nOn Saturday, Iranian reformist daily Sazandegi posted \"Long live hope\" on its front page, while the state-run daily Iran hailed the \"strong\" turnout.\n\nRegardless of the result, Iran's next president will be in charge of applying state policy outlined by the supreme leader, who wields ultimate authority in the country.\n\nEarlier, the local Tasnim news agency said militants in southeast Iran attacked a vehicle carrying ballot boxes in Sistan-Baluchistan province.\n\nTwo policemen were killed and others were injured in the attack, the agency added.", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "RFI"}, "authors": [],

He said of 24.5 million votes cast, Pezeshkian got 10.4 million while Jalili received 9.4 million.\n\nParliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf got 3.3 million. Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 206,000 votes.\n\nIranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50% of all votes cast. If not, the race's top two candidates advance to a runoff a week later. There's been only one runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nEslami acknowledged the country's Guardian Council would need to offer formal approval, but the result did not draw any immediate challenge from contenders in the race.\n\nAs has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors.\n\nThere were signs of the wider disenchantment of the public with the vote. More than 1 million votes were voided, according to the results, typically a sign of people feeling obligated to cast a ballot but not wanting to select any of the candidates.\n\nThe overall turnout was 39.9%, according to the results. The 2021 presidential election that elected Raisi saw a 48.8% turnout, while the March parliamentary election saw a 40.6% turnout.\n\nDespite the low turnout, Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi praised the public for turning out to a vote conducted without any internationally recognized observers.\n\nHe thanked the people who voted for their \"very valuable presence,\" adding that the election was held in \"complete safety\" and \"with very serious competition.\"\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, has also refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere's also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. In a documentary on the reformist candidate aired by state TV, one woman said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\" of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nJalili, once described by CIA director Bill Burns as \"stupefyingly opaque\" in negotiations, likely would have won outright had the three hard-liners not split Friday's vote.\n\nQalibaf, a former general in Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, had been thought to have a wider power base, despite being plagued by corruption allegations. He is also known for launching a violent crackdown on Iranian university students in 1999 and reportedly ordering live fire to be used against students in 2003 while serving as the country's police chief.\n\nNow the question becomes whether Pezeshkian will be able to draw voters into his campaign. On Election Day, he offered comments on outreach to the West after voting seemingly aimed at drumming up turnout for his campaign -- even after being targeted by a veiled warning from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\n\"Though he has received notable endorsements from major reformist figures, including former Presidents (Hassan) Rouhani and Mohammad Khatami, Pezeshkian has been a generally underwhelming candidate,\" the geopolitical consultancy Eurasia Group said in an analysis before the vote. \"Should he qualify for a runoff, his position would weaken as the conservative voting bloc unites behind a single candidate.\"\n\nRaisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Khamenei and a potential successor. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\nThe voting came as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region -- such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels -- are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Republic continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build -- should it choose to do so -- several nuclear weapons.\n\nDespite the recent unrest, there was only one reported attack around the election. Gunmen opened fire on a van transporting ballot boxes in the restive southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, killing two police officers and wounding others, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. The province regularly sees violence between security forces and the militant group Jaish al-Adl, as well as drug traffickers.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoud_Pezeshkian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Masoud Pezeshkian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saeed_Jalili", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saeed Jalili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reformism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Two-round system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Voter turnout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebrahim_Raisi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ebrahim Raisi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Bagher_Ghalibaf", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mostafa_Pourmohammadi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mostafa Pourmohammadi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardian_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guardian Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akbar_Hashemi_Rafsanjani", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mahmoud Ahmadinejad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Republic_of_Iran_Broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iranian Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shia Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Iranian_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2021 Iranian presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William J.

But a day ahead of the election, two candidates - the ultraconservative mayor of Tehran Alireza Zakani and Raisi's vice president Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi - dropped out of the race.\n\nPezeshkian, 69, is a heart surgeon who served as health minister under Iran's last reformist president Mohammad Khatami. In recent campaigning, Pezeshkian called for \"constructive relations\" with Washington and European countries in order to \"get Iran out of its isolation\".\n\nMeanwhile, Jalili, Iran's former nuclear negotiator, has maintained his uncompromising anti-West stance. The 58-year-old has held several senior positions in the Islamic Republic, including in the office of Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Khamenei in the early 2000s. He is currently one of Khamenei's representatives in the Supreme National Security Council, Iran's highest security body.\n\nFriday's vote took place amid heightened regional tensions over the Gaza

AFP-Yonhap\n\nIran announced Saturday it will hold a runoff presidential election to replace the late hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi after an initial vote saw the top candidates not securing an outright win in the lowest turnout poll ever held in the Islamic Republic.\n\nThe election this coming Friday will pit reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian against the hard-line former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili.\n\nMohsen Eslami, an election spokesman, announced the result in a news conference carried by Iranian state television. He said of 24.5 million votes cast, Pezeshkian got 10.4 million while Jalili received 9.4 million.\n\nParliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf got 3.3 million. Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 206,000 votes.\n\nIranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50 percent of all votes cast. If not, the race's top two candidates advance to a runoff a week later. There's been only one runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nEslami acknowledged the country's Guardian Council would need to offer formal approval, but the result did not draw any immediate challenge from contenders in the race.\n\nAs has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors.\n\nThere were signs of the wider disenchantment of the public with the vote. More than 1 million votes were voided, according to the results, typically a sign of people feeling obligated to cast a ballot but not wanting to select any of the candidates.\n\nThe overall turnout was 39.9 percent, according to the results. The 2021 presidential election that elected Raisi saw a 48.8 percent turnout, while the March parliamentary election saw a 40.6 percent turnout.\n\nDespite the low turnout, Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi praised the public for turning out to a vote conducted without any internationally recognized observers.\n\nHe thanked the people who voted for their \"very valuable presence,\" adding that the election was held in \"complete safety\" and \"with very serious competition.\"\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, has also refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere's also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. In a documentary on the reformist candidate aired by state TV, one woman said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\" of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nIranian hardline presidential candidate Saeed Jalili, center, waves after casting his vote at a polling station during the presidential election in Tehran, Iran, June 28. EPA-Yonhap\n\nJalili, once described by CIA director Bill Burns as \"stupefyingly opaque\" in negotiations, likely would have won outright had the three hard-liners not split Friday's vote.\n\nQalibaf, a former general in Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, had been thought to have a wider power base, despiting being plagued by corruption allegations. He is also known for launching a violent crackdown on Iranian university students in 1999 and reportedly ordering live fire to be used against students in 2003 while serving as the country's police chief.\n\nNow the question becomes whether Pezeshkian will be able to draw voters into his campaign. On Election Day, he offered comments on outreach to the West after voting seemingly aimed at drumming up turnout for his campaign -- even after being targeted by a veiled warning from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .\n\n\"Though he has received notable endorsements from major reformist figures, including former Presidents (Hassan) Rouhani and Mohammad Khatami, Pezeshkian has been a generally underwhelming candidate,\" the geopolitical consultancy Eurasia Group said in an analysis before the vote. \"Should he qualify for a runoff, his position would weaken as the conservative voting bloc unites behind a single candidate.\"\n\nRaisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Khamenei and a potential successor. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\nThe voting came as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region -- such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels -- are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Republic continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build -- should it choose to do so -- several nuclear weapons.\n\nDespite the recent unrest, there was only one reported attack around the election. Gunmen opened fire on a van transporting ballot boxes in the restive southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, killing two police officers and wounding others, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. The province regularly sees violence between security forces and the militant group Jaish al-Adl, as well as drug traffickers.

for Iran runoff election", "body": "Around 61 million Iranians were eligible to cast ballots in the election necessitated by the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi\n\nIran's sole reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian and ultraconservative Saeed Jalili have qualified for a runoff presidential election after leading in the first round, an official said on Saturday.\n\nPezeshkian got more than 10,400,000 votes and Jalili, a former nuclear negotiator, has more than 9,400,000, said Mohsen Eslami, spokesman of Iran's election authority.\n\n\"None of the candidates could garner the absolute majority of the votes, therefore, the first and second contenders who got the most votes will be referred\" for the second round, scheduled for next Friday, Eslami told a press conference.\n\nOut of around 61 million eligible voters, some 24,500,000 voters headed to the polls, he added, with a turnout of around 40 percent -- the lowest yet in the history of the Islamic republic.\n\nOut of Iran's 13 previous presidential elections since the Islamic revolution in 1979, only one has led to runoffs in 2005.\n\nConservative parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf received about 3,383,340 votes and Mostafa Pourmohammadi, a conservative cleric, had 206,397 votes.\n\nThe election authority counted a total of 1,056,159 spoiled ballots.\n\nThe vote took place amid heightened regional tensions over the Gaza war, a dispute with the West over Iran's nuclear programme and domestic discontent over the state of Iran's sanctions-hit economy\n\nThe elections were originally scheduled for 2025 but were brought forward by the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nThe Guardian Council, which vets electoral candidates in the Islamic republic, had originally approved six contenders.\n\nBut a day ahead of the election, two candidates -- the ultraconservative mayor of Tehran Alireza Zakani and Raisi's vice president Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi -- dropped out of the race.\n\nIn the 2021 elections that brought Raisi to power, the Council disqualified many reformists and moderates, prompting many voters to shun the polls.\n\nThe turnout then was just under 49 percent, which at the time was the lowest in any presidential election in Iran.\n\n- Different camps -\n\nFriday's vote took place amid heightened regional tensions over the Gaza war, a dispute with the West over Iran's nuclear programme and domestic discontent over the state of Iran's sanctions-hit economy.\n\nIran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had called on people to participate in the vote.\n\nOut of Iran's 13 previous presidential elections since the Islamic revolution in 1979, only one led to a runoff, in 2005\n\nOpposition groups, especially in the diaspora, meanwhile called for a boycott, questioning the credibility of elections.\n\nPezeshkian, 69, is a heart surgeon who has represented the northern city of Tabriz in parliament since 2008.\n\nHe served as health minister under Iran's last reformist president Mohammad Khatami, who held office from 1997 to 2005 and has endorsed Pezeshkian's bid in the current elections.\n\nPezeshkian criticised Raisi's government for a lack of transparency during nationwide protests triggered by the September 2022 death in police custody of Mahsa Amini.\n\nAmini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, had been arrested for allegedly violating the Islamic republic's strict dress code for women.\n\nIn recent campaigning, Pezeshkian called for \"constructive relations\" with Washington and European countries in order to \"get Iran out of its isolation\".\n\nUltraconservative Jalili, Iran's former nuclear negotiator, has maintained his uncompromising anti-West stance.\n\nThis is the first presidential election since Iran was swept by nationwide protests over the 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini after her arrest for allegedly violating the Islamic republic's dress code\n\nThe 58-year-old has held several senior positions in the Islamic republic, including in Khamenei's office in the early 2000s.\n\nHe is currently one of Khamenei's representatives in the Supreme National Security Council, Iran's highest security body.\n\nOn Saturday, Iranian reformist daily Sazandegi posted \"Long live hope\" on its front page, while the state-run daily Iran hailed the \"strong\" turnout.\n\nRegardless of the result, Iran's next president will be in charge of applying state policy outlined by the supreme leader, who wields ultimate authority in the country.\n\nEarlier, the local Tasnim news agency said militants in southeast Iran attacked a vehicle carrying ballot boxes in Sistan-Baluchistan province.\n\nTwo policemen were killed and others were injured in the attack, the agency added.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

presidency runoff", "body": "The sole reformist in Iran's presidential election, Masoud Pezeshkian, will face the ultraconservative Saeed Jalili in a runoff, authorities said on Saturday, following a vote marred by historically low turnout.\n\nPezeshkian secured 42.4 percent of the vote, while Jalili, a former nuclear negotiator, came second with 38.6 percent, according to figures from Iran's elections authority.\n\nConservative parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf was next with 13.8 percent, while the only other candidate, conservative cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi, got less than one percent.\n\n\"None of the candidates could garner the absolute majority of the votes,\" electoral authority spokesman Mohsen Eslami said.\n\nIn his first post-election remarks, Pezeshkian thanked his supporters and urged them to vote again next Friday \"to save the country from poverty, lies, discrimination and injustice\".\n\n\"I hope your presence will be the basis of a new voice for change in attitude, behaviour, conversation and in the distribution and allocation of resources,\" he added in a video published on the website of the reformist newspaper Etemad.\n\nIran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had called for a high turnout ahead of Friday's vote.\n\nOnly slightly more than 40 percent of the 61 million electorate took part -- a record low turnout for the Islamic republic -- and more than one million ballots were spoiled.\n\nThe poll had been scheduled to take place in 2025 but was brought forward by the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.\n\n- Conservatives consolidate -\n\nThe Guardian Council, which vets candidates, had originally approved six contenders.\n\nBut a day ahead of the election, two of them -- the ultraconservative mayor of Tehran Alireza Zakani and Raisi's vice president Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi -- dropped out.\n\nAfter the final results were released, they both asked their supporters to vote for Jalili in the July 5 runoff.\n\nGhalibaf followed suit, asking \"all revolutionary forces and supporters\" to get behind Jalili's bid for the presidency.\n\nIn the 2021 election that brought Raisi to power, the Guardian Council disqualified many reformists and moderates, prompting many voters to shun the election.\n\nThe turnout then was just under 49 percent, which at the time was the lowest in any presidential election in Iran.\n\nFriday's vote took place amid heightened regional tensions over the Gaza war, a dispute with the West over Iran's nuclear programme and domestic discontent over the state of Iran's sanctions-hit economy.\n\nOpposition groups, especially in the diaspora, meanwhile called for a boycott, questioning the credibility of elections.\n\nPezeshkian, 69, is a heart surgeon who has represented the northwestern city of Tabriz in parliament since 2008.\n\nHe served as health minister under Iran's last reformist president Mohammad Khatami, who held office from 1997 to 2005 and has endorsed Pezeshkian's bid in the current elections.\n\n- 'Resistance' -\n\nPezeshkian criticised Raisi's government for a lack of transparency during nationwide protests triggered by the September 2022 death in police custody of Mahsa Amini.\n\nAmini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, had been arrested for allegedly violating the Islamic republic's strict dress code for women.\n\nIn recent campaigning, Pezeshkian called for \"constructive relations\" with Washington and European countries in order to \"get Iran out of its isolation\".\n\nPeople, however, are not optimistic, with 32-year-old trader Sina saying, \"there will not be much change\" even if Pezeshkian is elected president.\n\n\"If he wins, he will have to work with a parliament whose head is Ghalibaf and the Supreme National Security Council whose head is Jalili,\" he added.\n\nJalili is widely recognised for his uncompromising anti-West stance.\n\nThe 58-year-old has held several senior positions in the Islamic republic, including in Khamenei's office in the early 2000s.\n\nHe is currently one of Khamenei's representatives in the Supreme National Security Council, Iran's highest security body.\n\n\"I would like Mr. Jalili to become the president and lead Iran to progress with religious rationality based on resistance,\" said Shima, 43-year-old filmmaker in Tehran.\n\nOn Saturday, the reformist newspaper Sazandegi ran the headline \"Long live hope\" on its front page, while the state-run Iran daily hailed what it called a \"strong\" turnout.\n\nRegardless of the result, Iran's next president will be in charge of applying state policy outlined by the supreme leader, who wields ultimate authority in the country.\n\nInterior Minister Ahmad Vahidi said Friday's vote went smoothly.\n\n\"The presidential election was conducted in complete security, in perfect health, with very serious competition and with the valuable presence of people at the ballot boxes,\" he said.\n\nThe Tasnim news agency said however that militants attacked a vehicle carrying ballot boxes in the southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchistan, leaving two policemen dead and others wounded.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Amini after her arrest for allegedly violating the Islamic republic's dress code\n\nIran's sole reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian and ultraconservative Saeed Jalili have qualified for a runoff presidential election after leading in the first round, an official said on Saturday.\n\nPezeshkian got more than 10,400,000 votes and Jalili, a former nuclear negotiator, has more than 9,400,000,

added, with a turnout of around 40 percent -- the lowest yet in the history of the Islamic republic.\n\nOut of Iran's 13 previous presidential elections since the Islamic revolution in 1979, only one

"body": "TEHRAN -- The sole reformist in Iran's presidential election, Masoud Pezeshkian, will face the ultraconservative Saeed Jalili in a run-off, authorities said on Saturday, following a vote marred by historically low turnout.\n\nPezeshkian secured 42.4 per cent of the vote, while Jalili, a former nuclear negotiator, came second with 38.6 per cent, according to figures from Iran's elections authority.\n\nConservative parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf was next with 13.8 per cent, while the only other candidate, conservative cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi, got less than 1 per cent.\n\n\"None of the candidates could garner the absolute majority of the votes,\" electoral authority spokesman Mohsen Eslami said.\n\nIn his first post-election remarks, Pezeshkian thanked his supporters and urged them to vote again next Friday \"to save the country from poverty, lies, discrimination and injustice\".\n\n\"I hope your presence will be the basis of a new voice for change in attitude, behaviour, conversation and in the distribution and allocation of resources,\" he added in a video published on the website of the reformist newspaper Etemad.\n\nIran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had called for a high turnout ahead of Friday's vote.\n\nOnly slightly more than 40 per cent of the 61 million electorate took part -- a record low turnout for the Islamic republic -- and more than one million ballots were spoiled.\n\nThe poll had been scheduled to take place in 2025 but was brought forward by the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nThe Guardian Council, which vets candidates, had originally approved six contenders.\n\nBut a day ahead of the election, two of them -- the ultraconservative mayor of Tehran Alireza Zakani and Raisi's vice president Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi -- dropped out.\n\nAfter the final results were released, they both asked their supporters to vote for Jalili in the July 5 runoff.\n\nGhalibaf followed suit, asking \"all revolutionary forces and supporters\" to get behind Jalili's bid for the presidency.\n\nIn the 2021 election that brought Raisi to power, the Guardian Council disqualified many reformists and moderates, prompting many voters to shun the election.\n\nThe turnout then was just under 49 per cent, which at the time was the lowest in any presidential election in Iran.\n\nFriday's vote took place amid heightened regional tensions over the Gaza war, a dispute with the West over Iran's nuclear programme and domestic discontent over the state of Iran's sanctions-hit economy.\n\nOpposition groups, especially in the diaspora, meanwhile called for a boycott, questioning the credibility of elections.\n\nPezeshkian, 69, is a heart surgeon who has represented the northwestern city of Tabriz in parliament since 2008.\n\nHe served as health minister under Iran's last reformist president Mohammad Khatami, who held office from 1997 to 2005 and has endorsed Pezeshkian's bid in the current elections.\n\n'Resistance'\n\nPezeshkian criticised Raisi's government for a lack of transparency during nationwide protests triggered by the September 2022 death in police custody of Mahsa Amini.\n\nAmini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, had been arrested for allegedly violating the Islamic republic's strict dress code for women.\n\nIn recent campaigning, Pezeshkian called for \"constructive relations\" with Washington and European countries in order to \"get Iran out of its isolation\".\n\nPeople, however, are not optimistic, with 32-year-old trader Sina saying, \"there will not be much change\" even if Pezeshkian is elected president.\n\n\"If he wins, he will have to work with a parliament whose head is Ghalibaf and the Supreme National Security Council whose head is Jalili,\" he added.\n\nJalili is widely recognised for his uncompromising anti-West stance.\n\nThe 58-year-old has held several senior positions in the Islamic republic, including in Khamenei's office in the early 2000s.\n\nHe is currently one of Khamenei's representatives in the Supreme National Security Council, Iran's highest security body.\n\n\"I would like Mr. Jalili to become the president and lead Iran to progress with religious rationality based on resistance,\" said Shima, 43-year-old filmmaker in Tehran.\n\nOn Saturday, the reformist newspaper Sazandegi ran the headline \"Long live hope\" on its front page, while the state-run Iran daily hailed what it called a \"strong\" turnout.\n\nRegardless of the result, Iran's next president will be in charge of applying state policy outlined by the supreme leader, who wields ultimate authority in the country.\n\nInterior Minister Ahmad Vahidi said Friday's vote went smoothly.\n\n\"The presidential election was conducted in complete security, in perfect health, with very serious competition and with the valuable presence of people at the ballot boxes,\" he said.\n\nThe Tasnim news agency said however that militants attacked a vehicle carrying ballot boxes in the southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchistan, leaving two policemen dead and others wounded.", "source": {"uri":

It sort of brings it all together.\"\n\nOf the 24.5 million votes cast in Friday's election, Pezeshkian got 10.4 million while Jalili received 9.4 million, election spokesman Mohsen Eslami announced. Parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf got 3.3 million, while Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 206,000 votes.\n\nIranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50 per cent of all votes cast. If not, the race's top two candidates advance to a runoff a week later. There's been only one other runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nAs has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognised monitors.\n\nThere were signs of the wider disenchantment of the public with the vote. More than 1 million votes were voided, according to the results, typically a sign of people feeling obligated to cast a ballot but not wanting to select any of the candidates.\n\nThe overall turnout was 39.9 per cent, according to the results. The 2021 presidential election that elected Raisi saw a 48.8 per cent turnout, while the March parliamentary election saw a 40.6 per cent turnout.\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, has also refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere's also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. In a documentary on the reformist candidate aired by state TV, one woman said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\" of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nJalili, once described by CIA director Bill Burns as \"stupefyingly opaque\" in negotiations, likely would have won outright had the three hard-liners not split Friday's vote. Jalili is known as the \"Living Martyr\" after losing a leg in the 1980s Iran-Iraq war and is famous among Western diplomats for his haranguing lectures and hard-line stances.\n\nQalibaf, a former general in Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and head of Iran's police, had been thought to have a wider power base, despite being plagued by corruption allegations and his role in past violent crackdowns.\n\nHe quickly endorsed Jalili in conceding the result and criticised Pezeshkian for allying himself with President Hassan Rouhani and his former foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif. The two reached Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which later collapsed after then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the accord.\n\n\"The road is not over yet, and despite the fact that I respect Mr. Dr. Pezeshkian personally, ... I ask all the revolutionary forces and my supporters to help stop the wave that is causing an important part of our economic and political problems today,\" Qalibaf said in a statement.\n\nNow the question becomes whether Pezeshkian will be able to draw voters into his campaign. On Election Day, he offered comments on outreach to the West after voting seemingly aimed at drumming up turnout for his campaign -- even after being targeted by a veiled warning from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\n\"Pezeshkian has been a generally underwhelming candidate,\" the geopolitical consultancy Eurasia Group said in an analysis before Friday's vote. \"Should he qualify for a runoff, his position would weaken as the conservative voting bloc unites behind a single candidate.\"\n\nRaisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Khamenei and a potential successor. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\nFriday's vote saw only one reported attack around the election. Gunmen opened fire on a van transporting ballot boxes in the restive southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, killing two police officers and wounding others, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. The province regularly sees violence between security forces and the militant group Jaish al-Adl, as well as drug traffickers.\n\nThe runoff election comes as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. In April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel. Militia groups that Tehran arms in the region -- such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels -- are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Republic continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build -- should it choose to do so -- several nuclear weapons.\n\nVakil said that \"it's going to rest on if the general public, that 60 per cent who stayed home, are going to come out and protect themselves from those hard-line views\" Jalili holds. \"That's what next Friday is going to be about.\"", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoud_Pezeshkian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Masoud Pezeshkian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saeed_Jalili", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saeed Jalili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reformism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Two-round system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Voter turnout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Bagher_Ghalibaf", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iranian Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shia Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mostafa_Pourmohammadi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mostafa Pourmohammadi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatham House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MENA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MENA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theocracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theocracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Iranian_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2021 Iranian presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William J.

The election saw the lowest voter turnout for a presidential election since the Islamic Republic was established in 1979.\n\nReformist lawmaker Masoud Pezeshkian and ultraconservative former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili, who received the most votes, will face off in the runoff, according to Mohsen Eslami, the spokesperson for the election committee.\n\nPezeshkian led with 42.5% of the votes, followed by Jalili with 38.6%, according to the state news agency IRNA. Out of 60 million eligible voters, 24 million cast their ballots, resulting in a 40% turnout, Eslami said.\n\nThe results will be reviewed by the Guardian Council, the powerful 12-member body tasked with overseeing elections and legislation, before the two candidates start campaigning again.\n\nThe snap election was held after Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi died in a helicopter crash on May 19 in the country's remote northwest, along with Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and other officials.\n\nTwo conservatives dropped out of the race just a day before the elections to help the hardline candidates consolidate the conservative vote.\n\nPezeshkian was the only reformist candidate after dozens of other contenders were barred from running by the Guardian Council.\n\nThe Iranian electoral process has been marred by voter apathy of late, causing embarrassment to an establishment that has relied on high voter turnout to bolster its democratic credentials and popular legitimacy.\n\nNationwide discontent was evident in low voter turnout in both parliamentary and presidential elections in recent years. While Iran has boasted exceptionally high voter participation, its last legislative election in March recorded the lowest turnout since in 1979, despite government efforts to rally voters ahead of the ballot.\n\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urged Iranians to head to the polls and vote after he cast his ballot in the election on Friday morning.\n\n\"People's participation is part of the essence of the state and continuation of the existence of the Islamic Republic and its status in the world is tied to people's participation\", he said.\n\nSina Toossi, an Iran analyst and senior fellow at the Center for International Policy in Washington, DC, said Pezeshkian may have been allowed to run in the elections in an attempt to boost voter turnout.\n\n\"This move could be seen as a strategy to create a more dynamic and engaging election process, thereby encouraging greater public participation,\" he told CNN.\n\nWho is Masoud Pezeshkian?\n\nThe two candidates set to compete in the next round of elections represent opposite sides of Iran's political spectrum, and both have run for presidential elections unsuccessfully in the past.\n\nA health minister under reformist president Mohammad Khatami, Pezeshkian is a trained heart surgeon and lawmaker.\n\nHe gained prominence for his stance against the crackdown on the 2009 pro-democracy protests and violence perpetrated by the morality police in 2022 following the death of a young woman in police custody after she was detained for not adhering to the Islamic Republic's strict dress code for women.\n\nDuring the 2022 protests, Pezeshkian said in an interview with Iran's IRINN TV: \"It is our fault. We want to implement religious faith through the use of force. This is scientifically impossible.\"\n\nAfter losing his wife and one of his children in a 1994 car crash, he devoted much of his time to politics. Pezeshkian ran for president in the 2013 and 2021 elections, but failed to make headway.\n\nThe 69-year-old hails from an ethnically mixed family - his father is Azeri and his mother is Kurdish. Persian isn't his mother tongue. That has burnished his image for Iran's minorities but left him open to xenophobic attacks from some opponents.\n\nA more moderate face in the presidency could make it easier for Western states to have conversations with Iran, particularly on the nuclear issue, regional issues and trade, Vali Nasr, a Middle East academic and former adviser to the US State Department, told CNN.\n\nAhead of Friday's vote, however, Khamenei condemned those seeking improved relations with the West. Pezeshkian has publicly stated that he would defer to Khamenei on matters of foreign policy.\n\nWho is Saeed Jalili?\n\nJalili is an ultraconservative hawk known for his uncompromising dealings with the West. He is a longtime top security adviser to Khamenei and a former soldier with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) during the decade-long Iran-Iraq war.\n\nAs lead negotiator of the landmark 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers, he spearheaded Tehran's efforts to win sanctions relief in exchange for controls on its nuclear program. He emerged as a hard-headed opponent, often lecturing US officials on Iran's rights during negotiations in Geneva.\n\nIranian media outlets describe him as \"a firm and meticulous negotiator who did not make concessions\" during nuclear negotiations, believing Iran's economic development should not depend on \"foreign will,\" lines echoed by the Supreme Leader ahead of the Friday vote.\n\nJalili unsuccessfully ran for the 2013 presidential election. He ran again in 2021, but withdrew in favor of Raisi, who eventually won.\n\nNasr, the Middle East academic, says that with Friday's election, the clerical establishment in Iran may have been rethinking what the last presidential election produced. Under Raisi, he says, \"the entire system became uniformly hardline, conservative.\"\n\nArash Azizi, an Iranian writer and fellow at the Center for Middle East and Global Order (CMEG), said that \"a victory by the fundamentalist Jalili\" would complicate efforts to restart negotiations with the West.\n\nEscalating tensions\n\nThe elections came at a delicate time for the Islamic Republic. The country is embroiled in escalating tensions with Israel and its Western allies, triggered by the war in Gaza and the advancement of Iran's nuclear program.\n\nThe vote also takes place just two months after Iran and Israel exchanged fire for the first time as the Gaza conflict widened. Israel is now preparing for a potential second front with Hezbollah, Iran's primary regional proxy, in Lebanon.\n\nAzizi said Iran's shadow war with Israel \"will go on regardless of who wins\" as the most important decisions in that regard are taken by Khamenei and security bodies, not the president.\n\nThe country's Supreme Leader is the final arbiter for most decisions in Iran, but the elected president will be the face of the Islamic Republic abroad.\n\nIran's fight with the US has left the economy in tatters, crippled by years of American sanctions, a weakening local currency and high inflation.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nadeen_ebrahim@aol.com", "name":

It sort of brings it all together.\"\n\nOf the 24.5 million votes cast in Friday's election, Pezeshkian got 10.4 million while Jalili received 9.4 million, election spokesman Mohsen Eslami announced. Parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf got 3.3 million, while Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 206,000 votes.\n\nIranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50% of all votes cast. If not, the race's top two candidates advance to a runoff a week later. There's been only one other runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nPHOTOS: Iran to hold runoff election with reformist Pezeshkian and hard-liner Jalili after low-turnout vote\n\nAs has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors.\n\nThere were signs of the wider disenchantment of the public with the vote. More than 1 million votes were voided, according to the results, typically a sign of people feeling obligated to cast a ballot but not wanting to select any of the candidates.\n\nThe overall turnout was 39.9%, according to the results. The 2021 presidential election that elected Raisi saw a 48.8% turnout, while the March parliamentary election saw a 40.6% turnout.\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, has also refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere's also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. In a documentary on the reformist candidate aired by state TV, one woman said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\" of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nJalili, once described by CIA director Bill Burns as \"stupefyingly opaque\" in negotiations, likely would have won outright had the three hard-liners not split Friday's vote. Jalili is known as the \"Living Martyr\" after losing a leg in the 1980s Iran-Iraq war and is famous among Western diplomats for his haranguing lectures and hard-line stances.\n\nQalibaf, a former general in Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and head of Iran's police, had been thought to have a wider power base, despite being plagued by corruption allegations and his role in past violent crackdowns.\n\nHe quickly endorsed Jalili in conceding the result and criticized Pezeshkian for allying himself with President Hassan Rouhani and his former foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif. The two reached Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which later collapsed after then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the accord.\n\n\"The road is not over yet, and despite the fact that I respect Mr. Dr. Pezeshkian personally, ... I ask all the revolutionary forces and my supporters to help stop the wave that is causing an important part of our economic and political problems today,\" Qalibaf said in a statement.\n\nNow the question becomes whether Pezeshkian will be able to draw voters into his campaign. On Election Day, he offered comments on outreach to the West after voting seemingly aimed at drumming up turnout for his campaign - even after being targeted by a veiled warning from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\n\"Pezeshkian has been a generally underwhelming candidate,\" the geopolitical consultancy Eurasia Group said in an analysis before Friday's vote. \"Should he qualify for a runoff, his position would weaken as the conservative voting bloc unites behind a single candidate.\"\n\nRaisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Khamenei and a potential successor. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\nFriday's vote saw only one reported attack around the election. Gunmen opened fire on a van transporting ballot boxes in the restive southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, killing two police officers and wounding others, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. The province regularly sees violence between security forces and the militant group Jaish al-Adl, as well as drug traffickers.\n\nThe runoff election comes as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. In April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel. Militia groups that Tehran arms in the region - such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels - are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Republic continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build - should it choose to do so - several nuclear weapons.\n\nVakil said that \"it's going to rest on if the general public, that 60% who stayed home, are going to come out and protect themselves from those hard-line views\" Jalili holds. \"That's what next Friday is going to be about.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoud_Pezeshkian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Masoud Pezeshkian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saeed_Jalili", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saeed Jalili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reformism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Two-round system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Voter turnout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Bagher_Ghalibaf", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iranian Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shia Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mostafa_Pourmohammadi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mostafa Pourmohammadi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatham House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MENA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MENA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theocracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theocracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Iranian_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2021 Iranian presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William J.

If no candidate reaches the threshold in the first round, a runoff election will be held on the Friday following the election day between the two candidates with the highest number of votes.\n\nAnalysts believe that regardless of who wins in the upcoming runoff, the key focus for Iran's next president will be navigating the economic challenges posed by Western sanctions, addressing heightened tensions with Israel, and enhancing ties with neighboring countries.\n\nVoting for the election ended at 12:00 a.m. Saturday local time (2030 GMT on Friday) after 16 straight hours, being extended for three times or six hours from the scheduled closing time.\n\nTens of millions of Iranian citizens cast their ballots at close to 59,000 polling stations in more than 95 states.\n\nAccording to Iranian authorities, over 61 million people are eligible to vote in the election, but the voter turnout was only 40 percent, lower than the 48.8 percent turnout in Iran's previous presidential election in 2021.\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, the Iranian government had been actively promoting voter participation, prioritizing an increase in voter turnout. Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has said that participation in the polls is essential \"for the viability of the Islamic Republic system.\"\n\n\"The durability, consistency, dignity and reputation of the Islamic Republic in the world depend on the presence of the people,\" he said after casting the first ballot on Friday.\n\nA total of 80 political heavyweights registered to participate in this election. Iran's Guardian Council approved six candidates earlier this month to join the race.\n\nAs Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi, the current vice president, and Alireza Zakani, the mayor of Tehran, announced their withdrawals days before its commencement, ultimately, Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, the parliamentary speaker; Mostafa Pourmohammadi, a former interior and justice minister, Jalili and Pezeshkian emerged as the final four contenders for Iran's highest executive office.\n\nApart from Pezeshkian and Jalili, Qalibaf received 13.8 percent of the votes, while Pourmohammadi garnered 0.8 percent, according to Iran's Election Headquarters.\n\nIran's 14th presidential election, initially set for 2025, was moved up following the unexpected death of President Ebrahim Raisi and his entourage in a helicopter crash on May 19.\n\nFollowing the incident, Khamenei reassured Iranians that there would be \"no interruption\" to the country's affairs.\n\nDuring the election, candidates have also committed to following the late President Raisi's trajectory. Nevertheless, notable disagreements persist between Pezeshkian and Jalili on matters including relations with Western nations and tackling domestic economic issues.\n\nDuring the election debates, Pezeshkian advocated for economic reforms and increased social freedom and inclusivity. He expressed his intention to achieve national economic growth through strengthening regional and global relations\n\nPezeshkian, 70, served as Iran's health minister from 2001 to 2005; he had previously worked as a heart surgeon.\n\nDuring the election debates, Pezeshkian advocated for economic reforms and increased social freedom and inclusivity. He expressed his intention to achieve national economic growth through strengthening regional and global relations.\n\nIn the final debate held on Tuesday, Pezeshkian said that \"we have to resolve our problems with the world, we have to resolve issues\" about the nuclear deal.\n\nJalili, 59, ran as a qualified candidate in the presidential elections of 2013 and 2021. In 2021, he withdrew his candidacy in support of Raisi.\n\nJalili holds a more conservative and hardline stance on relevant issues. During the debate, Jalili criticized the United States for exerting \"maximum pressure\" on Iran and said that he would not seek to improve relations with Western countries.\n\n\"We should make the enemy regretful about sanctioning Iran through economic means,\" Jalili said in the final debate, advocating for stronger economic ties with Latin American and African nations to defuse the US-led sanctions against the country.\n\nWhile most experts agree that the political direction of Iran will not undergo significant changes, Iranian citizens are still hopeful that the incoming president will implement effective solutions to tackle the country's severe economic challenges and navigate the increasing tensions with Israel and Western powers.\n\n\"The main domestic issue will be related to the economy,\" said Mostafa Khoshcheshm, a Tehran-based international affairs analyst.\n\nA recent report from the International Monetary Fund highlights Iran's dire economic situation, with domestic inflation soaring to 35 percent and unemployment at 8.9 percent. The main focus for the Iranian people now revolves around how to enhance exports, reduce inflation, and boost employment opportunities.\n\nDue to Iran's current economic hardships, largely attributed to sanctions led by the United States and Western countries, both Pezeshkian and Jalili have explicitly stated their intention to seek the lifting of US sanctions against Iran.\n\nHowever, pundits argue that because of the substantial disagreements between Iran and the United States over reviving the Iran nuclear deal, and given Iran's current tensions with Israel, prospects for a near-term improvement in Iran's relations with the West appear dim.\n\nTherefore, Iran's diplomatic focus in the future is likely to center on furthering relationships with countries in the Global South and

"Reformist to face ultraconservative in Iran presidency runoff", "body": "Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei waves as he casts his ballot\n\nThe sole reformist in Iran's presidential election, Masoud Pezeshkian, will face the ultraconservative Saeed Jalili in a runoff, authorities said on Saturday, following a vote marred by historically low turnout.\n\nPezeshkian, 69, secured 42.4 percent of the vote, while Jalili, a 58-year-old former nuclear negotiator, came second with 38.6 percent, according to voting figures announced by Mohsen Eslami, spokesman for Iran's elections authority.\n\nConservative parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf was next with 13.8 percent of the vote, while the only other candidate, conservative cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi, received less than one percent.\n\n\"None of the candidates could garner the absolute majority of the votes,\" Eslami said, adding that those who finished first and second would face each other in a runoff next Friday.\n\nOnly slightly more than 40 percent of the 61 million electorate took part in Friday's first round -- a record low turnout for the Islamic republic.\n\nThe electoral authority said more than one million ballots were spoiled.\n\nOut of Iran's 13 previous presidential elections since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, only one has led to a runoff, which occurred in 2005.\n\nThe poll had been scheduled to take place in 2025 but was brought forward by the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nThe Guardian Council, which vets candidates, had originally approved six contenders.\n\nBut a day ahead of the election, two of them -- the ultraconservative mayor of Tehran Alireza Zakani and Raisi's vice president Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi -- dropped out.\n\nBoth candidates, after the release of the final results, asked their supporters to vote for Jalili in the July 5 runoff.\n\nGhalibaf followed suit later, asking \"all revolutionary forces and supporters\" to get behind Jalili's bid for the presidency.\n\nIn the 2021 election that brought Raisi to power, the Guardian Council disqualified many reformists and moderates, prompting many voters to shun the election.\n\nThe turnout then was just under 49 percent, which at the time was the lowest in any presidential election in Iran.\n\n- Different camps -\n\nFriday's vote took place amid heightened regional tensions over the Gaza war, a dispute with the West over Iran's nuclear programme and domestic discontent over the state of Iran's sanctions-hit economy.\n\nMore from this section Google Tests Facial Recognition for Enhanced Office Security U.S. Mobile Carriers Hit by Global Roaming Outage Harwinton Animal Control looking for missing Peacocks\n\nIran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had called on people to participate in the vote.\n\nOpposition groups, especially in the diaspora, meanwhile called for a boycott, questioning the credibility of elections.\n\nPezeshkian is a heart surgeon who has represented the northern city of Tabriz in parliament since 2008.\n\nHe served as health minister under Iran's last reformist president Mohammad Khatami, who held office from 1997 to 2005 and has endorsed Pezeshkian's bid in the current elections.\n\nPezeshkian criticised Raisi's government for a lack of transparency during nationwide protests triggered by the September 2022 death in police custody of Mahsa Amini.\n\nAmini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, had been arrested for allegedly violating the Islamic republic's strict dress code for women.\n\nIn recent campaigning, Pezeshkian called for \"constructive relations\" with Washington and European countries in order to \"get Iran out of its isolation\".\n\nJalili, Iran's former nuclear negotiator, has maintained his uncompromising anti-West stance.\n\nThe 58-year-old has held several senior positions in the Islamic republic, including in Khamenei's office in the early 2000s.\n\nHe is currently one of Khamenei's representatives in the Supreme National Security Council, Iran's highest security body.\n\nOn Saturday, the reformist newspaper Sazandegi ran the headline \"Long live hope\" on its front page, while the state-run Iran daily hailed what it called a \"strong\" turnout.\n\nRegardless of the result, Iran's next president will be in charge of applying state policy outlined by the supreme leader, who wields ultimate authority in the country.\n\nEarlier, the Tasnim news agency said militants in southeast Iran attacked a vehicle carrying ballot boxes in Sistan-Baluchistan province.\n\nTwo policemen were killed and others were injured in the attack, the agency added.\n\nrkh-pdm/dv", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Iranians are voting in a snap election to replace the late hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi. (Alireza Sotakabr, ISNA via AP)DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) - Iran announced Saturday it will hold a runoff presidential election to replace the late hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi after an initial vote saw the top candidates not securing an outright win in the lowest turnout poll ever held in the Islamic Republic. The election this coming Friday will pit reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian against the hard-line former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili. Mohsen Eslami, an election spokesman, announced the result in a news conference carried by Iranian state television. He said of 24.5 million votes cast, Pezeshkian got 10.4 million while Jalili received 9.4 million. Parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf got 3.3 million. Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 206,000 votes. Iranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50% of all votes cast. If not, the race's top two candidates advance to a runoff a week later. There's been only one runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. Eslami acknowledged the country's Guardian Council would need to offer formal approval, but the result did not draw any immediate challenge from contenders in the race. As has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors. There were signs of the wider disenchantment of the public with the vote. More than 1 million votes were voided, according to the results, typically a sign of people feeling obligated to cast a ballot but not wanting to select any of the candidates. The overall turnout was 39.9%, according to the results. The 2021 presidential election that elected Raisi saw a 48.8% turnout, while the March parliamentary election saw a 40.6% turnout. Despite the low turnout, Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi praised the public for turning out to a vote conducted without any internationally recognized observers. He thanked the people who voted for their \"very valuable presence,\"\u009d adding that the election was held in \"complete safety\"\u009d and \"with very serious competition.\"\u009d There had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, has also refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said. There's also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. In a documentary on the reformist candidate aired by state TV, one woman said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\"\u009d of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution. Jalili, once described by CIA director Bill Burns as \"stupefyingly opaque\"\u009d in negotiations, likely would have won outright had the three hard-liners not split Friday's vote. Qalibaf, a former general in Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, had been thought to have a wider power base, despiting being plagued by corruption allegations. He is also known for launching a violent crackdown on Iranian university students in 1999 and reportedly ordering live fire to be used against students in 2003 while serving as the country's police chief. Now the question becomes whether Pezeshkian will be able to draw voters into his campaign. On Election Day, he offered comments on outreach to the West after voting seemingly aimed at drumming up turnout for his campaign - even after being targeted by a veiled warning from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. \"Though he has received notable endorsements from major reformist figures, including former Presidents (Hassan) Rouhani and Mohammad Khatami, Pezeshkian has been a generally underwhelming candidate,\"\u009d the geopolitical consultancy Eurasia Group said in an analysis before the vote. \"Should he qualify for a runoff, his position would weaken as the conservative voting bloc unites behind a single candidate.\"\u009d Raisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Khamenei and a potential successor. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab. The voting came as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. In April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region - such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels - are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks. Meanwhile, the Islamic Republic continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build - should it choose to do so - several nuclear weapons. Despite the recent unrest, there was only one reported attack around the election.

It sort of brings it all together.\"\n\nOf the 24.5 million votes cast in Friday's election, Pezeshkian got 10.4 million while Jalili received 9.4 million, election spokesman Mohsen Eslami announced. Parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf got 3.3 million, while Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 206,000 votes.\n\nIranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50% of all votes cast. If not, the race's top two candidates advance to a runoff a week later. There's been only one other runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nAs has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors.\n\nThere were signs of the wider disenchantment of the public with the vote. More than 1 million votes were voided, according to the results, typically a sign of people feeling obligated to cast a ballot but not wanting to select any of the candidates.\n\nThe overall turnout was 39.9%, according to the results. The 2021 presidential election that elected Raisi saw a 48.8% turnout, while the March parliamentary election saw a 40.6% turnout.\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, has also refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere's also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. In a documentary on the reformist candidate aired by state TV, one woman said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\" of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nJalili, once described by CIA director Bill Burns as \"stupefyingly opaque\" in negotiations, likely would have won outright had the three hard-liners not split Friday's vote. Jalili is known as the \"Living Martyr\" after losing a leg in the 1980s Iran-Iraq war and is famous among Western diplomats for his haranguing lectures and hard-line stances.\n\nQalibaf, a former general in Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and head of Iran's police, had been thought to have a wider power base, despite being plagued by corruption allegations and his role in past violent crackdowns.\n\nHe quickly endorsed Jalili in conceding the result and criticized Pezeshkian for allying himself with President Hassan Rouhani and his former foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif. The two reached Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which later collapsed after then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the accord.\n\n\"The road is not over yet, and despite the fact that I respect Mr. Dr. Pezeshkian personally, ... I ask all the revolutionary forces and my supporters to help stop the wave that is causing an important part of our economic and political problems today,\" Qalibaf said in a statement.\n\nNow the question becomes whether Pezeshkian will be able to draw voters into his campaign. On Election Day, he offered comments on outreach to the West after voting seemingly aimed at drumming up turnout for his campaign -- even after being targeted by a veiled warning from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\n\"Pezeshkian has been a generally underwhelming candidate,\" the geopolitical consultancy Eurasia Group said in an analysis before Friday's vote. \"Should he qualify for a runoff, his position would weaken as the conservative voting bloc unites behind a single candidate.\"\n\nRaisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Khamenei and a potential successor. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\nFriday's vote saw only one reported attack around the election. Gunmen opened fire on a van transporting ballot boxes in the restive southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, killing two police officers and wounding others, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. The province regularly sees violence between security forces and the militant group Jaish al-Adl, as well as drug traffickers.\n\nThe runoff election comes as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. In April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel. Militia groups that Tehran arms in the region -- such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels -- are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Republic continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build -- should it choose to do so -- several nuclear weapons.\n\nVakil said that \"it's going to rest on if the general public, that 60% who stayed home, are going to come out and protect themselves from those hard-line views\" Jalili holds. \"That's what next Friday is going to be about.\"", "source": {"uri": "ksby.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KSBY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoud_Pezeshkian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Masoud Pezeshkian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saeed_Jalili", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saeed Jalili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reformism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Two-round system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Voter turnout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Bagher_Ghalibaf", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iranian Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shia Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_demonstration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political demonstration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Iranian_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2009 Iranian presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mostafa_Pourmohammadi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mostafa Pourmohammadi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatham House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MENA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MENA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theocracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theocracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Iranian_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2021 Iranian presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William J.

Iran's Guardian Council approved six candidates earlier this month to join the race.\n\nAs Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi, the current vice president, and Alireza Zakani, the mayor of Tehran, announced their withdrawals days before its commencement, ultimately, Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, the parliamentary speaker; Mostafa Pourmohammadi, a former interior and justice minister, Jalili and Pezeshkian emerged as the final four contenders for Iran's highest executive office.\n\nApart from Pezeshkian and Jalili, Qalibaf received 13.8 percent of the votes, while Pourmohammadi garnered 0.8 percent, according to Iran's Election Headquarters.\n\nREFORMIST VS PRINCIPLIST\n\nIran's 14th presidential election, initially set for 2025, was moved up following the unexpected death of President Ebrahim Raisi and his entourage in a helicopter crash on May 19.\n\nFollowing the incident, Khamenei reassured Iranians that there would be \"no interruption\" to the country's affairs.\n\nDuring the election, candidates have also committed to following the late President Raisi's trajectory. Nevertheless, notable disagreements persist between Pezeshkian and Jalili on matters including relations with Western nations and tackling domestic economic issues.\n\nPezeshkian, 70, served as Iran's health minister from 2001 to 2005; he had previously worked as a heart surgeon.\n\nDuring the election debates, Pezeshkian advocated for economic reforms and increased social freedom and inclusivity. He expressed his intention to achieve national economic growth through strengthening regional and global relations.\n\nIn the final debate held on Tuesday, Pezeshkian said that \"we have to resolve our problems with the world, we have to resolve issues\" about the nuclear deal.\n\nJalili, 59, ran as a qualified candidate in the presidential elections of 2013 and 2021. In 2021, he withdrew his candidacy in support of Raisi.\n\nJalili holds a more conservative and hardline stance on relevant issues. During the debate, Jalili criticized the United States for exerting \"maximum pressure\" on Iran and said that he would not seek to improve relations with Western countries.\n\n\"We should make the enemy regretful about sanctioning Iran through economic means,\" Jalili said in the final debate, advocating for stronger economic ties with Latin American and African nations to defuse the U.S.-led sanctions against the country.\n\nFUTURE PATH\n\nWhile most experts agree that the political direction of Iran will not undergo significant changes, Iranian citizens are still hopeful that the incoming president will implement effective solutions to tackle the country's severe economic challenges and navigate the increasing tensions with Israel and Western powers.\n\n\"The main domestic issue will be related to the economy,\" said Mostafa Khoshcheshm, a Tehran-based international affairs analyst.\n\nA recent report from the International Monetary Fund highlights Iran's dire economic situation, with domestic inflation soaring to 35 percent and unemployment at 8.9 percent. The main focus for the Iranian people now revolves around how to enhance exports, reduce inflation, and boost employment opportunities.\n\nDue to Iran's current economic hardships, largely attributed to sanctions led by the United States and Western countries, both Pezeshkian and Jalili have explicitly stated their intention to seek the lifting of U.S. sanctions against Iran.\n\nHowever, pundits argue that because of the substantial disagreements between Iran and the United States over reviving the Iran nuclear deal, and given Iran's current tensions with Israel, prospects for a near-term improvement in Iran's relations with the West appear dim.\n\nTherefore, Iran's diplomatic focus in the future is likely to center on furthering relationships with countries in the Global South and neighboring regions.\n\n\"The most important plans to be pursued by Iran's next administration would be making full use of the country's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and BRICS, the regional geopolitics and the foreign policy opportunities through further interactions with neighbors,\" said Seyed Reza Sadr al-Hosseini, a Tehran-based senior expert on regional issues.\n\n\"As stressed by the (supreme) leader (Ali Khamenei), Iran's approach will continue to be an East-oriented one regardless of who would become president,\" said Khoshcheshm.

It sort of brings it all together.\"\n\nOf the 24.5 million votes cast in Friday's election, Pezeshkian got 10.4 million while Jalili received 9.4 million, election spokesman Mohsen Eslami announced. Parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf got 3.3 million, while Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 206,000 votes.\n\nIranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50 percent of all votes cast. If not, the race's top two candidates advance to a runoff a week later. There's been only one other runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nAs has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors.\n\nThere were signs of the wider disenchantment of the public with the vote. More than 1 million votes were voided, according to the results, typically a sign of people feeling obligated to cast a ballot but not wanting to select any of the candidates.\n\nThe overall turnout was 39.9 percent, according to the results. The 2021 presidential election that elected Raisi saw a 48.8 percent turnout, while the March parliamentary election saw a 40.6 percent turnout.\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, has also refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere's also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. In a documentary on the reformist candidate aired by state TV, one woman said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\" of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nJalili, once described by CIA director Bill Burns as \"stupefyingly opaque\" in negotiations, likely would have won outright had the three hard-liners not split Friday's vote. Jalili is known as the \"Living Martyr\" after losing a leg in the 1980s Iran-Iraq war and is famous among Western diplomats for his haranguing lectures and hard-line stances.\n\nQalibaf, a former general in Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and head of Iran's police, had been thought to have a wider power base, despite being plagued by corruption allegations and his role in past violent crackdowns.\n\nHe quickly endorsed Jalili in conceding the result and criticized Pezeshkian for allying himself with President Hassan Rouhani and his former foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif. The two reached Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which later collapsed after then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the accord.\n\n\"The road is not over yet, and despite the fact that I respect Mr. Dr. Pezeshkian personally, ... I ask all the revolutionary forces and my supporters to help stop the wave that is causing an important part of our economic and political problems today,\" Qalibaf said in a statement.\n\nNow the question becomes whether Pezeshkian will be able to draw voters into his campaign. On Election Day, he offered comments on outreach to the West after voting seemingly aimed at drumming up turnout for his campaign -- even after being targeted by a veiled warning from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\n\"Pezeshkian has been a generally underwhelming candidate,\" the geopolitical consultancy Eurasia Group said in an analysis before Friday's vote. \"Should he qualify for a runoff, his position would weaken as the conservative voting bloc unites behind a single candidate.\"\n\nRaisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Khamenei and a potential successor. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\nFriday's vote saw only one reported attack around the election. Gunmen opened fire on a van transporting ballot boxes in the restive southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, killing two police officers and wounding others, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. The province regularly sees violence between security forces and the militant group Jaish al-Adl, as well as drug traffickers.\n\nThe runoff election comes as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. In April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel. Militia groups that Tehran arms in the region -- such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels -- are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Republic continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build -- should it choose to do so -- several nuclear weapons.\n\nVakil said that \"it's going to rest on if the general public, that 60 percent who stayed home, are going to come out and protect themselves from those hard-line views\" Jalili holds. \"That's what next Friday is going to be about.\"\n\nVahdat reported from Tehran, Iran.

If not, the race's top two candidates will advance to a run-off a week later.\n\nThere has been only one run-off presidential election in Iran's history - in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad beat former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nMr Eslami acknowledged the country's Guardian Council would need to offer formal approval, but the result did not draw any immediate challenge from contenders in the race.\n\nAs has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognised monitors.\n\nThere were signs of the wider disenchantment of the public with the vote.\n\nMore than one million votes were voided, according to the results, typically a sign of people feeling obligated to cast a ballot but not wanting to select any of the candidates.\n\nThe overall turnout was 39.9%, according to the results.\n\nThe 2021 presidential election that elected Mr Raisi saw a 42% turnout, while the March parliamentary election saw a 41% turnout.\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, has also refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere has also been criticism that Mr Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate.\n\nIn a documentary on the reformist candidate aired by state TV, one woman said her generation was \"moving towards the same level\" of animosity with the government that Mr Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nMr Raisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a protege of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and a potential successor.\n\nStill, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing of the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\nThe voting came as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region - such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels - are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Republic continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build - should it choose to do so - several nuclear weapons.\n\nDespite the recent unrest, there was only one reported attack around the election.", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Rafsanjani.\n\nThe late president Mr Raisi died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others.\n\nHe was seen as a protege of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and a potential successor.\n\nStill, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988 and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk",

The second round is required if no candidate wins 50 percent of the vote, plus one.\n\nOut of Iran's 13 previous presidential elections since the Islamic revolution in 1979, only one has led to runoffs in 2005.\n\nThe Interior Ministry reported that more than 19,000,000 ballots had been counted so far.\n\nComing third in the early results is the conservative parliament speaker, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, with about 2,600,000 votes.\n\nThe fourth, Mostafa Pourmohammadi, a conservative cleric, had 158,314 votes.\n\nAround 61 million Iranians were eligible to cast ballots in the elections that were originally scheduled for 2025 but were brought forward by the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nThe Guardian Council, which vets electoral candidates in the Islamic republic, had originally approved six contenders.\n\nBut a day ahead of the election, two candidates -- the ultraconservative mayor of Tehran Alireza Zakani and Raisi's vice president Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi -- dropped out of the race.\n\nIn the 2021 elections that brought Raisi to power, the Council disqualified many reformists and moderates, prompting many voters to shun the polls.\n\nThe turnout then was just under 49 percent -- the lowest in any presidential election in Iran.\n\nFriday's vote took place amid heightened regional tensions over the Gaza war, a dispute with the West over Iran's nuclear programme and domestic discontent over the state of Iran's sanctions-hit economy.\n\nIran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has called on people to participate in the vote.\n\nOpposition groups, especially in the diaspora, meanwhile called for a boycott, questioning the credibility of elections.\n\n- Different camps -\n\nPezeshkian, 69, is a heart surgeon who has represented the northern city of Tabriz in parliament since 2008.\n\nHe served as health minister under Iran's last reformist president Mohammad Khatami, who held office from 1997 to 2005 and has endorsed Pezeshkian's bid in the current elections.\n\nPezeshkian criticised Raisi's government for a lack of transparency during nationwide protests triggered by the September 2022 death in police custody of Mahsa Amini.\n\nAmini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, had been arrested for allegedly violating the Islamic republic's strict dress code for women.\n\nIn recent campaigning, Pezeshkian called for \"constructive relations\" with Washington and European capitals in order to \"get Iran out of its isolation\".\n\nUltraconservative Jalili, Iran's former nuclear negotiator, has maintained his uncompromising anti-West stance.\n\nThe 58-year-old has held several senior positions in the Islamic republic, including in Khamenei's office in the early 2000s.\n\nHe is currently one of Khamenei's representatives in the Supreme National Security Council, Iran's highest security body.\n\nOn Saturday, Iranian reformist daily Sazandegi posted \"Long live hope\" on its front page, while the state-run daily Iran hailed the \"strong\" turnout.\n\nRegardless of the result, Iran's next president will be in charge of applying state policy outlined by the supreme leader, who wields ultimate authority in the country.\n\nEarlier, the local Tasnim news agency said militants in southeast Iran attacked a vehicle carrying ballot boxes in

Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had more than 95,000 votes.\n\nVoters faced a choice between the three hard-line candidates and the little-known reformist Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon. As has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors.\n\nThe voting came as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region -- such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels -- are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build -- should it choose to do so -- several nuclear weapons.\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains in house arrest, also has refused to vote with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere's also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. One woman in a documentary on Pezeshkian aired by state TV said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\" of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nIranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50 per cent of all votes cast. If that doesn't happen, the race's top two candidates will advance to a runoff a week later. There's been only one runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nThe 63-year-old Raisi died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and a potential successor.\n\nStill, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.", "source": {"uri": "tribuneindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tribuneindia News Service"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribuneindia.com", "name": "Associated Press",

If no candidate reaches the threshold in the first round, a runoff election will be held on the Friday following the election day between the two candidates with the highest number of votes.\n\nAnalysts believe that regardless of who wins in the upcoming runoff, the key focus for Iran's next president will be navigating the economic challenges posed by Western sanctions, addressing heightened tensions with Israel, and enhancing ties with neighboring countries.\n\nVoting for the election ended at 12:00 a.m. Saturday local time (2030 GMT on Friday) after 16 straight hours, being extended for three times or six hours from the scheduled closing time.\n\nTens of millions of Iranian citizens cast their ballots at close to 59,000 polling stations in more than 95 states.\n\nAccording to Iranian authorities, over 61 million people are eligible to vote in the election, but the voter turnout was only 40 percent, lower than the 48.8 percent turnout in Iran's previous presidential election in 2021.\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, the Iranian government had been actively promoting voter participation, prioritizing an increase in voter turnout. Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has said that participation in the polls is essential \"for the viability of the Islamic Republic system.\"\n\n\"The durability, consistency, dignity and reputation of the Islamic Republic in the world depend on the presence of the people,\" he said after casting the first ballot on Friday.\n\nA total of 80 political heavyweights registered to participate in this election. Iran's Guardian Council approved six candidates earlier this month to join the race.\n\nAs Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi, the current vice president, and Alireza Zakani, the mayor of Tehran, announced their withdrawals days before its commencement, ultimately, Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, the parliamentary speaker; Mostafa Pourmohammadi, a former interior and justice minister, Jalili and Pezeshkian emerged as the final four contenders for Iran's highest executive office.\n\nApart from Pezeshkian and Jalili, Qalibaf received 13.8 percent of the votes, while Pourmohammadi garnered 0.8 percent, according to Iran's Election Headquarters.\n\nREFORMIST VS PRINCIPLIST\n\nIran's 14th presidential election, initially set for 2025, was moved up following the unexpected death of President Ebrahim Raisi and his entourage in a helicopter crash on May 19.\n\nFollowing the incident, Khamenei reassured Iranians that there would be \"no interruption\" to the country's affairs.\n\nDuring the election, candidates have also committed to following the late President Raisi's trajectory. Nevertheless, notable disagreements persist between Pezeshkian and Jalili on matters including relations with Western nations and tackling domestic economic issues.\n\nPezeshkian, 70, served as Iran's health minister from 2001 to 2005; he had previously worked as a heart surgeon.\n\nDuring the election debates, Pezeshkian advocated for economic reforms and increased social freedom and inclusivity. He expressed his intention to achieve national economic growth through strengthening regional and global relations.\n\nIn the final debate held on Tuesday, Pezeshkian said that \"we have to resolve our problems with the world, we have to resolve issues\" about the nuclear deal.\n\nJalili, 59, ran as a qualified candidate in the presidential elections of 2013 and 2021. In 2021, he withdrew his candidacy in support of Raisi.\n\nJalili holds a more conservative and hardline stance on relevant issues. During the debate, Jalili criticized the United States for exerting \"maximum pressure\" on Iran and said that he would not seek to improve relations with Western countries.\n\n\"We should make the enemy regretful about sanctioning Iran through economic means,\" Jalili said in the final debate, advocating for stronger economic ties with Latin American and African nations to defuse the U.S.-led sanctions against the country.\n\nWhile most experts agree that the political direction of Iran will not undergo significant changes, Iranian citizens are still hopeful that the incoming president will implement effective solutions to tackle the country's severe economic challenges and navigate the increasing tensions with Israel and Western powers.\n\n\"The main domestic issue will be related to the economy,\" said Mostafa Khoshcheshm, a Tehran-based international affairs analyst.\n\nA recent report from the International Monetary Fund highlights Iran's dire economic situation, with domestic inflation soaring to 35 percent and unemployment at 8.9 percent. The main focus for the Iranian people now revolves around how to enhance exports, reduce inflation, and boost employment opportunities.\n\nDue to Iran's current economic hardships, largely attributed to sanctions led by the United States and Western countries, both Pezeshkian and Jalili have explicitly stated their intention to seek the lifting of U.S. sanctions against Iran.\n\nHowever, pundits argue that because of the substantial disagreements between Iran and the United States over reviving the Iran nuclear deal, and given Iran's current tensions with Israel, prospects for a near-term improvement in Iran's relations with the West appear dim.\n\nTherefore, Iran's diplomatic focus in the future is likely to center on furthering relationships with countries in the Global South and neighboring regions.\n\n\"The most important plans to be pursued by Iran's next administration would be making full use of the country's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and BRICS, the regional geopolitics and the foreign policy opportunities through further interactions with neighbors,\" said Seyed Reza Sadr al-Hosseini, a Tehran-based senior expert on regional issues.",

It sort of brings it all together.\"\n\nOf the 24.5 million votes cast in Friday's election, Pezeshkian got 10.4 million while Jalili received 9.4 million, election spokesman Mohsen Eslami announced. Parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf got 3.3 million, while Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 206,000 votes.\n\nIranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50% of all votes cast. If not, the race's top two candidates advance to a runoff a week later. There's been only one other runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nAs has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors.\n\nThere were signs of the wider disenchantment of the public with the vote. More than 1 million votes were voided, according to the results, typically a sign of people feeling obligated to cast a ballot but not wanting to select any of the candidates.\n\nThe overall turnout was 39.9%, according to the results. The 2021 presidential election that elected Raisi saw a 48.8% turnout, while the March parliamentary election saw a 40.6% turnout.\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, has also refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere's also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. In a documentary on the reformist candidate aired by state TV, one woman said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\" of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nJalili, once described by CIA director Bill Burns as \"stupefyingly opaque\" in negotiations, likely would have won outright had the three hard-liners not split Friday's vote. Jalili is known as the \"Living Martyr\" after losing a leg in the 1980s Iran-Iraq war and is famous among Western diplomats for his haranguing lectures and hard-line stances.\n\nQalibaf, a former general in Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and head of Iran's police, had been thought to have a wider power base, despite being plagued by corruption allegations and his role in past violent crackdowns.\n\nHe quickly endorsed Jalili in conceding the result and criticized Pezeshkian for allying himself with President Hassan Rouhani and his former foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif. The two reached Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which later collapsed after then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the accord.\n\n\"The road is not over yet, and despite the fact that I respect Mr. Dr. Pezeshkian personally, ... I ask all the revolutionary forces and my supporters to help stop the wave that is causing an important part of our economic and political problems today,\" Qalibaf said in a statement.\n\nNow the question becomes whether Pezeshkian will be able to draw voters into his campaign. On Election Day, he offered comments on outreach to the West after voting seemingly aimed at drumming up turnout for his campaign -- even after being targeted by a veiled warning from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\n\"Pezeshkian has been a generally underwhelming candidate,\" the geopolitical consultancy Eurasia Group said in an analysis before Friday's vote. \"Should he qualify for a runoff, his position would weaken as the conservative voting bloc unites behind a single candidate.\"\n\nRaisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Khamenei and a potential successor. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\nFriday's vote saw only one reported attack around the election. Gunmen opened fire on a van transporting ballot boxes in the restive southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, killing two police officers and wounding others, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. The province regularly sees violence between security forces and the militant group Jaish al-Adl, as well as drug traffickers.\n\nThe runoff election comes as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. In April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel. Militia groups that Tehran arms in the region -- such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels -- are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Republic continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build -- should it choose to do so -- several nuclear weapons.\n\nVakil said that \"it's going to rest on if the general public, that 60% who stayed home, are going to come out and protect themselves from those hard-line views\" Jalili holds. \"That's what next Friday is going to be about.\"", "source": {"uri": "newschannel5.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WTVF"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoud_Pezeshkian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Masoud Pezeshkian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saeed_Jalili", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saeed Jalili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reformism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Two-round system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Voter turnout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Bagher_Ghalibaf", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iranian Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shia Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mostafa_Pourmohammadi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mostafa Pourmohammadi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatham House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MENA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MENA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theocracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theocracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Iranian_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2021 Iranian presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William J.

Iranians were voting Friday in a snap election to replace the late President Ebrahim Raisi, killed in a helicopter crash last month, as public apathy has become pervasive in the Islamic Republic after years of economic woes, mass protests and tensions in the Middle East.\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Early, seesawing results released Saturday in Iran's presidential election put the race between reformist Masoud Pezeshkian and hard-liner Saeed Jalili, with the lead trading between the two men while a runoff vote appeared likely.\n\nThe early results, reported by Iranian state television, did not initially put either man in a position to win Friday's election outright, potentially setting the stage for a runoff election to replace the late hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi.\n\nIt also did not offer any turnout figures for the race yet -- a crucial component of whether Iran's electorate backs its Shiite theocracy after years of economic turmoil and mass protests.\n\nAfter counting over 14 million votes, Pezeshkian had 5.9 million while Jalili held 5.5 million.\n\nAnother candidate, hard-line parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, had some 1.89 million votes. Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 111,900 votes.\n\nVoters faced a choice between the three hard-line candidates and the little-known reformist Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon. As has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors.\n\nThe voting came as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region -- such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels -- are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build -- should it choose to do so -- several nuclear weapons.\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi.

Another candidate, hard-line speaker of the parliament Mohmmad Bagher Qalibaf, had some 1.38 million votes. Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had more than 80,000 votes.\n\nVoters faced a choice between three hard-line candidates and the little-known reformist Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon. As has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors.\n\nThe voting came as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region -- such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels -- are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build -- should it choose to do so -- several nuclear weapons.\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains in house arrest, also has refused to vote with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere's also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. One woman in a documentary on Pezeshkian aired by state TV said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\" of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nIranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50% of all votes cast. If that doesn't happen, the race's top two candidates will advance to a runoff a week later. There's been only one runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nThe 63-year-old Raisi died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and a potential successor. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to say 10 million was the overall number of votes initially

Iranians were voting Friday in a snap election to replace the late President Ebrahim Raisi, killed in a helicopter crash last month, as public apathy has become pervasive in the Islamic Republic after years of economic woes, mass protests and tensions in the Middle East.\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Iran announced Saturday it will hold a runoff presidential election to replace the late hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi after an initial vote saw the top candidates not securing an outright win in the lowest turnout poll ever held in the Islamic Republic.\n\nThe election this coming Friday will pit reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian against the hard-line former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili.\n\nMohsen Eslami, an election spokesman, announced the result in a news conference carried by Iranian state television. He said of 24.5 million votes cast, Pezeshkian got 10.4 million while Jalili received 9.4 million.\n\nParliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf got 3.3 million. Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 206,000 votes.\n\nIranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50% of all votes cast. If not, the race's top two candidates advance to a runoff a week later. There's been only one runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nEslami acknowledged the country's Guardian Council would need to offer formal approval, but the result did not draw any immediate challenge from contenders in the race.\n\nAs has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors.\n\nThere were signs of the wider disenchantment of the public with the vote. More than 1 million votes were voided, according to the results, typically a sign of people feeling obligated to cast a ballot but not wanting to select any of the candidates.\n\nThe overall turnout was 39.9%, according to the results. The 2021 presidential election that elected Raisi saw a 48.8% turnout, while the March parliamentary election saw a 40.6% turnout.\n\nDespite the low turnout, Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi praised the public for turning out to a vote conducted without any internationally recognized observers.\n\nHe thanked the people who voted for their \"very valuable presence,\" adding that the election was held in \"complete safety\" and \"with very serious competition.\"\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, has also refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere's also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. In a documentary on the reformist candidate aired by state TV, one woman said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\" of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nJalili, once described by CIA director Bill Burns as \"stupefyingly opaque\" in negotiations, likely would have won outright had the three hard-liners not split Friday's vote.\n\nQalibaf, a former general in Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, had been thought to have a wider power base, despiting being plagued by corruption allegations. He is also known for launching a violent crackdown on Iranian university students in 1999 and reportedly ordering live fire to be used against students in 2003 while serving as the country's police chief.\n\nNow the question becomes whether Pezeshkian will be able to draw voters into his campaign. On Election Day, he offered comments on outreach to the West after voting seemingly aimed at drumming up turnout for his campaign -- even after being targeted by a veiled warning from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\n\"Though he has received notable endorsements from major reformist figures, including former Presidents (Hassan) Rouhani and Mohammad Khatami, Pezeshkian has been a generally underwhelming candidate,\" the geopolitical consultancy Eurasia Group said in an analysis before the vote. \"Should he qualify for a runoff, his position would weaken as the conservative voting bloc unites behind a single candidate.\"\n\nRaisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Khamenei and a potential successor. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\nThe voting came as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region -- such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels -- are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Republic continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build -- should it choose to do so -- several nuclear weapons.\n\nDespite the recent unrest, there was only one reported attack around the election. Gunmen opened fire on a van transporting ballot boxes in the restive southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, killing two police officers and wounding others, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. The province regularly sees violence between security forces and the militant group Jaish al-Adl, as well as drug traffickers.\n\nVahdat reported from Tehran, Iran.

"Reformist, ultraconservative qualify for Iran runoff election", "body": "This is the first presidential election since Iran was swept by nationwide protests over the 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini after her arrest for allegedly violating the Islamic republic's dress code\n\nIran's sole reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian and ultraconservative Saeed Jalili have qualified for a runoff presidential election after leading in the first round, an official said on Saturday.\n\nPezeshkian got more than 10,400,000 votes and Jalili, a former nuclear negotiator, has more than 9,400,000, said Mohsen Eslami, spokesman of Iran's election authority.\n\n\"None of the candidates could garner the absolute majority of the votes, therefore, the first and second contenders who got the most votes will be referred\" for the second round, scheduled for next Friday, Eslami told a press conference.\n\nOut of around 61 million eligible voters, some 24,500,000 voters headed to the polls, he added, with a turnout of around 40 percent -- the lowest yet in the history of the Islamic republic.\n\nOut of Iran's 13 previous presidential elections since the Islamic revolution in 1979, only one has led to runoffs in 2005.\n\nConservative parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf received about 3,383,340 votes and Mostafa Pourmohammadi, a conservative cleric, had 206,397 votes.\n\nThe election authority counted a total of 1,056,159 spoiled ballots.\n\nThe elections were originally scheduled for 2025 but were brought forward by the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nThe Guardian Council, which vets electoral candidates in the Islamic republic, had originally approved six contenders.\n\nBut a day ahead of the election, two candidates -- the ultraconservative mayor of Tehran Alireza Zakani and Raisi's vice president Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi -- dropped out of the race.\n\nIn the 2021 elections that brought Raisi to power, the Council disqualified many reformists and moderates, prompting many voters to shun the polls.\n\nThe turnout then was just under 49 percent, which at the time was the lowest in any presidential election in Iran.\n\n- Different camps -\n\nFriday's vote took place amid heightened regional tensions over the Gaza war, a dispute with the West over Iran's nuclear programme and domestic discontent over the state of Iran's sanctions-hit economy.\n\nIran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had called on people to participate in the vote.\n\nMore from this section Authorities: Suspect in custody following police pursuit in Tuckahoe Border Arrests Fall Over 40% Since Biden Suspended Asylum Processing US: Fan In Grimace Costume Chugs Beer During Rain Delay At Citi Field, New York 2\n\nOpposition groups, especially in the diaspora, meanwhile called for a boycott, questioning the credibility of elections.\n\nPezeshkian, 69, is a heart surgeon who has represented the northern city of Tabriz in parliament since 2008.\n\nHe served as health minister under Iran's last reformist president Mohammad Khatami, who held office from 1997 to 2005 and has endorsed Pezeshkian's bid in the current elections.\n\nPezeshkian criticised Raisi's government for a lack of transparency during nationwide protests triggered by the September 2022 death in police custody of Mahsa Amini.\n\nAmini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, had been arrested for allegedly violating the Islamic republic's strict dress code for women.\n\nIn recent campaigning, Pezeshkian called for \"constructive relations\" with Washington and European countries in order to \"get Iran out of its isolation\".\n\nUltraconservative Jalili, Iran's former nuclear negotiator, has maintained his uncompromising anti-West stance.\n\nThe 58-year-old has held several senior positions in the Islamic republic, including in Khamenei's office in the early 2000s.\n\nHe is currently one of Khamenei's representatives in the Supreme National Security Council, Iran's highest security body.\n\nOn Saturday, Iranian reformist daily Sazandegi posted \"Long live hope\" on its front page, while the state-run daily Iran hailed the \"strong\" turnout.\n\nRegardless of the result, Iran's next president will be in charge of applying state policy outlined by the supreme leader, who wields ultimate authority in the country.\n\nEarlier, the local Tasnim news agency said militants in southeast Iran attacked a vehicle carrying ballot boxes in Sistan-Baluchistan province.\n\nTwo policemen were killed and others were injured in the attack, the agency added.\n\nrkh-pdm/mz/jsa", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

If no candidate reaches the threshold in the first round, a runoff election will be held on the Friday following the election day between the two candidates with the highest number of votes.\n\nAnalysts believe that regardless of who wins in the upcoming runoff, the key focus for Iran's next president will be navigating the economic challenges posed by Western sanctions, addressing heightened tensions with Israel, and enhancing ties with neighboring countries. LOW TURNOUT\n\nVoting for the election ended at 12:00 a.m. Saturday local time (2030 GMT on Friday) after 16 straight hours, being extended for three times or six hours from the scheduled closing time.\n\nTens of millions of Iranian citizens cast their ballots at close to 59,000 polling stations in more than 95 states.\n\nAccording to Iranian authorities, over 61 million people are eligible to vote in the election, but the voter turnout was only 40 percent, lower than the 48.8 percent turnout in Iran's previous presidential election in 2021.\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, the Iranian government had been actively promoting voter participation, prioritizing an increase in voter turnout. Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has said that participation in the polls is essential \"for the viability of the Islamic Republic system.\"\n\n\"The durability, consistency, dignity and reputation of the Islamic Republic in the world depend on the presence of the people,\" he said after casting the first ballot on Friday.\n\nA total of 80 political heavyweights registered to participate in this election. Iran's Guardian Council approved six candidates earlier this month to join the race.\n\nAs Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi, the current vice president, and Alireza Zakani, the mayor of Tehran, announced their withdrawals days before its commencement, ultimately, Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, the parliamentary speaker; Mostafa Pourmohammadi, a former interior and justice minister, Jalili and Pezeshkian emerged as the final four contenders for Iran's highest executive office.\n\nApart from Pezeshkian and Jalili, Qalibaf received 13.8 percent of the votes, while Pourmohammadi garnered 0.8 percent, according to Iran's Election Headquarters. REFORMIST VS PRINCIPLIST\n\nIran's 14th presidential election, initially set for 2025, was moved up following the unexpected death of President Ebrahim Raisi and his entourage in a helicopter crash on May 19.\n\nFollowing the incident, Khamenei reassured Iranians that there would be \"no interruption\" to the country's affairs.\n\nDuring the election, candidates have also committed to following the late President Raisi's trajectory. Nevertheless, notable disagreements persist between Pezeshkian and Jalili on matters including relations with Western nations and tackling domestic economic issues.\n\nPezeshkian, 70, served as Iran's health minister from 2001 to 2005; he had previously worked as a heart surgeon.\n\nDuring the election debates, Pezeshkian advocated for economic reforms and increased social freedom and inclusivity. He expressed his intention to achieve national economic growth through strengthening regional and global relations.\n\nIn the final debate held on Tuesday, Pezeshkian said that \"we have to resolve our problems with the world, we have to resolve issues\" about the nuclear deal.\n\nJalili, 59, ran as a qualified candidate in the presidential elections of 2013 and 2021. In 2021, he withdrew his candidacy in support of Raisi.\n\nJalili holds a more conservative and hardline stance on relevant issues. During the debate, Jalili criticized the United States for exerting \"maximum pressure\" on Iran and said that he would not seek to improve relations with Western countries.\n\n\"We should make the enemy regretful about sanctioning Iran through economic means,\" Jalili said in the final debate, advocating for stronger economic ties with Latin American and African nations to defuse the U.S.-led sanctions against the country. FUTURE PATH\n\nWhile most experts agree that the political direction of Iran will not undergo significant changes, Iranian citizens are still hopeful that the incoming president will implement effective solutions to tackle the country's severe economic challenges and navigate the increasing tensions with Israel and Western powers.\n\n\"The main domestic issue will be related to the economy,\" said Mostafa Khoshcheshm, a Tehran-based international affairs analyst.\n\nA recent report from the International Monetary Fund highlights Iran's dire economic situation, with domestic inflation soaring to 35 percent and unemployment at 8.9 percent. The main focus for the Iranian people now revolves around how to enhance exports, reduce inflation, and boost employment opportunities.\n\nDue to Iran's current economic hardships, largely attributed to sanctions led by the United States and Western countries, both Pezeshkian and Jalili have explicitly stated their intention to seek the lifting of U.S. sanctions against Iran.\n\nHowever, pundits argue that because of the substantial disagreements between Iran and the United States over reviving the Iran nuclear deal, and given Iran's current tensions with Israel, prospects for a near-term improvement in Iran's relations with the West appear dim.\n\nTherefore, Iran's diplomatic focus in the future is likely to center on furthering relationships with countries in the Global South and neighboring regions.\n\n\"The most important plans to be pursued by Iran's next administration would be making full use of the country's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and BRICS, the regional geopolitics and the foreign policy opportunities through further interactions with neighbors,\" said Seyed Reza Sadr al-Hosseini, a Tehran-based senior expert on regional issues.\n\n\"As stressed by the (supreme) leader (Ali Khamenei), Iran's approach will continue to be an East-oriented one regardless of who would become president,\" said Khoshcheshm.", "source": {"uri":

The second round is required if no candidate wins 50 percent of the vote, plus one.\n\nOut of Iran's 13 previous presidential elections since the Islamic revolution in 1979, only one has led to runoffs in 2005.\n\nThe Interior Ministry reported that more than 19,000,000 ballots had been counted so far.\n\nComing third in the early results is the conservative parliament speaker, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, with about 2,600,000 votes.\n\nThe fourth, Mostafa Pourmohammadi, a conservative cleric, had 158,314 votes.\n\nAround 61 million Iranians were eligible to cast ballots in the elections that were originally scheduled for 2025 but were brought forward by the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nThe Guardian Council, which vets electoral candidates in the Islamic republic, had originally approved six contenders.\n\nBut a day ahead of the election, two candidates -- the ultraconservative mayor of Tehran Alireza Zakani and Raisi's vice president Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi -- dropped out of the race.\n\nIn the 2021 elections that brought Raisi to power, the Council disqualified many reformists and moderates, prompting many voters to shun the polls.\n\nThe turnout then was just under 49 percent -- the lowest in any presidential election in Iran.\n\nFriday's vote took place amid heightened regional tensions over the Gaza war, a dispute with the West over Iran's nuclear programme and domestic discontent over the state of Iran's sanctions-hit economy.\n\nIran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has called on people to participate in the vote.\n\nOpposition groups, especially in the diaspora, meanwhile called for a boycott, questioning the credibility of elections.\n\nMore from this section Why do Americans love watching movies with their dogs? Nike shares tumble on tepid outlook as CEO eyes Olympics marketing win Emotional day on Manitoba First Nation, as city apologizes for racist expulsion order more than a century ago - Different camps -\n\nPezeshkian, 69, is a heart surgeon who has represented the northern city of Tabriz in parliament since 2008.\n\nHe served as health minister under Iran's last reformist president Mohammad Khatami, who held office from 1997 to 2005 and has endorsed Pezeshkian's bid in the current elections.\n\nPezeshkian criticised Raisi's government for a lack of transparency during nationwide protests triggered by the September 2022 death in police custody of Mahsa Amini.\n\nAmini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, had been arrested for allegedly violating the Islamic republic's strict dress code for women.\n\nIn recent campaigning, Pezeshkian called for \"constructive relations\" with Washington and European capitals in order to \"get Iran out of its isolation\".\n\nUltraconservative Jalili, Iran's former nuclear negotiator, has maintained his uncompromising anti-West stance.\n\nThe 58-year-old has held several senior positions in the Islamic republic, including in Khamenei's office in the early 2000s.\n\nHe is currently one of Khamenei's representatives in the Supreme National Security Council, Iran's highest security body.\n\nOn Saturday, Iranian reformist daily Sazandegi posted \"Long live hope\" on its front page, while the state-run daily Iran hailed the \"strong\" turnout.\n\nRegardless of the result, Iran's next president will be in charge of applying state policy outlined by the supreme leader, who wields ultimate authority in the country.\n\nEarlier, the local Tasnim news agency said militants in southeast Iran attacked a vehicle carrying ballot boxes in Sistan-Baluchistan province.\n\nTwo policemen were killed and others were injured in the attack, the agency added.\n\nrkh/mz/jsa", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

He said of 24.5 million votes cast, Pezeshkian got 10.4 million while Jalili received 9.4 million. Parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf got 3.3 million. Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 206,000 votes. Iranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50% of all votes cast. If not, the race\u00b4s top two candidates advance to a runoff a week later. There\u00b4s been only one runoff presidential election in Iran\u00b4s history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nEslami acknowledged the country's Guardian Council would need to offer formal approval, but the result did not draw any immediate challenge from contenders in the race. As has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors.\n\nThere were signs of the wider disenchantment of the public with the vote. More than 1 million votes were voided, according to the results, typically a sign of people feeling obligated to cast a ballot but not wanting to select any of the candidates. The overall turnout was 39.9%, according to the results. The 2021 presidential election that elected Raisi saw a 48.8% turnout, while the March parliamentary election saw a 40.6% turnout.\n\nDespite the low turnout, Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi praised the public for turning out to a vote conducted without any internationally recognized observers.\n\nHe thanked the people who voted for their \"very valuable presence,\" adding that the election was held in \"complete safety\" and \"with very serious competition.\"\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, has also refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere\u00b4s also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. In a documentary on the reformist candidate aired by state TV, one woman said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\" of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian\u00b4s generation had in the 1979 revolution. Jalili, once described by CIA director Bill Burns as \"stupefyingly opaque\" in negotiations, likely would have won outright had the three hard-liners not split Friday's vote.\n\nQalibaf, a former general in Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, had been thought to have a wider power base, despiting being plagued by corruption allegations. He is also known for launching a violent crackdown on Iranian university students in 1999 and reportedly ordering live fire to be used against students in 2003 while serving as the country\u00b4s police chief.\n\nNow the question becomes whether Pezeshkian will be able to draw voters into his campaign. \"Though he has received notable endorsements from major reformist figures, including former Presidents (Hassan) Rouhani and Mohammad Khatami, Pezeshkian has been a generally underwhelming candidate,\" the geopolitical consultancy Eurasia Group said in an analysis before the vote. \"Should he qualify for a runoff, his position would weaken as the conservative voting bloc unites behind a single candidate.\"\n\nRaisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country\u00b4s foreign minister and others.

"Reformist, ultraconservative qualify for Iran runoff election", "body": "This is the first presidential election since Iran was swept by nationwide protests over the 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini after her arrest for allegedly violating the Islamic republic's dress code\n\nIran's sole reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian and ultraconservative Saeed Jalili have qualified for a runoff presidential election after leading in the first round, an official said on Saturday.\n\nPezeshkian got more than 10,400,000 votes and Jalili, a former nuclear negotiator, has more than 9,400,000, said Mohsen Eslami, spokesman of Iran's election authority.\n\n\"None of the candidates could garner the absolute majority of the votes, therefore, the first and second contenders who got the most votes will be referred\" for the second round, scheduled for next Friday, Eslami told a press conference.\n\nOut of around 61 million eligible voters, some 24,500,000 voters headed to the polls, he added, with a turnout of around 40 percent -- the lowest yet in the history of the Islamic republic.\n\nOut of Iran's 13 previous presidential elections since the Islamic revolution in 1979, only one has led to runoffs in 2005.\n\nConservative parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf received about 3,383,340 votes and Mostafa Pourmohammadi, a conservative cleric, had 206,397 votes.\n\nThe election authority counted a total of 1,056,159 spoiled ballots.\n\nThe elections were originally scheduled for 2025 but were brought forward by the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nThe Guardian Council, which vets electoral candidates in the Islamic republic, had originally approved six contenders.\n\nBut a day ahead of the election, two candidates -- the ultraconservative mayor of Tehran Alireza Zakani and Raisi's vice president Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi -- dropped out of the race.\n\nIn the 2021 elections that brought Raisi to power, the Council disqualified many reformists and moderates, prompting many voters to shun the polls.\n\nThe turnout then was just under 49 percent, which at the time was the lowest in any presidential election in Iran.\n\n- Different camps -\n\nFriday's vote took place amid heightened regional tensions over the Gaza war, a dispute with the West over Iran's nuclear programme and domestic discontent over the state of Iran's sanctions-hit economy.\n\nIran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had called on people to participate in the vote.\n\nOpposition groups, especially in the diaspora, meanwhile called for a boycott, questioning the credibility of elections.\n\nPezeshkian, 69, is a heart surgeon who has represented the northern city of Tabriz in parliament since 2008.\n\nHe served as health minister under Iran's last reformist president Mohammad Khatami, who held office from 1997 to 2005 and has endorsed Pezeshkian's bid in the current elections.\n\nPezeshkian criticised Raisi's government for a lack of transparency during nationwide protests triggered by the September 2022 death in police custody of Mahsa Amini.\n\nAmini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, had been arrested for allegedly violating the Islamic republic's strict dress code for women.\n\nIn recent campaigning, Pezeshkian called for \"constructive relations\" with Washington and European countries in order to \"get Iran out of its isolation\".\n\nUltraconservative Jalili, Iran's former nuclear negotiator, has maintained his uncompromising anti-West stance.\n\nThe 58-year-old has held several senior positions in the Islamic republic, including in Khamenei's office in the early 2000s.\n\nHe is currently one of Khamenei's representatives in the Supreme National Security Council, Iran's highest security body.\n\nOn Saturday, Iranian reformist daily Sazandegi posted \"Long live hope\" on its front page, while the state-run daily Iran hailed the \"strong\" turnout.\n\nRegardless of the result, Iran's next president will be in charge of applying state policy outlined by the supreme leader, who wields ultimate authority in the country.\n\nEarlier, the local Tasnim news agency said militants in southeast Iran attacked a vehicle carrying ballot boxes in Sistan-Baluchistan province.\n\nTwo policemen were killed and others were injured in the attack, the agency added.\n\nrkh-pdm/mz/jsa\n\nMore from this section\n\nEmpowering Women To Improve Their Inner Health\n\nOld Vine Registry Marks One Year Anniversary and Announces

There's been only one runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Early results in Iran's presidential election put hard-liner Saeed Jalili slightly ahead Saturday, followed closely behind by reformist Masoud Pezeshkian.\n\nThe early results, reported by Iranian state television, did not initially put Jalili in a position to win Friday's election outright, potentially setting the stage for a runoff election to replace the late hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi.\n\nIt also did not offer any turnout figures for the race yet -- a crucial component of whether Iran's electorate backs its Shiite theocracy after years of economic turmoil and mass protests.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWith over 10 million votes counted, Jaili had 4.26 million votes, followed by Pezeshkian with 4.24 million. Another candidate, hard-line speaker of the parliament Mohmmad Bagher Qalibaf, had some 1.38 million votes. Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had more than 80,000 votes.\n\nVoters faced a choice between the three hard-line candidates and the little-known reformist Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon. As has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors.\n\nThe voting came as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region -- such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels -- are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build -- should it choose to do so -- several nuclear weapons.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains in house arrest, also has refused to vote with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere's also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. One woman in a documentary on Pezeshkian aired by state TV said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\" of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nIranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50% of all votes cast. If that doesn't happen, the race's top two candidates will advance to a runoff a week later. There's been only one runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nThe 63-year-old Raisi died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and a potential successor. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to say 10 million was the overall number of votes initially

If no candidate reaches the threshold in the first round, a runoff election will be held on the Friday following the election day between the two candidates with the highest number of votes.\n\nAnalysts believe that regardless of who wins in the upcoming runoff, the key focus for Iran's next president will be navigating the economic challenges posed by Western sanctions, addressing heightened tensions with Israel, and enhancing ties with neighboring countries.\n\nLOW TURNOUT\n\nVoting for the election ended at 12:00 a.m. Saturday local time (2030 GMT on Friday) after 16 straight hours, being extended for three times or six hours from the scheduled closing time.\n\nTens of millions of Iranian citizens cast their ballots at close to 59,000 polling stations in more than 95 states.\n\nAccording to Iranian authorities, over 61 million people are eligible to vote in the election, but the voter turnout was only 40 percent, lower than the 48.8 percent turnout in Iran's previous presidential election in 2021.\n\nPeople vote at a polling station during Iran's presidential election in Tehran, Iran, June 28, 2024. (Xinhua/Shadati)\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, the Iranian government had been actively promoting voter participation, prioritizing an increase in voter turnout. Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has said that participation in the polls is essential \"for the viability of the Islamic Republic system.\"\n\n\"The durability, consistency, dignity and reputation of the Islamic Republic in the world depend on the presence of the people,\" he said after casting the first ballot on Friday.\n\nA total of 80 political heavyweights registered to participate in this election. Iran's Guardian Council approved six candidates earlier this month to join the race.\n\nAs Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi, the current vice president, and Alireza Zakani, the mayor of Tehran, announced their withdrawals days before its commencement, ultimately, Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, the parliamentary speaker; Mostafa Pourmohammadi, a former interior and justice minister, Jalili and Pezeshkian emerged as the final four contenders for Iran's highest executive office.\n\nApart from Pezeshkian and Jalili, Qalibaf received 13.8 percent of the votes, while Pourmohammadi garnered 0.8 percent, according to Iran's Election Headquarters.\n\nA voter casts his ballot for Iran's presidential election at a polling station in Tehran, Iran, June 28, 2024. (Xinhua/Shadati)\n\nREFORMIST VS PRINCIPLIST\n\nIran's 14th presidential election, initially set for 2025, was moved up following the unexpected death of President Ebrahim Raisi and his entourage in a helicopter crash on May 19.\n\nFollowing the incident, Khamenei reassured Iranians that there would be \"no interruption\" to the country's affairs.\n\nDuring the election, candidates have also committed to following the late President Raisi's trajectory. Nevertheless, notable disagreements persist between Pezeshkian and Jalili on matters including relations with Western nations and tackling domestic economic issues.\n\nPezeshkian, 70, served as Iran's health minister from 2001 to 2005; he had previously worked as a heart surgeon.\n\nDuring the election debates, Pezeshkian advocated for economic reforms and increased social freedom and inclusivity. He expressed his intention to achieve national economic growth through strengthening regional and global relations.\n\nIn the final debate held on Tuesday, Pezeshkian said that \"we have to resolve our problems with the world, we have to resolve issues\" about the nuclear deal.\n\nJalili, 59, ran as a qualified candidate in the presidential elections of 2013 and 2021. In 2021, he withdrew his candidacy in support of Raisi.\n\nJalili holds a more conservative and hardline stance on relevant issues. During the debate, Jalili criticized the United States for exerting \"maximum pressure\" on Iran and said that he would not seek to improve relations with Western countries.\n\n\"We should make the enemy regretful about sanctioning Iran through economic means,\" Jalili said in the final debate, advocating for stronger economic ties with Latin American and African nations to defuse the U.S.-led sanctions against the country.\n\nSnow mountains are seen from Tehran, Iran, March 9, 2024. (Xinhua/Shadati)\n\nFUTURE PATH\n\nWhile most experts agree that the political direction of Iran will not undergo significant changes, Iranian citizens are still hopeful that the incoming president will implement effective solutions to tackle the country's severe economic challenges and navigate the increasing tensions with Israel and Western powers.\n\n\"The main domestic issue will be related to the economy,\" said Mostafa Khoshcheshm, a Tehran-based international affairs analyst.\n\nA recent report from the International Monetary Fund highlights Iran's dire economic situation, with domestic inflation soaring to 35 percent and unemployment at 8.9 percent. The main focus for the Iranian people now revolves around how to enhance exports, reduce inflation, and boost employment opportunities.\n\nDue to Iran's current economic hardships, largely attributed to sanctions led by the United States and Western countries, both Pezeshkian and Jalili have explicitly stated their intention to seek the lifting of U.S. sanctions against Iran.\n\nHowever, pundits argue that because of the substantial disagreements between Iran and the United States over reviving the Iran nuclear deal, and given Iran's current tensions with Israel, prospects for a near-term improvement in Iran's relations with the West appear dim.\n\nTherefore, Iran's diplomatic focus in the future is likely to center on furthering relationships with countries in the Global South and neighboring regions.\n\n\"The most important plans to be pursued by Iran's next administration would be making full use of the country's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and BRICS, the regional geopolitics and the foreign policy opportunities through further interactions with neighbors,\" said Seyed Reza Sadr al-Hosseini, a Tehran-based senior expert on regional issues.\n\n\"As stressed by the (supreme) leader (Ali Khamenei), Iran's approach will continue to be an East-oriented one regardless of who would become president,\" said Khoshcheshm.", "source": {"uri":

Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 158,000 votes.\n\nVoters faced a choice between the three hard-line candidates and the little-known reformist Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon. As has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors.\n\nThe voting came as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region -- such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels -- are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build -- should it choose to do so -- several nuclear weapons.\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, also has refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere's also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. One woman in a documentary on Pezeshkian aired by state TV said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\" of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nIranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50% of all votes cast. If that doesn't happen, the race's top two candidates will advance to a runoff a week later. There's been only one runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nThe 63-year-old Raisi died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and a potential successor. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\nDespite the recent unrest, there was only one reported attack around the election. Gunmen opened fire on a van transporting ballot boxes in the restive southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, killing two police officers and wounding others, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. The province regularly sees violence between security forces and the militant group Jaish al-Adl, as well as drug traffickers.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Seesawing results released early Saturday in Iran's presidential election put the race between little-known reformist Masoud Pezeshkian and hard-liner Saeed Jalili, with the lead trading between the two men as a runoff vote appeared likely.\n\nIranian state television reported the results which did not initially put either man in a position to win Friday's election outright, potentially setting the stage for a second round of voting to replace the late hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi who died in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nSo far, no turnout figures have been offered -- a crucial component of whether Iran's electorate backs its Shiite theocracy after years of economic turmoil and mass protests.\n\nVoters faced a choice between the three hard-line candidates and Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAfter counting over 19 million votes, Pezeshkian had 8.3 million while Jalili held 7.18 million.

If not, the race's top two candidates will advance to a runoff a week later. There's been only one runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nAs has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors.\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, has also refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere's also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. In a documentary on the reformist candidate aired by state TV, one woman said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\" of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nRaisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others.

Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\nThe voting came as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region -- such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels -- are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Republic continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build -- should it choose to do so -- several nuclear weapons.\n\nDespite the recent unrest, there was only one reported attack around the election.

He said of 24.5 million votes cast, Pezeshkian got 10.4 million while Jalili received 9.4 million.\n\nParliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf got 3.3 million. Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 206,000 votes.\n\nIranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50% of all votes cast. If not, the race's top two candidates advance to a runoff a week later. There's been only one runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nEslami acknowledged the country's Guardian Council would need to offer formal approval, but the result did not draw any immediate challenge from contenders in the race.\n\nAs has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors.\n\nThere were signs of the wider disenchantment of the public with the vote. More than 1 million votes were voided, according to the results, typically a sign of people feeling obligated to cast a ballot but not wanting to select any of the candidates.\n\nThe overall turnout was 39.9%, according to the results. The 2021 presidential election that elected Raisi saw a 48.8% turnout, while the March parliamentary election saw a 40.6% turnout.\n\nDespite the low turnout, Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi praised the public for turning out to a vote conducted without any internationally recognized observers.\n\nHe thanked the people who voted for their \"very valuable presence,\" adding that the election was held in \"complete safety\" and \"with very serious competition.\"\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, has also refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere's also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. In a documentary on the reformist candidate aired by state TV, one woman said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\" of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nJalili, once described by CIA director Bill Burns as \"stupefyingly opaque\" in negotiations, likely would have won outright had the three hard-liners not split Friday's vote.\n\nQalibaf, a former general in Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, had been thought to have a wider power base, despiting being plagued by corruption allegations. He is also known for launching a violent crackdown on Iranian university students in 1999 and reportedly ordering live fire to be used against students in 2003 while serving as the country's police chief.\n\nNow the question becomes whether Pezeshkian will be able to draw voters into his campaign. On Election Day, he offered comments on outreach to the West after voting seemingly aimed at drumming up turnout for his campaign -- even after being targeted by a veiled warning from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\n\"Though he has received notable endorsements from major reformist figures, including former Presidents (Hassan) Rouhani and Mohammad Khatami, Pezeshkian has been a generally underwhelming candidate,\" the geopolitical consultancy Eurasia Group said in an analysis before the vote. \"Should he qualify for a runoff, his position would weaken as the conservative voting bloc unites behind a single candidate.\"\n\nRaisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Khamenei and a potential successor. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\nThe voting came as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region -- such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels -- are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Republic continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build -- should it choose to do so -- several nuclear weapons.\n\nDespite the recent unrest, there was only one reported attack around the election. Gunmen opened fire on a van transporting ballot boxes in the restive southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, killing two police officers and wounding others, the state-run IRNA news agency reported.

It sort of brings it all together.\"\n\nOf the 24.5 million votes cast in Friday's election, Pezeshkian got 10.4 million while Jalili received 9.4 million, election spokesman Mohsen Eslami announced. Parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf got 3.3 million, while Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 206,000 votes.\n\nIranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50 per cent of all votes cast. If not, the race's top two candidates advance to a runoff a week later. There's been only one other runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nAs has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors.\n\nThere were signs of the wider disenchantment of the public with the vote. More than one million votes were voided, according to the results, typically a sign of people feeling obligated to cast a ballot but not wanting to select any of the candidates.\n\nThe overall turnout was 39.9 per cent, according to the results. The 2021 presidential election that elected Raisi saw a 48.8 per cent turnout, while the March parliamentary election saw a 40.6 per cent turnout.\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, has also refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere's also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. In a documentary on the reformist candidate aired by state TV, one woman said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\" of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nJalili, once described by CIA director Bill Burns as \"stupefyingly opaque\" in negotiations, likely would have won outright had the three hard-liners not split Friday's vote. Jalili is known as the \"Living Martyr\" after losing a leg in the 1980s Iran-Iraq war and is famous among Western diplomats for his haranguing lectures and hard-line stances.\n\nQalibaf, a former general in Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and head of Iran's police, had been thought to have a wider power base, despite being plagued by corruption allegations and his role in past violent crackdowns.\n\nHe quickly endorsed Jalili in conceding the result and criticized Pezeshkian for allying himself with President Hassan Rouhani and his former foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif. The two reached Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which later collapsed after then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the accord.\n\n\"The road is not over yet, and despite the fact that I respect Mr. Dr. Pezeshkian personally, (...) I ask all the revolutionary forces and my supporters to help stop the wave that is causing an important part of our economic and political problems today,\" Qalibaf said in a statement.\n\nNow the question becomes whether Pezeshkian will be able to draw voters into his campaign. On Election Day, he offered comments on outreach to the West after voting, seemingly aimed at drumming up turnout for his campaign -- even after being targeted by a veiled warning from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\n\"Pezeshkian has been a generally underwhelming candidate,\" the geopolitical consultancy Eurasia Group said in an analysis before Friday's vote. \"Should he qualify for a runoff, his position would weaken as the conservative voting bloc unites behind a single candidate.\"\n\nRaisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a protege of Khamenei and a potential successor. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\nFriday's vote saw only one reported attack around the election. Gunmen opened fire on a van transporting ballot boxes in the restive southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, killing two police officers and wounding others, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. The province regularly sees violence between security forces and the militant group Jaish al-Adl, as well as drug traffickers.\n\nThe runoff election comes as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. In April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel. Militia groups that Tehran arms in the region -- such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels -- are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Republic continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build -- should it choose to do so -- several nuclear weapons.\n\nVakil said that \"it's going to rest on if the general public, that 60 per cent who stayed home, are going to come out and protect themselves from those hard-line views\" Jalili holds. \"That's what next Friday is going to be about.\"", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoud_Pezeshkian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Masoud Pezeshkian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saeed_Jalili", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saeed Jalili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reformism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Two-round system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Voter turnout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Bagher_Ghalibaf", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iranian Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shia Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mostafa_Pourmohammadi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mostafa Pourmohammadi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mahmoud Ahmadinejad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatham House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MENA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MENA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theocracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theocracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Iranian_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2021 Iranian presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William J.

The second round is required if no candidate wins 50 percent of the vote, plus one.\n\nOut of Iran's 13 previous presidential elections since the Islamic revolution in 1979, only one has led to runoffs in 2005.\n\nThe Interior Ministry reported that more than 19,000,000 ballots had been counted so far.\n\nComing third in the early results is the conservative parliament speaker, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, with about 2,600,000 votes.\n\nThe fourth, Mostafa Pourmohammadi, a conservative cleric, had 158,314 votes.\n\nAround 61 million Iranians were eligible to cast ballots in the elections that were originally scheduled for 2025 but were brought forward by the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nThe Guardian Council, which vets electoral candidates in the Islamic republic, had originally approved six contenders.\n\nBut a day ahead of the election, two candidates -- the ultraconservative mayor of Tehran Alireza Zakani and Raisi's vice president Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi -- dropped out of the race.\n\nIn the 2021 elections that brought Raisi to power, the Council disqualified many reformists and moderates, prompting many voters to shun the polls.\n\nThe turnout then was just under 49 percent -- the lowest in any presidential election in Iran.\n\nFriday's vote took place amid heightened regional tensions over the Gaza war, a dispute with the West over Iran's nuclear programme and domestic discontent over the state of Iran's sanctions-hit economy.\n\nIran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has called on people to participate in the vote.\n\nOpposition groups, especially in the diaspora, meanwhile called for a boycott, questioning the credibility of elections.\n\n- Different camps -\n\nPezeshkian, 69, is a heart surgeon who has represented the northern city of Tabriz in parliament since 2008.\n\nHe served as health minister under Iran's last reformist president Mohammad Khatami, who held office from 1997 to 2005 and has endorsed Pezeshkian's bid in the current elections.\n\nPezeshkian criticised Raisi's government for a lack of transparency during nationwide protests triggered by the September 2022 death in police custody of Mahsa Amini.\n\nAmini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, had been arrested for allegedly violating the Islamic republic's strict dress code for women.\n\nIn recent campaigning, Pezeshkian called for \"constructive relations\" with Washington and European capitals in order to \"get Iran out of its isolation\".\n\nUltraconservative Jalili, Iran's former nuclear negotiator, has maintained his uncompromising anti-West stance.\n\nThe 58-year-old has held several senior positions in the Islamic republic, including in Khamenei's office in the early 2000s.\n\nHe is currently one of Khamenei's representatives in the Supreme National Security Council, Iran's highest security body.\n\nOn Saturday, Iranian reformist daily Sazandegi posted \"Long live hope\" on its front page, while the state-run daily Iran hailed the \"strong\" turnout.\n\nRegardless of the result, Iran's next president will be in charge of applying state policy outlined by the supreme leader, who wields ultimate authority in the country.\n\nEarlier, the local Tasnim news agency said militants in southeast Iran attacked a vehicle carrying ballot boxes in Sistan-Baluchistan province.\n\nTwo policemen were killed and others were injured in the attack, the agency added.\n\nrkh/mz/jsa\n\nMore from this section\n\nCome Over October 2024 Campaign Officially

Iranians are voting in a snap election to replace the late hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi. (Alireza Sotakabr, ISNA via AP)DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) - Seesawing results released early Saturday in Iran's presidential election put the race between little-known reformist Masoud Pezeshkian and hard-liner Saeed Jalili, with the lead trading between the two men as a runoff vote appeared likely. Iranian state television reported the results which did not initially put either man in a position to win Friday's election outright, potentially setting the stage for a second round of voting to replace the late hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi who died in a helicopter crash last month. So far, no turnout figures have been offered - a crucial component of whether Iran's electorate backs its Shiite theocracy after years of economic turmoil and mass protests. Voters faced a choice between the three hard-line candidates and Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon. After counting over 19 million votes, Pezeshkian had 8.3 million while Jalili held 7.18 million. Another candidate, hard-line parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, had some 2.67 million votes while Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 158,000 votes. Iranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50% of all votes cast. If not, the race's top two candidates will advance to a runoff a week later. There's been only one runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. As has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors. There had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, has also refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said. There's also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. In a documentary on the reformist candidate aired by state TV, one woman said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\"\u009d of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution. Raisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and a potential successor. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab. The voting came as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. In April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region - such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels - are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks. Meanwhile, the Islamic Republic continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build - should it choose to do so - several nuclear weapons. Despite the recent unrest, there was only one reported attack around the election. Gunmen opened fire on a van transporting ballot boxes in the restive southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, killing two police officers and wounding others, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. The province regularly sees violence between security forces and the militant group Jaish al-Adl, as well as drug traffickers. ___ Karimi reported from Tehran, Iran.", "source": {"uri":

He is also known for launching a violent crackdown on Iranian university students in 1999 and reportedly ordering live fire to be used against students in 2003 while serving as the country's police chief.\n\nNow the question becomes whether Pezeshkian will be able to draw voters into his campaign. On Election Day, he offered comments on outreach to the West after voting seemingly aimed at drumming up turnout for his campaign -- even after being targeted by a veiled warning from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\n\"Though he has received notable endorsements from major reformist figures, including former Presidents (Hassan) Rouhani and Mohammad Khatami, Pezeshkian has been a generally underwhelming candidate,\" the geopolitical consultancy Eurasia Group said in an analysis before the vote. \"Should he qualify for a runoff, his position would weaken as the conservative voting bloc unites behind a single candidate.\"\n\nRaisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Khamenei and a potential successor. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\nThe voting came as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region -- such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels -- are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Republic continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build -- should it choose to do so -- several nuclear weapons.\n\nDespite the recent unrest, there was only one reported attack around the election. Gunmen opened fire on a van transporting ballot boxes in the restive southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, killing two police officers and wounding others, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. The province regularly sees violence between security forces and the militant group Jaish al-Adl, as well as drug traffickers.\n\nVahdat reported from Tehran, Iran.

If that doesn't happen, the race's top two candidates will advance to a runoff a week later.

Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had more than 80,000 votes.", "source": {"uri": "wboc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WBOC TV-16"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wboc.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebrahim_Raisi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ebrahim Raisi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saeed_Jalili", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saeed Jalili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Snap election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Reformists", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iranian Reformists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoud_Pezeshkian", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Masoud Pezeshkian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_clergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shia clergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mostafa_Pourmohammadi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mostafa Pourmohammadi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Republic_of_Iran_Broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theocracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Theocracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Consultative_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Consultative Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shia Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Two-round system"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Multimedia", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/wboc.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/9d/39d0b74b-9c84-566d-bd88-957e1d80c017/667f766459d4c.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692323", "eventUri": "eng-9692323", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

He said of 24.5 million votes cast, Pezeshkian got 10.4 million while Jalili received 9.4 million. Parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf got 3.3 million. Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 206,000 votes.\n\nIranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50% of all votes cast. If not, the race's top two candidates will advance to a runoff a week later. There's been only one runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nEslami acknowledged the country's Guardian Council would need to offer formal approval, but the result did not draw any immediate challenge from contenders in the race.\n\nAs has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors.\n\nThere were signs of the wider disenchantment of the public with the vote. More than 1 million votes were voided, according to the results, typically a sign of people feeling obligated to cast a ballot but not wanting to select any of the candidates.\n\nThe overall turnout was 39.9%, according to the results. The 2021 presidential election that elected Raisi saw a 42% turnout, while the March parliamentary election saw a 41% turnout.\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, has also refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere's also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. In a documentary on the reformist candidate aired by state TV, one woman said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\" of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nRaisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and a potential successor. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\nThe voting came as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region -- such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels -- are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Republic continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build -- should it choose to do so -- several nuclear weapons.\n\nDespite the recent unrest, there was only one reported attack around the election. Gunmen opened fire on a van transporting ballot boxes in the restive southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, killing two police officers and wounding others, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. The province regularly sees violence between security forces and the militant group Jaish al-Adl, as well as drug traffickers.\n\nVahdat reported from Tehran, Iran.

Another candidate, hard-line parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, had some 2.67 million votes while Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 158,000 votes.\n\nIranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50% of all votes cast. If not, the race's top two candidates will advance to a runoff a week later. There's been only one runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nAs has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors.\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, has also refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere's also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. In a documentary on the reformist candidate aired by state TV, one woman said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\"\u009d of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nRaisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and a potential successor. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\nThe voting came as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region - such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels - are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Republic continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build - should it choose to do so - several nuclear weapons.\n\nDespite the recent unrest, there was only one reported attack around the election. Gunmen opened fire on a van transporting ballot boxes in the restive southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, killing two police officers and wounding others, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. The province regularly sees violence between security forces and the militant group Jaish al-Adl, as well as drug traffickers.", "source": {"uri": "lethbridgeherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

It sort of brings it all together.\"\n\nOf the 24.5 million votes cast in Friday's election, Pezeshkian got 10.4 million while Jalili received 9.4 million, election spokesman Mohsen Eslami announced. Parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf got 3.3 million, while Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 206,000 votes.\n\nIranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50% of all votes cast. If not, the race's top two candidates advance to a runoff a week later. There's been only one other runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nAs has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors.\n\nThere were signs of the wider disenchantment of the public with the vote. More than 1 million votes were voided, according to the results, typically a sign of people feeling obligated to cast a ballot but not wanting to select any of the candidates.\n\nThe overall turnout was 39.9%, according to the results. The 2021 presidential election that elected Raisi saw a 48.8% turnout, while the March parliamentary election saw a 40.6% turnout.\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, has also refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere's also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. In a documentary on the reformist candidate aired by state TV, one woman said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\" of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nJalili, once described by CIA director Bill Burns as \"stupefyingly opaque\" in negotiations, likely would have won outright had the three hard-liners not split Friday's vote. Jalili is known as the \"Living Martyr\" after losing a leg in the 1980s Iran-Iraq war and is famous among Western diplomats for his haranguing lectures and hard-line stances.\n\nQalibaf, a former general in Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and head of Iran's police, had been thought to have a wider power base, despite being plagued by corruption allegations and his role in past violent crackdowns.\n\nHe quickly endorsed Jalili in conceding the result and criticized Pezeshkian for allying himself with President Hassan Rouhani and his former foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif. The two reached Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which later collapsed after then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the accord.\n\n\"The road is not over yet, and despite the fact that I respect Mr. Dr. Pezeshkian personally, ... I ask all the revolutionary forces and my supporters to help stop the wave that is causing an important part of our economic and political problems today,\" Qalibaf said in a statement.\n\nNow the question becomes whether Pezeshkian will be able to draw voters into his campaign. On Election Day, he offered comments on outreach to the West after voting seemingly aimed at drumming up turnout for his campaign -- even after being targeted by a veiled warning from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\n\"Pezeshkian has been a generally underwhelming candidate,\" the geopolitical consultancy Eurasia Group said in an analysis before Friday's vote. \"Should he qualify for a runoff, his position would weaken as the conservative voting bloc unites behind a single candidate.\"\n\nRaisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Khamenei and a potential successor. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\nFriday's vote saw only one reported attack around the election. Gunmen opened fire on a van transporting ballot boxes in the restive southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, killing two police officers and wounding others, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. The province regularly sees violence between security forces and the militant group Jaish al-Adl, as well as drug traffickers.\n\nThe runoff election comes as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.

Bagher Ghalibaf received about 3,383,340 votes, and conservative cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had 206,397.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe poll authority counted 1,056,159 spoiled ballots.\n\nThe elections were originally scheduled for 2025 but were brought forward by the death of ultraconservative president Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nThe Guardian Council, which vets electoral candidates in the Islamic republic, had originally approved six contenders.\n\nBut a day ahead of the election, two candidates -- Tehran's ultraconservative Mayor Alireza Zakani and Raisi's vice president Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi -- dropped out of the race.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the 2021 elections that brought Raisi to power, the council disqualified many reformists and moderates, prompting many voters to shun the polls.\n\nThe turnout then was just under 49 percent, which at the time was the lowest in any presidential election in Iran.\n\nFriday's vote took place amid heightened regional tensions over the war in the Gaza Strip, a dispute with the West over Iran's nuclear program and domestic discontent over the state of Iran's sanctions-hit economy.\n\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had called on people to participate in the vote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpposition groups, especially in the diaspora, meanwhile called for a boycott, questioning the credibility of the elections.\n\nPezeshkian, 69, is a heart surgeon who has represented the northern city of Tabriz in parliament since 2008.\n\nHe served as health minister under Iran's last reformist president Mohammad Khatami, who held office from 1997 to 2005 and has endorsed Pezeshkian's bid in the current elections.\n\nPezeshkian criticized Raisi's government for a lack of transparency during nationwide protests triggered by the September 2022 death of Mahsa Amini in police custody.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, had been arrested for allegedly violating the Islamic republic's strict dress code for women.\n\nIn recent campaigning, Pezeshkian called for \"constructive relations\" with Washington and European countries in order to \"get Iran out of its isolation.\"\n\nHis rival, Jalili, has maintained his uncompromising anti-West stance.\n\nThe 58-year-old has held several senior positions in the Islamic republic, including in Khamenei's office in the early 2000s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe is currently one of Khamenei's representatives in the Supreme National Security Council, the country's highest security body.\n\nOn Saturday, Iranian reformist daily Sazandegi posted \"Long live hope\" on its front page, while the state-run daily Iran hailed the \"strong\" turnout.\n\nRegardless of the result, Iran's next president will be in charge of applying state policy outlined by the supreme leader, who wields ultimate authority in the country.\n\nEarlier, the local Tasnim news agency said militants in southeastern Iran attacked a vehicle carrying ballot boxes in Sistan-Baluchistan province.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo policemen were killed, and others were injured in the attack, it added.", "source": {"uri": "manilatimes.net",

Another candidate, hard-line parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, had some 2.67 million votes while Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 158,000 votes.\n\nIranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50% of all votes cast. If not, the race's top two candidates will advance to a runoff a week later. There's been only one runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nAs has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors.\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, has also refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere's also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. In a documentary on the reformist candidate aired by state TV, one woman said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\" of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nRaisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and a potential successor. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\nThe voting came as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region -- such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels -- are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Republic continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build -- should it choose to do so -- several nuclear weapons.\n\nDespite the recent unrest, there was only one reported attack around the election. Gunmen opened fire on a van transporting ballot boxes in the restive southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, killing two police officers and wounding others, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. The province regularly sees violence between security forces and the militant group Jaish al-Adl, as well as drug traffickers.\n\nKarimi reported from Tehran, Iran.", "source": {"uri":

Majid Asgaripour/WANA (West Asia News Agency) via REUTERS\n\nEarly, seesawing results released Saturday in Iran's presidential election put the race between reformist Masoud Pezeshkian and hard-liner Saeed Jalili, with the lead trading between the two men while a runoff vote appeared likely.\n\nThe early results, reported by Iranian state television, did not initially put either man in a position to win Friday's election outright, potentially setting the stage for a runoff election to replace the late hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi, The Associated Press said.\n\nIt also did not offer any turnout figures for the race yet -- a crucial component of whether Iran's electorate backs its theocracy after years of economic turmoil and mass protests.\n\nAfter counting over 12 million votes, Pezeshkian had over 5 million while Jalili held 4.8 million.\n\nAnother candidate, hard-line speaker of the parliament Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, had some 1.6 million votes. Cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had more than 95,000 votes.\n\nVoters faced a choice between the three hard-line candidates and the little-known reformist Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon. As has been the case since the 1979 Iranian Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors.\n\nThe voting came as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region -- such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi militants -- are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build -- should it choose to do so -- several nuclear weapons.\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains in house arrest, also has refused to vote with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere's also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. One woman in a documentary on Pezeshkian aired by state TV said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\" of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nIranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50% of all votes cast. If that doesn't happen, the race's top two candidates will advance to a runoff a week later. There's been only one runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nThe 63-year-old Raisi died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and a potential successor. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf.\n\nDespite the recent unrest, there was only one reported attack around the election. Gunmen opened fire on a van transporting ballot boxes in the restive southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, killing two police officers and wounding others, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. The province regularly sees violence between security forces and the militant group Jaish al-Adl, as well as drug traffickers.", "source": {"uri": "english.aawsat.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Two hardline candidates subsequently dropped out.\n\nLimited choices\n\nThree candidates are hardliners and one is a low-profile comparative moderate, backed by the reformist faction that has largely been sidelined in Iran in recent years.\n\nA source close to Pezeshkian had earlier told Reuters that 'so far, from the votes counted in small towns and villages, Pezeshkian is ahead of his rivals.'\n\nProminent among the remaining hardliners are Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, parliament speaker and former commander of the powerful Revolutionary Guards, and Jalili, who served for four years in Khamenei's office.\n\nAn Iranian man votes at a polling station in Tehran, Iran, during a snap presidential election to choose a successor to Ebrahim Raisi following Raisi's death in a helicopter crash, June 28, 2024.\n\nCritics of Iran's clerical rule say that low turnouts in recent years show the system's legitimacy has eroded. Turnout was 48% in the 2021 presidential election and a record low of 41% in a parliamentary election in March.\n\n'Based on unconfirmed reports, the election is very likely heading to a second round. Based on the votes counted so far, Jalili and Pezeshkian will compete in a run-off election,' Tasnim reported.\n\nIf no candidate wins at least 50% plus one vote from all ballots cast, including blank votes, a run-off between the top two candidates is held on the first Friday after the result is declared.\n\nAll four candidates have vowed to revive the flagging economy, beset by mismanagement, state corruption and sanctions re-imposed since 2018, after the United States ditched Tehran's 2015 nuclear pact with six world powers.\n\n'I think Jalili is the only candidate who raised the issue of justice, fighting corruption and giving value to the poor. ... Most importantly, he does not link Iran's foreign policy to the nuclear deal,' said Farzan, a 45-year-old artist in the city of Karaj.\n\nDivided voters\n\nPezeshkian is faithful to Iran's theocratic rule, but advocates detente with the West, economic reform, social liberalization and political pluralism.\n\n'We will respect the hijab law, but there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behavior toward women,' Pezeshkian said after casting his vote.\n\nHe was referring to the death of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman, in 2022 while in morality police custody for allegedly violating the mandatory Islamic dress code.\n\nThe unrest sparked by Amini's death spiraled into the biggest show of opposition to Iran's clerical rulers in years.\n\nPezeshkian's chances hinge on reviving the enthusiasm of reform-minded voters who have largely stayed away from the polls for the last four years as a mostly youthful population chafes at political and social curbs. He could also benefit from his rivals' failure to consolidate the hardline vote.\n\n'I feel Pezeshkian represents both traditional and liberal thoughts,' said architect Pirouz, 45, who said he had planned to boycott the vote until he learned more about Pezeshkian's plans.\n\nIn the past few weeks, Iranians have made wide use of the hashtag #ElectionCircus on X, with some activists at home and abroad calling for a boycott, saying a high turnout would only serve to legitimize the Islamic Republic.\n\n'The youth were punished ... young girls were killed on the streets. ... We can't easily move on from that. ... After all that happened, it's unconscionable to vote,' said 55-year-old writer Shahrzad Afrasheh.\n\nIn the 2022-2023 protests, more than 500 people including 71 minors were killed, hundreds were

The election saw the lowest voter turnout for a presidential election since the Islamic Republic was established in 1979.\n\nReformist lawmaker Masoud Pezeshkian and ultraconservative former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili, who received the most votes, will face off in the runoff, according to Mohsen Eslami, the spokesperson for the election committee.\n\nPezeshkian led with 42.5 percent of the votes, followed by Jalili with 38.6 percent, according to the state news agency IRNA. Out of 60 million eligible voters, 24 million cast their ballots, resulting in a 40 percent turnout, Eslami said.\n\nThe results will be reviewed by the Guardian Council, the powerful 12-member body tasked with overseeing elections and legislation, before the two candidates start campaigning again.\n\nThe snap election was held after Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi died in a helicopter crash on May 19 in the country's remote northwest, along with Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and other officials.\n\nTwo conservatives dropped out of the race just a day before the elections to help the hardline candidates consolidate the conservative vote.\n\nPezeshkian was the only reformist candidate after dozens of other contenders were barred from running by the Guardian Council.\n\nThe Iranian electoral process has been marred by voter apathy of late, causing embarrassment to an establishment that has relied on high voter turnout to bolster its democratic credentials and popular legitimacy.\n\nNationwide discontent was evident in low voter turnout in both parliamentary and presidential elections in recent years. While Iran has boasted exceptionally high voter participation, its last legislative election in March recorded the lowest turnout since in 1979, despite government efforts to rally voters ahead of the ballot.\n\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urged Iranians to head to the polls and vote after he cast his ballot in the election on Friday morning.\n\n\"People's participation is part of the essence of the state and continuation of the existence of the Islamic Republic and its status in the world is tied to people's participation\", he said.\n\nSina Toossi, an Iran analyst and senior fellow at the Center for International Policy in Washington, DC, said Pezeshkian may have been allowed to run in the elections in an attempt to boost voter turnout.\n\n\"This move could be seen as a strategy to create a more dynamic and engaging election process, thereby encouraging greater public participation,\" he told CNN.\n\nThe two candidates set to compete in the next round of elections represent opposite sides of Iran's political spectrum, and both have run for presidential elections unsuccessfully in the past.\n\nA health minister under reformist president Mohammad Khatami, Pezeshkian is a trained heart surgeon and lawmaker.\n\nHe gained prominence for his stance against the crackdown on the 2009 pro-democracy protests and violence perpetrated by the morality police in 2022 following the death of a young woman in police custody after she was detained for not adhering to the Islamic Republic's strict dress code for women.\n\nDuring the 2022 protests, Pezeshkian said in an interview with Iran's IRINN TV: \"It is our fault. We want to implement religious faith through the use of force. This is scientifically impossible.\"\n\nAfter losing his wife and one of his children in a 1994 car crash, he devoted much of his time to politics. Pezeshkian ran for president in the 2013 and 2021 elections, but failed to make headway.\n\nThe 69-year-old hails from an ethnically mixed family - his father is Azeri and his mother is Kurdish. Persian isn't his mother tongue. That has burnished his image for Iran's minorities but left him open to xenophobic attacks from some opponents.\n\nA more moderate face in the presidency could make it easier for Western states to have conversations with Iran, particularly on the nuclear issue, regional issues and trade, Vali Nasr, a Middle East academic and former adviser to the US State Department, told CNN.\n\nAhead of Friday's vote, however, Khamenei condemned those seeking improved relations with the West. Pezeshkian has publicly stated that he would defer to Khamenei on matters of foreign policy.\n\nJalili is an ultraconservative hawk known for his uncompromising dealings with the West. He is a longtime top security adviser to Khamenei and a former soldier with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) during the decade-long Iran-Iraq war.\n\nAs lead negotiator of the landmark 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers, he spearheaded Tehran's efforts to win sanctions relief in exchange for controls on its nuclear program. He emerged as a hard-headed opponent, often lecturing US officials on Iran's rights during negotiations in Geneva.\n\nIranian media outlets describe him as \"a firm and meticulous negotiator who did not make concessions\" during nuclear negotiations, believing Iran's economic development should not depend on \"foreign will,\" lines echoed by the Supreme Leader ahead of the Friday vote.\n\nJalili unsuccessfully ran for the 2013 presidential election. He ran again in 2021, but withdrew in favor of Raisi, who eventually won.\n\nNasr, the Middle East academic, says that with Friday's election, the clerical establishment in Iran may have been rethinking what the last presidential election produced. Under Raisi, he says, \"the entire system became uniformly hardline, conservative.\"\n\nArash Azizi, an Iranian writer and fellow at the Center for Middle East and Global Order (CMEG), said that \"a victory by the fundamentalist Jalili\" would complicate efforts to restart negotiations with the West.\n\nThe elections came at a delicate time for the Islamic Republic. The country is embroiled in escalating tensions with Israel and its Western allies, triggered by the war in Gaza and the advancement of Iran's nuclear program.\n\nThe vote also takes place just two months after Iran and Israel exchanged fire for the first time as the Gaza conflict widened. Israel is now preparing for a potential second front with Hezbollah, Iran's primary regional proxy, in Lebanon.\n\nAzizi said Iran's shadow war with Israel \"will go on regardless of who wins\" as the most important decisions in that regard are taken by Khamenei and security bodies, not the president.\n\nThe country's Supreme Leader is the final arbiter for most decisions in Iran, but the elected president will be the face of the Islamic Republic abroad.\n\nIran's fight with the US has left the economy in tatters, crippled by years of American sanctions, a weakening local currency and high inflation.", "source": {"uri": "egyptindependent.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Egypt Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Hossein Beris/AFP hide caption\n\nIranians will head back to the polls next week to decide between a reformist and a hard-line conservative for president.\n\nThe runoff election comes after the first vote, which took place on Friday, ended with none of the candidates receiving a majority. Under Iranian election law, a candidate must get 50% and one vote in order to secure an outright victory.\n\nBut two top contenders did emerge: reformist Masoud Pezeshkian and hardliner Saeed Jalili.\n\nPezeshkian has called for greater outreach to the outside world as a means of improving Iran's economy, while Jalili is a former nuclear negotiator with strong anti-Western views.\n\nThe two will face off in a second round of voting scheduled for July 5. The snap election is to replace former President Ebrahim Raisi who died in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nIn Iran, the supreme leader yields the most power. But the president can still have influence on domestic and some foreign policies.\n\nThis upcoming election will be the second presidential runoff in the country's history. The first took place in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won against former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. Iran's critics are quick to note that the country's elections are not free or fair.\n\nOn Friday, Pezeshkian received 10.4 million votes while Jalili trailed with 9.4 million, according to Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency.\n\nAs some expected, the hard-line vote was divided, while Pezeshkian is believed to have captured many votes from moderate or reform-minded Iranians.\n\nThe election also confirmed widespread disenchantment among voters with the current political process in Iran. Turnout looks to have been a record low in the history of the Islamic Republic, continuing a trend seen in other recent elections.\n\nPrior to President Raisi's death, the hard-liner was viewed as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and possible successor of the 85-year-old supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nNow, the prospect of who may replace Khamenei, who holds the power to make the most major decisions in Iran, is even more unclear.\n\nWhat is apparent is that Khamenei does not support many of the reformist ideas put forth by Pezeshkian, including seeking greater engagement with other countries.\n\nBut at large, observers don't predict significant change to come out of this vote. No candidate has proposed policies that would be considered controversial, such as as addressing the strict Islamic dress code for women.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_kenyon@npr.org", "name": "Peter Kenyon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "juliana_kim@npr.org", "name": "Juliana Kim", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoud_Pezeshkian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Masoud Pezeshkian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saeed_Jalili", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saeed Jalili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reformism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Two-round system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebrahim_Raisi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ebrahim Raisi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Western_sentiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Western sentiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akbar_Hashemi_Rafsanjani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Leader of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mahmoud Ahmadinejad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Republic_News_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Khamenei", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ali Khamenei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Zoroastrianism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Zoroastrianism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7360x4140+0+386/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2d%2F68%2F3bee71624658a967c4dafeae8b69%2Fgettyimages-2159148140.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692323", "eventUri": "eng-9692323", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-05", "textStart": 845, "textEnd": 851}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

But Pezeshkian did not get the more than 50% of votes cast that is required by Iranian law to win outright.\n\nWith Jalili now alone in facing the cardiac surgeon, Pezeshkian's campaign would need to draw voters to the July 5 runoff in an election they've otherwise not taken part in as public anger hardens following years of Iran facing economic hardships and mass protests under its Shiite theocracy.\n\n\"Let's look at it as a protest in its own right: A very widespread choice to reject what's on offer -- both the candidates and the system,\" said Sanam Vakil, the director of Chatham House's Middle East and North Africa program. \"That tells us a lot about public opinion and apathy, frustration. It sort of brings it all together.\"\n\nOf the 24.5 million votes cast in Friday's election, Pezeshkian got 10.4 million while Jalili received 9.4 million, election spokesman Mohsen Eslami announced. Parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf got 3.3 million, while Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 206,000 votes.\n\nAs has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change were barred from running. The voting has had no oversight from internationally recognized monitors.\n\nThere were signs of the wider disenchantment of the public with the vote after calls for a boycott. More than 1 million votes were voided, according to the results, typically a sign of people feeling obligated to cast a ballot but not wanting to select any of the candidates. The overall turnout was 39.9%, according to the results.\n\nJalili, once described by CIA director Bill Burns as \"stupefyingly opaque\" in negotiations, likely would have won outright had the three hard-liners not split Friday's vote. Jalili is known as the \"Living Martyr\" after losing a leg in the 1980s Iran-Iraq war and is famous among Western diplomats for his haranguing lectures and hard-line stances.\n\nQalibaf, a former general in Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and head of Iran's police, quickly endorsed Jalili and criticized Pezeshkian for allying himself with former President Hassan Rouhani and his former foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif. The two reached Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which later collapsed after then-President Trump unilaterally withdrew from the accord.\n\nNow the question becomes whether Pezeshkian will be able to draw voters into his campaign. On Election Day, he offered comments on outreach to the West -- even after being targeted by a veiled warning from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nRaisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Khamenei and a potential successor.\n\nThe runoff election comes as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. In April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel. Militia groups that Tehran arms in the region -- such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels -- are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Republic continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build -- should it choose to do so -- several nuclear weapons.\n\nVakil said that \"it's going to rest on if the general public, that 60% who stayed home, are going to come out and protect themselves from those hard-line views\" Jalili holds. \"That's what next Friday is going to be about.\"", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoud_Pezeshkian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Masoud Pezeshkian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saeed_Jalili", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saeed Jalili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reformism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Two-round system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shia Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Bagher_Ghalibaf", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebrahim_Raisi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ebrahim Raisi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theocracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theocracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William J.

Iranians are voting in a snap election to replace the late hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi. (Alireza Sotakabr, ISNA via AP)DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) - Iran will hold a runoff presidential election to replace the late hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi, an official said Saturday, after an initial vote saw the top candidates not securing an outright win. The election this coming Friday will pit reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian against the hard-line former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili. Mohsen Eslami, an election spokesman, announced the result in a news conference carried by Iranian state television. He said of 24.5 million votes cast, Pezeshkian got 10.4 million while Jalili received 9.4 million. Parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf got 3.3 million. Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 206,000 votes. Iranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50% of all votes cast. If not, the race's top two candidates will advance to a runoff a week later. There's been only one runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. Eslami acknowledged the country's Guardian Council would need to offer formal approval, but the result did not draw any immediate challenge from contenders in the race. As has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors. There had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, has also refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said. There's also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. In a documentary on the reformist candidate aired by state TV, one woman said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\"\u009d of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution. Raisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and a potential successor. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab. The voting came as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. In April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region - such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels - are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks. Meanwhile, the Islamic Republic continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build - should it choose to do so - several nuclear weapons. Despite the recent unrest, there was only one reported attack around the election. Gunmen opened fire on a van transporting ballot boxes in the restive southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, killing two police officers and wounding others, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. The province regularly sees violence between security forces and the militant group Jaish al-Adl, as well as drug traffickers. ___ Vahdat reported from Tehran, Iran.

Under Iranian election law, a candidate must get 50% and one vote in order to secure an outright victory.\n\nBut two top contenders did emerge: reformist Masoud Pezeshkian and hardliner Saeed Jalili.\n\nPezeshkian has called for greater outreach to the outside world as a means of improving Iran's economy, while Jalili is a former nuclear negotiator with strong anti-Western views.\n\nThe two will face off in a second round of voting scheduled for July 5. The snap election is to replace former President Ebrahim Raisi who died in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nIn Iran, the supreme leader yields the most power. But the president can still have influence on domestic and some foreign policies.\n\nThis upcoming election will be the second presidential runoff in the country's history. The first took place in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won against former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. Iran's critics are quick to note that the country's elections are not free or fair.\n\nOn Friday, Pezeshkian received 10.4 million votes while Jalili trailed with 9.4 million, according to Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency.\n\nAs some expected, the hard-line vote was divided, while Pezeshkian is believed to have captured many votes from moderate or reform-minded Iranians.\n\nThe election also confirmed widespread disenchantment among voters with the current political process in Iran. Turnout looks to have been a record low in the history of the Islamic Republic, continuing a trend seen in other recent elections.\n\nPrior to President Raisi's death, the hard-liner was viewed as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and possible successor of the 85-year-old supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nNow, the prospect of who may replace Khamenei, who holds the power to make the most major decisions in Iran, is even more unclear.\n\nWhat is apparent is that Khamenei does not support many of the reformist ideas put forth by Pezeshkian, including seeking greater engagement with other countries.", "source": {"uri": "wfae.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFAE 90.7 - Charlotte's NPR News Source"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoud_Pezeshkian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Masoud Pezeshkian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saeed_Jalili", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saeed Jalili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reformism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Two-round system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebrahim_Raisi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ebrahim Raisi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Western_sentiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Western sentiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akbar_Hashemi_Rafsanjani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Leader of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mahmoud Ahmadinejad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Republic_News_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Khamenei", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ali Khamenei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Zoroastrianism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Zoroastrianism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aedfba5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6549x3684+0+614/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnpr.brightspotcdn.com%2Fdims3%2Fdefault%2Fstrip%2Ffalse%2Fcrop%2F6549x4912%20405%200%2Fresize%2F6549x4912%21%2F%3Furl%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2d%2F68%2F3bee71624658a967c4dafeae8b69%2Fgettyimages-2159148140.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692323", "eventUri": "eng-9692323", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-05", "textStart": 698, "textEnd": 704}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

If not, the race's top two candidates will advance to a run-off a week later.\n\nThere's been only one run-off presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when Ahmadinejad bested former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nEslami acknowledged the Guardian Council would need to offer formal approval of the result, but the announcement did not draw any immediate challenge from contenders in the race.\n\nAs has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change were barred from running.\n\nThere were also signs of disenchantment with the vote among the public. More than a million votes cast were not valid, according to the results -- typically a sign of people feeling obligated to cast a ballot but not wanting to select any of the candidates.\n\n\"Let's look at it as a protest in its own right: A very widespread choice to reject what's on offer - both the candidates and the system,\" said Sanam Vakil, the director of Chatham House's Middle East and North Africa program.\n\n\"That tells us a lot about public opinion and apathy, frustration. It sort of brings it all together.\"\n\nThe low turnout was unsurprising given there were calls for a boycott of the poll, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi.\n\nMir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere has also been criticism that the reformist Pezeshkian nevertheless represents just another government-approved candidate.\n\nMeanwhile Jalili -- who was once described by CIA director Bill Burns as \"stupefyingly opaque\" in negotiations -- likely would have won outright had the three hardliners not split Friday's vote.\n\nThe question now becomes whether Pezeshkian will be able to draw voters into his campaign.\n\nOn election day, he offered comments on outreach to the West after voting, seemingly aimed at drumming up turnout for his campaign -- even after being targeted by a veiled warning from Ayatollah Khamenei.\n\n\"Though he has received notable endorsements from major reformist figures, including former Presidents [Hassan] Rouhani and Mohammad Khatami, Pezeshkian has been a generally underwhelming candidate,\" the geopolitical consultancy Eurasia Group said in an analysis before the vote.\n\n\"Should he qualify for a run-off, his position would weaken as the conservative voting bloc unites behind a single candidate.\"\n\nThe election is behind held to replace President Ebrahim Raisi, 63, who died in a May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister.\n\nRaisi was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Khamenei, and a potential successor.\n\nStill, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his

It sort of brings it all together.\"\n\nOf the 24.5 million votes cast in Friday's election, Pezeshkian got 10.4 million while Jalili received 9.4 million, election spokesman Mohsen Eslami announced. Parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf got 3.3 million, while Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 206,000 votes.\n\nIranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50% of all votes cast. If not, the race's top two candidates advance to a runoff a week later. There's been only one other runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nAs has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors.\n\nThere were signs of the wider disenchantment of the public with the vote. More than 1 million votes were voided, according to the results, typically a sign of people feeling obligated to cast a ballot but not wanting to select any of the candidates.\n\nThe overall turnout was 39.9%, according to the results. The 2021 presidential election that elected Raisi saw a 48.8% turnout, while the March parliamentary election saw a 40.6% turnout.\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, has also refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere's also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. In a documentary on the reformist candidate aired by state TV, one woman said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\" of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nJalili, once described by CIA director Bill Burns as \"stupefyingly opaque\" in negotiations, likely would have won outright had the three hard-liners not split Friday's vote. Jalili is known as the \"Living Martyr\" after losing a leg in the 1980s Iran-Iraq war and is famous among Western diplomats for his haranguing lectures and hard-line stances.\n\nQalibaf, a former general in Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and head of Iran's police, had been thought to have a wider power base, despite being plagued by corruption allegations and his role in past violent crackdowns.\n\nHe quickly endorsed Jalili in conceding the result and criticized Pezeshkian for allying himself with President Hassan Rouhani and his former foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif. The two reached Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which later collapsed after then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the accord.\n\n\"The road is not over yet, and despite the fact that I respect Mr. Dr. Pezeshkian personally, ... I ask all the revolutionary forces and my supporters to help stop the wave that is causing an important part of our economic and political problems today,\" Qalibaf said in a statement.\n\nNow the question becomes whether Pezeshkian will be able to draw voters into his campaign. On Election Day, he offered comments on outreach to the West after voting seemingly aimed at drumming up turnout for his campaign -- even after being targeted by a veiled warning from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\n\"Pezeshkian has been a generally underwhelming candidate,\" the geopolitical consultancy Eurasia Group said in an analysis before Friday's vote. \"Should he qualify for a runoff, his position would weaken as the conservative voting bloc unites behind a single candidate.\"\n\nRaisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Khamenei and a potential successor. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\nFriday's vote saw only one reported attack around the election. Gunmen opened fire on a van transporting ballot boxes in the restive southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, killing two police officers and wounding others, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. The province regularly sees violence between security forces and the militant group Jaish al-Adl, as well as drug traffickers.\n\nThe runoff election comes as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. In April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel.

Iranians were voting Friday in a snap election to replace the late President Ebrahim Raisi, killed in a helicopter crash last month, as public apathy has become pervasive in the Islamic Republic after years of economic woes, mass protests and tensions in the Middle East.\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Iran will hold a runoff presidential election to replace the late hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi, an official said Saturday, after an initial vote saw the top candidates not securing an outright win.\n\nThe election this coming Friday will pit reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian against the hard-line former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili.\n\nMohsen Eslami, an election spokesman, announced the result in a news conference carried by Iranian state television. He said of 24.5 million votes cast, Pezeshkian got 10.4 million while Jalili received 9.4 million. Parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf got 3.3 million. Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 206,000 votes.\n\nIranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50% of all votes cast. If not, the race's top two candidates will advance to a runoff a week later. There's been only one runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nEslami acknowledged the country's Guardian Council would need to offer formal approval, but the result did not draw any immediate challenge from contenders in the race.\n\nAs has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors.\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, has also refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere's also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. In a documentary on the reformist candidate aired by state TV, one woman said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\" of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nRaisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and a potential successor. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\nThe voting came as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region -- such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels -- are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Republic continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build -- should it choose to do so -- several nuclear weapons.\n\nDespite the recent unrest, there was only one reported attack around the election. Gunmen opened fire on a van transporting ballot boxes in the restive southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, killing two police officers and wounding others, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. The province regularly sees violence between security forces and the militant group Jaish al-Adl, as well as drug traffickers.\n\nVahdat reported from Tehran, Iran.

Majid Asgaripour/WANA (West Asia News Agency) via REUTERS\n\nA moderate lawmaker will face Iran supreme leader's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in a run-off presidential election on Jul 5 after the country's interior ministry said on Saturday that no candidate secured enough votes in the first round of voting.\n\nFriday's vote to replace Ebrahim Raisi after his death in a helicopter crash came down to a tight race between a low-profile lawmaker Massoud Pezeshkian, the sole moderate in a field of four candidates, and former Revolutionary Guards member Saeed Jalili.\n\nThe interior ministry said neither secured the 50 percent plus one vote of over 25 million ballots cast required to win outright, with Pezeshkian leading with over 10 million votes ahead of Jalili with over 9.4 million votes.\n\nPower in Iran ultimately lies with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, so the result will not herald any major policy shift on Iran's nuclear programme or its support for militia groups across the Middle East.\n\nBut the president runs the government day-to-day and can influence the tone of Iran's policy.\n\nThe clerical establishment hoped for a high turnout as it faces a legitimacy crisis fuelled by public discontent over economic hardship and curbs on political and social freedom. However, turnout in Friday's vote hit a historic low of about 40 percent, based on interior ministry count released on Saturday.\n\nThe election comes at a time of escalating regional tension due to the war between Israel and Iranian allies Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as increased Western pressure on Iran over its fast-advancing nuclear programme.\n\nWith Iran's supreme leader now 85, it is likely that the next president will be closely involved in the process of choosing a successor to Khamenei, who seeks a fiercely loyal president who can ensure a smooth eventual succession to his own position, insiders and analysts say.\n\nAnti-Western views of Jalili, Iran's former uncompromising nuclear negotiator, offer a contrast to those of Pezeshkian. Analysts said Jalili's win would signal the possibility of an even more antagonistic turn in the Islamic Republic's foreign and domestic policy.\n\nBut a victory for mild-mannered lawmaker Pezeshkian might help ease tensions with the West, improve chances of economic reform, social liberalisation and political pluralism.\n\nPezeshkian, faithful to Iran's theocratic rule, is backed by the reformist faction that has largely been sidelined in Iran in recent years.\n\n\"We will respect the hijab law, but there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behaviour toward women,\" Pezeshkian said after casting his vote.\n\nHe was referring to the death of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman, in 2022 while in morality police custody for allegedly violating the mandatory Islamic dress code.\n\nThe unrest sparked by Amini's death spiralled into the biggest show of opposition to Iran's clerical rulers in years.", "source": {"uri": "bdnews24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "bdnews24.com"},

Two hardline candidates subsequently dropped out.\n\nLimited choices\n\nThree candidates are hardliners and one is a low-profile comparative moderate, backed by the reformist faction that has largely been sidelined in Iran in recent years.\n\nA source close to Pezeshkian had earlier told Reuters that 'so far, from the votes counted in small towns and villages, Pezeshkian is ahead of his rivals.'\n\nProminent among the remaining hardliners are Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, parliament speaker and former commander of the powerful Revolutionary Guards, and Jalili, who served for four years in Khamenei's office.\n\nAn Iranian man votes at a polling station in Tehran, Iran, during a snap presidential election to choose a successor to Ebrahim Raisi following Raisi's death in a helicopter crash, June 28, 2024.\n\nCritics of Iran's clerical rule say that low turnouts in recent years show the system's legitimacy has eroded. Turnout was 48% in the 2021 presidential election and a record low of 41% in a parliamentary election in March.\n\n'Based on unconfirmed reports, the election is very likely heading to a second round. Based on the votes counted so far, Jalili and Pezeshkian will compete in a run-off election,' Tasnim reported.\n\nIf no candidate wins at least 50% plus one vote from all ballots cast, including blank votes, a run-off between the top two candidates is held on the first Friday after the result is declared.\n\nAll four candidates have vowed to revive the flagging economy, beset by mismanagement, state corruption and sanctions re-imposed since 2018, after the United States ditched Tehran's 2015 nuclear pact with six world powers.\n\n'I think Jalili is the only candidate who raised the issue of justice, fighting corruption and giving value to the poor. ... Most importantly, he does not link Iran's foreign policy to the nuclear deal,' said Farzan, a 45-year-old artist in the city of Karaj.\n\nDivided voters\n\nPezeshkian is faithful to Iran's theocratic rule, but advocates detente with the West, economic reform, social liberalization and political pluralism.\n\n'We will respect the hijab law, but there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behavior toward women,' Pezeshkian said after casting his vote.\n\nHe was referring to the death of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman, in 2022 while in morality police custody for allegedly violating the mandatory Islamic dress code.\n\nThe unrest sparked by Amini's death spiraled into the biggest show of opposition to Iran's clerical rulers in years.\n\nPezeshkian's chances hinge on reviving the enthusiasm of reform-minded voters who have largely stayed away from the polls for the last four years as a mostly youthful population chafes at political and social curbs. He could also benefit from his rivals' failure to consolidate the hardline vote.\n\n'I feel Pezeshkian represents both traditional and liberal thoughts,' said architect Pirouz, 45, who said he had planned to boycott the vote until he learned more about Pezeshkian's plans.\n\nIn the past few weeks, Iranians have made wide use of the hashtag #ElectionCircus on X, with some activists at home and abroad calling for a boycott, saying a high turnout would only serve to legitimize the Islamic Republic.\n\n'The youth were punished ... young girls were killed on the streets. ... We can't easily move on from that. ... After all that happened, it's unconscionable to vote,' said 55-year-old writer Shahrzad Afrasheh.\n\nIn the 2022-2023 protests, more than 500 people including 71 minors were killed, hundreds were injured and thousands arrested, rights groups said.\n\nReuters is a news agency founded in 1851 and owned by the Thomson Reuters Corporation based in Toronto, Canada.

He served as health minister under Iran's last reformist president Mohammad Khatami, who held office from 1997 to 2005 and has endorsed Pezeshkian's bid in the current elections.\n\nMeanwhile, Jalili is a former nuclear negotiator and held several senior positions in the country, including in Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's office in the early 2000s.\n\nHe is currently one of Khamenei's representatives in the Supreme National Security Council -- Iran's highest security body.\n\nAs per Eslami, parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf received about 3,383,340 votes and Mostafa Pourmohammadi had 206,397 votes.\n\nOut of around 61 million eligible voters, some 24,500,000 voters headed to the polls, he added, with a turnout of around 40% -- the lowest yet in the history of the country.\n\nOut of Iran's 13 previous presidential elections since the 1979 revolution, only one has led to runoffs in 2005.\n\nThe Guardian Council, which vets electoral candidates had originally approved six contenders.\n\nBut a day ahead of the election, two candidates Tehran Mayor Alireza Zakani and Raisi's vice president Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi dropped out of the race.\n\nA pressing challenge faced by all the candidates is how they would tackle the prevailing economic woes of the people who are finding it difficult to make ends meet.\n\nThe next president is not expected to usher in any major policy shift on Iran's nuclear programme or support for militia groups across the Middle East, since Khamenei calls all the shots on top state matters.\n\nHowever, the president runs the government day-to-day and can influence the tone of Iran's foreign and domestic policy.\n\nA hardline watchdog body made up of six clerics and six jurists aligned with Khamenei vets candidates.

If not, the race's top two candidates will advance to a run-off a week later.\n\nThere has been only one run-off presidential election in Iran's history - in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad beat former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nMr Eslami acknowledged the country's Guardian Council would need to offer formal approval, but the result did not draw any immediate challenge from contenders in the race.\n\nAs has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognised monitors.\n\nThere were signs of the wider disenchantment of the public with the vote.\n\nMore than one million votes were voided, according to the results, typically a sign of people feeling obligated to cast a ballot but not wanting to select any of the candidates.\n\nThe overall turnout was 39.9%, according to the results.\n\nThe 2021 presidential election that elected Mr Raisi saw a 42% turnout, while the March parliamentary election saw a 41% turnout.\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, has also refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere has also been criticism that Mr Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate.\n\nIn a documentary on the reformist candidate aired by state TV, one woman said her generation was \"moving towards the same level\" of animosity with the government that Mr Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nMr Raisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a protege of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and a potential successor.\n\nStill, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing of the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\nThe voting came as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region - such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels - are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Republic continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build - should it choose to do so - several nuclear weapons.\n\nDespite the recent unrest, there was only one reported attack around the election.", "source": {"uri": "andoveradvertiser.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Andover Advertiser"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Rubin and Russell Goldman New York Times\n\nA reformist candidate critical of many of the Iranian government's policies, including the mandatory headscarf law, will compete next week against a hard-line conservative in a runoff election for the country's presidency, Iran's interior ministry announced Saturday. The runoff follows a special vote called after the death last month of the previous leader, Ebrahim Raisi, in a helicopter crash.\n\nA second round of voting, which will pit reformist Masoud Pezeshkian against Saeed Jalili, an ultraconservative former nuclear negotiator, will take place July 5. The runoff was in part the result of low voter turnout and a field of three main candidates, two of whom competed for the conservative vote. Iranian law requires a winner to receive more than 50% of all votes cast.\n\nThe majority of Iranians, 60%, according to the interior ministry, did not vote Friday, in what analysts and aides to the candidates said was largely an act of protest against the government for ignoring their demands for meaningful change.\n\nA prominent Iranian economist, Siamak Ghassemi, said on social media that voters were sending a clear message. \"In one of the most competitive presidential elections, where reformists and conservatives came to the field with all their might, a 60% majority of Iranians are through with reformist and conservatives.\"\n\nIran is facing multiple challenges, from domestic turmoil to international tensions. Its economy is cratering under punishing Western sanctions, its citizens' freedoms are increasingly curtailed and its foreign policy is largely shaped by hardline leaders.\n\nThe campaign, which initially included six candidates -- five conservatives and one reformist -- was notable for how candidly those issues were discussed and a public willingness to attack the status quo. In speeches, televised debates and round-table discussions, the candidates criticized government policies and ridiculed rosy official assessments of Iran's economic prospects as harmful delusions.\n\nPublic dissatisfaction in any new president's ability to bring change was reflected in the paltry turnout, a historic low for presidential elections and even less than the reported level of 41% in parliamentary elections this year. The low totals will be a blow to the country's governing clerics, who made voter participation a marker of the vote's perceived legitimacy and had hoped to achieve a 50% turnout.\n\nIn the official results announced Saturday, Pezeshkian led with 10.4 million votes (42.4%), followed by Jalili at 9.4 million (38.6%). A third conservative candidate, Mohammad Baqer Ghalibaf, the current speaker of parliament and former mayor of Tehran, was a distant third at 3.3 million (13.8%).\n\nIt remains unclear whether a runoff between two candidates representing different ends of the political spectrum will inspire more voters to come out, when large numbers of Iranians see the candidates as part of a system they want to reject wholesale.\n\n\"This is going to be a very difficult and challenging week,\" Mohammad Mobin, an analyst in Tehran who worked on the campaign of Pezeshkian, said Saturday. \"To get voters out we have to be strategic.\" He added, speaking about the conservatives, \"People think there is no difference between us and them.\"\n\nSimple math would seem to indicate that Jalili would surpass 50% if he picked up Ghailibaf's votes. But in earlier polling, many of those voting for Ghalibaf said they would not support Jalili. And Pezeshkian might pick up votes from those dreading the prospect of a Jalili presidency.\n\nIn a neighborhood in north Tehran on Saturday, a group of men discussed the election results, and the prospects for the runoff, over coffee. Farzad Jafari, 36, predicted a higher turnout in the next vote. He and others also debated whether Jalili would be able to unite the conservative vote in a head-to-head contest, or if even more voters would emerge to back the reformist option offered by Pezeshkian.\n\nJafari said he thought many of those who, like him, sat out Friday's voting might well be drawn back for the runoff. \"I did not want to vote at all because they excluded those who should've been in the race, they were mostly reformers\" he said. \"But more people will vote next time in the next round and those who cast a blank vote, or who didn't vote will come.\"\n\nBesides domestic pressures, Iran's leaders are also facing an especially volatile time in the region: Israel's war in the Gaza Strip against Hamas, an Iranian-backed militant group, and an escalation in skirmishes between Israel and Hezbollah pit two of Iran's proxy forces against Israel, its sworn enemy.\n\nDespite the critical rhetoric of the campaign, the candidates were all members of the Iranian political establishment, approved to run by a committee of Islamic clerics and jurists. All but one, Pezeshkian, were considered conservatives close to the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nJalili is likely the candidate closest to Khamenei. He leads the ultra-right-wing Paydari party and represents the country's most hard-line ideological views when it comes to domestic and foreign policy. Jalili has said he does not believe Iran needs to negotiate with the United States for economic success.\n\nPezeshkian is a cardiac surgeon and veteran of the Iran-Iraq war who served in parliament and as Iran's health minister. After his wife died in a car accident, he raised his children as a single father and never remarried. This and his identity as an Azeri, one of Iran's ethnic minorities, has endeared him to many voters.\n\nPezeshkian was endorsed by a former reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, and he has expressed openness to nuclear negotiations with the West, framing the debate as an economic issue with the ultimate aim of escaping economic sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\n\nAfter a bitter public spat, Ghalibaf issued a statement Saturday endorsing Jalili and asked his voters to do the same to ensure victory for the conservative camp.\n\nBy stacking the deck to increase the chances of a conservative's victory, Khamenei signaled his desire for a second in command whose outlook mirrored his own and who would continue the hard-line agenda of Raisi.\n\nThe low voter turnout reflected widespread apathy among Iranians, whose frustration has been intensified by the government's violent crackdowns on protesters demanding change and its inadequate response to the toll that decades of sanctions have wreaked on the country's economy, shrinking Iranians' purchasing power.\n\nThe most recent anti-government demonstrations -- and an ensuing crackdown -- were prompted largely by the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini, who died in police custody after being detained for incorrectly wearing her mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\nIn a nod to the unpopularity of the hijab law, the candidates all sought to distance themselves from the methods the country's morality police use to enforce it, which include violence, arrests and fines.\n\nAlthough a new president could soften the enforcement of the headscarf mandate -- as Khatami and a moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, did in their terms in office -- it is unlikely that the law would be annulled.\n\nThat is largely because Iran is a theocracy with parallel systems of governance, in which elected bodies are supervised by appointed councils made up of Islamic clerics and jurists. And major state policies on nuclear, military and foreign affairs are decided by the country's supreme leader, Khamenei.\n\nThe president's role is focused on domestic policy and economic matters, but it is still an influential position. Rouhani, for example, played an active role in forging the 2015 deal with the Western powers in which Iran agreed to scale back its nuclear program in exchange for the easing of sanctions.\n\nThe Trump administration withdrew the United States from that deal in 2018, and Iran has since returned to enriching uranium. Beyond tensions over Tehran's nuclear program, the United States and Iran have in the past year come increasingly close to a direct confrontation as they compete for influence across the Middle East.\n\nIn Gaza, the war between Israel, a U.S. ally, and Hamas has drawn the United States, Iran and Iran's foreign proxies into closer conflict. Iran sees its use of these groups as a way of extending its power, but many citizens, particularly in the cities, see little value in their leaders' strategy and believe the economy will recover only through sustained diplomacy and the lifting of sanctions.\n\n\"We are in a Third World country and we are sitting on top of so much wealth,\" said Vahid Arafati, 38, a coffee shop owner in Tehran, after he voted Friday. \"For instance the Arab states are getting benefits from their wealth, but with our politics we cannot get anything.\"\n\nAsked why he voted if he did not expect much change, he said, \"Maybe I have a little hope.\" After a pause, he added: \"Isn't it good to have a little hope?\"", "source": {"uri": "spokesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Spokesman Review"},

Stringer/WANA (West Asia News Agency) via REUTERS\n\nBy Parisa Hafezi\n\nDUBAI (Reuters) -A moderate lawmaker will face Iran supreme leader's protege in a run-off presidential election on July 5 after the country's interior ministry said on Saturday that no candidate secured enough votes in the first round of voting.\n\nFriday's vote to replace Ebrahim Raisi after his death in a helicopter crash came down to a tight race between a low-profile lawmaker Massoud Pezeshkian, the sole moderate in a field of four candidates, and former Revolutionary Guards member Saeed Jalili.\n\nThe interior ministry said neither secured the 50% plus one vote of over 25 million ballots cast required to win outright, with Pezeshkian leading with over 10 million votes ahead of Jalili with over 9.4 million votes.\n\nPower in Iran ultimately lies with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, so the result will not herald any major policy shift on Iran's nuclear programme or its support for militia groups across the Middle East.\n\nBut the president runs the government day-to-day and can influence the tone of Iran's policy.\n\nThe clerical establishment hoped for a high turnout as it faces a legitimacy crisis fuelled by public discontent over economic hardship and curbs on political and social freedom. However, turnout in Friday's vote hit a historic low of about 40%, based on interior ministry count released on Saturday.\n\nThe election comes at a time of escalating regional tension due to the war between Israel and Iranian allies Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as increased Western pressure on Iran over its fast-advancing nuclear programme.\n\nWith Iran's supreme leader now 85, it is likely that the next president will be closely involved in the process of choosing a successor to Khamenei, who seeks a fiercely loyal president who can ensure a smooth eventual succession to his own position, insiders and analysts say.\n\nAnti-Western views of Jalili, Iran's former uncompromising nuclear negotiator, offer a contrast to those of Pezeshkian. Analysts said Jalili's win would signal the possibility of an even more antagonistic turn in the Islamic Republic's foreign and domestic policy.\n\nBut a victory for mild-mannered lawmaker Pezeshkian might help ease tensions with the West, improve chances of economic reform, social liberalisation and political pluralism.\n\nPezeshkian, faithful to Iran's theocratic rule, is backed by the reformist faction that has largely been sidelined in Iran in recent years.\n\n\"We will respect the hijab law, but there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behaviour toward women,\" Pezeshkian said after casting his vote.\n\nHe was referring to the death of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman, in 2022 while in morality police custody for allegedly violating the mandatory Islamic dress code.\n\nThe unrest sparked by Amini's death spiralled into the biggest show of opposition to Iran's clerical rulers in years.\n\n(Writing by Parisa HafeziEditing by Tomasz Janowski)\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE

He said of 24.5 million votes cast, Pezeshkian got 10.4 million while Jalili received 9.4 million. Parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf got 3.3 million. Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 206,000 votes.\n\nIranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50% of all votes cast. If not, the race's top two candidates will advance to a runoff a week later. There's been only one runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nEslami acknowledged the country's Guardian Council would need to offer formal approval, but the result did not draw any immediate challenge from contenders in the race.\n\nAs has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors.\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, has also refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere's also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. In a documentary on the reformist candidate aired by state TV, one woman said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\" of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nRaisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and a potential successor. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\nThe voting came as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region -- such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels -- are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Republic continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build -- should it choose to do so -- several nuclear weapons.\n\nDespite the recent unrest, there was only one reported attack around the election. Gunmen opened fire on a van transporting ballot boxes in the restive southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, killing two police officers and wounding others, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. The province regularly sees violence between security forces and the militant group Jaish al-Adl, as well as drug traffickers.\n\nVahdat reported from Tehran, Iran.

If not, the race's top two candidates will advance to a run-off a week later.\n\nThere has been only one run-off presidential election in Iran's history - in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad beat former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nMr Eslami acknowledged the country's Guardian Council would need to offer formal approval, but the result did not draw any immediate challenge from contenders in the race.\n\nAs has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognised monitors.\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, has also refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere has also been criticism that Mr Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate.\n\nIn a documentary on the reformist candidate aired by state TV, one woman said her generation was \"moving towards the same level\" of animosity with the government that Mr Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nMr Raisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a protege of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and a potential successor.\n\nStill, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing of the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\nThe voting came as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region - such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels - are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Republic continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build - should it choose to do so - several nuclear weapons.\n\nDespite the recent unrest, there was only one reported attack around the election.", "source": {"uri": "breakingnews.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breaking News.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The unexpected election follows the tragic death of President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month, prompting the early vote initially scheduled for 2025.\n\n\"None of the candidates could garner the absolute majority of the votes, therefore, the first and second contenders who got the most votes will be referred to the Guardian Council for the second round,\" announced Interior Ministry spokesperson Mohsen Eslami.\n\nThe elections took place during a period of heightened regional tension, with conflicts involving Israeli forces and Iranian allies Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as intensified Western scrutiny over Iran's rapidly advancing nuclear program.\n\nWith more than 24 million votes counted, moderate lawmaker Massoud Pezeshkian led with over 10 million votes, while hardline diplomat Saeed Jalili followed closely with over 9.4 million votes, according to the interior ministry's statement on Saturday.\n\nThe run-off will see Pezeshkian and Jalili vying for the presidency as the leading candidates from Friday's polls.\n\n**Candidates' Profiles**\n\n**Massoud Pezeshkian**, 69, is a heart surgeon who has represented the northern city of Tabriz in parliament since 2008. He previously served as health minister under Iran's last reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, who was in office from 1997 to 2005. Khatami has endorsed Pezeshkian's bid in the current elections.\n\n**Saeed Jalili** is a former nuclear negotiator who has held several senior positions, including roles in Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's office in the early 2000s. He currently serves as one of Khamenei's representatives in the Supreme National Security Council, Iran's highest security body.\n\nAccording to Eslami, other candidates received significantly fewer votes, with parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf receiving about 3,383,340 votes and Mostafa Pourmohammadi garnering 206,397 votes.\n\nOut of around 61 million eligible voters, approximately 24,500,000 participated in the election, marking a turnout of around 40% -- the lowest in the country's history.\n\n**Election Context and Challenges**\n\nThe run-off will be only the second in Iran's history since the 1979 revolution, with the first occurring in 2005. The Guardian Council, which vets electoral candidates, had initially approved six contenders. However, a day before the election, two candidates, Tehran Mayor Alireza Zakani and Raisi's vice president Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi, withdrew from the race.\n\nA significant challenge for all candidates is addressing the severe economic issues facing the nation. Many Iranians are struggling to make ends meet amidst economic sanctions and internal economic mismanagement.\n\nWhile the next president is not expected to make significant changes to Iran's nuclear policy or its support for regional militia groups, as these are dictated by Khamenei, they will influence the tone of Iran's foreign and domestic policy through the daily administration of the government.\n\nThe Guardian Council, a body composed of six clerics and six jurists aligned with Khamenei, plays a critical role in the electoral process, approving a limited number of candidates from an initial pool of 80.\n\nAs Iran prepares for the decisive run-off election, the nation and the international community watch closely to see how the new leadership will navigate the numerous challenges facing the country.", "source": {"uri": "chiangraitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTN News l Chiang Rai Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Former nuclear negotiator Jalili trailed with 9.4 million votes.\n\nConservative parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, who garnered 3.3 million votes, and conservative Islamic leader Mostafa Pourmohammadi, with 206,397 votes, are out of the race. Two other candidates, Tehran Mayor Alireza Zakani and government official Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi, withdrew.\n\nThe election on Friday was called within the 50 days mandated by the constitution to select a new president following the death of Ebrahim Raisi and seven others, including Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, in a helicopter crash on May 19.\n\nLike all major elections in the past four years, Friday's vote saw low turnout, but the final figure was much lower than the 45 to 53 percent suggested by polls.\n\nA higher turnout is expected in the July 5 runoff, presenting a clearer choice between two opposing camps.\n\nPezeshkian, a prominent politician and former health minister, is backed by former centrist and reformist presidents and other top figures. He has promised to lift sanctions by restoring the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and to bridge the widening gap between the people and the establishment.\n\nJalili, a senior member of the Supreme National Security Council, has pledged to reduce inflation to single digits, boost economic growth to 8 percent, and combat corruption and mismanagement.\n\nPezeshkian was the only moderate among the six candidates approved to run by the Guardian Council, the constitutional body that vets all candidates. His supporters present him not as a miracle worker but as someone who could make incremental improvements while claiming that a Jalili victory would signal a significant backslide.\n\nJalili is known for his role in nuclear negotiations in the late 2000s and early 2010s, which led to Iran's global isolation and the imposition of United Nations Security Council sanctions. He has long sought the presidency, blaming Pezeshkian's camp for compromising Iran's nuclear program as part of the 2015 accord, which then-U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned in 2018.\n\nAccusing his opponent of inefficiency, Jalili and other conservatives argue that a Pezeshkian victory would mark a continuation of the policies of former centrist President Hassan Rouhani.", "source": {"uri":

If not, the race's top two candidates will advance to a runoff a week later.\n\nIran will hold a runoff presidential election to replace the late hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi, an official said on Saturday, after an initial vote saw the top candidates not securing an outright win.\n\nThe election this Friday will see reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian facing off against hard-line former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili.\n\nThe results were announced during a news conference, broadcasted on Iranian state television by Mohsen Eslami, an election spokesman.\n\nPezeshkian took the lead receiving 10.4 million of the 24.5 million votes cast. While Jalili got 9.4 million, Parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf garnered 3.3 million, and Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi secured over 206,000 votes.\n\nIn Iran, the law says that a candidate must secure over 50% of all votes cast to win. If that requirement is not met, the two top candidates will proceed to a runoff the following week.\n\nHistorically Iran has only had one runoff, in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad defeated former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nHowever, once the new leader chosen the country's Guardian Council, an appointed and constitutionally mandated 12-member council, would need to formally approve the results, but according to Eslami there were no immediate challenges from any contenders.\n\nThe interior ministry reported the turnout was 40 percent which, if correct, makes it the lowest figure since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.\n\nThe figure is another indication that many Iranians remain disenchanted with the lack of democracy in their country, with women in particular suffering from a lack of basic freedoms.\n\nOne well known Iranian activist posted video of what she said was the violent arrest of a woman, simply for not wearing her hijab in the authorised way.\n\nWomen and advocates for radical change were barred from running, and the election will have no oversight from internationally recognised monitors.\n\nThere have been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, a leader of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, also refused to vote, according to his daughter.\n\nCritics argue that Pezeshkian represents another government-approved candidate. In a state TV documentary on Pezeshkian, a woman said her generation was developing the same level of animosity towards the government that Pezeshkian's generation felt during the 1979 revolution.\n\nEbrahim Raisi, a key figure in Iranian politics, died in a May 19 helicopter crash along with the country's foreign minister and others. Raisi was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and a potential successor, though he was widely known for his role in the 1988 mass executions and the bloody crackdowns on dissent following protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained for allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory hijab.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType":

However, turnout in Friday's vote hit a historic low of about 40%, based on an interior ministry count released on Saturday.\n\nThe election comes at a time of escalating regional tension due to the war between Israel and Iranian allies Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as increased Western pressure on Iran over its fast-advancing nuclear programme.\n\nWith Iran's supreme leader now 85, it is likely that the next president will be closely involved in the process of choosing a successor to Khamenei, who seeks a fiercely loyal president who can ensure a smooth eventual succession to his own position, insiders and analysts say.\n\nAnti-Western views of Jalili, Iran's former uncompromising nuclear negotiator, offer a contrast to those of Pezeshkian. Analysts said Jalili's win would signal the possibility of an even more antagonistic turn in the Islamic Republic's foreign and domestic policy.\n\nBut a victory for mild-mannered lawmaker Pezeshkian might help ease tensions with the West, improve chances of economic reform, social liberalisation and political pluralism.\n\nPezeshkian, faithful to Iran's theocratic rule, is backed by the reformist faction that has largely been sidelined in Iran in recent years.\n\n\"We will respect the hijab law, but there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behaviour toward women,\" Pezeshkian said after

Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had more than 95,000 votes.\n\nVoters faced a choice between the three hard-line candidates and the little-known reformist Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon. As has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors.\n\nThe voting came as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region -- such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels -- are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.",

He said that out of 24.5 million votes cast, Pezeshkian received 10.4 million and Jalili 9.4 million. The speaker of the parliament, Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, received 3.3 million. Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 206,000 votes.\n\nIranian law requires a winner to receive more than 50% of all votes cast. If not, the two top contenders will go to a runoff a week later. There has only been one presidential runoff in Iran's history: in 2005, when hardline Mahmoud Ahmadinejad defeated former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nEslami acknowledged that the country's Defense Council would have to offer formal approval, but the result did not prompt any immediate challenge from contenders in the race.\n\nAs has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change are barred from running, and the vote itself will not be overseen by internationally recognized observers.\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including by imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests, who remains under house arrest, has also refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere has also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another candidate endorsed by the government. In a documentary on the reformist candidate aired on state TV, one woman said her generation was moving toward the same level of hostility toward the government that Pezeshke's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nRaisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and a potential successor. However, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran carried out in 1988 and for his role in the bloody crackdown on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman arrested by police for allegedly was improperly wearing the mandatory clothing. headscarf, or hijab.\n\nThe vote came as wider tensions grip the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn April, Iran launched its first direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region, such as Lebanon's Hezbollah rebels and Yemen's Houthi rebels, have engaged in fighting and escalated their attacks. .\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Republic continues to enrich uranium to near-weapons-grade levels and maintains a large enough stockpile to build several nuclear weapons if it decides to do so.\n\nDespite the recent unrest, there was only one reported attack around the election. Gunmen opened fire on a van carrying ballot boxes in the restive southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, killing two police officers and wounding others, state news agency IRNA reported. The province regularly sees violence between security forces and the Jaish al-Adl militant group, as well as drug traffickers.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Voters chose between the three hard-line candidates and the little-known reformist Mr Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon.\n\nAs has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, and the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognised monitors.\n\nIranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50% of all votes cast.\n\nThere's been only one runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nThe late president Mr Raisi died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others.\n\nHe was seen as a protege of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and a potential successor.\n\nStill, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988 and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the

Out of 60 million eligible voters, 24 million cast their ballots, resulting in a 40% turnout, Eslami said.\n\nThe results will be reviewed by the Guardian Council, the powerful 12-member body tasked with overseeing elections and legislation, before the two candidates start campaigning again.\n\nThe snap election was held after Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi died in a helicopter crash on May 19 in the country's remote northwest, along with Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and other officials.\n\nFour candidates were vying for the country's top elected post after two conservative candidates dropped out of the race just a day before the elections to help the hardline candidates consolidate the conservative vote.\n\nPezeshkian was the only reformist candidate after dozens of other contenders were barred from running by the Guardian Council.\n\nThe elections came at a delicate time for the Islamic Republic. The country is embroiled in escalating tensions with Israel and its Western allies, triggered by the war in Gaza and the advancement of Iran's nuclear program.\n\nThe vote also takes place just two months after Iran and Israel exchanged fire for the first time as the Gaza conflict widened. Israel is now preparing for a potential second front with Hezbollah, Iran's primary regional proxy, in Lebanon.\n\nIran's fight with the US has left the economy in tatters, crippled by years of American sanctions, a weakening local currency and high inflation.\n\nThis was also Iran's first presidential vote since protests swept the nation in 2022 in opposition to the hijab rules and other social issues. The movement was triggered by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in the custody of the notorious morality police after she was detained for not following the country's strict dress code for women.\n\nThe nationwide discontent was evident in low voter turnout in both parliamentary and presidential elections in recent years. While Iran has boasted exceptionally high voter participation, its last legislative election in March recorded the lowest turnout since the Islamic Republic's founding in 1979, despite government efforts to rally voters ahead of the ballot.\n\nThe country's Supreme Leader is the final arbiter for most decisions in Iran, but the elected president will be the face of the Islamic Republic abroad.\n\nThis is a breaking news story.

If not, the race's top two candidates will advance to a run-off a week later.\n\nThere has been only one run-off presidential election in Iran's history - in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad beat former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nMr Eslami acknowledged the country's Guardian Council would need to offer formal approval, but the result did not draw any immediate challenge from contenders in the race.\n\nAs has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognised monitors.\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, has also refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere has also been criticism that Mr Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate.\n\nIn a documentary on the reformist candidate aired by state TV, one woman said her generation was \"moving towards the same level\" of animosity with the government that Mr Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nMr Raisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a protege of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and a potential successor.\n\nStill, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing of the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\nThe voting came as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region - such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels - are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Republic continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build - should it choose to do so - several nuclear weapons.\n\nDespite the recent unrest, there was only one reported attack around the election.", "source": {"uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belfast Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Despite extensive efforts and widespread propaganda by the government to mobilize voters, many Iranians boycotted the election, reflecting a growing disillusionment with the political system.\n\nThe Ministry of Interior reported that more than 24 million votes were cast out of the 61.5 million eligible voters.\n\nCandidates and Results:\n\nMasoud Pezeshkian: Reformist candidate who advocates for more engagement with the West. He received 42.4% of the votes.Saeed Jalili: Ultraright conservative and former nuclear negotiator. He received 38.6% of the votes.Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf: Conservative parliament speaker, secured 13.8%.Mostafa Pourmohammadi: Conservative cleric, got less than 1%. Runoff Election:\n\nAs no candidate secured more than 50% of the vote, a runoff election will be held on July 5. The competition between Pezeshkian and Jalili presents a stark choice for Iranians between a reformist approach and a hardline stance.\n\nLow Engagement and Public Sentiment:\n\nThe historically low turnout has been attributed to widespread dissatisfaction with the regime and the limited choice of candidates. Many Iranians, including political prisoners and civil activists, had declared their refusal to participate in what they termed as \"governmental appointments\" and the \"circus of elections.\" Reports from social media users and images from Iran indicated minimal participation, with 77% of eligible voters in Greater Tehran abstaining from the vote.\n\nKey Issues and Campaigns:\n\nPezeshkian's Platform: Advocates for resuming nuclear talks with Western powers to lift international sanctions. He has criticized the country's economic mismanagement and emphasized the need for pragmatic foreign policy.Jalili's Platform: Opposes compromise on Iran's nuclear program and advocates for a harsher stance against the West. He promises to tackle inflation and boost economic growth. Background Context:\n\nThe election follows the death of President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month. Raisi, a hardline cleric, was viewed as a contender to succeed Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The election is seen as an informal referendum on the Iranian regime, two years after widespread protests calling for its downfall were violently suppressed.\n\nThe upcoming runoff on July 5 will be crucial in determining the direction of Iran's future policies, both domestically and internationally. With such low initial turnout, the engagement level in the runoff will be closely watched as an indicator of public sentiment and legitimacy of the election process.", "source": {"uri":

politician will face the Iranian supreme leader's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in a run-off presidential election on 5 July after the country's interior ministry said that no candidate secured enough votes in the first round of voting.\n\nYesterday's vote to replace Ebrahim Raisi after his death in a helicopter crash came down to a tight race between a low-profile lawmaker Massoud Pezeshkian, the sole moderate in a field of four candidates and former Revolutionary Guards member Saeed Jalili.\n\nInterior Minister Ahmad Vahidi said neither secured the 50% plus one vote of over 25 million ballots cast required to win outright, with Mr Pezeshkian leading with over 10 million votes ahead of Jalili with over 9.4 million votes.\n\nPower in Iran ultimately lies with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, so the result will not herald any major policy shift on Iran's nuclear programme or its support for militia groups across the Middle East.\n\nHowever, the president runs the government day-to-day and can influence the tone of Iran's policy.\n\nThe clerical establishment hoped for a high turnout as it faces a legitimacy crisis fuelled by public discontent over economic hardship and curbs on political and social freedom.\n\nHowever, turnout in the vote hit a historic low of about 40%, based on interior ministry count released earlier.\n\nThe election comes at a time of escalating regional tension due to the war between Israel and Iranian allies Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as increased Western pressure on Iran over its fast-advancing nuclear programme.\n\nWith Iran's supreme leader now 85, it is likely that the next president will be closely involved in the process of choosing a successor to Mr Khamenei, who seeks a fiercely loyal president who can ensure a smooth eventual succession to his own position, insiders and analysts say.\n\nAnti-Western views of Mr Jalili, Iran's former uncompromising nuclear negotiator, offer a contrast to those of Mr Pezeshkian.\n\nAnalysts said Mr Jalili's win would signal the possibility of an even more antagonistic turn in the Islamic Republic's foreign and domestic policy.\n\nBut a victory for mild-mannered Massoud Pezeshkian might help ease tensions with the West, improve chances of economic reform, social liberalisation and political pluralism.\n\nMassoud Pezeshkian, faithful to Iran's theocratic rule, is backed by the reformist faction that has largely been sidelined in Iran in recent years.\n\n\"We will respect the hijab law, but there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behaviour toward women,\" Mr Pezeshkian said after casting his vote.\n\nHe was referring to the death of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman, in 2022 while in morality police custody for allegedly violating the mandatory Islamic dress code.\n\nThe unrest sparked by Amini's death spiralled into the biggest show of opposition to Iran's clerical rulers in years.", "source": {"uri":

Reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian will face off against hard-line former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili this coming Friday.\n\nAccording to Mohsen Eslami, an election spokesman who announced the results in a televised news conference, Pezeshkian garnered 10.4 million votes while Jalili received 9.4 million out of the 24.5 million votes cast. The initial vote failed to secure an outright winner, thus triggering a runoff as mandated by Iranian law.\n\nThis runoff will occur under the shadow of rising tensions in the Middle East, including Iran's first-ever direct attack on Israel in response to the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza.

Jalili is considered close to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and is leading ahead of moderate candidate Massoud Pazeshkian.\n\nSo far, over 10.3 million ballots have been counted in Iran's election in which Jalili has won more than 4.26 million votes and Pazeshkian gained over 4.24 million, according to Interior ministry official Mohsen Eslami. The turnout was around 40 per cent, lower than expected by Iran's clerics and one of the lowest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nIt is important to note that the elections come amid growing public frustration amid economic hardship and restrictions on political and social freedom. Iran is also in the midst of escalating regional tensions due to the war between Israel and Iranian allies Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nIran's presidential election is a contest among a tightly controlled group of three hardline candidates and one low-profile moderate loyal to the supreme leader. Khamenei handles all important state matters like Tehran's nuclear programme or support for militia groups, but the president sets the tone of Iran's domestic and foreign policy and manages day-to-day government actions.\n\nMore than 61 million Iranians over the age of 18 are eligible to vote, with about 18 million of them between 18 to 30. Meanwhile, Iranian activists and opposition groups are distributing the Twitter hashtag #ElectionCircus widely on social media, in a bid for a regime change.\n\nManual counting of ballots means the final result is expected to be announced only in two days after the polls commenced on Friday, though initial figures may come out sooner. If no candidate manages to win at least 50 per cent plus one vote from all ballots cast, including blank votes, a run-off round between the top two candidates will be held on the first Friday after the election result is declared.\n\nThree candidates are hardliners and one is a low-profile comparative moderate, backed by the reformist faction that has largely been sidelined in Iran in recent years. Prominent among the remaining hardliners are Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, parliament speaker and former commander of the powerful Revolutionary Guards, and Saeed Jalili, a former nuclear negotiator who served for four years in Khamenei's office.\n\nThe sole comparative moderate, Massoud Pezeshkian, is faithful to Iran's theocratic rule, but advocates detente with the West, economic reform, social liberalisation and political pluralism. His chances rely on reviving the enthusiasm of reform-minded voters who have largely stayed away from the polls for the last four years after previous pragmatist presidents brought little change. \"We will respect the hijab law, but there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behaviour toward women,\" Pezeshkian said after casting his vote.\n\nBased on preliminary reports, it seems that Jalili and Pezeshkian are heading for a run-off election. Pezeshkian could benefit from his rivals' failure to consolidate the hardline vote. \"We will respect the hijab law, but there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behaviour toward women,\" Pezeshkian said after casting his vote, in an apparent reference to the death of Mahsa Amini, 22, in 2022, which sparked widespread protests in Iran.\n\nA hardline watchdog body called the Guardian Council made up of six clerics and six jurists aligned with Khamenei is tasked with choosing the candidates for the presidential elections. Only six candidates were selected from a pool of 80, and two hardline candidates - Tehran's mayor Alireza Zakani and head of the Martyrs' Foundation Amirhossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi - dropped out of the race on Thursday.\n\n(with inputs from Reuters)", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Another candidate, hard-line speaker of the parliament Mohmmad Bagher Qalibaf, had some 1.38 million votes.

Masoud Pezeshkian is leading the race with 5,354,000 votes, followed by Said Jalili with 4,875,269 votes.\n\nThe people in Iran went to the polls for the 14th term presidential elections. Voting took place in more than 59,000 polling stations across the country. The voting process for the election, which started at 08:00 in the morning, ended at 24:00 local time. After the closing of the ballot boxes in Iran, the vote counting process began.\n\nIn the elections, reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian, conservative candidates Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, former Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council Saeed Jalili, and former Minister of Interior Mostafa Pourmohammadi are competing. Conservative candidates Ali Reza Zakani, the Mayor of Tehran, and Amir Hossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi withdrew from the race \"to ensure unity in the conservative camp\" just hours before the election.\n\nIn order for the candidates to be elected in the first round, they need to receive 50%+1 of the votes. If no candidate exceeds 50%+1 in the first round, the top 2 candidates with the most votes will proceed to the second round, which will be held on July 5th, and the winner of the second round will become the 9th President of the country. The first data on the election results are expected to be announced at midnight, and the final results are expected to be announced this afternoon.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Interior Election Center in Iran, a total of 12,058,843 votes have been counted so far. Looking at the distribution of votes, Pezeshkian is leading the race with 5,354,269 votes, followed by Jalili with 4,875,269 votes. Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf is in third place with 1,620,628 votes, and Mostafa Pourmohammadi is in fourth place with 95,172 votes.\n\nIn a public opinion poll in Iran, reformist candidate Pezeshkian was in the lead with 33.1%, followed by Jalili with 28.8%, and conservative candidate Ghalibaf with 19.1%.\n\nAfter the death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash on May 19th, the 14th term presidential elections were scheduled to be held on June 28th by the Guardian Council.", "source": {"uri": "en.haberler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Haberler.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoud_Pezeshkian", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Masoud Pezeshkian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saeed_Jalili", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saeed Jalili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elections in Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Principlists", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iranian Principlists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Reformists", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iranian Reformists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Interior_(Iran)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Interior (Iran)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Bagher_Ghalibaf", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mostafa_Pourmohammadi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mostafa Pourmohammadi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_National_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme National Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebrahim_Raisi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ebrahim Raisi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardian_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guardian Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of Iran"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://foto.haberler.com/haber/2024/06/29/iran-da-cumhurbaskanligi-secimlerinde-ilk-17469604_3296_o.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692323", "eventUri": "eng-9692323", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-05", "textStart": 1322, "textEnd": 1330}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-19", "textStart": 2190, "textEnd": 2198}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-28", "textStart": 2266, "textEnd": 2275}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 111,900 votes.\n\nVoters faced a choice between the three hard-line candidates and the little-known reformist Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon. As has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors.\n\nThe voting came as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region -- such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels -- are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build -- should it choose to do so -- several nuclear weapons.\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains in house arrest, also has refused to vote with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere's also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. One woman in a documentary on Pezeshkian aired by state TV said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\" of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nIranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50% of all votes cast. If that doesn't happen, the race's top two candidates will advance to a runoff a week later. There's been only one runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nThe 63-year-old Raisi died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and a potential successor. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\nDespite the recent unrest, there was only one reported attack around the election. Gunmen opened fire on a van transporting ballot boxes in the restive southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, killing two police officers and wounding others, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. The province regularly sees violence between security forces and the militant group Jaish al-Adl, as well as drug traffickers.", "source": {"uri": "mb.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manila

Masoud Pezeshkian, a cardiac surgeon, secured almost 10.5 million votes. He will face off against ultraconservative Saeed Jalili, a former chief nuclear negotiator with just under 9.5 million votes.\n\nOf about 60 million eligible voters in Iran, 24 million people cast their ballot Friday, putting turnout at around 40 percent -- a historic low. Iran's parliamentary speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf came in third place with about 3 million votes.\n\nThe runoff will be held next Friday, July 5, when Iranians will choose between Pezeshkian and Jalili. Iran's influential Guardian Council, an unelected body of jurists and theologians, will review the results before the top two candidates start campaigning again.\n\nIt appears that the conservative vote was split, allowing a reformist to receive the largest share of votes. Two other conservative candidates withdrew from the election days before the vote, but Jalili and Ghalibaf resisted calls for one to step aside. It is unclear if Ghalibaf will give Jalili his endorsement.\n\nMany predicted that the vote would go to a runoff. But some analysts said Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei probably wanted to avoid such an eventuality, due to concerns that a second round of voting could inject additional uncertainty into the process.\n\nFor Iran's ruling clerics, a smooth, predictable electoral process with high voter turnout is important for the regime's stability and legitimacy.\n\nIn the days leading up to the election, Khamenei called on Iranians to vote. \"The continuity of the Islamic republic depends on people's turnout and participation,\" Khamenei told reporters Friday after he cast his ballot as polls opened across the country.\n\nInstead, there appears to have been low turnout, motivated by a mix of apathy and opposition to Iran's clerical rulers. Many Iranians said they would not vote because they don't believe elections have the power to influence policy, while others said they were disillusioned with a government that has failed to improve their daily lives.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "susannah_george@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Susannah George", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saeed_Jalili", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saeed Jalili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Reformists", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iranian Reformists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoud_Pezeshkian", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Masoud Pezeshkian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Bagher_Ghalibaf", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_peoples", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iranian peoples"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebrahim_Raisi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ebrahim Raisi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Two-round system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardian_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guardian Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faq\u012bh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Faq\u012bh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Khamenei", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ali Khamenei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Leader of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic republic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Zoroastrianism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Zoroastrianism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XXIUWDPOON5K2N3BCVAG6HTOA4_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692323", "eventUri": "eng-9692323", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-05", "textStart": 711, "textEnd": 717}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Friday's vote to replace Ebrahim Raisi after his death in a helicopter crash came down to a tight race between a low-profile lawmaker Massoud Pezeshkian, the sole moderate in a field of four candidates, and former Revolutionary Guards member Saeed Jalili.\n\nThe interior ministry said neither secured the 50% plus one vote of over 25 million ballots cast required to win outright, with Pezeshkian leading with over 10 million votes ahead of Jalili with over 9.4 million votes. Power in Iran ultimately lies with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, so the result will not herald any major policy shift on Iran's nuclear programme or its support for militia groups across the Middle East.\n\nBut the president runs the government day-to-day and can influence the tone of Iran's policy. The clerical establishment hoped for a high turnout as it faces a legitimacy crisis fuelled by public discontent over economic hardship and curbs on political and social freedom. However, turnout in Friday's vote hit a historic low of about 40%, based on interior ministry count released on Saturday.\n\nThe election comes at a time of escalating regional tension due to the war between Israel and Iranian allies Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as increased Western pressure on Iran over its fast-advancing nuclear programme. With Iran's supreme leader now 85, it is likely that the next president will be closely involved in the process of choosing a successor to Khamenei, who seeks a fiercely loyal president who can ensure a smooth eventual succession to his own position, insiders and analysts say.\n\nAnti-Western views of Jalili, Iran's former uncompromising nuclear negotiator, offer a contrast to those of Pezeshkian. Analysts said Jalili's win would signal the possibility of an even more antagonistic turn in the Islamic Republic's foreign and domestic policy. But a victory for mild-mannered lawmaker Pezeshkian might help ease tensions with the West, improve chances of economic reform, social liberalisation and political pluralism.\n\nPezeshkian, faithful to Iran's theocratic rule, is backed by the reformist faction that has largely been sidelined in Iran in recent years. \"We will respect the hijab law, but there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behaviour toward women,\" Pezeshkian said after casting his vote.\n\nHe was referring to the death of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman, in 2022 while in morality police custody for allegedly violating the mandatory Islamic dress code. The unrest sparked by Amini's death spiralled into the biggest show of opposition to Iran's clerical rulers in years.\n\n(Writing by Parisa Hafezi Editing by Tomasz Janowski)\n\n(This story has not

Some opponents, particularly from the Iranian diaspora, had called for a boycott of the elections.\n\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest office in the Islamic Republic's political and religious structure, had on Friday encouraged voters to take the ballot seriously and participate in it.\n\nDuring the 2021 presidential election, in which no reformist or moderate candidate had been allowed to run, the abstention rate reached 51%, which was a record at the time.\n\nThe elections had to be rushed following the death of President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash on 19 May.\n\nThese elections are attracting international attention because Iran, a Middle Eastern heavyweight, is at the centre of several crises, from the war in Gaza to the issue of its nuclear programme.\n\nIran's president has limited powers and is responsible for implementing, at the head of the government, the main policy lines set by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.\n\nThe second round will pit two candidates with very different profiles and programmes against each other.\n\nPezeshkian, the 69-year-old reformist candidate, is an MP from Tabriz, a city in north-western Iran. His governmental experience is limited. He served as health minister from 2001 to 2005 during the reformist government of President Mohammad Khatami.\n\nThe candidate became known for his outspokenness, and did not hesitate to criticise the government during the protest movement that rocked the country after the death of young Mahsa Amini in police custody in September 2022 for allegedly violating the strict dress code for women.\n\nWith his discreet appearance, this doctor of Azeri origin advocates a rapprochement between Iran and Western countries, with the United States at the forefront, to lift the sanctions that are hitting the economy hard.\n\nSaid Jalili, on the other hand, favours an inflexible policy towards Western powers. The 58-year-old candidate demonstrated this during the six years he was involved in negotiations over Iran's nuclear programme between 2007 and 2013.\n\nThroughout his career, Jalili rose to key positions thanks to the confidence of Ayatollah Khamenei. He is currently one of the two representatives of the Supreme National Security Council, the country's highest security body.", "source": {"uri": "atalayar.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Two other candidates, Tehran Mayor Alireza Zakani and government official Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi, dropped out.\n\nGhalibaf, Zakani and Ghazizadeh called on their supporters to vote for Jalili in the run-off next Friday in order to ensure victory for the \"revolution front\".\n\nThe snap election on Friday came within the 50-day constitutionally mandated period to select a new president after Ebrahim Raisi and seven others, including Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, died in a helicopter crash on May 19.\n\nLike all major elections in the past four years, the vote on Friday saw low turnout, but the final number was much lower than the 45 percent to 53 percent suggested by polls.\n\nThe lowest presidential turnout in the more than four-decade history of the Islamic republic was the one that got Raisi into office, with 48.8 percent. At just below 41 percent, the parliamentary election in March and May previously had the lowest turnout of any major polls since Iran's 1979 revolution.\n\nThe voter apathy comes as many are disillusioned in the aftermath of deadly nationwide protests in 2022 and 2023, and as the economy continues to deal with myriad challenges including more than 40 percent inflation due to mismanagement and United States sanctions.\n\nA higher turnout appears likely when Iranians vote in the July 5 run-off since it would present a clearer choice between two opposing camps. Higher turnout is expected to mostly benefit Pezeshkian, who would need more votes to defeat the combined forces of the conservative and hardliner camps.\n\nPezeshkian, a prominent politician and former health minister, is backed by former centrist and reformist presidents and other top figures. He has promised to lift sanctions by restoring the country's comatose 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, and to bridge the widening gap between the people and the establishment.\n\nJalili, a senior member of the Supreme National Security Council, has promised to bring inflation down to single digits and boost economic growth to a whopping 8 percent, along with fighting corruption and mismanagement. He advocates a harsher stance against the West and its allies.\n\nPezeshkian was the only moderate of six people approved to run by the Guardian Council, the constitutional body that vets all candidates.\n\nHis backers have presented him not as a miracle worker, but as a prospective president who could make things slightly better while claiming a victory for Jalili would signal a major backslide.\n\nJalili's name is tied with years-long nuclear negotiations in the late 2000s and early 2010s that ultimately led to Iran's isolation on the global stage and the imposition of United Nations Security Council sanctions.\n\nThe hardline politician, who has been trying to become president for more than a decade, blames the camp backing Pezeshkian for compromising the country's nuclear programme as part of the landmark accord signed in 2015, which then US President Donald Trump reneged on in 2018.\n\nAccusing his opponent of inefficiency, Jalili and other conservatives have claimed a Pezeshkian victory would only mark a third administration of former centrist President Hassan Rouhani.\n\nTwo security forces were killed in an attack targeting their vehicle that was carrying ballot boxes in southern Sistan and Baluchestan province after voting concluded. According to state media, armed attackers targeted the car that was returning the boxes to the local governor.", "source": {"uri": "tv360nigeria.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TV360 Nigeria"},

A hardline watchdog body approved only six from an initial pool of 80 and two hardline candidates subsequently dropped out.\n\n\"Based on unconfirmed reports, the election is very likely heading to a second round ... Jalili and Pezeshkian will compete in a run-off election,\" Tasnim reported.\n\nCritics of the clerical establishment say that low turnouts in recent years show the system's legitimacy has eroded. Turnout was 48% in the 2021 presidential election and a record low of 41% of people voted in a parliamentary election in March.\n\nAll candidates have vowed to revive the flagging economy, beset by mismanagement, state corruption, and sanctions re-imposed since 2018 after the U.S. ditched Tehran's nuclear pact.\n\n\"I think Jalili is the only candidate who raised the issue of justice, fighting corruption and giving value to the poor. ... Most importantly, he does not link Iran's foreign policy to the nuclear deal,\" said Farzan, a 45-year-old artist in the city of Karaj.\n\nDIVIDED VOTERS\n\nPezeshkian, faithful to Iran's theocratic rule, is backed by the reformist faction that has largely been sidelined in Iran in recent years.\n\n\"We will respect the hijab law, but there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behaviour toward women,\" Pezeshkian said after casting his vote.\n\nHe was referring to the death of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman, in 2022 while in morality police custody for allegedly violating the mandatory Islamic dress code.\n\nThe unrest sparked by Amini's death spiralled into the biggest show of opposition to Iran's clerical rulers in years.\n\nPezeshkian attempted to revive the enthusiasm of reform-minded voters who have largely stayed away from the polls for the last four years as a mostly youthful population chafes at political and social curbs. He could also benefit from his rivals' failure to consolidate the hardline vote.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nIn the past few weeks, Iranians have made wide use of the hashtag #ElectionCircus on X, with some activists at home and abroad calling for a boycott, saying a high turnout would only serve to legitimise the Islamic Republic.\n\n(This story has not been

Voters participated on Friday in the election to choose a successor to deceased Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash on May 19. They get to choose from a controlled group of four candidates loyal to the supreme leader.\n\nEslami revealed on Saturday that the ballot boxes from 58,640 polling places across Iran and 344 international locations have been counted. With over 61 million eligible voters, the election results show a close fight between Pezeshkian and Jalili. Out of the 24,535,185 votes counted, Pezeshkian garnered 10,415,991 votes, while Jalili received 9,473,298, Iranian state media IRNA reported.\n\nALSO READ | Iran Votes To Elect New President From 4 Candidates Vetted By Supreme Leader Khamenei's Council\n\nAnother candidate, Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, secured 3,383,340 votes, and Mostafa Pourmohammadi received 206,397 votes. Amirhossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi and Alireza Zakani had withdrawn their candidacies before the election.\n\nAs per the Iranian electoral law, if no candidate wins more than 50% of the votes, a runoff between the top two candidates is scheduled for the first Friday after the results are announced.\n\nWhile the election may not make a big change in the policies of the Islamic Republic, the outcome could influence the succession of Iran's supreme leader, Seyyed Ali Hosseini Khamenei, news agency Reuters reported.\n\nThe election comes at a time when the tussle is running high due to the war between Israel and Iranian allies Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Western pressure on Iran over its fast-advancing nuclear programme.\n\nIn order to combat the crisis of legitimacy brought on by public unhappiness with economic hardship and limitations on political and social freedom, Khamenei has called for a high voter turnout. \"The durability, strength, dignity, and reputation of the Islamic Republic depend on the presence of people,\" Khamenei said to state television after casting his vote, as per Reuters. \"High turnout is a definite necessity.\"", "source": {"uri":

However, turnout in Friday's vote hit a historic low of about 40%, based on interior ministry count released on Saturday.\n\nThe election comes at a time of escalating regional tension due to the war between Israel and Iranian allies Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as increased Western pressure on Iran over its fast-advancing nuclear programme.\n\nWith Iran's supreme leader now 85, it is likely that the next president will be closely involved in the process of choosing a successor to Khamenei, who seeks a fiercely loyal president who can ensure a smooth eventual succession to his own position, insiders and analysts say.\n\nAnti-Western views of Jalili, Iran's former uncompromising nuclear negotiator, offer a contrast to those of Pezeshkian. Analysts said Jalili's win would signal the possibility of an even more antagonistic turn in the Islamic Republic's foreign and domestic policy.\n\nBut a victory for mild-mannered lawmaker Pezeshkian might help ease tensions with the West, improve chances of economic reform, social liberalisation and political pluralism.\n\nPezeshkian, faithful to Iran's theocratic rule, is backed by the reformist faction that has largely been sidelined in Iran in recent years.\n\n\"We will respect the hijab law, but there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behaviour toward women,\" Pezeshkian said after casting his vote.\n\nHe was referring to the death of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman, in 2022 while in morality police custody for allegedly violating the mandatory Islamic dress code.\n\nThe unrest sparked by Amini's death spiralled into the biggest show of opposition to Iran's clerical rulers in years.\n\n(Writing by Parisa Hafezi Editing by Tomasz Janowski)", "source": {"uri":

Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 158,000 votes.\n\nVoters faced a choice between the three hard-line candidates and the little-known reformist Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon. As has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognized monitors.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build -- should it choose to do so -- several nuclear weapons.\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, also has refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere's also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. One woman in a documentary on Pezeshkian aired by state TV said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\" of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nIranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50% of all votes cast.

He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and a potential successor. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\nDespite the recent unrest, there was only one reported attack around the election. Gunmen opened fire on a van transporting ballot boxes in the restive southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, killing two police officers and wounding others, the state-run IRNA news agency reported.

He advocates for \"constructive relations\" with the west to \"get Iran out of its isolation\", economic reform, social liberalisation and political pluralism.\n\nDuring the 2022 anti-establishment protests triggered by the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody after she was arrested for alleged violation of the dress code for women, he criticised Raisi's government for a lack of transparency and suggested that Amini was beaten and killed at the hands of the morality police.\n\n\"We will respect the hijab law, but there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behaviour toward women,\" Pezeshkian said on Friday after casting his vote.\n\nMeanwhile, Jalili, the representative of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei in the Supreme National Security Council, is a former nuclear negotiator who holds ultra-conservative views on both domestic and foreign issues. He is particularly strict on internet and social freedoms, and his foreign policy rejects any form of agreement with the US.\n\nWhile running in the 2021 presidential race, Jalili declared that joining any international conventions and agreements is useless for the country.\n\nIn the past few weeks, many Iranians at home and abroad called for a boycott of the election, questioning its credibility.\n\nIran had called early presidential election to replace principlist Ebrahim Raisi after his death in a helicopter crash last month.

A hardline watchdog body approved only six from an initial pool of 80 and two hardline candidates subsequently dropped out.\n\n\"Based on unconfirmed reports, the election is very likely heading to a second round ... Jalili and Pezeshkian will compete in a run-off election,\" Tasnim reported.\n\nCritics of the clerical establishment say that low turnouts in recent years show the system's legitimacy has eroded. Turnout was 48% in the 2021 presidential election and a record low of 41% of people voted in a parliamentary election in March.\n\nAll candidates have vowed to revive the flagging economy, beset by mismanagement, state corruption and sanctions re-imposed since 2018, after the U.S. ditched Tehran's nuclear pact.\n\n\"I think Jalili is the only candidate who raised the issue of justice, fighting corruption and giving value to the poor. ... Most importantly, he does not link Iran's foreign policy to the nuclear deal,\" said Farzan, a 45-year-old artist in the city of Karaj.\n\nPezeshkian, faithful to Iran's theocratic rule, is backed by the reformist faction that has largely been sidelined in Iran in recent years.\n\n\"We will respect the hijab law, but there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behaviour toward women,\" Pezeshkian said after casting his vote.\n\nHe was referring to the death of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman, in 2022 while in morality police custody for allegedly violating the mandatory Islamic dress code.\n\nThe unrest sparked by Amini's death spiralled into the biggest show of opposition to Iran's clerical rulers in years.\n\nPezeshkian attempted to revive the enthusiasm of reform-minded voters who have largely stayed away from the polls for the last four years as a mostly youthful population chafes at political and social curbs. He could also benefit from his rivals' failure to consolidate the hardline vote.\n\nIn the past few weeks, Iranians have made wide use of the hashtag #ElectionCircus on X, with some activists at home and abroad calling for a boycott, saying a high turnout would only serve to legitimise the Islamic Republic.", "source": {"uri": "asia.nikkei.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nikkei Asia"},

According to the Ministry of Interior, just 40 per cent of more than 61 million eligible Iranians voted, setting a new low in presidential elections since the country's 1979 revolution.\n\nThe final data from election headquarters at the ministry revealed that Pezeshkian won more than 10.41 million votes from a total of more than 24.5 million ballots tabulated, trailing former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili by 9.47 million votes. Only the second time since the 1979 revolution has a presidential election been held, reported Al Jazeera. Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, the Conservative Speaker of the Parliament secured 3.38 million votes, and conservative Islamic leader Mostafa Pourmohammadi, got 206,397 votes and was therefore knocked out of the race. Two other candidates, Tehran Mayor Alireza Zakani and government official Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi, dropped out.\n\nMeanwhile, Ghalibaf, Zakani, and Ghazizadeh called on their supporters to vote for Jalili in the run-off next Friday to ensure victory for the \"revolution front\". The snap election on Friday occurred inside the 50-day legally mandated deadline for selecting a new president after Ebrahim Raisi and seven others, including Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, were killed in a helicopter accident on May 19.\n\nThe vote on Friday witnessed a low turnout, as has been the case in all key elections over the last four years, but the final figure was far lower than the 45-53 percent predicted by surveys. Raisi was elected with the lowest presidential turnout in Iran's more than four-decade history, at 48.8 per cent, reported Al Jazeera. The parliamentary election in March and May had the lowest turnout of any major poll since Iran's 1979 revolution, at slightly less than 41 per cent.\n\nJalili, a senior member of the Supreme National Security Council, has pledged to reduce inflation to single digits and improve economic growth to an impressive 8 per cent, while also combating corruption and incompetence. He recommends taking a stronger stance against the West and its supporters. Pezeshkian was the only moderate among six persons authorized to run by the Guardian Council, the constitutional authority that examines all candidates. His supporters have portrayed him not as a miracle worker, but as a potential president who might make things somewhat better while maintaining that a victory for Jalili would signify a big setback.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Jalili's name is associated with years-long nuclear discussions in the late 2000s and early 2010s, which finally led to Iran's isolation on the global stage.

AFP\n\nA relative moderate and a protege of Iran's supreme leader are neck-and-neck in the vote count in snap presidential elections marked by voter apathy over economic hardships and social restrictions.\n\nMore than 14 million votes have been counted so far from Friday's vote, of which the sole reformist-backed candidate Massoud Pezeshkian had won over 5.9 million votes and his hardline challenger former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili over 5.5 million, provisional results by the interior ministry showed.\n\nSome insiders said the turnout was around 40%, lower than expected by Iran's clerical rulers, while witnesses told Reuters that polling stations in Tehran and some other cities were not crowded.\n\nIran's Tasnim news agency said a run-off election was \"very likely\" to pick the next president following the death of Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nIf no candidate wins at least 50% plus one vote from all ballots cast, including blank votes, a run-off between the top two candidates is held on the first Friday after the result is declared.\n\nThe election coincides with escalating regional tension due to the war between Israel and Iranian ally Hamas in Gaza and mounting tensions between Tehran's proxies in Lebanon, Yemen and Iraq, as well as increased Western pressure on Iran over its fast-advancing nuclear programme.\n\nWhile the election is unlikely to bring a major shift in the Islamic Republic's policies, its outcome could influence the succession to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's 85-year-old supreme leader, in power since 1989.\n\nThe clerical establishment sought a high turnout to offset a legitimacy crisis fuelled by public discontent over economic hardship and curbs on political and social freedom.\n\nThe next president is not expected to usher in any major policy shift on Iran's nuclear programme or support for militia groups across the Middle East, since Khamenei calls all the shots on top state matters.\n\nHowever, the president runs the government day-to-day and can influence the tone of Iran's foreign and domestic policy.\n\nPezeshkian's views offer a contrast to those of Jalili, advocating detente with the West, economic reform, social liberalisation and political pluralism.\n\nA staunch anti-Westerner, Jalili's win would signal the possibility of an even more antagonistic turn in the Islamic Republic's foreign and domestic policy, analysts said.\n\nThe election was a contest among a tightly controlled group of three hardline candidates and one low-profile moderate loyal to the supreme leader. A hardline watchdog body approved only six from an initial pool of 80 and two hardline candidates subsequently dropped out.\n\n\"Based on unconfirmed reports, the election is very likely heading to a second round ... Jalili and Pezeshkian will compete in a run-off election,\" Tasnim reported.\n\nCritics of the clerical establishment say that low turnouts in recent years show the system's legitimacy has eroded. Turnout was 48% in the 2021 presidential election and a record low of 41% of people voted in a parliamentary election in March.\n\nAll candidates have vowed to revive the flagging economy, beset by mismanagement, state corruption and sanctions re-imposed since 2018, after the US ditched Tehran's nuclear pact.\n\nPezeshkian, faithful to Iran's theocratic rule, is backed by the reformist faction that has largely been sidelined in Iran in recent years.\n\n\"We will respect the hijab law, but there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behaviour towards women,\" Pezeshkian said after casting his vote.\n\nHe was referring to the death of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman, in 2022 while in morality police custody for allegedly violating the mandatory Islamic dress code.\n\nThe unrest sparked by Amini's death spiralled into the biggest show of opposition to Iran's clerical rulers in years.\n\nPezeshkian attempted to revive the enthusiasm of reform-minded voters who have largely stayed away from the polls for the last four years as a mostly youthful population chafes at political and social curbs. He could also benefit from his rivals' failure to consolidate the hardline vote.\n\nIn the past few weeks, Iranians have made wide use of the hashtag #ElectionCircus on X, with some activists at home and abroad calling for a boycott, saying a high turnout would only serve to legitimise \"the Islamic Republic\".", "source": {"uri": "thearabweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AW"}, "authors":

A hardline watchdog body approved only six from an initial pool of 80 and two hardline candidates subsequently dropped out.\n\n\"Based on unconfirmed reports, the election is very likely heading to a second round ... Jalili and Pezeshkian will compete in a run-off election,\" Tasnim reported.\n\nCritics of the clerical establishment say that low turnouts in recent years show the system's legitimacy has eroded. Turnout was 48 percent in the 2021 presidential election and a record low of 41 percent of people voted in a Parliamentary election in March.\n\nAll candidates have vowed to revive the flagging economy, beset by mismanagement, state corruption and sanctions reimposed since 2018, after the US ditched Tehran's nuclear pact.\n\n\"I think Jalili is the only candidate who raised the issue of justice, fighting corruption and giving value to the poor... Most importantly, he does not link Iran's foreign policy to the nuclear deal,\" said Farzan, a 45-year-old artist in the city of Karaj.\n\nPezeshkian, faithful to Iran's theocratic rule, is backed by the reformist faction that has largely been sidelined in Iran in recent years.\n\n\"We will respect the hijab law, but there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behaviour toward women,\" Pezeshkian said after casting his vote.\n\nHe was referring to the death of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman, in 2022 while in morality police custody for allegedly violating the mandatory Islamic dress code.\n\nThe unrest sparked by Amini's death spiralled into the biggest show of opposition to Iran's clerical rulers in years.\n\nPezeshkian attempted to revive the enthusiasm of reform-minded voters who have largely stayed away from the polls for the last four years as a mostly youthful population chafes at political and social curbs. He could also benefit from his rivals' failure to consolidate the hardline vote.\n\nIn the past few weeks, Iranians have made wide use of the hashtag #ElectionCircus on X, with some activists at home and abroad calling for a boycott, saying a high turnout would only serve to legitimise the Islamic Republic.", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"}, "authors": [],

Both of them edged out conservative parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf with 3.38 million votes and former Justice Minister Mostafa Pourmohammadi with 206,000.\n\nA total of 24,735,185 people voted, representing a turnout of around 40%. That is the lowest turnout in an Iranian election since the 1979 revolution, according to Middle East Eye.\n\n\"This demonstrates that a majority of the Iranian public remains disaffected from participation in the Islamic Republic's restricted elections, which are neither free nor fair,\" the National Iranian American Council (NIAC) wrote in a statement on Saturday. \"The Iranian people have suffered manifold outrages from their government and circumstances, including the brutal crackdown on popular protests in 2022 and earlier and the failure of past moderate and reformist figures to deliver lasting change.\"\n\n\"As a result,\" NIAC continued, \"a majority appear to have concluded for now that they would rather stay home than risk legitimizing a government they do not believe in. The inclusion of a reformist on the ticket in Masoud Pezeshkian may have boosted turnout in some quarters, but did little overall to arrest the slide in turnout in the first round.\"\n\nReform leader Abbas Akhoundi said: \"About 60% of voters did not participate in the elections. Their message was clear. They object to the institutionalized discrimination in the existing governance and do not accept that they are second-class citizens and that a minority impose their will on the majority of Iranian society as first-class citizens.\"\n\nThe outcome on July 5 could depend on whether or not turnout increases.\n\nNIAC observed that Pezeshkian's lead was surprising, given that low-turnout elections usually favor more conservative candidates.\n\n\"Typically, reformists have only triumphed when turnout reaches near record highs with a vast majority of public participation,\" the group wrote. \"Pezeshkian appears to have done well enough to turn out a core base of support that gives him a plausible path to victory, but he will likely need to secure support from Iranians who opted to stay home yesterday in order to triumph.\"\n\nBecause power in Iran is ultimately held by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the winner of the presidential election is unlikely to substantially shift policies such as Iran's nuclear program or its support for militant groups in the Middle East, according to Reuters.\n\nHowever, NIAC said the difference between the two candidates was \"about as wide a difference as the Islamic Republic's restricted elections would allow.\"\n\nPezeshkian, a former health minister who represents Tabriz in Parliament, advocates for economic and social reform. He expressed regret over the death of Mahsa Amini after she was arrested for allegedly wearing her hijab incorrectly -- an event that sparked nationwide protests in 2022 -- and also criticized the Raisi government for lack of transparency during the protests.\n\n\"We will respect the hijab law, but there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behavior toward women,\" Pezeshkian said after voting on Friday.\n\nIn foreign policy, he supports direct diplomacy with the U.S. and has expressed interest in renegotiating the 2015 Iran nuclear deal or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).\n\nJalili, who represents Khamenei on the Supreme National Security Council, supports even stricter hijab laws, advocates for internet restrictions, and opposes the JCPOA or any negotiations with Western countries.\n\nBecause Pezeshkian was the only reformist in the first round of elections, he may struggle in a second round unless turnout increases, as supporters of the other conservative candidates would vote for Jalili, according to The Guardian.\n\nHowever, a reformist newspaper editor told the Middle East Eye that many people who had sat out the first round of elections may vote in the second round to prevent a win by Jalili. The editor also predicted that many people who voted for Ghalibaf in the first round would back Pezeshkian in the second.\n\n\"At least 40% of his supporters, who are moderate and pragmatic conservatives, would vote for Pezeshkian as they fear Jalili's domestic policies and dead-end foreign policy,\" the editor said.\n\nAhead of the election, Trita Parsi of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft predicted that voters would ultimately decide based on a desire to improve \"their increasingly dire economic situation in the medium term.\"\n\n\"They are looking for the candidate who will most likely be able to reduce the price of meat,\" Parsi wrote.\n\nHe did predict the winner could make a difference in Iran-U.S. relations, but only up to a point.\n\n\"Expectations for an opening between the U.S. and Iran should be kept low, even if Pezeshkian wins,\" Parsi concluded. \"The problems between the U.S. and Iran are deeper today than they were in 2013, the trust gap is wider, reversing Iran's nuclear advances is going to be more difficult and politically more costly. On top of all that, Iran has more options in today's increasingly multipolar world.\"", "source": {"uri": "commondreams.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Common Dreams"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

A hard-line watchdog body approved only six from an initial pool of 80 and two hard-line candidates subsequently dropped out.\n\n\"Based on unconfirmed reports, the election is very likely heading to a second round ... Jalili and Pezeshkian will compete in a run-off election,\" Tasnim reported.\n\nCritics of the clerical establishment say that low turnouts in recent years show the system's legitimacy has eroded. Turnout was 48 percent in the 2021 presidential election and a record low of 41 percent of people voted in a parliamentary election in March.\n\nAll candidates have vowed to revive the flagging economy, beset by mismanagement, state corruption and sanctions re-imposed since 2018, after the US ditched Tehran's nuclear pact.\n\n\"I think Jalili is the only candidate who raised the issue of justice, fighting corruption and giving value to the poor. ... Most importantly, he does not link Iran's foreign policy to the nuclear deal,\" said Farzan, a 45-year-old artist in the city of Karaj.\n\nDIVIDED VOTERS\n\nPezeshkian, faithful to Iran's theocratic rule, is backed by the reformist faction that has largely been sidelined in Iran in recent years.\n\n\"We will respect the hijab law, but there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behavior toward women,\" Pezeshkian said after casting his vote.\n\nHe was referring to the death of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman, in 2022 while in morality police custody for allegedly violating the mandatory Islamic dress code.\n\nThe unrest sparked by Amini's death spiraled into the biggest show of opposition to Iran's clerical rulers in years.\n\nPezeshkian attempted to revive the enthusiasm of reform-minded voters who have largely stayed away from the polls for the last four years as a mostly youthful population chafes at political and social curbs. He could also benefit from his rivals' failure to consolidate the hard-line vote.\n\nIn the past few weeks, Iranians have made wide use of the hashtag #ElectionCircus on X, with some activists at home and abroad calling for a boycott, saying a high turnout would only serve to legitimize the Islamic Republic.", "source": {"uri": "arab.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [],

He never remarried and raised his remaining three children -- two sons and a daughter -- alone.\n\nCampaigning on behalf of Pezeshkian was Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran's combative former foreign minister who helped secure the landmark 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which fell through three years later.\n\nThe reformist candidate has called for reviving the accord -- which sought to curb Tehran's nuclear activity in return for sanctions relief -- to get Iran \"out of isolation\".\n\n\"If we manage to lift the sanctions, people will have an easier life while the continuation of sanctions means making people's lives miserable,\" he said during one of his televised interviews.\n\nIf he wins the runoff round, Pezeshkian will be tasked with applying state policy outlined by the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who wields ultimate authority in the country.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

None of the four candidates secured more than 50% of the vote in Friday's election, prompting a second round on July 5. The election saw the lowest voter turnout for a presidential election since the Islamic Republic was established in 1979. Reformist lawmaker Masoud Pezeshkian and ultraconservative former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili, who received the most votes, will face off in the runoff, according to Mohsen Eslami, the spokesperson for the election committee.\n\nPezeshkian led with 42.5% of the votes, followed by Jalili with 38.6%, according to the state news agency IRNA. Out of 60 million eligible voters, 24 million cast their ballots, resulting in a 40% turnout, Eslami said. The results will be reviewed by the Guardian Council, the powerful 12-member body tasked with overseeing elections and legislation, before the two candidates start campaigning again. The snap election was held after Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi died in a helicopter crash on May 19 in the country's remote northwest, along with Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and other officials.\n\nTwo conservatives dropped out of the race just a day before the elections to help the hardline candidates consolidate the conservative vote.\n\nPezeshkian was the only reformist candidate after dozens of other contenders were barred from running by the Guardian Council.\n\nThe Iranian electoral process has been marred by voter apathy of late, causing embarrassment to an establishment that has relied on high voter turnout to bolster its democratic credentials and popular legitimacy.\n\nNationwide discontent was evident in low voter turnout in both parliamentary and presidential elections in recent years. While Iran has boasted exceptionally high voter participation, its last legislative election in March recorded the lowest turnout since in 1979, despite government efforts to rally voters ahead of the ballot.\n\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urged Iranians to head to the polls and vote after he cast his ballot in the election on Friday morning.\n\n\"People's participation is part of the essence of the state and continuation of the existence of the Islamic Republic and its status in the world is tied to people's participation\", he said.\n\nSina Toossi, an Iran analyst and senior fellow at the Center for International Policy in Washington, DC, said Pezeshkian may have been allowed to run in the elections in an attempt to boost voter turnout.\n\n\"This move could be seen as a strategy to create a more dynamic and engaging election process, thereby encouraging greater public participation,\" he told CNN.", "source": {"uri": "nation.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

The significant regional and domestic implications of this election could shape Iran's future, specifically given the ongoing pressures from the Israel-Hamas conflict and Iran's contentious nuclear activities.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoud_Pezeshkian", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Masoud Pezeshkian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saeed_Jalili", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saeed Jalili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Reformists", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iranian Reformists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Two-round system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Bagher_Ghalibaf", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebrahim_Raisi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ebrahim Raisi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_clergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shia clergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mostafa_Pourmohammadi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mostafa Pourmohammadi"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_05_2019_12_11_15_3417518.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692323", "eventUri": "eng-9692323", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

If not, the race's top two candidates will advance to a run-off a week later.\n\nThere has been only one run-off presidential election in Iran's history - in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad beat former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nMr Eslami acknowledged the country's Guardian Council would need to offer formal approval, but the result did not draw any immediate challenge from contenders in the race.\n\nAs has been the case since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, women and those calling for radical change have been barred from running, while the vote itself will have no oversight from internationally recognised monitors.\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, has also refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nIn a documentary on the reformist candidate aired by state TV, one woman said her generation was \"moving towards the same level\" of animosity with the government that Mr Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nMr Raisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a protege of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and a potential successor.\n\nStill, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing of the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\nThe voting came as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region - such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels - are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Republic continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build - should it choose to do so - several nuclear weapons.\n\nDespite the recent unrest, there was only one reported attack around the election.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

However, turnout in Friday's vote hit a historic low of about 40pc, based on the interior ministry count released on Saturday.\n\nThe next president is not expected to usher in any major policy shift on Iran's nuclear programme or support for militia groups across the Middle East, since Khamenei calls all the shots on top state matters.\n\nHowever, the president runs the government day-to-day and can influence the tone of Iran's foreign and domestic policy.\n\nPezeshkian's views offer a contrast to those of Jalili, advocating detente with the West, economic reform, social liberalisation and political pluralism.\n\nA staunch anti-Westerner, Jalili's win would signal the possibility of an even more antagonistic turn in the Islamic Republic's foreign and domestic policy, analysts said.\n\nThe election was a contest among a tightly controlled group of three hardline candidates and one low-profile moderate loyal to the supreme leader. A watchdog body approved only six from an initial pool of 80 and two hardline candidates subsequently dropped out.\n\nCritics of the clerical establishment say that low turnouts in recent years show the system's legitimacy has eroded.\n\nTurnout was 48pc in the 2021 presidential election and a record low of 41pc of people voted in a parliamentary election in March.\n\nAll candidates have vowed to revive the flagging economy, beset by mismanagement, state corruption and sanctions re-imposed since 2018, after the US ditched Tehran's nuclear pact.\n\n\"I think Jalili is the only candidate who raised the issue of justice, fighting corruption and giving value to the poor. [...] Most importantly, he does not link Iran's foreign policy to the nuclear deal,\" said Farzan, a 45-year-old artist in the city of Karaj.\n\nPezeshkian, faithful to Iran's theocratic rule, is backed by the reformist faction that has largely been sidelined in Iran in recent years.\n\n\"We will respect the hijab law, but there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behaviour toward women,\" Pezeshkian said after casting his vote. He was referring to the death of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman, in 2022 while in morality police custody for allegedly violating the mandatory Islamic dress code.\n\nThe unrest sparked by Amini's death spiralled into the biggest show of opposition to Iran's clerical rulers in years.\n\nPezeshkian attempted to revive the enthusiasm of reform-minded voters who have largely stayed away from the polls for the last four years as a mostly youthful population chafes at political and social curbs. He could also benefit from his rivals' failure to consolidate the hardline vote.\n\nIn the past few weeks, Iranians have made wide use of the hashtag #ElectionCircus on X, with some activists at home and abroad calling for a boycott, saying a high turnout would only serve to legitimise the Islamic Republic.", "source": {"uri": "pakistantoday.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title":

Only the second time since the 1979 revolution has a presidential election been held, reported Al Jazeera.\n\nMohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, the Conservative Speaker of the Parliament secured 3.38 million votes, and conservative Islamic leader Mostafa Pourmohammadi, got 206,397 votes and was therefore knocked out of the race. Two other candidates, Tehran Mayor Alireza Zakani and government official Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi, dropped out.\n\nMeanwhile, Ghalibaf, Zakani, and Ghazizadeh called on their supporters to vote for Jalili in the run-off next Friday to ensure victory for the \"revolution front\".\n\nThe snap election on Friday occurred inside the 50-day legally mandated deadline for selecting a new president after Ebrahim Raisi and seven others, including Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, were killed in a helicopter accident on May 19.\n\nThe vote on Friday witnessed a low turnout, as has been the case in all key elections over the last four years, but the final figure was far lower than the 45-53 percent predicted by surveys. Raisi was elected with the lowest presidential turnout in Iran's more than four-decade history, at 48.8 per cent, reported Al Jazeera.\n\nThe parliamentary election in March and May had the lowest turnout of any major poll since Iran's 1979 revolution, at slightly less than 41 per cent.\n\nJalili, a senior member of the Supreme National Security Council, has pledged to reduce inflation to single digits and improve economic growth to an impressive 8 per cent, while also combating corruption and incompetence. He recommends taking a stronger stance against the West and its supporters.\n\nPezeshkian was the only moderate among six persons authorized to run by the Guardian Council, the constitutional authority that examines all candidates. His supporters have portrayed him not as a miracle worker, but as a potential president who might make things somewhat better while maintaining that a victory for Jalili would signify a big setback.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Jalili's name is associated with years-long nuclear discussions in the late 2000s and early 2010s, which finally led to Iran's isolation on the global stage.

However, turnout in Friday's vote hit a historic low of about 40%, based on interior ministry count released on Saturday.\n\nThe election comes at a time of escalating regional tension due to the war between Israel and Iranian allies Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as increased Western pressure on Iran over its fast-advancing nuclear programme.\n\nMaximize\n\nItem 1 of 5 A view shows a symbolic ballot box for the presidential election in a street in Tehran, Iran June 29, 2024.

Analysts said Jalili's win would signal the possibility of an even more antagonistic turn in the Islamic Republic's foreign and domestic policy.\n\nBut a victory for mild-mannered lawmaker Pezeshkian might help ease tensions with the West, improve chances of economic reform, social liberalisation and political pluralism.\n\nPezeshkian, faithful to Iran's theocratic rule, is backed by the reformist faction that has largely been sidelined in Iran in recent years.\n\n\"We will respect the hijab law, but there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behaviour toward women,\" Pezeshkian said after casting his vote.\n\nHe was referring to the death of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman, in 2022 while in morality police custody for allegedly violating the mandatory Islamic dress code.\n\nThe unrest sparked by Amini's death spiralled into the biggest show of opposition to Iran's clerical rulers in years.\n\nWriting by Parisa Hafezi Editing by Tomasz Janowski", "source": {"uri":

Pezeshkian could not get past the 50 percent threshold to win outright, so he will face hardliner Saeed Jalili in a runoff election on July 5.\n\nPezeshkian collected 42.4 percent of the vote, or about 10.4 million votes, in the low-turnout election. Jalili came in second with 38.6 percent or 9.4 million votes. Another hardliner and the early favorite to win the election, parliamentary speaker Mohammed Bagher Qalibaf, placed third with just 13.8 percent.\n\nTurnout was estimated at just 40 percent of Iranian voters, a record low. Many Iranians do not bother to vote because the elections are rigged in advance by a theocratic Guardian Council, and even if a \"moderate\" like Pezeshkian wins, his ability to actually reform the Iranian system would be minimal. The autocratic ruler of the country will remain Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is aging and in poor health, so he could be replaced soon.\n\nHuman rights activists, both within Iran and internationally, urged Iranians to boycott the election to replace Raisi, who was killed in a helicopter crash in May. The Iranian regime complained that the U.S. government was \"meddling\" in the election and depressing turnout by criticizing the vote as a farce.\n\nRaisi won his election in 2021 with 18 million votes, which was almost as much as the two front-runners in Friday's contest combined, and turnout for Raisi's election was considered a record low at the time. Critics of the regime believed it only allowed Pezeshkian to run against five hardliners to create the illusion of a real choice and were taken aback that he polled as well as he did.\n\nPezeshkian campaigned on skepticism of Iran's strict laws for women's head coverings and on the need to develop better relations with Western nations to secure Iran's economic future. Jalili offered some criticisms of Raisi's economic policies, which left Iran in dire shape, but he is a rigid theocrat who is deeply hostile to the West.\n\nThe UK Guardian on Saturday found Iranians deeply skeptical of regime media's breathless coverage of an exciting election:\n\nOne Tehran citizen, Kianoosh Sanjari, struck by the contrast between the official TV reports of excitement at the polls and what he had seen on the streets of the capital, said he travelled to 14 polling booths and did not find more than five people queueing to vote. He said he then went to Laleh (Tulip) Park, one of his favourite haunts in Tehran, and found old men playing chess under a gazebo, crowds of youngsters playing badminton football and volleyball, and children practising slacklining.\n\n\"I don't know about the situation in other cities, but I can definitely say that the absolute majority of people in Tehran ignored the presidential appointments of the Islamic Republic of Iran and did not participate in them.\"\n\nReform activist Abbas Akhoundi doubted the turnout would be much better for the July 5 runoff, even though the reformist Pezeshkian seems to stand a good chance of winning.\n\n\"A large part of Iranian society does not see a place for itself in the ruling political institutions. Therefore, they had the right not to participate in the elections.

He served as deputy speaker from 2016 to 2020, when moderates and reformists had a majority in the legislature.\n\nHe has questioned Iran's methods of enforcing the hijab, the Islamic head scarf for women, and spoken in favor of negotiating with the West. But he has said he will follow Khamenei's policies if elected.\n\nJalili, who has never held elected office, serves as Khamenei's personal representative on the Supreme National Security Council. During his 2007-13 term as the council's secretary, he led the a delegation in failed talks with the West on Tehran's nuclear program.\n\nIran's political establishment has long maintained it derives its legitimacy from strong voter turnout, but poor participation in recent elections and popular protests have challenged the legitimacy of the current leadership.\n\nWATCH: Speaking with RFE/RL's Radio Farda from inside Iran, some listeners said they would boycott the vote, while others said they hoped their participation would bring about reforms.\n\nThe estimated 40 percent turnout in the June 28 vote signaled apathy among many Iranians tired of the country's persistent economic woes and international isolation.\n\nDissidents at home and abroad called for a boycott, arguing that past voting has failed to deliver change.\n\nIran's supreme leader has the final say on all state matters and the president does not have much sway on many key issues.\n\nRaisi died along with Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and several other officials when their helicopter crashed on May 19.\n\nMany Iranians refer to him as the Butcher of Tehran for his alleged role in the mass execution of political prisoners in 1988 when he was Tehran's deputy prosecutor.", "source": {"uri": "rferl.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

This election, which marked the lowest voter turnout since the 1979 elections, saw reformist Masoud Pezeshkian and hard-liner Saeed Jalili advance to the final round.\n\nWith more than 60% of eligible voters abstaining, Pezeshkian secured 10.4 million votes, narrowly leading Jalili, who received 9.4 million. The runoff pits Pezeshkian, a cardiac surgeon, against Jalili, a former nuclear negotiator known for his hard-line stance.\n\nThe vote saw isolated violence, including an attack in Sistan and Baluchestan province, killing two police officers, AP News reported.\n\nThe low turnout suggests growing public disillusionment and frustration with Iran's political system. Over 1 million ballots were voided, which could indicate a protest vote.\n\nNobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi, who is imprisoned, and Green Movement leader Mir Hossein Mousavi, who remains under house arrest, called for a boycott of the presidential elections.\n\nPezeshkian faces criticism for being another government-approved candidate despite his reformist label. Jalili, known as the \"Living Martyr\" for his war injuries, is seen as a staunch hard-liner and received support from the conservative bloc.\n\nOutgoing President Ebrahim Raisi's tenure was marked by economic hardship and mass protests. Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash in May, was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nThe crash occurred in the Dizmar forest amid severe weather conditions, including heavy fog and rain. Despite immediate rescue efforts, the harsh weather and difficult terrain significantly hampered the search.\n\nState media reported that the crash was a result of a \"technical failure,\" and Iran's army chief Mohammed Bagheri has ordered an investigation into the incident.\n\nThe late president's government faced large-scale protests following the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who died in police custody after being detained for not wearing a hijab correctly.\n\nThese protests were part of the \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" movement, which saw more than 500 people killed, including 60 children, and over 19,000 protesters jailed.\n\n\u00a9 Morocco World News.

However, the president runs the government and can influence the tone of foreign and domestic policy.\n\nAll four candidates have promised to revive the flagging economy, beset by mismanagement, state

Neither budged, however, and Qalibaf suffered for a couple of reasons.\n\nQalibaf found himself squeezed between Jalili, who appealed to more hard-line and ideologically committed voters, and Pezeshkian, who drew on the support of enough moderate and pro-reform voters to finish ahead of the pack.\n\nThe parliament speaker has also been embroiled in a series of corruption allegations and political scandals throughout his career, which may have damaged his reputation to such an extent that it could not be offset by his attempts to present himself as a competent, experienced manager with technocratic solutions.\n\nPezeshkian initially was not seen as a serious challenger but as election day grew closer, his poll numbers soared.\n\nDespite the low turnout, he managed to lure enough moderate and reformist voters out to secure a place in the run-off election.\n\nPezeshkian is a veteran lawmaker who backs engaging with the West and has been critical of some of Tehran's conservative policies. But he is also committed to the principles of the Islamic republic and has vowed to follow Khamenei's policies if elected.\n\nJalili, who is staunchly opposed to improving relations with the West, will be hoping to get Qalibaf's votes after the parliament speaker endorsed him for the run-off. However, there is no guarantee that Qalibaf's supporters will swing to Jalili.\n\nThe hard-liner Jalili has also surrounded himself with officials close to the administration of the late Ebrahim Raisi, whose death in a helicopter crash in May triggered the snap election to replace him.\n\nThe last time an Iranian presidential vote went to a runoff was in 2005, when the populist candidate Mahmud Ahmadinejad, who had finished second in the first round, beat the moderate hopeful Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nIf turnout remains low and Pezeshkian fails to mobilize a larger portion of pro-reform voters, Jalili could win the July 5 poll.\n\nBut the prospect of a Jalili presidency might just be enough of an incentive to compel some to vote for Pezeshkian.\n\n\"I voted for Pezeshkian because I believe he is qualified, but also I was scared of Jalili becoming president,\" a voter inside Iran said in a voice message to RFE/RL's Radio Farda.\n\nSabet argued, however, that with the Iranian public having experienced the repressive Ahmadinejad and Raisi presidencies, \"I'm not sure how much more frightening a Jalili administration will be.\"", "source": {"uri": "rferl.org",

Neither budged, however, and Qalibaf suffered for a couple of reasons.\n\nQalibaf found himself squeezed between Jalili, who appealed to more hard-line and ideologically committed voters, and Pezeshkian, who drew on the support of enough moderate and pro-reform voters to finish ahead of the pack.\n\nThe parliament speaker has also been embroiled in a series of corruption allegations and political scandals throughout his career, which may have damaged his reputation to such an extent that it could not be offset by his attempts to present himself as a competent, experienced manager with technocratic solutions.\n\nPezeshkian initially was not seen as a serious challenger but as election day grew closer, his poll numbers soared.\n\nDespite the low turnout, he managed to lure enough moderate and reformist voters out to secure a place in the runoff election.\n\nPezeshkian is a veteran lawmaker who backs engaging with the West and has been critical of some of Tehran's conservative policies. But he is also committed to the principles of the Islamic republic and has vowed to follow Khamenei's policies if elected.\n\nJalili, who is staunchly opposed to improving relations with the West, will be hoping to get Qalibaf's votes after the parliament speaker endorsed him for the runoff. However, there is no guarantee that Qalibaf's supporters will swing to Jalili.\n\nThe hard-liner Jalili has also surrounded himself with officials close to the administration of the late Ebrahim Raisi, whose death in a helicopter crash in May triggered the snap election to replace him.\n\nThe last time an Iranian presidential vote went to a runoff was in 2005, when the populist candidate Mahmud Ahmadinejad, who had finished second in the first round, beat the moderate hopeful Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nIf turnout remains low and Pezeshkian fails to mobilize a larger portion of pro-reform voters, Jalili could win the July 5 poll.\n\nTo convince the disillusioned public to vote, Pezeshkian needs \"a clear plan and distinct approach,\" France-based political commentator Mojtaba Najafi told RFE/RL's Radio Farda.\n\nIf Pezeshkian succeeds, he will have \"a significant chance\" of defeating Jalili, he said.\n\nThere is also a possibility that the prospect of a Jalili presidency is enough incentive to compel some to vote for Pezeshkian.\n\n\"I voted for Pezeshkian because I believe he is qualified, but also I was scared of Jalili becoming president,\" a voter inside Iran said in a voice message to RFE/RL's Radio Farda.\n\nSabet argued, however, that with the Iranian public having experienced the repressive Ahmadinejad and Raisi presidencies, \"I'm not sure how much more frightening a Jalili administration will be.\"", "source": {"uri": "eurasiareview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eurasia Review"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rfe_rl@eurasiareview.com",

The outcome of the vote could also influence the succession to the 85-year-old supreme leader, in power since 1989.\n\nRaisi died at a time of worsening strains between the clerical leadership and the wider society, aggravated by tightening political and social controls and a worsening economy.\n\nA hardline watchdog body approved only six presidential candidates from an initial pool of 80. Two hardline candidates subsequently dropped out, apparently in order to reduce the risk of diluting the conservative vote.\n\nGrowing numbers of voters have shunned recent elections, a worrying sign for the leadership, which sees turnout as a credibility test for the 45-year-old Islamic Republic.\n\nTurnout on Friday was about 40%, according to interior ministry data released on Saturday. That compared with 48% in the 2021 presidential election and 41% in a parliamentary election in March this yeard.\n\nPezeshkian's views offer a contrast to those of Jalili, advocating detente with the West, economic reform, social liberalisation and political pluralism.\n\nA staunch anti-Westerner, Jalili could press for an even more antagonistic turn in foreign and domestic policy if he wins, analysts said.\n\nAll candidates vowed to revive the flagging economy, beset by mismanagement, state corruption and sanctions reimposed since 2018, after the United States ditched a nuclear pact with Tehran.\n\n\"I think Jalili is the only candidate who raised the issue of justice, fighting corruption and giving value to the poor. ... Most importantly, he does not link Iran's foreign policy to the nuclear deal,\" said Farzan, a 45-year-old artist in the city of Karaj.\n\nPezeshkian, while faithful to theocratic rule, is backed by the reformist faction that has largely been sidelined in Iran in recent years.\n\n\"We will respect the hijab law, but there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behaviour toward women,\" Pezeshkian said after casting his vote.\n\nHe was referring to the death of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman, in 2022 while in morality police custody for allegedly violating the mandatory Islamic dress code.\n\nThe unrest sparked by Amini's death spiralled into the biggest show of opposition to Iran's clerical rulers in years.\n\nPezeshkian attempted to revive the enthusiasm of reform-minded voters who have largely stayed away from the polls for the last four years as a mostly youthful population chafes at political and social curbs. He could also benefit from his rivals' failure to consolidate the hardline vote.", "source": {"uri": "bangkokpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangkok Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

In 2021, he joined the race again but eventually pulled out in favor of the eventual winner, Raisi.\n\nHe has been one of the most vocal opponents of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, a position he highlighted in his election campaign, including in televised debates.\n\nPre-election opinion polls showed Jalili and parliament speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf evenly poised for victory, but voters completely bucked this forecast on Friday, with Qalibaf ending up in third place with just 3.3 million votes, roughly one-third of his conservative rival.\n\nImportantly, Jalili was closely involved in the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s and lost part of his leg after a frontline injury.\n\nIn 2013, he was appointed by Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to the Expediency Council, a powerful administrative assembly tasked with resolving policy disputes in the country.\n\nIn the presidential debates, Jalili said he would \"make the enemy regret\" its actions of imposing sanctions on Iran, adding that he had an \"action plan\" to do this if elected president.\n\nHe also dismissed claims that the 2015 Iran nuclear deal benefited the country economically, arguing that economic growth was \"zero and negative\" when the accord was signed.\n\nJalili has also advocated strongly for mandatory hijab (Islamic headscarf), accusing the West of concealing the \"glorious role\" Iranian women had in various fields. He called the hijab a dress code to \"preserve and strengthen the sanctity of the institution of family.\"", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu Ajans\u0131"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Reformists", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iranian Reformists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoud_Pezeshkian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Masoud Pezeshkian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saeed_Jalili", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saeed Jalili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diplomat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Two-round system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebrahim_Raisi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ebrahim Raisi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Bagher_Ghalibaf", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Iran)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Iran)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_National_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme National Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mahmoud Ahmadinejad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Leader of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expediency_Discernment_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Expediency Discernment Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctions_against_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sanctions against Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Khamenei", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ali Khamenei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hijab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran\u2013Iraq_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iran\u2013Iraq War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Zoroastrianism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Zoroastrianism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2024/06/29/thumbs_b_c_b08782fdd164375c07dc9917b21e0a15.jpg?v=144432", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692323", "eventUri": "eng-9692323", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-05", "textStart": 83, "textEnd": 89, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "-04-30", "textStart": 285, "textEnd": 293, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

with Mr Pezeshkian finishing narrowly ahead.\n\nIran's interior ministry confirmed the second round is set for 5 July.\n\nTwo security force members were killed after unidentified gunmen attacked a vehicle carrying election boxes in Sistan-Baluchestan province, according to state media reports.\n\nFormer nuclear negotiator Mr Jalili was trailing Mr Pezeshkian - a former heart surgeon and health minister - by about a million votes, early results from the interior ministry show.\n\nMr Pezeshkian has promised a different approach, saying the actions of the morality police, who enforce strict dress codes on women, are \"immoral\".\n\nAlthough he is seen as a reformist, Mr Pezeshkian is deeply loyal to Iran's supreme leader.\n\nSome commentators have suggested that should he be elected, Iran should not expect more than a difference in tone.\n\nThe vote is to replace former president Ebrahim Raisi, who died on 19 May when the helicopter he was in crashed into a mountain, with seven other people also killed.\n\nThough there are 61.5 million eligible voters in Iran, only around 40% turned out to vote - the fewest since the 1979 Islamic revolution.\n\nSupreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is the ultimate authority in the country, had called for \"maximum\" turnout.\n\nIran was shaken by a huge wave of protests in 2022 following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was detained by the morality police for allegedly violating Iran's strict dress code.\n\nHuman rights groups say hundreds were killed in the crackdown and thousands detained.\n\nIf you have any stories or news that you would like to share with the global online community, please feel free to share it with us by contacting us directly at [email protected]", "source": {"uri": "brudirect.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BruneiDirect"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoud_Pezeshkian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Masoud Pezeshkian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Reformists", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iranian Reformists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saeed_Jalili", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saeed Jalili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_the_Interior_(Spain)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of the Interior (Spain)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Two-round system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistan_and_Baluchestan_province", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sistan and Baluchestan province"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_religious_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamic religious police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Leader of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dress code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Province"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Mahsa_Amini", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Death of Mahsa Amini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebrahim_Raisi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ebrahim Raisi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Khamenei", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ali Khamenei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iranian Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Zoroastrianism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Zoroastrianism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692323", "eventUri": "eng-9692323", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-05", "textStart": 464, "textEnd": 470}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-19", "textStart": 1257, "textEnd": 1263}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Four candidates contested the initial round, but none secured the absolute majority required for an outright win. Iranian electoral law stipulates that a candidate must obtain at least one vote more than the combined total of all other candidates to be declared the winner.\n\nPezeshkian and Jalili emerged as the top contenders, receiving 10,415,901 and 9,473,298 votes respectively, out of a total of 24,535,185 ballots cast. The other two candidates, Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf and Mustafa Pour Mohammadi, garnered 3,383,340 and 206,397 votes respectively.\n\nVoter turnout was a mere 40%, according to the Mehr News Agency, marking the lowest participation rate in the history of the Islamic Republic and breaking the previous record set in the 2021 presidential election.\n\nThe two runoff candidates represent starkly different political viewpoints. Jalili, an ultraconservative politician, is known for his anti-Western stance and has previously blocked laws related to Iran's compliance with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog. Conversely, Pezeshkian, the sole reformist candidate, has campaigned on a platform of engaging in talks with the United States to lift sanctions and has pledged to finalise bills that would remove Iran from the FATF's blacklist, potentially normalising the country's international trade.\n\nThe coming days are expected to see intense campaigning as both candidates vie for the support of undecided voters. Turnout in the runoff may increase slightly, as some who previously boycotted the elections might now cast their votes for Pezeshkian to prevent Jalili's ascension to power.\n\nHowever, regardless of the outcome, fundamental changes in Iran's general policies are unlikely. All candidates have expressed loyalty to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who recently advised against voting for candidates with \"an affection\" for the United States. This statement has been interpreted as opposition to any compromise with Washington over the revival of the 2015 nuclear deal.\n\nThe landmark nuclear agreement, which lifted international sanctions on Iran, has been in limbo since the US withdrawal in 2018. Negotiations for its restoration have yielded no results after more than two years. Khamenei's remarks have dampened hopes for the removal of sanctions, which was a central promise in Pezeshkian's campaign and a key motivator for many voters.\n\nAs Iran heads towards this crucial runoff, the international community watches closely, aware that the outcome could significantly impact the country's domestic and foreign policies in the years to come.", "source": {"uri":

Iran's electoral law requires that any one candidate must win at least 50 percent of the vote to assume the presidency. The runoff will be held July 5.\n\nSome Iranians speculated that Pezeshkian's place in the second round would mobilize pro-reform voters to cast ballots, while others were unsure he could usher in meaningful change.\n\nIn Iran's Shiite theocracy, ultimate authority resides with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say on critical matters such as national security and foreign policy. But as the head of government and second-highest ranking official, the president can set economic policy, influence how strictly moral codes are enforced and guide diplomacy with other nations.\n\nPezeshkian, a cardiac surgeon and lawmaker, supports engagement with the West and has criticized the harsh enforcement of the mandatory dress code for women. But he was not among Iran's most prominent reformists when he entered the race and his \"public expressions of loyalty to Khamenei suggest little willingness to directly oppose the supreme leader on any issues of substance,\" Gregory Brew, Iran analyst at Eurasia Group, wrote in a briefing note.\n\nHe would also likely struggle to deliver on key policy promises, Brew said, \"given the opposition he would face from virtually every branch of the Islamic Republic's governing system, where hard-liners remain dominant.\"\n\nJalili, however, is a staunch regime hard-liner, religious conservative, and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the supreme leader. His positions - including permanent hostility to the West, stricter dress codes for women, and building better ties with Russia - align more closely with Iran's ruling establishment.\n\nOn the economic front, hard-liners like Jalili \"believe in a closed economy under their control,\" Ehsan Naser, a board member at Iran's Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Mines, told the reformist news site Entekhab on Saturday.\n\nA closed economy creates \"a breeding ground for corruption,\" Naser said. \"They do not believe in the active participation of society in the economy.\"\n\nIn a statement Saturday, carried by the semiofficial Tasnim news agency, Jalili said the elections were \"a manifestation of religious democracy, which showed that in the Islamic Republic, the power rests with the people of Iran.\"\n\nHe called on Iranians to campaign for him next week and to \"actively participate\" in the runoff, saying the government needs the strong support of the people to confront major challenges.\n\nHigh voter turnout is critical for the regime's legitimacy and in the lead-up to the election, Khamenei urged the public go out and cast their ballots.\n\n\"The continuity of the Islamic republic depends on people's turnout and participation,\" Khamenei told reporters Friday. Authorities later extended the voting by six hours, in what analysts said was a bid to increase participation.\n\nIran has roughly 60 million eligible voters but only 24 million people cast their ballots Friday. Of those, Pezeshkian secured 10.4 million votes. Jalili received 9.4 million and 3 million went to Ghalibaf.\n\nConservative voters Saturday took to social media to vent their anger with Ghalibaf, who they said divided the hard line vote by refusing to step down.\n\nTwo other conservative candidates withdrew from the race just days before the vote, but both Jalili and Ghalibaf resisted calls to step aside.\n\nGhalibaf, a former military commander and mayor of Tehran, endorsed Jalili in a statement shortly after the results were announced. He called him \"the candidate of the revolutionary front\" and said that conservatives \"should not let reformists go to work.\"\n\nAt a news conference Saturday, the head of Pezeshkian's campaign headquarters, Abdul Alizadeh, fired back.\n\n\"This not the way to run the country. What are you doing?\" Entekhab quoted Alizadeh as saying.\n\nHe also dismissed criticism that the president has no power.\n\n\"Don't say the president has no authority ... the president has a lot of authority,\" he said, pointing to the leader's ability to set social and economic policy. \"People choose the future of the country when electing the president.\"", "source": {"uri": "matzav.com",

Raisi was elected with the lowest presidential turnout in Iran's more than four-decade history, at 48.8 per cent, reported Al Jazeera.\n\nThe parliamentary election in March and May had the lowest turnout of any major poll since Iran's 1979 revolution, at slightly less than 41 per cent.\n\nJalili, a senior member of the Supreme National Security Council, has pledged to reduce inflation to single digits and improve economic growth to an impressive 8 per cent, while also combating corruption and incompetence. He recommends taking a stronger stance against the West and its supporters.\n\nPezeshkian was the only moderate among six persons authorized to run by the Guardian Council, the constitutional authority that examines all candidates. His supporters have portrayed him not as a miracle worker, but as a potential president who might make things somewhat better while maintaining that a victory for Jalili would signify a big setback.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Jalili's name is associated with years-long nuclear discussions in the late 2000s and early 2010s, which finally led to Iran's isolation on the global stage.

neck in Iran's presidential vote", "body": "A low-key moderate and a protege of Iran's supreme leader are neck and neck as votes are counted in snap presidential elections marked by voter apathy over economic hardship and social restrictions.\n\nWith more than 14 million ballots counted so far from Friday's polling, sole moderate candidate Masoud Pezeshkian has more 5.9 million votes and the hardline candidate, former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili, more than 5.5 million, provisional results from the Interior Ministry showed.\n\nSome insiders said the turnout was about 40 per cent - a figure lower than expected by Iran's clerical rulers, while witnesses told Reuters that polling stations in Tehran and some other cities had not been crowded.\n\nIran's Tasnim news agency said a run-off election was \"very likely\" to pick the next president following the death of Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nIf no candidate wins at least 50 per cent plus one vote from all ballots cast, including blank votes, a run-off between the top two candidates is held on the first Friday after the result is declared.\n\nThe election coincides with escalating regional tension due to the war between Israel and Iranian allies Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as increased western pressure on Iran over its nuclear programme.\n\nIn April, Iran launched its first direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region - such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels - are engaged in fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build, should it choose to do so, several nuclear weapons.\n\nWhile the election is unlikely to bring a major shift in the Islamic Republic's policies, its outcome could influence the succession to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's 85-year-old supreme leader, in power since 1989.\n\nThe clerical establishment sought a high turnout to offset a legitimacy crisis fuelled by public discontent over economic hardship and curbs on political and social freedom.\n\nThe next president is not expected to usher in any major policy shift on Iran's nuclear programme or support for militia groups across the Middle East, since Mr Khamenei decides top state matters.\n\nHowever, the president runs the government day-to-day and can influence the tone of Iran's foreign and domestic policy.\n\nMr Pezeshkian's views offer a contrast to those of Mr Jalili, advocating detente with the West, economic reform, social liberalisation and political pluralism.\n\nA staunch anti-westerner, a win by Mr Jalili would signal the possibility of an even more antagonistic turn in the Islamic Republic's foreign and domestic policy, analysts said.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [],

Pezeshikan collected 42.5% of the vote, and Jalili came in second place with 38.6%.\n\nThe election was prompted by the death of late President Ebrahim Raisi, who died on May 19 in a helicopter crash. Known as the \"butcher of Tehran,\" Ebrahim was responsible for executing hundreds of political prisoners during the 1980s before being elected president in 2021.\n\nWith the Iranian people jaded by the integrity of their democracy, this past election boasted the lowest turnout rates since the Islamic Republic was created in 1979. A total of 24 million voters cast their ballot, a 40% turnout.\n\nIn an effort to bolster Jalili's chances of winning, two conservative candidates dropped out days before Friday's election. Meanwhile, Pezeshkian was the only reformist candidate approved to run by the Guardian Council after it prevented dozens of contenders from appearing on the ballot.\n\nSina Toossi, an Iran analyst and senior fellow at the Center for International Policy in Washington, D.C., told CNN that Pezeshkian may have been permitted to run in the election only as a way of boosting voter turnout.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"This move could be seen as a strategy to create a more dynamic and engaging election process, thereby encouraging greater public participation,\" Toossi told CNN.\n\nIf elected to the presidency, Pezeshkian would have a more moderate approach to the country's governance and could improve Iran's relations with Western states; whereas Jalili has a history of being uncompromising with his dealings with Western powers, thus potentially escalating tensions surrounding Iran's nuclear program and its involvement in the war in Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elaine_mallon@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Elaine Mallon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saeed_Jalili", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saeed Jalili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoud_Pezeshkian", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Masoud Pezeshkian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reformism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebrahim_Raisi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ebrahim Raisi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Two-round system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_prisoner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political prisoner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardian_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guardian Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_program_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear program of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24140739624493.jpg.optimal.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692323", "eventUri": "eng-9692323", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-05", "textStart": 121, "textEnd": 127}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-19", "textStart": 509, "textEnd": 515}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

A fourth candidate, Mostafa Pourmohammadi, a former justice minister who ran a wild card campaign, won only 206,000. A total of 24,735,185 people voted.\n\nAs the first vote tallies were announced, Pezeshkian was just behind Jalili, but he then overtook him and pushed ahead.\n\nA runoff on Friday seems inevitable and will offer a straight ideological choice between Pezeshkian and Jalili.\n\nUnless Pezeshkian can galvanise more voters to turn out, on the basis that the first round proved that he has a viable chance of winning and can change Iran, the reformist is likely to lose a runoff. The bulk, but not all, of the Ghalibaf votes are predicted to switch to Jalili. The rivalry between Ghalibaf and Jalili - both personal and ideological - was enough to prevent them reaching a pre-polling pact.\n\nThe snap election was called after the death of President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash. In 2021, Raisi secured 18m votes, only 6m less than the total number of votes recorded as cast in 2024. Detailed comparisons showed that turnout was down in 2021 in almost all provinces except in Tehran and Qom.\n\nAbbas Akhoundi, a leading reformist, warned: \"About 60% of voters did not participate in the elections. Their message was clear. They object to the institutionalised discrimination in the existing governance and do not accept that they are second-class citizens and that a minority impose their will on the majority of Iranian society as first-class citizens.\n\n\"A large part of Iranian society does not see a place for itself in the ruling political institutions. Therefore, they had the right not to participate in the elections. The government should know that, if this procedure continues, this part of society will get bigger because even some of those who voted agree with this group.\"\n\nSix candidates, including five Conservatives, two of whom dropped out on the eve of the poll, were approved as qualified to stand by the Guardian Council, an unelected constitutional watchdog whose members are directly and indirectly appointed by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nThe decision to allow a reformist to stand was seen as a concession by the regime, which needed a more competitive election to try to lure voters to the polls.\n\nIran needs leaders with legitimacy as it supports resistance movements across the Middle East, confronts unelected Gulf monarchies and challenges the west over the purpose and scale of its currently expanding nuclear programme.\n\nRelated: US imposes fresh sanctions on Iran over apparent nuclear escalations\n\nOn Friday, the UN nuclear watchdog reported Tehran had installed four of eight new centrifuges at its Fordow facilities, speeding its uranium enrichment facilities.\n\nThe reformist movement that stretches back many decades inside Iran was divided over whether to participate, with many leading figures including political prisoners, such as the Nobel prize winner Narges Mohammadi, calling for a boycott.\n\nOther jailed thinkers on the left such as Majid Tavakoli urged voters from behind bars not to vote.\n\nJudging by the makeup of the sometimes large crowds at Pezeshkian's rallies, the reformists seem to have failed to persuade the younger generation demanding greater cultural freedom that their movement, or the route of the ballot box, offers real change. Some describe Gen Z Iran as depoliticised, and others simply conscious that elected politicians in Iran do not have controls over the levers of power that remain with the supreme leader, and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.\n\nPezeshkian has used video town hall meetings to engage with students and promised no crackdown on those that refuse to wear the hijab. But at the heart of his campaign has been a call that the country's economic travails will not end unless it engages with western economies, including through renegotiating the Iranian nuclear deal. Actively supported by the former foreign minister Javad Zarif, he has accused hardliners of taking Iran down an ideological, cultural and economic cul-de-sac.\n\nThe big question now will be whether those around the supreme leader will hold an honest discussion about the turnout and self-evident alienation of Iranians.\n\nOne Tehran citizen, Kianoosh Sanjari, struck by the contrast between the official TV reports of excitement at the polls and what he had seen on the streets of the capital, travelled to 14 polling booths, and did not find more than five people queueing to vote. He said he then went to Laleh (Tulip) Park, one of his favourite haunts in Tehran, and found old men playing chess under a gazebo, crowds of youngsters playing badminton football and volleyball, and children practising slacklining.\n\n\"I don't know about the situation in other cities, but I can definitely say that the absolute majority of people in Tehran ignored the presidential appointments of the Islamic Republic of Iran and did not participate in them.\"\n\nHe added: \"All the domestic media of Iran served to heat up the oven of this election. Both sides were given a chance to speak their hearts out (and not to someone like me). Both factions sent text messages to the people. They conveyed their message to the people in all social networks.\n\n\"Call it discouragement, despair, indifference or collective consciousness.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType":

He said of 24.5 million votes cast, Pezeshkian got 10.4 million while Jalili received 9.4 million. Parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf got 3.3 million. Shiite cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi had over 206,000 votes.\n\nIranian law requires that a winner gets more than 50% of all votes cast. If not, the race's top two candidates will advance to a runoff a week later. There's been only one runoff presidential election in Iran's history: in 2005, when hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad bested former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\nJanet Jackson, with Nelly opener, mostly wows crowd at Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre Acclaimed St. Louis restaurant Bulrush closes.

More than 1 million votes were voided, according to the results, typically a sign of people feeling obligated to cast a ballot but not wanting to select any of the candidates.\n\nThe overall turnout was 39.9%, according to the results. The 2021 presidential election that elected Raisi saw a 42% turnout, while the March parliamentary election saw a 41% turnout.\n\nThere had been calls for a boycott, including from imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi. Mir Hossein Mousavi, one of the leaders of the 2009 Green Movement protests who remains under house arrest, has also refused to vote along with his wife, his daughter said.\n\nThere's also been criticism that Pezeshkian represents just another government-approved candidate. In a documentary on the reformist candidate aired by state TV, one woman said her generation was \"moving toward the same level\" of animosity with the government that Pezeshkian's generation had in the 1979 revolution.\n\nRaisi, 63, died in the May 19 helicopter crash that also killed the country's foreign minister and others. He was seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and a potential successor. Still, many knew him for his involvement in the mass executions that Iran conducted in 1988, and for his role in the bloody crackdowns on dissent that followed protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained by police over allegedly improperly wearing the mandatory headscarf, or hijab.\n\nThe voting came as wider tensions have gripped the Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn April, Iran launched its first-ever direct attack on Israel over the war in Gaza, while militia groups that Tehran arms in the region -- such as the Lebanese Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels -- are engaged in the fighting and have escalated their attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Republic continues to enrich uranium at near weapons-grade levels and maintains a stockpile large enough to build -- should it choose to do so -- several nuclear weapons.\n\nDespite the recent unrest, there was only one reported attack around the election. Gunmen opened fire on a van transporting ballot boxes in the restive southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, killing two police officers and wounding others, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. The province regularly sees violence between security forces and the militant group Jaish al-Adl, as well as drug traffickers.\n\nVahdat reported from Tehran, Iran.

Only the second time since the 1979 revolution has a presidential election been held, reported Al Jazeera.\n\nMohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, the Conservative Speaker of the Parliament secured 3.38 million votes, and conservative Islamic leader Mostafa Pourmohammadi, got 206,397 votes and was therefore knocked out of the race. Two other candidates, Tehran Mayor Alireza Zakani and government official Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi, dropped out.\n\nMeanwhile, Ghalibaf, Zakani, and Ghazizadeh called on their supporters to vote for Jalili in the run-off next Friday to ensure victory for the \"revolution front\".\n\nThe snap election on Friday occurred inside the 50-day legally mandated deadline for selecting a new president after Ebrahim Raisi and seven others, including Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, were killed in a helicopter accident on May 19.\n\nThe vote on Friday witnessed a low turnout, as has been the case in all key elections over the last four years, but the final figure was far lower than the 45-53 percent predicted by surveys. Raisi was elected with the lowest presidential turnout in Iran's more than four-decade history, at 48.8 per cent, reported Al Jazeera.\n\nThe parliamentary election in March and May had the lowest turnout of any major poll since Iran's 1979 revolution, at slightly less than 41 per cent.\n\nJalili, a senior member of the Supreme National Security Council, has pledged to reduce inflation to single digits and improve economic growth to an impressive 8 per cent, while also combating corruption and incompetence. He recommends taking a stronger stance against the West and its supporters.\n\nPezeshkian was the only moderate among six persons authorized to run by the Guardian Council, the constitutional authority that examines all candidates. His supporters have portrayed him not as a miracle worker, but as a potential president who might make things somewhat better while maintaining that a victory for Jalili would signify a big setback.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Jalili's name is associated with years-long nuclear discussions in the late 2000s and early 2010s, which finally led to Iran's isolation on the global stage.

Turnout was 48% in the 2021 presidential election and a record low of 41% of people voted in a parliamentary election in March.\n\n\"Based on unconfirmed reports, the election is very likely heading to a second round ... Jalili and Pezeshkian will compete in a run-off election,\" Tasnim reported.\n\nIf no candidate wins at least 50% plus one vote from all ballots cast, including blank votes, a run-off between the top two candidates is held on the first Friday after the result is declared.\n\nAll candidates have vowed to revive the flagging economy, beset by mismanagement, state corruption and sanctions re-imposed since 2018, after the United States ditched Tehran's 2015 nuclear pact with six world powers.\n\n\"I think Jalili is the only candidate who raised the issue of justice, fighting corruption and giving value to the poor. ... Most importantly, he does not link Iran's foreign policy to the nuclear deal,\" said Farzan, a 45-year-old artist in the city of Karaj.\n\nPezeshkian is faithful to Iran's theocratic rule, but advocates detente with the West, economic reform, social liberalisation and political pluralism.\n\n\"We will respect the hijab law, but there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behaviour toward women,\" Pezeshkian said after casting his vote.\n\nHe was referring to the death of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman, in 2022 while in morality police custody for allegedly violating the mandatory Islamic dress code.\n\nThe unrest sparked by Amini's death spiralled into the biggest show of opposition to Iran's clerical rulers in years.\n\nPezeshkian attempted to revive the enthusiasm of reform-minded voters who have largely stayed away from the polls for the last four years as a mostly youthful population chafes at political and social curbs. He could also benefit from his rivals' failure to consolidate the hardline vote.\n\n\"I feel Pezeshkian represents both traditional and liberal thoughts,\" said architect Pirouz, 45, who said he had planned to boycott the vote until he learned more about Pezeshkian's plans.\n\nIn the past few weeks, Iranians have made wide use of the hashtag #ElectionCircus on X, with some activists at home and abroad calling for a boycott, saying a high turnout would only serve to legitimise the Islamic Republic.\n\n\"The youth were punished ... young girls were killed on the streets ... We can't easily move on from that. ... After all that happened, it's unconscionable to vote,\" said 55-year-old writer Shahrzad Afrasheh.\n\nIn the 2022/23 protests, more than 500 people including 71 minors were killed, hundreds were injured and thousands arrested, rights groups said.\n\n(Additional reporting by Elwely Elwelly; Writing by Parisa Hafezi; Editing by Peter Graff, Clarence Fernandez, Alex Richardson, Kevin Liffey,

Israel carried out a reported retaliatory strike near Isfahan.\n\nPolling is also being held just five months before a presidential election in the United States, Iran's sworn enemy and Israel's staunch ally.\n\nLeading contenders for Iran's second highest-ranking office are conservative parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, ultraconservative former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili, and the sole reformist, Massoud Pezeshkian.\n\nThe others are conservative Tehran mayor Alireza Zakani, cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi, and incumbent vice president Amirhossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi, the ultraconservative head of the Martyrs' Foundation.\n\nThe six have staged largely low-key campaigns, which included televised debates where they vowed to tackle economic challenges and offered varied views on Iran's relations with the West.\n\nAli Vaez of the International Crisis Group says the new president will also have to tackle the challenge of the deepening \"fissure between the state and society\".\n\n\"Nobody has presented a concrete plan of how they are going to deal with a lot of these issues,\" he said.\n\nSupreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who wields the ultimate authority in Iran, urged \"high participation\" on Friday.\n\nIn the 2021 election that brought Raisi to power, voters shunned the polls after many reformists and moderates were disqualified.\n\nThe turnout then was just under 49 per cent -- the lowest in any presidential election in Iran.\n\nPeople appear divided over whether voting will mean any key concerns being addressed. These include the mounting effects of soaring inflation and the decline of the rial against the dollar.\n\n\"There's no way I'm voting,\" said Neda, an engineer who gave only her first name, in northern Tehran.\n\n\"No matter who takes the post, none of them is sympathetic with the nation. My vote won't affect anything,\" she told AFP.\n\nIn contrast, 60-year-old housewife Jaleh said she was rooting for reformist Pezeshkian, who comes \"from the people\" and could address unemployment and poverty.\n\nReformist figures including former president Mohammad Khatami and ex-foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif have endorsed Pezeshkian.\n\nHowever, some Iranians view the 69-year-old reformist as lacking government experience -- he only served as health minister about 20 years ago.\n\nOf the main contenders, Ghalibaf is a veteran politician and former member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, ideological defenders of the republic after the 1979 revolution.\n\nJalili, an ultraconservative former nuclear negotiator known for his inflexible stance towards the West, seems to be attracting hardline support.\n\nAlireza Valadkhani, a 35-year-old tax consultant, told AFP that he will vote for Ghalibaf as he \"is the only one who can help Iran in its current situation\".\n\nOne concern among voters is whether a new president will mean a potential change to the contentious hijab law for women, particularly since the mass protests triggered by the 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini.\n\nAmini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, was detained for allegedly breaching Iran's dress code which makes women cover their heads and necks and wear modest clothing in public.\n\nSince the protests, women have increasingly flouted the code. But police have toughened controls in recent months on those who ignore the rules.\n\nMost of the candidates have been cautious in the televised debates, saying they generally opposed the use of violence against those who do not wear the mandatory headscarf.\n\n\"For 40 years, we have sought to fix the hijab, but we made the situation worse,\" Pezeshkian said in campaigning. For many women, the idea of a change to the hijab laws seems far-fetched.\n\n\"It is hard for the candidates to fulfil their promises\" on this, said 31-year-old Maryam, who also gave only her first name.\n\nNeda said: \"The hijab law will never be lifted since this is the Islamic republic. \"I don't think any president would be willing to change this law. \"", "source": {"uri": "dawn.com",

However, turnout in Friday's vote hit a historic low of about 40%, based on interior ministry count released on Saturday.\n\nThe election comes at a time of escalating regional tension due to the war between Israel and Iranian allies Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as increased Western pressure on Iran over its fast-advancing nuclear programme.\n\nWith Iran's supreme leader now 85, it is likely that the next president will be closely involved in the process of choosing a successor to Khamenei, who seeks a fiercely loyal president who can ensure a smooth eventual succession to his own position, insiders and analysts say.\n\nAnti-Western views of Jalili, Iran's former uncompromising nuclear negotiator, offer a contrast to those of Pezeshkian. Analysts said Jalili's win would signal the possibility of an even more antagonistic turn in the Islamic Republic's foreign and domestic policy.\n\nBut a victory for mild-mannered lawmaker Pezeshkian might help ease tensions with the West, improve chances of economic reform, social liberalisation and political pluralism.\n\nPezeshkian, faithful to Iran's theocratic rule, is backed by the reformist faction that has largely been sidelined in Iran in recent years.\n\n\"We will respect the hijab law, but there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behaviour toward women,\" Pezeshkian said after casting his vote.\n\nHe was referring to the death of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman, in 2022 while in morality police custody for allegedly violating the mandatory Islamic dress code.\n\nThe unrest sparked by Amini's death spiralled into the biggest show of opposition to Iran's clerical rulers in years.\n\n(Writing by Parisa HafeziEditing by Tomasz Janowski)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@theprint.in", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoud_Pezeshkian", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Masoud Pezeshkian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Leader of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_program_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear program of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Khamenei", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ali Khamenei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Mahsa_Amini", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Death of Mahsa Amini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurds", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kurds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Western_sentiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Western sentiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_religious_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic religious police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralism_(political_philosophy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pluralism (political philosophy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reformism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theocracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Theocracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hijab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Zoroastrianism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Zoroastrianism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/theprint_default_image_new.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692323", "eventUri": "eng-9692323", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Election: Reformist Pezeshkian, Hardliner Jalili Lead - EA WorldView", "body": "In a surprise development, reformist Masoud Pezeshkian and hardliner Saeed Jalili are leading in the first round of Iran's President election.\n\nPezeshkian, an MP and former Health Minister has 5,955,781 votes. Jalili, best known as Iran's lead nuclear negotiator and Secretary of the National Security Council, has 5,560,321.\n\nConservative Parliament Speaker Mohammad-Bagher Ghalibaf is a distant third with 1,891,385 votes. Conservative former Interior Minister Mostafa Pourmohammadi has 111,967.\n\nThe top two candidates proceed to a run-off, unless one has a majority of all valid votes.\n\nSee also A Beginner's Guide to Iran's \"Managed\" Presidential Election\n\nPezeshkian initially appeared to be a token reformist candidate -- all others were blocked by the Guardian Council, which carries out vetting on behalf of Iran's leadership -- in the hope of boosting voter turnout past the historic lows in recent elections.\n\nThe leadership appeared to judge that Pezeshkian would not have the charisma and policies to mobilize mass support. However, the Council may have miscalculated, with centrists and reformists able to rally around a single figure.\n\nOther analysts believe that a strong first-round performance by Pezeshkian is acceptable to the regime, since he would lose to its preferred candidate in the run-off. And there are some who argue that Pezeshkian has curbed his views -- for example, silence on the strict house arrests of opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi, Mehdi Karroubi, and Zahra Rahnavard since February 2011 -- so he has a chance of victory.\n\nThe other surprise so far is the poor performance of Ghalibaf, a high-profile candidate -- this is his fourth run for the Presidency -- who was close with Pezeshkian and Jalili in polling.\n\nEarlier this week, some regime figures called for hardliners and conservatives to rally around a single candidate, apparently from concern about Pezeshkian's unexpected strength in polling.\n\nOne hardline and one conservative dropped out. However, both Ghalibaf and Jalili refused to step aside.\n\nAlmost 15 million ballots have been counted so far -- about 25% of the 61 million Iranians eligible to vote.\n\nIn 2021, official turnout of 48.5%, an all-time low since the Islamic Republic was established in 1979. Earlier this year, Parliamentary elections officially recorded 42% participation.\n\nThe election was called after the death last month of hardline President Ebrahim Raisi, whom the Supreme Leader hailed as his \"servant\", in a helicopter crash as he was returning from Azerbaijan.\n\nIn 2009, Green Movement leader Mousavi, promising reform, appeared to lead the first round amid a surge of enthusiasm across Iran. However, the regime proclaimed that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had \"won\" with 63% of the vote.\n\nMore than a million Iranians took to the streets, calling for a fair election, rights, and reforms. The protests were eventually repressed by regime forces, with widespread detentions, scores of demonstrators slain, and the house arrests of Mousavi, fellow candidate Karroubi, and Mousavi's wife, academic, and activist Rahnavard.\n\nFour years later, the Council disqualified former President Hashemi Rafsanjani, in an attempt to stem centrists and reformists. However, it allowed a consolation candidate, Rafsanjani's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Hassan Rouhani.\n\nThe tactic backfired when Rouhani won a first-round victory, and the Supreme Leader -- probably mindful of 2009 -- decided not to intervene.

My vote won't affect anything,\" she said.\n\nIn contrast, 60 years old housewife Jaleh expressed her support for reformist Pezeshkian, noting his grassroots connection and potential to tackle unemployment and poverty.\n\nReformist leaders, including former president Mohammad Khatami and ex-foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, have endorsed Pezeshkian.\n\nHowever, some Iranians are concerned about the 69 years old reformist's limited government experience, noting that he served only briefly as health minister around 20 years ago.\n\nThe main contenders, Ghalibaf is a veteran politician and former member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, ideological defenders of the republic after the 1979 revolution.\n\nJalili, an ultraconservative former nuclear negotiator known for his unwavering stance towards the West, appears to be attracting hardline support.\n\nAlireza Valadkhani, 35 years old tax consultant, stated he will vote for Ghalibaf because he believes Ghalibaf is the most capable candidate to assist Iran in its current situation.\n\nOne concern among voters is whether the new president will bring about a potential change to Iran's contentious hijab law for women.\n\nThis issue has gained prominence, especially following mass protests sparked by the 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22 years old Iranian Kurd.\n\nAmini was detained for allegedly violating Iran's dress code, which requires women to cover their heads, necks and wear modest clothing in public.\n\nSince the protests, more women have been openly defying these regulations.\n\nNevertheless, police enforcement against rule-breakers has strengthened in recent months.\n\nIn televised debates, most candidates have been careful with their words, typically voicing disapproval of violence against individuals who choose not to wear the mandatory headscarf.\n\n\"For 40 years, we have sought to fix the hijab, but we made the situation worse,\" Pezeshkian said in campaigning.\n\nMany women find the notion of a change to the hijab laws unlikely.\n\n\"It is hard for the candidates to fulfil their promises on this,\" said 31 years old Maryam, who also gave only her first name.\n\nNeda said, \"The hijab law will never be lifted since this is the Islamic republic.\n\n\"I don't think any president would be willing to change this law.\"", "source": {"uri":

The runoff was in part the result of low voter turnout and a crowded field of four candidates, three of whom competed for the conservative vote. Iranian law requires a winner to receive more than 50 percent of all votes cast.\n\nParticipation in another round of voting will strain the energies of an already apathetic electorate, unsatisfied by their leaders at a time of international and domestic turmoil. Iran's economy is cratering under punishing Western sanctions, its citizens' freedoms are increasingly curtailed and its foreign policy is largely shaped by hard-line leaders.\n\nThe campaign, which initially included six candidates -- five conservatives and one reformist -- was notable for how candidly those issues were discussed and a public willingness to attack the status quo. In speeches, televised debates and round-table discussions, the candidates criticized government policies and ridiculed rosy official assessments of Iran's economic prospects as harmful delusions.\n\nPublic dissatisfaction in any new president's ability to bring change was reflected in low turnout for the election: According to Iran's state news agency, only 40 percent of eligible voters cast ballots.\n\nIn the official results announced on Saturday, Dr. Pezeshkian led with 10.4 million votes (42.4 percent), followed by Mr. Jalili at 9.4 million (38.6 percent). A third conservative candidate, Gen. Mohammad Baqer Ghalibaf, the current speaker of Parliament and former mayor of Tehran, was a distant third at 3.3 million (13.8 percent).", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reformism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Two-round system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebrahim_Raisi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ebrahim Raisi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hijab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoud_Pezeshkian", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Masoud Pezeshkian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saeed_Jalili", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saeed Jalili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voter turnout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Bagher_Ghalibaf", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Status quo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/29/world/29iran-election-HFO-retop/29iran-election-HFO-retop-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692323", "eventUri": "eng-9692323", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-05", "textStart": 654, "textEnd": 660}], "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

A fourth candidate, Mostafa Pourmohammadi, a former justice minister who ran a wild card campaign, won only 206,000. A total of 24,735,185 people voted.\n\nAs the first vote tallies were announced, Pezeshkian was just behind Jalili, but he then overtook him and pushed ahead.\n\nA runoff on Friday seems inevitable and will offer a straight ideological choice between Pezeshkian and Jalili.\n\nUnless Pezeshkian can galvanise more voters to turn out, on the basis that the first round proved that he has a viable chance of winning and can change Iran, the reformist is likely to lose a runoff. The bulk, but not all, of the Ghalibaf votes are predicted to switch to Jalili. The rivalry between Ghalibaf and Jalili - both personal and ideological - was enough to prevent them reaching a pre-polling pact.\n\nThe snap election was called after the death of President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash. In 2021, Raisi secured 18m votes, only 6m less than the total number of votes recorded as cast in 2024. Detailed comparisons showed that turnout was down in 2021 in almost all provinces except in Tehran and Qom.\n\nAbbas Akhoundi, a leading reformist, warned: \"About 60% of voters did not participate in the elections. Their message was clear. They object to the institutionalised discrimination in the existing governance and do not accept that they are second-class citizens and that a minority impose their will on the majority of Iranian society as first-class citizens.\n\n\"A large part of Iranian society does not see a place for itself in the ruling political institutions. Therefore, they had the right not to participate in the elections. The government should know that, if this procedure continues, this part of society will get bigger because even some of those who voted agree with this group.\"\n\nSix candidates, including five Conservatives, two of whom dropped out on the eve of the poll, were approved as qualified to stand by the Guardian Council, an unelected constitutional watchdog whose members are directly and indirectly appointed by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nThe decision to allow a reformist to stand was seen as a concession by the regime, which needed a more competitive election to try to lure voters to the polls.\n\nIran needs leaders with legitimacy as it supports resistance movements across the Middle East, confronts unelected Gulf monarchies and challenges the west over the purpose and scale of its currently expanding nuclear programme.\n\nOn Friday, the UN nuclear watchdog reported Tehran had installed four of eight new centrifuges at its Fordow facilities, speeding its uranium enrichment facilities.\n\nThe reformist movement that stretches back many decades inside Iran was divided over whether to participate, with many leading figures including political prisoners, such as the Nobel prize winner Narges Mohammadi, calling for a boycott.\n\nOther jailed thinkers on the left such as Majid Tavakoli urged voters from behind bars not to vote.\n\nJudging by the makeup of the sometimes large crowds at Pezeshkian's rallies, the reformists seem to have failed to persuade the younger generation demanding greater cultural freedom that their movement, or the route of the ballot box, offers real change. Some describe Gen Z Iran as depoliticised, and others simply conscious that elected politicians in Iran do not have controls over the levers of power that remain with the supreme leader, and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.\n\nPezeshkian has used video town hall meetings to engage with students and promised no crackdown on those that refuse to wear the hijab. But at the heart of his campaign has been a call that the country's economic travails will not end unless it engages with western economies, including through renegotiating the Iranian nuclear deal. Actively supported by the former foreign minister Javad Zarif, he has accused hardliners of taking Iran down an ideological, cultural and economic cul-de-sac.\n\nThe big question now will be whether those around the supreme leader will hold an honest discussion about the turnout and self-evident alienation of Iranians.\n\nOne Tehran citizen, Kianoosh Sanjari, struck by the contrast between the official TV reports of excitement at the polls and what he had seen on the streets of the capital, travelled to 14 polling booths, and did not find more than five people queueing to vote. He said he then went to Laleh (Tulip) Park, one of his favourite haunts in Tehran, and found old men playing chess under a gazebo, crowds of youngsters playing badminton football and volleyball, and children practising slacklining.\n\n\"I don't know about the situation in other cities, but I can definitely say that the absolute majority of people in Tehran ignored the presidential appointments of the Islamic Republic of Iran and did not participate in them.\"\n\nHe added: \"All the domestic media of Iran served to heat up the oven of this election. Both sides were given a chance to speak their hearts out (and not to someone like me). Both factions sent text messages to the people. They conveyed their message to the people in all social networks.\n\n\"Call it discouragement, despair, indifference or collective consciousness.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType":

My vote won't affect anything,\" she told AFP.\n\nIn contrast, 60-year-old housewife Jaleh said she was rooting for reformist Pezeshkian, who comes \"from the people\" and could address unemployment and poverty.\n\nReformist figures including former president Mohammad Khatami and ex-foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif have endorsed Pezeshkian.\n\nHowever, some Iranians view the 69-year-old reformist as lacking government experience -- he only served as health minister about 20 years ago.\n\nOf the main contenders, Ghalibaf is a veteran politician and former member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, ideological defenders of the republic after the 1979 revolution.\n\n- Dress code concerns -\n\nJalili, an ultraconservative former nuclear negotiator known for his inflexible stance towards the West, seems to be attracting hardline support.\n\nAlireza Valadkhani, a 35-year-old tax consultant, told AFP he will vote for Ghalibaf as he \"is the only one who can help Iran in its current situation\".\n\nOne concern among voters is whether a new president will mean a potential change to the contentious hijab law for women, particularly since the mass protests triggered by the 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini.\n\nAmini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, was detained for allegedly breaching Iran's dress code which makes women cover their heads and necks and wear modest clothing in public.\n\nSince the protests, women have increasingly flouted the code. But police have toughened controls in recent months on those who ignore the rules.\n\nMost of the candidates have been cautious in the televised debates, saying they generally opposed the use of violence against those who do not wear the mandatory headscarf.\n\n\"For 40 years, we have sought to fix the hijab, but we made the situation worse,\" Pezeshkian said in campaigning.\n\nFor many women, the idea of a change to the hijab laws seems far-fetched.\n\n\"It is hard for the candidates to fulfil their promises\" on this, said 31-year-old Maryam, who also gave only her first name.\n\nNeda said: \"The hijab law will never be lifted since this is the Islamic republic.\n\n\"I don't think any president would be willing to change this law.\"", "source": {"uri":

Iran Presidential Race", "body": "TEMPO.CO, Dubai - A low-key moderate and a protege of Iran's supreme leader are neck-and-neck in the vote count in snap presidential elections marked by voter apathy over economic hardships and social restrictions.\n\nMore than 14 million votes have been counted so far from Friday's vote, June 28, of which the sole moderate candidate Massoud Pezeshkian had won over 5.9 million votes and his hardline challenger former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili over 5.5 million, provisional results by the interior ministry showed.\n\nSome insiders said the turnout was around 40%, lower than expected by Iran's clerical rulers, while witnesses told Reuters that polling stations in Tehran and some other cities were not crowded.\n\nIran's Tasnim news agency said a run-off election was \"very likely\" to pick the next president following the death of Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nIf no candidate wins at least 50% plus one vote from all ballots cast, including blank votes, a run-off between the top two candidates is held on the first Friday after the result is declared.\n\nThe election coincides with escalating regional tension due to the war between Israel and Iranian allies Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as increased Western pressure on Iran over its fast-advancing nuclear program.\n\nWhile the election is unlikely to bring a major shift in the Islamic Republic's policies, its outcome could influence the succession to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's 85-year-old supreme leader, in power since 1989.\n\nThe clerical establishment sought a high turnout to offset a legitimacy crisis fuelled by public discontent over economic hardship and curbs on political and social freedom.\n\nThe next president is not expected to usher in any major policy shift on Iran's nuclear program or support for militia groups across the Middle East, since Khamenei calls all the shots on top state matters.\n\nHowever, the president runs the government day-to-day and can influence the tone of Iran's foreign and domestic policy.\n\nPezeshkian's views offer a contrast to those of Jalili, advocating detente with the West, economic reform, social liberalization, and political pluralism.\n\nA staunch anti-Westerner, Jalili's win would signal the possibility of an even more antagonistic turn in the Islamic Republic's foreign and domestic policy, analysts said.\n\nREUTERS", "source": {"uri": "en.tempo.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "TEMPO.CO"}, "authors": [{"uri": "laila_afifa@en.tempo.co", "name": "Laila

With million of votes counted so far in Iran's snap presidential election, two candidates have emerged neck and neck - the sole moderate candidate, and a hardline conservative.\n\nElectoral officials opened ballot boxes early Saturday, after polling ended midnight.\n\nPreliminary results show moderate candidate Massoud Pezeshkian and his hardline challenger, former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili in the lead.\n\nPezeshkian, faithful to Iran's theocratic rule, has publicly criticized authorities over the death of Mahsa Amini.\n\nShe's an Iranian Kurdish woman who died in custody for allegedly violating Islamic dress code, and her death sparked mass unrest in Iran in 2022.\n\nJalili is a protege of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's 85-year-old supreme leader.\n\nA staunch anti-Westerner, analysts say him winning could signal an even more antagonistic turn in the Islamic Republic's foreign and domestic policy.\n\nThe election was sparked after the death of Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nIt comes as tensions spike in the Middle East due to the war in Gaza, and Iranians face a struggling economy and U.S. sanctions.\n\nThe end result of the vote is unlikely to alter Iran's backing for militant groups and its relations with the West.\n\nBut it could alter domestic policies, and may shape succession to Khamenei, who's been in power since 1989.\n\nPublic discontent, especially among Iran's youth, has kept voters away in recent elections.\n\nSome insiders said the turnout was around 40%, lower than expected by Iran's clerical rulers.\n\nIn the past few weeks, Iranians have made wide use of the hashtag #ElectionCircus on X.\n\nSome activists at home and abroad called for a boycott, saying a high turnout would only serve to legitimize the Islamic Republic.",

A hardline watchdog body approved only six from an initial pool of 80 and two hardline candidates subsequently dropped out.\n\n\u201cBased on unconfirmed reports, the election is very likely heading to a second round \u2026 Jalili and Pezeshkian will compete in a run-off election,\u201d Tasnim reported.\n\nCritics of the clerical establishment say that low turnouts in recent years show the system\u2019s legitimacy has eroded. Turnout was 48 per cent in the 2021 presidential election and a record low of 41 per cent of people voted in a parliamentary election in March.\n\nAll candidates have vowed to revive the flagging economy, beset by mismanagement, state corruption and sanctions reimposed since 2018, after the US ditched Tehran\u2019s nuclear pact.\n\n\u201cI think Jalili is the only candidate who raised the issue of justice, fighting corruption and giving value to the poor. \u2026 Most importantly, he does not link Iran\u2019s foreign policy to the nuclear deal,\u201d said Farzan, a 45-year-old artist in the city of Karaj.\n\nPezeshkian, faithful to Iran\u2019s theocratic rule, is backed by the reformist faction that has largely been sidelined in Iran in recent years.\n\n\u201cWe will respect the hijab law, but there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behaviour toward women,\u201d Pezeshkian said after casting his vote.\n\nHe was referring to the death of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman, in 2022 while in morality police custody for allegedly violating the mandatory Islamic dress code.\n\nThe unrest sparked by Amini\u2019s death spiralled into the biggest show of opposition to Iran\u2019s clerical rulers in years.\n\nPezeshkian attempted to revive the enthusiasm of reform-minded voters who have largely stayed away from the polls for the last four years as a mostly youthful population chafes at political and social curbs. He could also benefit from his rivals\u2019 failure to consolidate the hardline vote.\n\nIn the past few weeks, Iranians have made wide use of the hashtag #ElectionCircus on X, with some activists at home and abroad calling for a boycott, saying a high turnout would only serve to legitimise the Islamic republic.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning

The republic is also preparing for the eventual succession when Khamenei, 85, dies.\n\nThe emergency vote was held after hardline president Ebrahim Raisi, a cleric and potential successor to Khamenei, died in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nReformist politicians had been energised by the authorities' surprise decision to allow Pezeshkian's candidacy after the presidential election in 2021 and this year's parliamentary poll saw leading reformist and centrist contenders barred from competing.\n\nBut many voters who would typically back a moderate candidate have grown increasingly disillusioned with their leaders, angered by the country's economic malaise, social restrictions and isolation from the west. They have given up on the notion that change can come from within the regime and are loath to be seen to be legitimising the theocratic system through the ballot box.\n\nThe mood darkened after the 2021 presidential vote that brought Raisi to power, with many believing the result was preordained as leading reformists were prevented from competing. Turnout at that election was 48 per cent, the lowest for a presidential poll since the 1979 Islamic revolution.\n\nThe following year, mass anti-regime protests erupted after Mahsa Amini, 22, died in police custody after being arrested for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly. This year, social media campaigns have urged people not to vote, saying it would be a betrayal of those killed during the crackdown on demonstrations.\n\nAs a result, not voting has become a form of silent protest against the regime in a nation with a youthful population.\n\n\"Iranian society has completely transformed since 2022 [since the Amini protests],\" said Mohammad-Reza Javadi-Yeganeh, a sociologist, in a post on X. \"Neither the theoretical frameworks nor previous methods of opinion polls are capable of understanding the new society.\"\n\nReformist politicians will cling to the hope that in a run-off between Pezeshkian and Jalili, more Iranians will be mobilised to go to the polls.\n\nPezeshkian, 69, has promised to revive negotiations with the US to resolve Tehran's nuclear stand-off with the west and secure sanctions relief, while also suggesting he would ease social restrictions, including a more relaxed stance towards compulsory hijabs for women.\n\nBut Jalili, 58, will be betting that his chances are bolstered now that he is the sole hardliner running and hoping that the conservative base will unite around him.\n\nTypically, hardline candidates withdraw from the race to rally behind the leading candidate shortly before voters go to the poll. This time, however, neither Jalili, nor Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, the other leading hardliner who was trailing in third, were willing to step aside despite pressure from within their camp, splitting the conservative vote.\n\nGhalibaf threw his weight behind Jalili after the results were announced.\n\nIf Jalili is victorious, analysts warned that he would enforce social restrictions more rigorously and be more hostile to any engagement with the US or other western powers.\n\nWhile Pezeshkian and Ghalibaf suggested they would be open to negotiations with the west, Jalili told supporters that he would \"use the existing economic potential to make the enemy regret imposing sanctions [on Iran]\".\n\nAlthough important foreign policy and domestic decisions are determined by the supreme leader, the president can influence the tone of government both in the republic and in its foreign engagements.\n\nBut the challenge for Pezeshkian will be convincing wary Iranians that he can make a difference as president in a system where the supreme leader has ultimate authority and elected and unelected hardline centres of power, including the elite Revolutionary Guards, have significant sway over foreign and domestic policy.\n\n\"We don't see any reason for voting,\" said Saba, a 22-year-old student. \"No one can change things, they [the president] are just a small part of a big circle and no one can change it.\"", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

reformist candidate running for Iran's presidency", "body": "Pezeshkian is a prominent reformist figure and former health minister and lawmaker\n\nA seasoned Iranian lawmaker and former health minister, Masoud Pezeshkian stunningly raced past his opponents in the snap presidential election on Friday, receiving the most votes.\n\nAccording to the final results announced by Iran's Interior Ministry on Saturday morning, less than 12 hours after the voting lines closed, the reformist candidate received 10.4 million votes out of a total of 24.5 million votes counted.\n\nSaeed Jalili, the former lead nuclear negotiator, came in second with 9.4 million votes and will face Pezeskian in the run-off election on July 5.\n\nA relatively low-profile political figure, Pezeshkian served as the health minister in the government of Mohammad Khatami (2001-2005) and has represented the northwestern city of Tabriz in the Iranian parliament since 2008.\n\nA cardiologist by training, Pezeshkian previously also headed the Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, one of the leading medical institutions in northern Iran.\n\nHis two previous unsuccessful bids for the presidency came in 2013 and 2021, respectively.\n\nIn 2013, he withdrew from the race in the later stages in favor of former President Hashemi Rafsanjani, and in 2021, his candidacy was rejected by the Guardian Council, the country's top vetting body.\n\nAs the only reformist candidate in the race this time, backed by the country's leading reformist coalition, Pezeshkian engaged in hectic campaigning in the past few weeks.\n\nHis campaign was bolstered by the presence of many former reformist politicians and ministers, including Javad Zarif, who served as Iran's foreign minister for two terms under former President Hassan Rouhani.\n\nPre-election opinion polls showed significant support for Pezeshkian, especially after the five televised presidential debates in which he was vocal about both domestic and foreign policy issues.\n\nPezeshkian has given indications that he is more open to diplomatic engagement with the world, including the West, and intends to initiate reforms in both economic and cultural domains.\n\nIn presidential debates, he asserted that sanctions were acting as a roadblock in attracting trade partners and that achieving an 8% growth rate was impossible without opening borders.\n\nHe also vigorously defended the 2015 nuclear deal that was reached between Iran and the world powers during the administration of his fellow reformist Rouhani.\n\nPezeshkian has also been vocal about women-centric issues, including the mandatory Hijab (Islamic headscarf), expressing his opposition to the parliamentary bill on the implementation of the Islamic dress code bill that was introduced following the death of Mahsa Amini in late 2022.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu Ajans\u0131"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

A hardline watchdog body approved only six from an initial pool of 80 and two hardline candidates subsequently dropped out.\n\n\"Based on unconfirmed reports, the election is very likely heading to a second round ... Jalili and Pezeshkian will compete in a run-off election,\" Tasnim reported.\n\nCritics of the clerical establishment say that low turnouts in recent years show the system's legitimacy has eroded. Turnout was 48% in the 2021 presidential election and a record low of 41% of people voted in a parliamentary election in March.\n\nAll candidates have vowed to revive the flagging economy, beset by mismanagement, state corruption and sanctions re-imposed since 2018, after the U.S. ditched Tehran's nuclear pact.\n\n\"I think Jalili is the only candidate who raised the issue of justice, fighting corruption and giving value to the poor. ... Most importantly, he does not link Iran's foreign policy to the nuclear deal,\" said Farzan, a 45-year-old artist in the city of Karaj.\n\nPezeshkian, faithful to Iran's theocratic rule, is backed by the reformist faction that has largely been sidelined in Iran in recent years.\n\n\"We will respect the hijab law, but there should never be any intrusive or inhumane behaviour toward women,\" Pezeshkian said after casting his vote.\n\nHe was referring to the death of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman, in 2022 while in morality police custody for allegedly violating the mandatory Islamic dress code.\n\nThe unrest sparked by Amini's death spiralled into the biggest show of opposition to Iran's clerical rulers in years.\n\nPezeshkian attempted to revive the enthusiasm of reform-minded voters who have largely stayed away from the polls for the last four years as a mostly youthful population chafes at political and social curbs. He could also benefit from his rivals' failure to consolidate the hardline vote.\n\nIn the past few weeks, Iranians have made wide use of the hashtag #ElectionCircus on X, with some activists at home and abroad calling for a boycott, saying a high turnout would only serve to legitimise the Islamic Republic.\n\n(Additional reporting by Elwely ElwellyWriting by Parisa Hafezi; Editing by Peter Graff,

My vote won't affect anything,\" she told AFP.\n\nIn contrast, Jaleh, a 60-year-old housewife, said she supported reformist Pezeshkian, who is \"from the people\" and could handle unemployment and poverty.\n\nFormer President Mohammad Khatami and former Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif have endorsed Pezeshkian.\n\nHowever, some Iranians believe the 69-year-old reformist lacks government experience, having only served as health minister approximately 20 years ago.\n\nGhalibaf, one of the primary contenders, is a seasoned politician and former member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which ideologically supported the republic following the 1979 revolution.\n\nDress code concerns\n\nJalili, an ultraconservative former nuclear negotiator known for his rigid stance toward the West, appears to be gaining hardline backing.\n\nAlireza Valadkhani, a 35-year-old tax specialist, told AFP that he will vote for Ghalibaf because he \"is the only one who can help Iran in its current situation\".\n\nVoters are concerned that a new president could mean a potential modification to the disputed hijab law for women, especially in light of the enormous protests sparked by Mahsa Amini's death in detention in 2022.\n\nAmini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, was jailed for allegedly violating Iran's dress code, which requires women to cover their heads and necks and dress modestly in public.\n\nSince the uprisings, women have increasingly broken the code. In recent months, police have increased penalties for breaking the laws.\n\nThe majority of the contenders have been careful during the televised debates, stating that they generally condemn the use of violence against people who do not wear the mandated headscarf.\n\n\"For 40 years, we have sought to fix the hijab, but we made the situation worse,\" Pezeshkian said in campaigning.\n\nFor many women, the idea of a change to the hijab laws seems far-fetched.\n\n\"It is hard for the candidates to fulfil their promises\" on this, said 31-year-old Maryam, who also gave only her first name.\n\nNeda said: \"The hijab law will never be lifted since this is the Islamic republic.\n\n\"I don't think any president would be willing to change this law.\"", "source": {"uri":

Jalili promises to resolve Iran's issues through hardline principles, appealing to lower-income voters. His win could mark a more antagonistic shift in Iran's foreign and domestic policies.\n\nSaeed Jalili, a zealous ideologue loyal to Iran's supreme leader, plans to resolve the country's social, political and economic ills by adhering rigidly to the hardline ideals of the 1979 Islamic Revolution if he wins the country's presidential election.\n\nJalili was narrowly beaten in Friday's first round vote by moderate Massoud Pezeshkian but the two men will now face a run-off election on July 5, since Pezeshkian did not secure the majority of 50% plus one vote of ballots cast needed to win outright. Jalili, a former diplomat, describes himself as a pious believer in \"velayat-e faqih\", or rule by supreme jurisprudence, the system of Islamic government that provides the basis for Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's paramount position.\n\nHis staunch defence of the 45-year-old Islamic revolution appears designed to appeal to hardline, religiously-devout lower-income voters but offered little to young and urban Iranians frustrated by curbs on political and social freedoms. Once Iran's top nuclear negotiator, Jalili, 58, was one of four candidates in the election for a successor to Ebrahim Raisi, who was killed in a helicopter crash in May.\n\nHe is currently a member of a body that mediates in disputes between parliament and the Guardian Council, a body that screens election candidates for their political and Islamic qualifications. A staunch anti-Westerner, Jalili's advance to the second round signals the possibility of an even more antagonistic turn in the Islamic Republic's foreign and domestic policy, analysts said.\n\nForeign and nuclear policy are the domain of Khamenei, who wields supreme command of the armed forces, has the power to declare war and appoints senior figures including armed forces commanders, judicial heads and the head of the state media. However, the president can influence the tone of foreign and domestic policy.\n\nInsiders and analysts say Khamenei, 85, seeks a strongly loyal president to run the government day-to-day and to be a trusted ally who can ensure stability, amid manoeuvring over the eventual succession to his own position. UNCOMPROMISING STANCE\n\nJalili is an opponent of Tehran's 2015 nuclear pact with major powers that was negotiated on the Iranian side by a group of pragmatic officials open to detente with the West. Then-President Donald Trump reneged on the accord in 2018 and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy. With the possible return of Trump to the White House after November's U.S. presidential election and Jalili's possible election win, the deal's resurgence seems improbable.\n\nBefore the nuclear pact, Jalili served as Iran's top nuclear negotiator for five years from 2007, a period in which Tehran took a confrontational and uncompromising approach to discussions with global powers about its uranium enrichment programme. In those years, three U.N. Security Council resolutions were imposed on Iran, and several attempts to resolve the dispute failed.\n\nDuring the current election campaign, Jalili was heavily criticised in debates on state TV by other candidates for his uncompromising nuclear stance and his opposition to Iran signing up to two conventions on financial crime recommended by the Financial Action Taskforce, an international crime watchdog. Some hardliners, like Jalili, argue that the acceptance of the Convention on Combating the Financing of Terrorism and the Convention on Combating Transnational Organized Crime could hamper Iran's support for its paramilitary proxies across the region, including Lebanon's Hezbollah.\n\nPRODUCT OF THE REVOLUTION Jalili has been trying for the presidency for years. He finished third in the 2013 contest, and stood again in 2021 but eventually withdrew to support Raisi.\n\nBorn in the holy Muslim Shi'ite city of Mashhad in 1965, Jalili lost his right leg in the 1980s in fighting during the Iran-Iraq war and joined the Foreign Ministry in 1989. Despite his hardline views, he is outwardly soft-spoken. He gained a doctorate in political science at Imam Sadiq University, a training ground for Iranian leaders, where he wrote a study entitled \"Foreign policy of (the) Prophet of Islam\", according to a biography that was for a time posted on the Foreign Ministry website for a time.\n\nFor four years from 2001, he worked at Khamenei's office. When hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was elected president in 2005, he chose Jalili to be his adviser, and within months made him deputy foreign minister.\n\nJalili was appointed in 2007 as the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, a post that automatically made him chief nuclear negotiator.

My vote won't affect anything,\" she told AFP.\n\nIn contrast, 60-year-old housewife Jaleh said she was rooting for reformist Pezeshkian, who comes \"from the people\" and could address unemployment and poverty.\n\nReformist figures including former president Mohammad Khatami and ex-foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif have endorsed Pezeshkian.\n\nHowever, some Iranians view the 69-year-old reformist as lacking government experience -- he only served as health minister about 20 years ago.\n\nOf the main contenders, Ghalibaf is a veteran politician and former member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, ideological defenders of the republic after the 1979 revolution.\n\n- Dress code concerns -\n\nJalili, an ultraconservative former nuclear negotiator known for his inflexible stance towards the West, seems to be attracting hardline support.\n\nAlireza Valadkhani, a 35-year-old tax consultant, told AFP he will vote for Ghalibaf as he \"is the only one who can help Iran in its current situation\".\n\nOne concern among voters is whether a new president will mean a potential change to the contentious hijab law for women, particularly since the mass protests triggered by the 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini.\n\nAmini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, was detained for allegedly breaching Iran's dress code which makes women cover their heads and necks and wear modest clothing in public.\n\nSince the protests, women have increasingly flouted the code. But police have toughened controls in recent months on those who ignore the rules.\n\nMost of the candidates have been cautious in the televised debates, saying they generally opposed the use of violence against those who do not wear the mandatory headscarf.\n\n\"For 40 years, we have sought to fix the hijab, but we made the situation worse,\" Pezeshkian said in campaigning.\n\nFor many women, the idea of a change to the hijab laws seems far-fetched.\n\n\"It is hard for the candidates to fulfil their promises\" on this, said 31-year-old Maryam, who also gave only her first name.\n\nNeda said: \"The hijab law will never be lifted since this is the Islamic republic.\n\n\"I don't think any president would be willing to change this law.\"", "source": {"uri":

The remaining 4.7 million votes were split between other candidates or voided. Jalili, a former nuclear negotiator for the late President Ibrahim Raisi, is expected to pull ahead after the conservative vote consolidates in next Friday's runoff.\n\nThe election comes as the Israel-Gaza war inflames regional tensions.

Provisional estimates by state-affiliated media put turnout at about 40 per cent of the 61mn eligible voters, which would be a record low.\n\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, said on Friday that a high turnout was an \"absolute necessity\" and that Iran's \"durability, stability, honour and dignity in the world\" depended on people's votes.\n\nThe election comes at a crucial time for the regime amid heightened tensions with the west triggered by the Israel-Hamas war and Tehran's expansion of its nuclear programme. The republic is also preparing for the eventual succession to supreme leader when Khamenei, 85, dies.\n\nThe emergency vote was held after hardline president Ebrahim Raisi, a cleric and potential successor to Khamenei, died in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nReformist politicians had been energised by the authorities' surprise decision to allow Pezeshkian's candidacy after the presidential election in 2021 and this year's parliamentary poll saw leading reformist and centrist contenders barred from competing.\n\nBut many voters who would typically back a reformist candidate have grown increasingly disillusioned with their leaders, angered by the country's economic malaise, social restrictions and isolation from the west. They have given up on the notion that change can come from within the regime and are loath to be seen to be legitimising the theocratic system through the ballot box.\n\nThe mood darkened after the 2021 presidential vote that brought Raisi to power, with many believing the result was preordained as leading reformists were prevented from competing. Turnout at that election was 48 per cent, the lowest for a presidential poll since the 1979 Islamic revolution.\n\nThe following year, mass anti-regime protests erupted after Mahsa Amini, 22, died in police custody after being arrested for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly. This year, social media campaigns have urged people not to vote, saying it would be a betrayal of those killed during the crackdown on demonstrations.\n\nAs a result, not voting has become a form of silent protest against the regime in a nation with a youthful population.\n\n\"Iranian society has completely transformed since 2022 [since the Amini protests],\" said Mohammad-Reza Javadi-Yeganeh, a sociologist, in a post on X. \"Neither the theoretical frameworks nor previous methods of opinion polls are capable of understanding the new society.\"\n\nReformist politicians will cling to the hope that in a run-off between Pezeshkian and Jalili, more Iranians will be mobilised to go to the polls.\n\nPezeshkian, 69, has promised to revive negotiations with the US to resolve Tehran's nuclear stand-off with the west and secure sanctions relief, while also suggesting he would ease social restrictions, including a more relaxed stance towards compulsory hijabs for women.\n\nBut Jalili, 58, will be betting that his chances are bolstered now that he is the sole hardliner running and hoping that the conservative base will unite around him.\n\nTypically, hardline candidates withdraw from the race to rally behind the leading candidate shortly before voters go to the poll. This time, however, neither Jalili, nor Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, the other leading hardliner who was trailing in third, were willing to step aside despite pressure from within their camp, splitting the conservative vote.\n\nIf Jalili is victorious, analysts warned that he would enforce social restrictions more rigorously and be more hostile to any engagement with the US or other western powers.\n\nWhile Pezeshkian, and even Ghalibaf, suggested they would be open to negotiations with the west, Jalili told supporters that he would \"use the existing economic potential to make the enemy regret imposing sanctions [on Iran]\".\n\nAlthough important foreign policy and domestic decisions are determined by the supreme leader, the president can influence the tone of government both in the republic and in its foreign engagements.\n\nBut the challenge for Pezeshkian will be convincing wary Iranians that he can make a difference as president in a system where the supreme leader has ultimate authority and elected and unelected hardline centres of power, including the elite Revolutionary Guards, have significant sway over foreign and domestic policy.\n\n\"We don't see any reason for voting,\" said Saba, a 22-year-old student. \"No one can change things, they [the president] are just a small part of a big circle and no one can change it.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com",

Here is a look at the candidate list:\n\nMohammad Bagher Ghalibaf - Ghalibaf, 62, is a prominent conservative who has served as parliament speaker since 2020.\n\nBorn on September 23, 1961 near the northeastern city of Mashhad, he has held various governmental roles including mayor of Tehran. Ghalibaf has run for the presidency three times -- 2005, 2013 and 2017, the last of which he withdrew from to support Raisi's candidacy. Before entering politics, he was in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the ideological defenders of the Islamic republic. Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei appointed him as head of the Guards' air force in 1997, and he became the head of the police force in 2000.\n\nAmir-Hossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi - Ghazizadeh-Hashemi, 53, is a medical doctor and a staunch supporter of Raisi's government. Born on April 14, 1971, he serves as vice-president and heads the Martyrs' Foundation. Previously, he represented Mashhad in parliament for four consecutive terms. In the 2021 presidential election, he secured 3.5 percent of the vote.\n\n- Saeed Jalili - Jalili, 58, is a former nuclear negotiator known for his uncompromising anti-West stance. Born on September 6, 1965 in Mashhad, he was selected by Khamenei as one of his representatives in Iran's Supreme National Security Council. A veteran of the Iran-Iraq war, Jalili lost a foot during his service. He led Iran's nuclear programme negotiations between 2007 and 2013 and strongly opposed the 2015 nuclear deal with the United States and Western governments, which aimed to curb Tehran's nuclear activity in return for sanctions relief.\n\nJalili ran for president in 2013 and supported Raisi in 2017, withdrawing his candidacy.\n\n- Massoud Pezeshkian - Pezeshkian, 69, is the oldest candidate and the sole reformist in the race. Born on September 29, 1954, he is an outspoken heart surgeon who has represented the northwestern city of Tabriz in parliament since 2008. He was health minister in the government of former reformist president Mohammad Khatami. In the 2021 presidential race that brought Raisi to power, he was disqualified alongside other reformist and moderate candidates. Recently, he criticised Raisi's government for lacking transparency during nationwide protests triggered by the September 2022 death in police custody of Mahsa Amini.\n\n- Mostafa Pourmohammadi - Pourmohammadi, 64, is the only cleric in Iran's presidential elections. A conservative and a veteran politician, he was born on December 23, 1959 in the religious city of Qom. He held multiple positions over his career including in Iran's intelligence ministry. Pourmohammadi took the post of interior minister under the government of president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and served as justice minister under moderate president Hassan Rouhani.\n\nAlireza Zakani - Zakani, 58, who has served as Tehran's mayor since August 2021. Born in the capital on April 2, 1965, he is a veteran of the Iran-Iraq war. Zakani was a candidate in the 2021 presidential election before withdrawing to support Raisi. He was disqualified from running in 2013 and 2017. He was a lawmaker for four separate terms, representing Tehran for three terms and Qom for one. He was a staunch critic of the 2015 nuclear deal.", "source": {"uri": "omanobserver.om", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oman Observer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@omanobserver.om",

My vote won't affect anything,\" she told AFP.\n\nIn contrast, 60-year-old housewife Jaleh said she was rooting for reformist Pezeshkian, who comes \"from the people\" and could address unemployment and poverty.\n\nReformist figures including former president Mohammad Khatami and ex-foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif have endorsed Pezeshkian.\n\nHowever, some Iranians view the 69-year-old reformist as lacking government experience -- he only served as health minister about 20 years ago.\n\nOf the main contenders, Ghalibaf is a veteran politician and former member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, ideological defenders of the republic after the 1979 revolution.\n\n- Dress code concerns -\n\nJalili, an ultraconservative former nuclear negotiator known for his inflexible stance towards the West, seems to be attracting hardline support.\n\nAlireza Valadkhani, a 35-year-old tax consultant, told AFP he will vote for Ghalibaf as he \"is the only one who can help Iran in its current situation\".\n\nOne concern among voters is whether a new president will mean a potential change to the contentious hijab law for women, particularly since the mass protests triggered by the 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini.\n\nAmini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, was detained for allegedly breaching Iran's dress code which makes women cover their heads and necks and wear modest clothing in public.\n\nSince the protests, women have increasingly flouted the code. But police have toughened controls in recent months on those who ignore the rules.\n\nMost of the candidates have been cautious in the televised debates, saying they generally opposed the use of violence against those who do not wear the mandatory headscarf.\n\n\"For 40 years, we have sought to fix the hijab, but we made the situation worse,\" Pezeshkian said in campaigning.\n\nFor many

According to the Interior Ministry in Tehran, none of the four candidates won an absolute majority in the first round of the 14th presidential election on Friday. The two best-placed candidates, former health minister Masoud Pezeshkian and former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili, received a good 42 percent and just under 39 percent of the vote respectively, according to official figures. Pezeshkian is considered moderate to reform-oriented, while Jalili is categorised as strictly conservative.\n\nThe incumbent conservative parliamentary speaker Mohammed Bagher Ghalibaf follows in third place with around 14 percent of the vote, as the head of the election board reported on state television. The fourth candidate, cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi, received less than one percent of the vote. As the votes are counted by hand, it is likely to take two days before the final result is available.\n\nAround 61 million voters were called upon to elect a new head of government on Friday. According to the Ministry of the Interior, voter turnout in the first round was around 40 percent, a historic low. After the ultra-conservative Guardian Council had only authorised a few candidates, numerous organisations, including NGOs, parties and activists in Rojhilat (East Kurdistan) called for an election boycott.

Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, a conservative former speaker of parliament, trailed with 14 percent.\n\nThe fourth approved candidate in the running, Mostafa Purmohammadi, a former justice and interior minister, was well behind, with less than a percentage point of votes cast.\n\nIf no candidate secures a majority in the first round, a runoff between the top two vote-getters will be held July 5.\n\nAll four candidates were vetted and approved by the Guardians Council, an unelected constitutional watchdog whose members are directly and indirectly appointed by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nThe outcome of the election is unlikely to result in major policy shifts, but it could affect the succession to the 85-year-old Khamenei, who has been the country's supreme leader since 1989.\n\nLast-ditch efforts to rally behind a consensus conservatives candidate failed on the eve of the election, with neither Qalibaf nor Jalili willing to drop out in favor of the other.\n\nConservatives have expressed concern that the lack of unity could split the vote to the benefit of reformist Pezeshkian.\n\nQalibaf is a former commander of the air wing of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and is the longest-serving mayor of Tehran. He is a traditional conservative who is running for president for the fourth time in the past 20 years.\n\nOver his career, he's has been dogged by corruption allegations, though none has dented his relationship with Khamenei.\n\nJalili, who has never held elected office, serves as Khamenei's personal representative on the Supreme National Security Council. During his 2007-13 term as the council's secretary, he led the a delegation in failed talks with the West on Tehran's nuclear program.\n\nPezeshkian has been a member of parliament since 2008 and served as deputy speaker from 2016 to 2020, when moderates and reformists had a majority in the legislature.\n\nHe has questioned Iran's methods of enforcing the hijab, the Islamic head scarf for women, and spoken in favor of negotiating with the West. But he has said he will follow Khamenei's policies if elected.\n\nOpinion polls projected a slightly higher voter participation than in the last presidential vote in 2021, which saw a record-low turnout. Critics say the real number was likely even lower.\n\nWATCH: Speaking with RFE/RL's Radio Farda from inside Iran, some listeners said they would boycott the vote, while others said they hoped their participation would bring about reforms.\n\nKhamenei encouraged Iranians to vote as he cast his ballot shortly after the polls opened.\n\n\"We encourage our dear people to take the issue of voting seriously and participate,\" he said.\n\nDissidents at home and abroad called for a boycott, arguing that past voting has failed to deliver change.\n\nIran's political establishment has long maintained it derives its legitimacy from strong voter turnout, but poor participation in recent elections and popular protests have challenged the legitimacy of the current leadership.\n\nIran's supreme leader has the final say on all state matters and the president does not have much sway on many key issues.\n\nRaisi died along with Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and several other officials when their helicopter crashed on May 19.\n\nMany Iranians refer to him as the Butcher of Tehran for his alleged role in the mass execution of political prisoners in 1988 when he was Tehran's

He will be competing with conservative Saeed Jalili who came second after getting 38.6 percent. Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf and Mostafa Pourmoahmmadi ranked third and fourth in the presidential race.\n\nVoter turnout saw a 10 percent decrease from the 2021 presidential elections, standing at 40 percent.

The current head of the Foundation of Martyrs and Veterans Affairs Amir-Hossein Qazizadeh Hashemi said it is a duty of the Revolutionary Front, a term used by conservatives throughout their campaigns, to rally behind Jalili.\n\nA member of Alireza Zakani's team also announced the Tehran Mayor's support for Jalili by declaring that Zakani's campaigning centers across the country \"will work with full capability and capacity for the victory of the candidate of the revolution front.\"\n\nAnalysts had previously warned the four conservative candidates that they risk losing to the sole reformist hopeful if they failed to back one figure unanimously.\n\nThe campaign for Iran's presidential elections is set to enter its second round on Sunday.

This marks the second time in the history of the Islamic Republic that a runoff is required to decide the president.\n\nIn the first round of elections, Masoud Pezeshkian emerged as the winner, securing 10.4 million votes according to data provided by the Ministry of Interior, which accounts for 43.5% of the total votes. In second place, Saeed Jalili garnered 9.4 million votes, representing 37.7% of the total. Mohammed Qalibaf obtained 3.4 million votes, equivalent to 14%, placing third. Mohammed Pourmohammadi received 200,000 votes, accounting for 0.8% of the total.\n\nThe voter turnout was 40%. In the last presidential elections held in 2021 and won by the late President Raisi, the turnout reached 48.8%. The legislative elections held in March this year had a turnout of 41%.\n\nQalibaf's third-place finish is significant, especially because he was viewed as the favorite during parts of the campaign, leading several polls in the early weeks. In recent hours, Qalibaf has issued a statement urging his supporters to back Jalili in the runoff:\n\n\"Although I personally respect Dr. Pezeshkian, the journey is not over yet. Due to my concerns about some of the people surrounding him, I call upon all revolutionary forces and my supporters to prevent the return to power of the movement that has significantly contributed to our current economic and political problems.\"\n\nQalibaf added that he was glad to have contested the elections, although his \"political sense\" indicated he should remain in his position as the Speaker of Parliament. He stated that his candidacy \"provided an opportunity for the revolutionary movement in the second round of the elections.\"\n\nDuring the final days of the campaign, two marathon meetings took place, one in Mashhad and another in Tehran, involving Jalili, Qalibaf, and prominent figures such as Mohsen Rezaei, Vice President under Raisi, and Esmaeil Qa'ani, the current commander of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. These meetings aimed to reach an agreement between the two candidates and prevent a potential victory for the reformist camp.\n\nAdditionally, the two candidates who had withdrawn their candidacy to support the unity of the so-called \"Revolutionary Front,\" Alireza Zakani and Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi, have also expressed their support for Saeed Jalili in the runoff.\n\nThe statement from Zakani asserted that efforts will be made to ensure the victory of the candidate from the revolutionary front. Meanwhile, Ghazizadeh stated in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that it is \"the duty of all who care about the country to vote for Jalili as the representative of the conservatives in the elections.\"\n\nTherefore, it can be said that after the two unsuccessful meetings, a \"Revolutionary Front\" has been formed that will face Pezeshkian in the runoff.\n\nThe two candidates advancing to the runoff, scheduled for next Friday, the 5th of July, will soon be able to resume their campaigns.\n\nAccording to Iran's electoral law, candidates can begin campaign activities for the runoff once the final results of the first round are confirmed. The Ministry of Interior has sent the results to the Guardian Council, a 12-member constitutional body expected to review and confirm them soon.\n\nAs with the first round, the campaign can continue until 24 hours before the start of the runoff voting.\n\nFrom a political standpoint, the presence of Jalili and Pezeshkian in a runoff underscores the notable differences between the two candidates while reflecting the diversity of political positions within the Islamic Republic.\n\nTheir electoral platforms and political visions are radically distinct. These discrepancies are evident in issues such as foreign policy, where Jalili staunchly opposes any agreement with the United States that compromises the fundamental principles underpinning the Islamic Republic. He is known for his opposition to the 2015 nuclear deal, arguing that the guarantees provided by the West were inadequate.\n\nIn contrast, Pezeshkian has expressed during the campaign his willingness to reach agreements with the West, believing it to be the best guarantee for lifting sanctions and ensuring stability in the region.\n\nThe differences between them are also significant in economic matters. Jalili advocates for a vision of social justice rooted in Islamic concepts, with a strong state ensuring protection of the rights of the underprivileged. In contrast, Pezeshkian proposes economic opportunities through attracting foreign investment and limiting the state's role in economic planning.\n\nBut perhaps the most significant aspect from a political perspective is the existence of two options that are so distinct and far apart within the political-economic spectrum, challenging the narrative of a lack of real choices in the Islamic Republic. This diversity of options is not new. The fact that Iran has had presidents as diverse as Khatami or Raisi underscores the importance of understanding the country's political dynamics without succumbing to simplistic analyses suggesting a lack of genuine options or the notion that all candidates are alike.\n\nIt is evident that Jalili and Pezeshkian are not the same in political terms. Both represent real, distinct, and independent options that in some way reflect the diverse political visions upon which the Islamic Republic was built, without this being seen as a contradiction.",

With the possible return of Trump to the White House after November's U.S. presidential election and Jalili's possible election win, the deal's resurgence seems improbable.\n\nBefore the nuclear pact, Jalili served as Iran's top nuclear negotiator for five years from 2007, a period in which Tehran took a confrontational and uncompromising approach to discussions with global powers about its uranium enrichment programme.\n\nIn those years, three U.N. Security Council resolutions were imposed on Iran, and several attempts to resolve the dispute failed.\n\nDuring the current election campaign, Jalili was heavily criticised in debates on state TV by other candidates for his uncompromising nuclear stance and his opposition to Iran signing up to two conventions on financial crime recommended by the Financial Action Taskforce, an international crime watchdog.\n\nSome hardliners, like Jalili, argue that the acceptance of the Convention on Combating the Financing of Terrorism and the Convention on Combating Transnational Organized Crime could hamper Iran's support for its paramilitary proxies across the region, including Lebanon's Hezbollah.\n\nPRODUCT OF THE REVOLUTION\n\nJalili has been trying for the presidency for years. He finished third in the 2013 contest, and stood again in 2021 but eventually withdrew to support Raisi.\n\nBorn in the holy Muslim Shi'ite city of Mashhad in 1965, Jalili lost his right leg in the 1980s in fighting during the Iran-Iraq war and joined the Foreign Ministry in 1989. Despite his hardline views, he is outwardly soft-spoken.\n\nHe gained a doctorate in political science at Imam Sadiq University, a training ground for Iranian leaders, where he wrote a study entitled \"Foreign policy of (the) Prophet of Islam\", according to a biography that was for a time posted on the Foreign Ministry website for a time.\n\nFor four years from 2001, he worked at Khamenei's office.\n\nWhen hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was elected president in 2005, he chose Jalili to be his adviser, and within months made him deputy foreign minister.\n\nJalili was appointed in 2007 as the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, a post that automatically made him chief nuclear negotiator.\n\nWriting by Parisa Hafezi Editing by William Maclean and Frances Kerry",

Two hardline candidates dropped out of the race ahead of the election.\n\nThe president, who runs the government day to day and is particularly responsible for Iran's struggling economy, ultimately answers to the Supreme Leader.\n\nPresidential candidate Mohammed Baqer Qalibaf\n\nA former Iran Revolutionary Guards commander and ally of Khamenei, Qalibaf is the current speaker of the hardline-dominated parliament. He previously ran unsuccessfully for president twice and was compelled to withdraw from a third bid in 2017 to prevent a divided hardline vote in Raisi's initial failed presidential attempt.\n\nIn 2005, Qalibaf resigned from the Guards to run for president. Following his unsuccessful campaign, he assumed the position of Tehran mayor with the supreme leader's endorsement, a role he occupied for 12 years.\n\nIn 2009, Qalibaf took credit as Tehran mayor for helping suppress months of bloody unrest that rocked the establishment after a presidential vote that opposition candidates said was rigged to secure hardline Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's re-election.\n\nTo civil rights activists, he is known as someone who crushed protests as national police chief, personally beating demonstrators in 1999, and also played an active role in repressing unrest in 2003. Qalibaf did not reply to a request for comment on those allegations.\n\nPresidential candidate Saeed Jalili\n\nJalili is a hardline diplomat who lost his right leg in the 1980s when fighting for the Guards in the Iran-Iraq war. Holder of a PhD in political science, Jalili has declared being a pious believer in Iran's \"velayat-e faqih,\" or rule by supreme jurisprudence, a system of Islamic government that provides the basis for Khamenei's position.\n\nAppointed by Khamenei, Jalili served as secretary of the Supreme National Security Council for five years from 2007, a position that automatically made him chief nuclear negotiator. Jalili also served four years in Khamenei's office and was an unsuccessful candidate in the 2013 presidential election.\n\nA former deputy foreign minister, Jalili was appointed by Khamenei in 2013 as a member of the Expediency Council, a body that mediates disputes between parliament and the Guardian Council.\n\nPresidential candidate Massoud Pezeshkian\n\nAn Iranian lawmaker of Azeri ethnicity, Pezeshkian is the only moderate candidate approved by the Guardian Council and backed by the pro-reform camp. His prospects depend on attracting millions of disillusioned voters who have stayed home in elections since 2020.\n\nA physician by profession, Pezeshkian served as the health minister under reformist President Mohammad Khatami from 2001 to 2005 and has been a member of parliament since 2008.\n\nPezeshkian has been vocal in his criticism of the Islamic Republic for its lack of transparency about the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Iranian Kurdish woman in 2022 that sparked several months of unrest.\n\nPezeshkian was barred from the 2021 presidential election.\n\nPresidential candidate Mostafa Pourmohammadi\n\nThe only cleric in the race, Pourmohammadi served as interior minister from 2005 until 2008 during the first term of hardline former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\n\nHe was deputy intelligence minister from 1990 to 1999, and rights groups have alleged that he played a role in the assassinations inside Iran of several prominent dissident intellectuals in 1998. He has not commented on the allegations, but an Intelligence Ministry statement in 1998 said: \"A small number of irresponsible, deviant and rogue agents of the ministry who were most likely puppets of others committed these assassinations that were in the interest of foreigners.\"\n\nHuman Rights Watch, in a 2005 report, documented Pourmohammadi's alleged role in the execution of hundreds of political prisoners in the Iranian capital in 1988.\n\nPourmohammadi has never publicly addressed allegations about his role in a so-called \"death committee\" in 1988 comprising religious judges, prosecutors, and intelligence ministry officials who oversaw the executions.", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Saeed Jalili, the former top negotiator for nuclear talks; Mostafa Pourmohammadi, a former interior minister and justice minister; and Masoud Pezeshkian, a former health minister.\n\nIran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei cast the first ballot at a polling station and made a brief speech calling for the unity of the Iranian people during the election.\n\nThe voting was initially scheduled to end at 6:00 p.m. local time, but was extended three times, with each extension lasting for two hours.\n\nOver 61 million people were eligible to vote in the election, according to Iranian authorities.\n\nA total of 344 polling stations were also set up in more than 95 foreign countries for Iranians to cast their votes, the official news agency IRNA reported.\n\nEslami said the counting process at the stations would begin upon making sure that the very last voter had cast his vote, adding the winner should collect an absolute majority of the votes, or at least 50 percent plus one vote, otherwise the run-off would be held next Friday between the two top candidates.\n\nIn remarks at a televised interview on Thursday, Mohammad-Taqi Shahcheraghi, head of Iran's Election Headquarters, said efforts would be made to announce the election's results before Saturday noon.\n\nIran's 14th presidential election, initially set for 2025, was rescheduled following the unexpected death of President Ebrahim Raisi and his entourage in a helicopter crash on May 19. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Republic_of_Iran_Broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xinhua News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interior minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoud_Pezeshkian", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Masoud Pezeshkian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Bagher_Ghalibaf", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saeed_Jalili", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saeed Jalili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mostafa_Pourmohammadi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mostafa Pourmohammadi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Leader of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Khamenei", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ali Khamenei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebrahim_Raisi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ebrahim Raisi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Republic_News_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Majority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Two-round system"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Zoroastrianism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Zoroastrianism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692323", "eventUri": "eng-9692323", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-28", "textStart": 8, "textEnd": 15}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-19", "textStart": 2137, "textEnd": 2143}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

The deal collapsed in 2018.\n\nJalili holds a doctorate in political science from Emam Sadegh University in Tehran, an institution established to train the cadres of the Islamic republic.\n\nIn the early 2000s, he was part of the supreme leader's office, responsible for providing key reports on major strategies.\n\nUnder hardline populist president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Jalili served as deputy foreign minister for Europe and South America.\n\nIn the 2013 presidential race, Jalili finished third, securing only 11 percent of the vote.\n\nIn 2021, he withdrew his candidacy in favour of ultraconservative Ebrahim Raisi, who went on to win.

My vote won't affect anything,\" she told AFP.\n\nIn contrast, 60-year-old housewife Jaleh said she was rooting for reformist Pezeshkian, who comes \"from the people\" and could address unemployment and poverty.\n\nReformist figures including former president Mohammad Khatami and ex-foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif have endorsed Pezeshkian.\n\nHowever, some Iranians view the 69-year-old reformist as lacking government experience -- he only served as health minister about 20 years ago.\n\nOf the main contenders, Ghalibaf is a veteran politician and former member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, ideological defenders of the republic after the 1979 revolution.\n\n- Dress code concerns -\n\nJalili, an ultraconservative former nuclear negotiator known for his inflexible stance towards the West, seems to be attracting hardline support.\n\nAlireza Valadkhani, a 35-year-old tax consultant, told AFP he will vote for Ghalibaf as he \"is the only one who can help Iran in its current situation\".\n\nOne concern among voters is whether a new president will mean a potential change to the contentious hijab law for women, particularly since the mass protests triggered by the 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini.\n\nAmini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, was detained for allegedly breaching Iran's dress code which makes women cover their heads and necks and wear modest clothing in public.\n\nSince the protests, women have increasingly flouted the code. But police have toughened controls in recent months on those who ignore the rules.\n\nMost of the candidates have been cautious in the televised debates, saying they generally opposed the use of violence against those who do not wear the mandatory headscarf.\n\n\"For 40 years, we have sought to fix the hijab, but we made the situation worse,\" Pezeshkian said in campaigning.\n\nFor many women, the idea of a change to the hijab laws seems far-fetched.\n\n\"It is hard for the candidates to fulfil their promises\" on this, said 31-year-old Maryam, who also gave only her first name.\n\nNeda said: \"The hijab law will never be lifted since this is the Islamic republic.\n\n\"I don't think any president would be willing to change this law.\"\n\nrkh-jri-mz/srm/dv/smw\n\nMore

With the possible return of Trump to the White House after November's U.S. presidential election and Jalili's possible election win, the deal's resurgence seems improbable.\n\nBefore the nuclear pact, Jalili served as Iran's top nuclear negotiator for five years from 2007, a period in which Tehran took a confrontational and uncompromising approach to discussions with global powers about its uranium enrichment programme.\n\nIn those years, three U.N. Security Council resolutions were imposed on Iran, and several attempts to resolve the dispute failed.\n\nDuring the current election campaign, Jalili was heavily criticised in debates on state TV by other candidates for his uncompromising nuclear stance and his opposition to Iran signing up to two conventions on financial crime recommended by the Financial Action Taskforce, an international crime watchdog.\n\nSome hardliners, like Jalili, argue that the acceptance of the Convention on Combating the Financing of Terrorism and the Convention on Combating Transnational Organized Crime could hamper Iran's support for its paramilitary proxies across the region, including Lebanon's Hezbollah.\n\nPRODUCT OF THE REVOLUTION\n\nJalili has been trying for the presidency for years. He finished third in the 2013 contest, and stood again in 2021 but eventually withdrew to support Raisi.\n\nBorn in the holy Muslim Shi'ite city of Mashhad in 1965, Jalili lost his right leg in the 1980s in fighting during the Iran-Iraq war and joined the Foreign Ministry in 1989. Despite his hardline views, he is outwardly soft-spoken.\n\nHe gained a doctorate in political science at Imam Sadiq University, a training ground for Iranian leaders, where he wrote a study entitled \"Foreign policy of (the) Prophet of Islam\", according to a biography that was for a time posted on the Foreign Ministry website for a time.\n\nFor four years from 2001, he worked at Khamenei's office.\n\nWhen hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was elected president in 2005, he chose Jalili to be his adviser, and within months made him deputy foreign minister.\n\nJalili was appointed in 2007 as the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, a post that automatically made him chief nuclear negotiator.

29 (VOICE) Voting for Iran's 14th presidential election ended at Friday midnight after 16 straight hours, said Spokesman of Iran's Election Headquarters Mohsen Eslami.He made the remarks in a live interview with Iran's state-run IRIB TV, noting that though the polling stations' doors were closed, those people who had come before the end of the voting process and were waiting for their turns, could still cast their ballots.\n\nThe voting began at 8 a.m. Friday local time at about 58,640 polling stations across the country, with four candidates vying for the top position at the country's executive branch, news agency reported.\n\nThe candidates were Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, the Parliamentary Speaker; Saeed Jalili, the former top negotiator for nuclear talks; Mostafa Pourmohammadi, a former Interior Minister and Justice Minister; and Masoud Pezeshkian, a former Health Minister.\n\nIran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei cast the first ballot at a polling station and made a brief speech calling for the unity of the Iranian people during the election.\n\nThe voting was initially scheduled to end at 6 p.m. local time, but was extended three times, with each extension lasting for two hours.\n\nMore than 61 million people were eligible to vote in the election, according to Iranian authorities.\n\nA total of 344 polling stations were also set up in more than 95 foreign countries for Iranians to cast their votes, the official news agency IRNA reported.\n\nEslami said the counting process at the stations would begin upon making sure that the very last voter had cast his vote, adding the winner should collect an absolute majority of the votes, or at least 50 per cent plus one vote, otherwise the run-off would be held next Friday between the two top candidates.\n\nIn remarks at a televised interview on Thursday, Mohammad-Taqi Shahcheraghi, head of Iran's Election Headquarters, said efforts would be made to announce the election's results before Saturday noon.\n\nIran's 14th presidential election, initially set for 2025, was rescheduled following the unexpected death of President Ebrahim Raisi and his entourage in a helicopter crash on May 19.", "source": {"uri":

As a result, many voters are skeptical about Pezeshkian's ability to fulfill his campaign promises.\n\n\"Pezeshkian's power as the president to fulfill his campaign promises is zero,\" said Sholeh Mousavi, a 32-year-old teacher in Tehran, before Friday's first round of voting. \"I want reforms but Pezeshkian cannot improve the situation. I will not vote. \"\n\nPezeshkian, the sole moderate among the six candidates who were approved by a hardline watchdog body to stand, has pledged to foster a pragmatic foreign policy and ease nuclear tensions with the West. Two hardline subsequently candidates pulled out.\n\nA critic loyal to Khameneir\n\nAt the same time, Pezeshkian promised in TV debates and interviews not to contest Khamenei's policies, which analysts said risks further alienating the urban middle class and young voters. These groups no longer seek mere reform and instead now directly challenge the Islamic Republic as a whole.\n\nAs a lawmaker since 2008, Pezeshkian, who is an Azeri ethnic minority and supports the rights of ethnic minorities, has criticized the clerical establishment's suppression of political and social dissent.\n\nIn 2022, Pezeshkian demanded clarification from authorities about the death of Mahsa Amini, a woman who died in custody after she was arrested for allegedly violating a law restricting women's dress. Her death sparked months of unrest across the country.\n\nBut at a Tehran University meeting earlier this month, responding to a question about students imprisoned on charges linked to anti-government protests, Pezeshkian said \"Political prisoners are not within my scope, and if I want to do something, I have no authority\".\n\nDuring the Iran-Iraq war in 1980s, Pezeshkian, who held roles as both a combatant and a physician, was tasked with the deployment of medical teams to the front lines.\n\nHe was health minister from 2001-5 in Khatami's second term.\n\nPezeshkian lost his wife and one of his children in a car accident in 1994. He raised his surviving two sons and a daughter alone, opting to never remarry.", "source": {"uri": "ynetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ynetnews"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Despite narrowly beating a hardline opponent for first place, his ability to fulfill campaign promises remains in question under Iran's theocratic system.\n\nIn an election campaign dominated by hardliners, Iranian presidential hopeful Massoud Pezeshkian stood out as a moderate, backing women's rights, more social freedoms, cautious detente with the West and economic reform.\n\nPezeshkian narrowly beat hardline Saeed Jalili for first place in Friday's first round vote but the two men will now face a run-off election on July 5, since Pezeshkian did not secure the majority of 50% plus one vote of ballots cast needed to win outright. Pezeshkian, a 69-year-old cardiac surgeon, lawmaker and former health minister was up against candidates who more closely reflect the fiercely anti-Western stance of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country's ultimate decision-maker.\n\nAnd yet the mild-mannered Pezeshkian narrowly won Friday's vote and made it to the run-off in the election to pick a successor to Ebrahim Raisi, who was killed in a helicopter crash in May. His chances hinge on attracting votes from supporters of current hardline parliament speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, who finished third in the first round, and encouraging a young disillusioned population hungry for change but disenchanted with the country's political, social and economic crisis to vote for him again in the run-off.\n\nAlthough he advocates reforms, Pezeshkian is faithful to Iran's theocratic rule with no intention of confronting the powerful security hawks and clerical rulers. His views offer a contrast to those of Raisi, a Khamenei protege who tightened enforcement of a law curbing women's dress and took a tough stance in now-moribund negotiations with major powers to revive a 2015 nuclear deal.\n\nPezeshkian's election campaign gained momentum when he was endorsed by reformists, led by former President Mohammad Khatami, and when he appointed former Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, a key figure in crafting the nuclear deal, as his foreign policy adviser. Implicitly referring to the appointment of Zarif, who hardliners accuse of selling out Iran in order to reach the deal, Khamenei said on Tuesday: \"Anyone who is attached to America will not be a good colleague for you\".\n\nIn 2018, then-U.S. President Donald Trump ditched the pact and reimposed sanctions on Iran, calling it \"a horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made.\" His move prompted Tehran to progressively violate the agreement's nuclear limits. If Pezeshkian does go on to win, this would hinder Iranian hardliners who are opposed to the revival of the pact.\n\nHowever, under Iran's dual system of clerical and republican rule the power to shape key state policies including foreign and nuclear affairs ultimately rests with Khamenei. As a result, many voters are sceptical about Pezeshkian's ability to fulfil his campaign promises.\n\n\"Pezeshkian's power as the president to fulfil his campaign promises is zero,\" said Sholeh Mousavi, a 32-year-old teacher in Tehran, before Friday's first round of voting. \"I want reforms but Pezeshkian cannot improve the situation. I will not vote. \"\n\nPezeshkian, the sole moderate among the six candidates who were approved by a hardline watchdog body to stand, has pledged to foster a pragmatic foreign policy and ease nuclear tensions with the West. Two hardline subsequently candidates pulled out. A CRITIC LOYAL TO KHAMENEI\n\nAt the same time, Pezeshkian promised in TV debates and interviews not to contest Khamenei's policies, which analysts said risks further alienating the urban middle class and young voters. These groups no longer seek mere reform and instead now directly challenge the Islamic Republic as a whole. As a lawmaker since 2008, Pezeshkian, who is an Azeri ethnic minority and supports the rights of ethnic minorities, has criticised the clerical establishment's suppression of political and social dissent.\n\nIn 2022, Pezeshkian demanded clarification from authorities about the death of Mahsa Amini, a woman who died in custody after she was arrested for allegedly violating a law restricting women's dress. Her death sparked months of unrest across the country. But at a Tehran University meeting earlier this month, responding to a question about students imprisoned on charges linked to anti-government protests, Pezeshkian said \"political prisoners are not within my scope, and if I want to do something, I have no authority\".\n\nDuring the Iran-Iraq war in 1980s, Pezeshkian, who held roles as both a combatant and a physician, was tasked with the deployment of medical teams to the front lines. He was health minister from 2001-5 in Khatami's second term.\n\nPezeshkian lost his wife and one of his children in a car accident in 1994. He raised his surviving two sons and a daughter alone, opting to never remarry.

Since neither Masoud Pezeshkian nor Saeed Jalili -- the front runners -- were able to clinch 50pc of the vote needed to win the presidency, a run-off election will be held on July 5. It was a close contest, with Mr Pezeshkian slightly ahead of Mr Jalili. However, these dynamics may change on Friday, particularly if the conservative camp rallies around Saeed Jalili. Mr Jalili, a former nuclear negotiator, is considered close to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and would likely continue the policies of Raisi. Mr Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon and former health minister, is more of a centrist, with the backing of the reformist camp.\n\nThe results of the poll reflect the fissures within Iranian society, with more conservative voters backing Mr Jalili and ex-Tehran mayor Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, who came in third, while the 'change' camp has endorsed Mr Pezeshkian. Around 40pc of the electorate participated in the snap polls. Of course, considerable challenges confront whoever enters the Iranian presidency. Iran's two biggest challenges remain its moribund economy, and the fragile geopolitical situation regionally. Due to crippling US sanctions, as well as mismanagement, Iran has not been able to reach its full economic potential. The next Iranian president, therefore, will need to go the extra mile to bring down inflation and revive the economy. Geopolitically, Iran is in the midst of an undeclared war with Israel, backing armed factions across the Middle East. If Israel were foolhardy enough to launch an attack on Hezbollah, Iran is unlikely to leave its Lebanese ally in the lurch, while America has promised to come to Israel's aid in case of such a scenario. Hence, the incoming Iranian president will have to steer his country through a geopolitical minefield.", "source": {"uri": "dawn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dawn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoud_Pezeshkian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Masoud Pezeshkian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saeed_Jalili", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saeed Jalili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebrahim_Raisi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ebrahim Raisi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Two-round system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Principlists", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iranian Principlists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Reformists", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iranian Reformists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Bagher_Ghalibaf", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Leader of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Khamenei", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ali Khamenei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_sanctions_against_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States sanctions against Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Six-Day War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Zoroastrianism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Zoroastrianism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Ethnic_and_Regional/Middle_Eastern", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Ethnic and Regional/Middle Eastern", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.dawn.com/_img/social-default.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692323", "eventUri": "eng-9692323", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-05", "textStart": 370, "textEnd": 376}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

I will not vote. \"\n\nPezeshkian, the sole moderate among the six candidates who were approved by a hardline watchdog body to stand, has pledged to foster a pragmatic foreign policy and ease nuclear tensions with the West. Two hardline subsequently candidates pulled out.\n\nA CRITIC LOYAL TO KHAMENEI\n\nAt the same time, Pezeshkian promised in TV debates and interviews not to contest Khamenei's policies, which analysts said risks further alienating the urban middle class and young voters. These groups no longer seek mere reform and instead now directly challenge the Islamic Republic as a whole.\n\nAs a lawmaker since 2008, Pezeshkian, who is an Azeri ethnic minority and supports the rights of ethnic minorities, has criticised the clerical establishment's suppression of political and social dissent.\n\nIn 2022, Pezeshkian demanded clarification from authorities about the death of Mahsa Amini, a woman who died in custody after she was arrested for allegedly violating a law restricting women's dress. Her death sparked months of unrest across the country.\n\nBut at a Tehran University meeting earlier this month, responding to a question about students imprisoned on charges linked to anti-government protests, Pezeshkian said \"political prisoners are not within my scope, and if I want to do something, I have no authority\".\n\nDuring the Iran-Iraq war in 1980s, Pezeshkian, who held roles as both a combatant and a physician, was tasked with the deployment of medical teams to the front lines.\n\nHe was health minister from 2001-5 in Khatami's second term.\n\nPezeshkian lost his wife and one of his children in a car accident in 1994. He raised his surviving two sons and a daughter alone, opting to never remarry.\n\n(Writing by Parisa Hafezi; Editing by William Maclean and Frances Kerry)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com",

Close behind is the hardliner and former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili.\n\nThe two are headed to a runoff presidential election on Friday to replace the late hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash in May.\n\nMohsen Eslami, an election spokesman, announced that 24.5 million votes were cast with Pezeshkian getting 10.4 million while Jalili received 9.4 million, The Associated Press reported. Iranian law requires that a winner get more than 50% of all votes cast. If not, the race's top two candidates advance to a runoff a week later.\n\nPezeshkian is on record as wanting to bring Iran in from the cold of international sanctions and improve relations with the West.\n\nThat made him the obvious choice for Nima Saranghi, who works in marketing.\n\n\"I decided to vote for a better future for our country,\" he told CBS News. \"Maybe [Pezeshkian and his team] can work together and resolve problems with the West.\"\n\nThat includes trying to revive the nuclear deal which was ditched unilaterally by former President Donald Trump in 2018.\n\nPezeshkian ended up with the most votes even though Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei weighed in at the start of the week saying people who advocated better ties with the West were unsuited to lead.\n\n\"Some politicians in our country believe they must kowtow to this power or that power, and it's impossible to progress without sticking to famous countries and powers,\" he said. \"Some think like that. Or they think that all ways to progress pass through America. No. Such people can't run the country well.\"\n\nIranians who voted for reform want more secular freedoms too, but a conservative segment of the population is stubbornly opposed.\n\nSaana Hodaverdian cast her vote for a candidate who - above all - stands for a strict Islamic state.\n\n\"I just want someone who can support my religious beliefs along with attending to industrial and economic priorities,\" she said.\n\nAll Iranians agree that the country's economy is weak and life is a grind. They don't agree on the solution.\n\nConservatives believe opening up to Europe and America risks undermining the Islamic values of the revolution. They cling to a belief in so-called self-sufficiency; a largely made-in-Iran policy with help from allies like China and Russia.\n\nIran is a divided country - headed by a Supreme Leader whose values are only shared by conservatives.\n\nTake the contentious issue of women's dress. Islamic purists wear the complete black chador coverall and a headdress which prevents any hair at all from showing.\n\nThat look is completely rejected by reform-minded women who cover their bare arms and legs with Western dress, and drape loose headscarves over their hair.\n\nIn 2022, major street uprisings erupted in protest against the death of a young woman, Mahsa Amini, who died in police custody after being arrested for insufficiently Islamic dress.\n\nEven though the demonstrations were quelled by a violent crackdown by authorities, many women continued to protest by refusing to wear a scarf at all even though they too risk arrest.\n\nSaturday's polarized first-round voting reflects Iran's tragic divide. Whoever wins the presidency in the runoff next week will face an uphill battle to shape policies acceptable to both sides.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoud_Pezeshkian", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Masoud Pezeshkian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saeed_Jalili", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saeed Jalili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Two-round system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebrahim_Raisi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ebrahim Raisi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reformism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctions_against_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sanctions against Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Leader of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Khamenei", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ali Khamenei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secularism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Mahsa_Amini", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Death of Mahsa Amini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chador", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chador"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hijab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Zoroastrianism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Zoroastrianism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/29/417236f6-2351-49d8-acb8-6f18578ba6ad/thumbnail/1200x630/329e848e1c1ce05f3054a5af3d992d62/gettyimages-2159148133.jpg?v=a23cb4bdf4fa7f3cb72e5118085577f9", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692323", "eventUri": "eng-9692323", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

His statements are attracting attention.", "body": "The presidential election in Iran went to a second round as no candidate exceeded 50% of the votes. Reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian received the highest number of votes in the first round with 42.5%. Pezeshkian, a member of parliament from Tabriz with Turkish origins, expressed that some citizens of Turkmen, Kurdish, and Baloch backgrounds have been deprived of the status they deserve due to \"discrimination,\" and stated that he would adopt a \"positive discrimination\" approach if elected as President.\n\nThe 14th Presidential Elections in Iran have advanced to the second round. The sole candidate of the reformists, Pezeshkian, will compete again with the conservative candidate, Jalili, in the second round of elections to be held on July 5th. If Pezeshkian wins, he will become Iran's first Turkish president. Here is the answer to the question everyone is curious about, \"Who is Mesut Pezeshkian?\"...\n\nMesut Pezeshkian, a prominent figure in the reformist camp and a member of parliament from Tabriz, was the first to announce his candidacy for the election following the death of President Ibrahim Raisi. Pezeshkian, 69, expressed his intention to participate in the elections to increase the public's participation in the ballot boxes, stating, \"There is an impression that the people are disillusioned with the ballot boxes at the national and international level regarding Iran. My intention in applying for candidacy is to increase the public's participation in the elections.\"\n\nPezeshkian, who served as the Minister of Health during the presidency of Mohammad Khatami, had his request to run against Ibrahim Raisi in the 2021 presidential election vetoed by the Guardian Council.\n\nThe Council united the Reformist Front with Mesut Pezeshkian to put an end to legitimacy debates by not allowing any ministers from Raisi's cabinet to run for the presidency after his death. They forced a choice between Said Jalili and Kalibaf, who are two important power balances within the conservative base. Pezeshkian, of Turkic origin, is a name who served as the Minister of Health during the presidency of reformist leader Mohammad Khatami and has the potential to gain votes from different segments of the country with his statements.\n\nAfter finding the support he sought from the Reformist Front following his candidacy, Pezeshkian tried to establish a kind of dual balance in his election campaign. Pezeshkian, who does not support compulsory hijab, used the song \"Baraye\" by Mahsa Amini, which is still on everyone's lips, as his campaign song. In his initial statements, Pezeshkian said that he would continue his policies in line with Raisi's path and the line determined by Khamenei.\n\nPezeshkian, a cardiac surgery specialist born in Mahabad in West Azerbaijan province of Iran, will become Iran's first Turkish president if he wins. Pezeshkian, who emphasizes his Turkish identity at every opportunity, said the following in an interview with the Iranian media during the candidacy process: \"I am Turkish. My mother and father are also Turkish. I am proud of my Turkishness. I speak Turkish, not Persian, with my children at home.\"\n\nMesud Pezeshkian, who also made statements about the problems of regions, ethnic origins, and sects in Iran, promised to fight against \"ethnic and sectarian discrimination.\" Pezeshkian stated that some Turkmen, Kurdish, and Baloch citizens are deprived of the status they deserve due to \"discrimination\" and that if he becomes the President, he will adopt a \"positive discrimination\" approach to compensate for historical and chronic deficiencies and shortcomings in this regard.\n\nMeanwhile, the election in Iran had the lowest turnout in the country's history. Ballot boxes were set up in approximately 59,000 centers for about 62 million voters nationwide. A total of 24,535,185 votes were cast, and the turnout was around 40 percent.\n\nPezeshkian received 10,415,191 votes, and his vote share was 42.5 percent. Celili, who received 9,473,298 votes, finished second in the first round of the election with a vote share of 38.6 percent. Therefore, Pezeshkian, the sole candidate of the reformists, will compete again with the conservative candidate, Celili, in the second round of elections to be held on July 5th.\n\nMohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, one of the other two candidates, ranked third with 13.8 percent, while Mustafa Purmohammadi ranked fourth with 0.8 percent.", "source": {"uri": "en.haberler.com", "dataType": "news",

By that test the poll raises deep questions about the decaying regime's legitimacy. Some 60% of the country's 61m-strong electorate have withheld their vote, resulting in the lowest turnout on record. The streets of Tehran, the capital, were uncannily quiet on polling day with many people dismissing the exercise as a farce in a country being ruined by dictatorship. Instead of queues outside polling stations, election monitors slept at their desks in empty mosques.\n\nDon't mistake calm for stability, however. The system is still reeling from the mysterious death of the presidential incumbent, Ebrahim Raisi, in a helicopter crash on May 19th. And the surprise results mean a second round will take place on July 5th, which could further expose the fissures in Iranian society and the fragility of the regime.\n\nIran's political system is a hybrid that mixes elements of democracy, military rule and religious authority. The clerics and military commanders who dominate the system had looked to Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf as their candidate. He is a stalwart of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the clerical authorities' praetorian guard. Yet he came in third place and is now out of the race.\n\nIn the lead with 10.4m votes is Masoud Pezeshkian, a 69-year-old surgeon who was a health minister in a reform-leaning government two decades ago. He has decried the regime's corruption and brutal enforcement of the mandatory veil and called for engagement with the West. He has the backing of a reformist bloc hoping for a comeback. Behind him stand Jawad Zarif, the foreign minister who negotiated a nuclear deal with America and others in 2015; and two former presidents, Muhammad Khatami and Hassan Rouhani.\n\nAt his heels with 9.5m votes is Saeed Jalili, a 58-year-old zealot who looks a decade older than he is. Mr Jalili blames Iran's economic malaise on sanctions and calls for confrontation with America and engagement with Russia and China. He denounces anyone seeking social liberalisation as a counter-revolutionary. He has the backing of the Paydari (or Stabilisation) Front, a growing movement of the militantly religious right. He was wounded in the Iran-Iraq war and graduated from Imam Sadiq, a university-cum-seminary in Tehran. He wrote his doctorate on the Prophet Muhammad's diplomacy and, as a former chief negotiator on the nuclear file, took pride in his refusal to compromise. Such is his religious extremism that even the regime's pragmatic top brass feel unsettled.\n\nA riveting second round could now unfold. Both candidates still have much to prove. Mr Jalili received only half the votes Mr Raisi won in the election of 2021. Meanwhile Mr Pezeshkian has not convinced many prominent reformers. They include Mir Hossein Moussavi, the presidential candidate who lost the rigged presidential election of 2009 and remains under house arrest, and Faezeh Hashemi Rafsanjani, the daughter of a former president. Mr Pezeshkian is a \"wet blanket\", says a boycotter who once voted for reformists, but now deems the former minister too little too late.\n\nIn order to rally support and raise the turnout, both candidates are likely to denounce their rival as an existential threat and seek to exploit polarisation in Iran. In his casual checked shirts unbuttoned at the neck, Mr Pezeshkian will warn ordinary Iranians exhausted by the regime of the dangers of another puritanical wave. In his starched white collars buttoned up to the throat, Mr Jalili will emphasise the importance of defending the regime's standards, mores and theocracy. In a boost to him, Mr Jalil has won the support of Mr Qalibaf, the runner-up, who has urged his 3.4m voters to \"stop the current that caused today's economic and political problems,\" a tacit rebuke of reformists. Had Mr Qalibaf and Mr Jalili, bitter rivals, not split the vote, one of their conservative ilk would have won a majority.\n\nBoth of the remaining candidates will exploit simmering ethnic tensions. They come from opposite ends of Iran. The zealous Mr Jalili is from Mashhad, Iran's holiest city and its second-largest, and appeals to the Persian-speaking majority who fill the regime's ranks. The reformist Mr Pezeshkian is a long-time from Tabriz, a city in the north-west with both Turkish and Kurdish heritage. His campaign speeches in Turkish have already filled football stadiums. He may try to mobilise minorities who resent Persian domination. All this may concern Mr Khamenei, the supreme leader, who sees himself as straddling such divides. His family is Azeri from the Turkish-speaking north-west, but he grew up in Mashhad in the Persian east.\n\nA final fissure is gender. The spectre of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who died in custody after she was detained for a \"bad\" veil, in September 2022, continues to haunt Iran's testosterone-heavy regime. Its bullyboys suppressed female-led protesters chanting \"women, life, freedom\" after Mahsa's death. So far few women have joined either candidate's campaigns. Anecdotal evidence suggests women boycotted the polls more than men did. Yet Mr Pezeshkian could try to change this. The night before the first round he called for equal rights for women and said they should be allowed to choose how to dress. Many women are tired of sloganeering but more concrete steps could persuade them to vote: were Mr Pezeshkian to bring more women into his campaign and a future cabinet, he might see support surge.\n\nThis election takes place amid two big questions. One is Iran's fraught geopolitical position, with conflict in the Middle East, its nuclear programme and its intensifying friendship with Russia and China. The other is succession. Mr Khamenei is 85 and wants a president who can help steer the country's succession: under the constitution, the president is one of triumvirate that leads the interregnum. The election must be unnerving for the ageing supreme leader. He has said a higher turnout is a yardstick of the regime's \"durability, stability, honour and dignity in the world\".\n\nThat may yet happen, but if it does it will be the product of a fractious week of campaigning that exposes the fissures underlying his regime. He still holds many levers of power. His Guardian Council selects the candidates. His interior ministry manages the election. And his loyalists count the vote. Yet for all that, Iran is run by an unpopular regime dogged by repeated bouts of unrest. The election may yet awaken what many deem the greatest threat to his rule -- people power. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "economist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Economist"}, "authors": [],

(BSS/AFP) - Iran's former president Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday threw his weight behind reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian, two days ahead of a snap presidential vote to replace the late Ebrahim Raisi.\n\nRouhani, a moderate politician who preceded Raisi in office, said Pezeshkian -- the only reformist on the ballot -- could \"remove the shadow of sanctions\" that have battered the Iranian economy since the collapse of a landmark nuclear deal.\n\n\"On Friday, we should vote for someone who is determined to remove the shadow of sanctions from the Iranian people,\" Rouhani said in a video message published by the reformist Shargh daily, praising Pezeshkian's \"honesty\" and \"loyalty\".\n\nThe election was brought forward by Raisi's death in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nRouhani, whose government had negotiated the 2015 nuclear deal with the United States and other powers, said Pezeshkian appeared \"determined to revive\" the accord which fell through after Washington unilaterally withdrew from it in 2018, reimposing biting sanctions.\n\nDiplomatic efforts have since faltered to revive the deal, which aimed to curb Tehran's nuclear activity in return for sanctions relief.\n\nPezeshkian, 69, is an outspoken heart surgeon who has represented the northwestern city of Tabriz in parliament since 2008.\n\nHe is among the leading contenders in Iran's six-way presidential race along with conservative parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf and ultraconservative former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili.\n\nReformist figures including former president Mohammad Khatami and ex-foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif have endorsed Pezeshkian's candidacy.\n\nOn Tuesday, Khatami said the upcoming vote was \"an opportunity\" for \"change\", with Pezeshkian a \"righteous, justice-seeking, anti-corruption and meritocratic\" leader.\n\nOther candidates in the running include conservative Tehran mayor Alireza Zakani, cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi, and incumbent vice president Amirhossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi, the ultraconservative head of the Martyrs' Foundation.", "source": {"uri": "bssnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangladesh Sangbad

Sign up here.\n\nUnder the specter of conflict with Israel, a struggling economy and social discontent, Iranians headed to the polls on Friday for snap presidential elections that could be the most important for the country in decades.\n\nThe sudden death of President Ebrahim Raisi in a recent helicopter crash, alongside Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and other officials, has left a leadership void. Raisi, a hardline regime loyalist, was widely regarded as a leading candidate to replace Iran's Supreme Leader, 85-year-old Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate authority over all state matters.\n\nIt is also the first presidential election since the death of Mahsa Amini in the custody of the country's notorious morality police in 2022, an event that sparked the largest protests since the regime's founding in 1979. The vote takes place amid deteriorating relations with the West, an advancing Iranian nuclear program, and an increasing risk of direct war with Israel. Just two months ago, Iran and Israel exchanged fire for the first time as the Gaza conflict widened, and Israel is now preparing for a potential second front with Hezbollah, Iran's primary regional proxy, in Lebanon.\n\nThree conservatives are vying with a single reformist candidate for the country's top elected seat, after dozens of other candidates were barred from standing. Of those running, Masoud Pezeshkian, 69, a reformist lawmaker and former health minister, Saeed Jalili a hardline security adviser and nuclear negotiator, and Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, the conservative speaker of the Iranian parliament, are widely considered the frontrunners in the first round of elections. The final candidates were pre-selected by Iran's Guardian Council, which reports directly to Khamenei.\n\nSome polls have shown increasing popularity for Pezeshkian, with the rest of the conservatives splitting the vote. During nationwide protests against Amini's death in 2022, Pezeshkian said in an interview with Iran's IRINN TV: \"It is our fault. We want to implement religious faith through the use of force. This is scientifically impossible.\"\n\nOn Thursday, two conservative candidates, Amirhossein Qazizadeh-Hashemi and Alireza Zakani, withdrew from the race to help consolidate the hardline vote. Qazizadeh-Hashemi urged other candidates from the \"revolution camp\" to do the same to secure a hardliner victory.\n\nAny candidate who wins at least 50% of votes in the first round will be elected president, otherwise the two top-ranking candidates will face off in a second round a week later.\n\n\"These are nothing like free and fair elections, and only those who've already pledged absolute loyalty to Khamenei and the Islamic Republic can run,\" said Arash Azizi, an Iranian writer and fellow at the Center for Middle East and Global Order (CMEG), a Berlin-based think tank. \"But there are still very important differences between the three main candidates. Each of them present certain problems for Khamenei.\"\n\nThe top contenders are children of Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, likely shaped by their experiences fighting the then US-backed Saddam Hussein regime in the bloody, decade-long war with their neighbor Iraq, as well as careers serving the Iranian state.\n\nBut voters' choice between either of the conservatives or their reformist co-candidate will steer a different path forward for the country.\n\n\"What we have seen in this election compared to (the) previous one (in 2021), is that in the last couple of days there has been a degree of energy for the election,\" said Trita Parsi, a Washington-based Iran analyst and executive vice president of the Quincy Institute, suggesting the participation rate may end up being higher than previous elections.\n\nThe Iranian electoral process has been marred by voter apathy of late, causing embarrassment to an establishment that has relied on high voter turnout to bolster its democratic credentials and popular legitimacy.\n\nElections in March for the parliament and the Assembly of Experts, an oversight body responsible for selecting the Supreme Leader's successor, recorded the lowest turnout since the Islamic Republic's founding, despite government efforts to rally voters ahead of the ballot.\n\nKhamenei urged Iranians to head to the polls and vote after he cast his ballot in the election on Friday morning.\n\n\"People's participation is part of the essence of the state and continuation of the existence of the Islamic Republic and its status in the world is tied to people's participation\", he said.\n\nDespite some momentum, however, low voter turnout \"remains a distinct possibility, fueled by widespread disillusionment and economic hardships,\" said Sina Toossi, an Iran analyst and senior fellow at the Center for International Policy in Washington, DC.\n\n\"Many Iranians feel disenfranchised and skeptical about the electoral process, doubting its ability to bring about meaningful change, particularly in light of the government's violent repression of popular protests in recent years,\" he said. \"A substantial number of Iranians say they will boycott the elections, including prominent civil society activists and political prisoners like Nobel Laureate Narges Mohammadi.\"\n\nAt Shiroudi stadium in Tehran, there was an ebullient atmosphere Wednesday as supporters of the conservative Ghalibaf gathered for his final campaign rally.\n\nSeveral thousand Iranians crammed into the indoor arena, mobbing the candidate as he entered, chanting: \"We salute Raisi, we say hello to Ghalibaf.\"\n\n\"Ghalibaf is the one who supports the Supreme Leader and follows him. Whatever the Supreme Leader says, he puts into practice,\" Ahmad, 32, a clerical official, said in the crowd. Iranians who spoke to CNN only agreed to give their first names in order to be able to speak candidly.\n\nEconomic concerns are foremost on the minds of many voters.\n\nIn June, inflation in Iran stood at 36.1%, straining wallets across the country. Although down from highs exceeding 45% last year, the country's annual inflation rate hasn't dipped below 30% in over five years. This persistent inflation follows the Trump administration's withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear agreement and the subsequent reimposition of heavy sanctions on the Islamic Republic.\n\nGhalibaf has been determined in his attacks on the 2015 nuclear deal and paths towards rapprochement with the West, pinning much of the country's economic woes on Iran's Western enemies.\n\n\"The first thing people expect is economic development. There is no doubt that this development can happen through the path of elections,\" Ghalibaf shouted to the crowd, echoing promises from his campaign.\n\nDraped along the walls were campaign pledges of food on the table of all Iranian households and free land for homeless families.\n\n\"It worries me when people run after candidates like Ghalibaf,\" one university worker told CNN outside the rally. Leaning towards voting for Pezeshkian, the only reformist candidate, she said she had come to Ghalibaf's rally to hear him speak before deciding who to vote for.\n\n\"Iranians need simple things, a good economy, good relations with other countries,\" she said, adding that she trusted Pezeshkian to deliver on them.\n\nAs night fell at the nearby Heidarnia stadium, supporters of Pezeshkian gathered to hear him speak, with many focused on improving Iran's international relations.\n\n\"The change we need in politics is foreign policy so it will result in improvements in people's economic situation,\" Mariam, 23, told CNN. She added that voting for a conservative would be a repeat of the late President Raisi, whom she criticized for failing to fulfill his promises, and for not reining in Iran's infamous morality police.\n\nAround her, the crowd was on edge, an urgent energy rippled across the stadium. An hour before, organizers abruptly announced the event had been cancelled, and police blocked the gate.\n\nDespondent supporters poured into nearby streets; their chants, like the mood, were resolute: \"Our vote is one word: Pezeshkian.\"\n\nCheers surged through the crowd of several thousand Pezeshkian supporters when they were later allowed into the stadium but the incident in the final hours of his campaign stung his assembled voters.\n\n\"We only have a small window of hope, which is Pezeshkian,\" Mohammad, 47, a journalist, told CNN at the rally. \"We cannot change the constitution ... we should move forwards step by step, until we reach the democracy that people are seeking.\"\n\nParsi, the Iran expert, suggested that enthusiasm for this vote may stem from it being a snap election.\n\n\"No one expected this to happen,\" he said, noting that Raisi's unexpected death might be creating a public perception that \"perhaps the regime doesn't have the capability of controlling this election,\" as it has in the past.\n\nRelations with the West\n\nIran's foreign policy direction is largely steered by Khamenei, and the president's role is principally domestic. However, the future president and his foreign minister will play a crucial role in the working relations with the international community.\n\n\"Pezeshkian's victory won't be bad news for Khamenei and, in fact, might even be the best outcome since he will be a weak president with a smaller base and thus easier to control,\" said Azizi.\n\nPezeshkian's key ally is former Foreign Minister Javad Zarif. If the US-educated Zarif, who oversaw the warmest recent period of ties with Washington, returns in an official capacity, he may provide a conduit for an easing of tensions with the West.\n\nHowever, this week Khamenei condemned those chasing improved relations with the West - in an apparent implicit attack on Pezeshkian and Zarif.\n\nHe blasted thinking that, \"all the ways of progress pass through the US.\" Politicians who think they cannot progress without being in the US' favor \"will not manage (the country) well,\" Khamenei was cited as saying in Iranian state media.\n\nEven if Tehran isn't expected to pivot towards the West anytime soon, the prospect of an uncompromising Trump presidency and the already bloody tensions in the Middle East make any improvement in relations crucial.\n\nMoreover, even if a more Western-friendly candidate takes power, a shift in Iran's foreign relations is not guaranteed, as goodwill gestures toward the West may not be reciprocated.\n\n\"A more Western-oriented administration in Iran may not find a willing partner in Washington under Biden,\" Parsi said. \"It takes two to tango.\"", "source": {"uri": "egyptindependent.com", "dataType":

presidential election has gone to a run-off, where a moderate lawmaker will stand against a protege of the supreme leader.\n\nIt came down to a tight race between a low-profile lawmaker Massoud Pezeshkian, the sole moderate in a field of four candidates, and former Revolutionary Guards member Saeed Jalili.\n\nThe Islamic Republic's interior ministry said on Saturday (June 29) that no candidate had secured enough votes and a second round will be held on July 5.\n\nTurnout in Friday's election hit a historic low of about 40%, based on an interior ministry count.\n\nSupreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had called on voters to turn out, hoping to boost the legitimacy of the clerical establishment.\n\nBut there's widespread discontent over economic hardship and restrictions on political and social freedom.\n\nAnd in the past few weeks, many Iranians have mocked the vote on X with the hashtag #ElectionCircus.\n\nPezeshkian, though faithful to Iran's theocratic rule, has publicly criticized authorities over the death of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian Kurdish woman whose death in custody sparked mass unrest in Iran in 2022.\n\nHe also favors detente with the West, while Jalili is staunchly anti-Western.\n\nNeither candidate is expected to usher in significant shifts for Iran, because Khamenei calls the shots on major issues like Iran's nuclear program and support for militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah.\n\nBut the next president would run the government and affect the tone of domestic and foreign policy, and could even influence the succession to Khamenei.",

Iranian economy since the collapse of a landmark nuclear deal.\n\n\"On Friday, we should vote for someone who is determined to remove the shadow of sanctions from the Iranian people,\" Rouhani said in a video message published by the reformist Shargh daily, praising Pezeshkian's \"honesty\" and \"loyalty.\"\n\nThe election was brought about by Raisi's death in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nRouhani, whose government had negotiated the 2015 nuclear deal with the United States and other powers, said Pezeshkian appeared \"determined to revive\" the accord that fell through after Washington unilaterally withdrew from it in 2018, reimposing biting sanctions.\n\nDiplomatic efforts have since faltered to revive the deal, which aimed to curb Tehran's nuclear activity in return for sanctions relief.\n\nPezeshkian, 69, is an outspoken heart surgeon who has represented the northwestern city of Tabriz in parliament since 2008.\n\nHe is among the leading contenders in Iran's six-way presidential race along with conservative parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf and ultraconservative former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili.\n\nReformist figures, including former president

parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, ultraconservative former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili, and the sole reformist, Massoud Pezeshkian.\n\nThe others are conservative Tehran mayor Alireza Zakani, cleric Mostafa Pourmohammadi, and incumbent vice president Amirhossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi, the ultraconservative head of the Martyrs' Foundation.\n\nThe six have staged largely low-key campaigns, which included televised debates where they vowed to tackle economic challenges and offered varied views on Iran's relations with the West.\n\nAli Vaez of the International Crisis Group

Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf voiced backing for Saeed Jalili, the principlist candidate who is going to lock horns with Masoud Pezeshkian in a runoff next Friday.\n\nIran held its 14th presidential election on Friday, June 28, a year ahead of schedule, after President Ebrahim Raisi passed away in a helicopter crash in May.\n\nPezeshkian and Jalili garnered the highest number of votes and will face off in a showdown next Friday, July 5.\n\nThe two other candidates, namely Qalibaf and Mostafa Pourmohammadi, won 13.78% and 0.84% of the votes, respectively.\n\nQalibaf, the incumbent speaker of the Iranian Parliament, had already tested his luck in the presidential races in 2005, 2013, and 2017, all to no avail.\n\nThe former Iranian Police chief was expecting a walkover considering the withdrawal of two other principlist figures from the race, namely Alireza Zakani and Amir Hossein Qazizadeh Hashemi.\n\nQalibaf conceded defeat in a statement released on Saturday, saying the road has not ended yet.\n\nThe Parliament speaker said he has respect for Pezeshkian, but is worried about a number of the former health minister's associates.\n\n\"I call on all revolutionary forces and my supporters to help prevent a current, which is the cause of a major part of our economic and political problems today, from returning to power,\" Qalibaf said, hinting at the administration of former President Hassan Rouhani.\n\n\"Therefore, we must all try to elect the candidate of the Revolution's front, Dr. Jalili, as the president of the 14th administration,\" he added.\n\nThe voter turnout in Friday's election stood at 39.92, as over 61,452,000 people were eligible to vote.\n\nThe polls were held at around 59,000 polling stations across the country and 340 polling stations in 100 foreign

Islami explained that 24,535,185 votes were collected from 59,000 national polling stations.\n\npezeshkian won 10,415,191 votes, capturing 42.5% of the overall vote, with Jalili coming in with 9,473,298 votes, accounting for 38.6%. As such, pezeshkian and Jalili will now go into the second-round vote on July 5th.\n\nOther presidential candidates, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf and Mostafa Pourmohammadi, gained 13.8% and 0.8% of the national vote, respectively. The voter turnout was about 40%.\n\nAn AA correspondent in Tehran sends two profiles of candidates who will be in the runoff: reformist Masoud pezeshkian and conservative Saeed Jalili.\n\nMasoud pezeshkian\n\nReformist politician Masoud pezeshkian was born in Mahabad, Iran, to Iranian Turk parents on September 29, 1954. He attended Tabriz Medical University. Fighter medic, he joined a detachment during Iran-Iraq war (1980-1988). Following a Ph.D. in general surgery from Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, pezeshkian studied cardiac surgery in 1993. His presidency of Tabriz University Medical Sciences lasted from 1994 to 1999. He was Deputy Minister of Health under President Mohammad Khatami for four years starting in 1997. He was health minister from 2001 to 2005. He has five times represented Tabriz in Parliament since 2008. He was Iranian Parliament Deputy Speaker 2016-2020. pezeshkian withdrew his 2013 presidential bid. The Guardian Council denied his 2021 presidential run. He won the Tabriz parliamentary election as the frontrunner. Mohammad Khatami, Hassan Rouhani, and Zarif supported pezeshkian, the only reformist candidate. His organization opposes ethnic and sect discrimination, hijab mandates, and economic and justice reforms.\n\nSaeed Jalili\n\nHard-line leader Born September 6, 1965, in Mashhad, Saeed Jalili. His mother is Ardabilan. Tehran's Imam Sadegh University educated Jalili in politics. Working in the Basij, the volunteer arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Jalili lost his right leg in the 1987 Karbala-5 Operation. After the war, he taught at his old department and joined the Iranian Foreign Ministry in 1989. He advised Khamenei and the SNC in 2001 and 2002. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad appointed him Foreign Ministry Deputy Minister for European and American Affairs in 2005. Jalili became Supreme National Security Council Secretary in 2007, managing Iran-West nuclear discussions. Despite his slogan \"Turning Threats into Opportunities,\" many believe Jalili's administration witnessed three UN Security Council resolutions against Iran and severe US and European sanctions. Jalili was suddenly reinstalled in the Security Council by Khamenei after Rouhani removed him in 2013. He joined the Expediency Discernment Council. His political science teaching started at Imam Sadegh University in 2000. He finished third in 2013's presidential election with 11%. After this loss, he offered a \"Shadow Government\" method to help Rouhani, but few embraced it. To support Raisi, Jalili withdrew his presidential run in 2021. Khamenei's Supreme National Security Council representative is cautious with the West. He wants stability.", "source": {"uri": "albawaba.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Bawaba"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saeed_Jalili", "type": "person",

I will not vote. \"\n\nPezeshkian, the sole moderate among the six candidates who were approved by a hardline watchdog body to stand, has pledged to foster a pragmatic foreign policy and ease nuclear tensions with the West. Two hardline subsequently candidates pulled out.\n\nAt the same time, Pezeshkian promised in TV debates and interviews not to contest Khamenei's policies, which analysts said risks further alienating the urban middle class and young voters. These groups no longer seek mere reform and instead now directly challenge the Islamic Republic as a whole.\n\nAs a lawmaker since 2008, Pezeshkian, who is an Azeri ethnic minority and supports the rights of ethnic minorities, has criticised the clerical establishment's suppression of political and social dissent.\n\nIn 2022, Pezeshkian demanded clarification from authorities about the death of Mahsa Amini, a woman who died in custody after she was arrested for allegedly violating a law restricting women's dress. Her death sparked months of unrest across the country.\n\nBut at a Tehran University meeting earlier this month, responding to a question about students imprisoned on charges linked to anti-government protests, Pezeshkian said \"political prisoners are not within my scope, and if I want to do something, I have no authority\".\n\nDuring the Iran-Iraq war in 1980s, Pezeshkian, who held roles as both a combatant and a physician, was tasked with the deployment of medical teams to the front lines.\n\nHe was health minister from 2001-5 in Khatami's second term.\n\nPezeshkian lost his wife and one of his children in a car accident in 1994. He raised his surviving two sons and a daughter alone, opting to never remarry.\n\n(Writing by Parisa Hafezi; Editing by William Maclean and Frances Kerry)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in",

Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday threw his weight behind reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian, two days ahead of a snap presidential vote to replace the late Ebrahim Raisi.\n\nRouhani, a moderate politician who preceded Raisi in office, said Pezeshkian -- the only reformist on the ballot -- could \"remove the shadow of sanctions\" that have battered the Iranian economy since the collapse of a landmark nuclear deal.\n\n\"On Friday, we should vote for someone who is determined to remove the shadow of sanctions from the Iranian people,\" Rouhani said in a video message published by the reformist Shargh daily, praising Pezeshkian's \"honesty\" and \"loyalty\".\n\nRouhani, whose government had negotiated the 2015 nuclear deal with the United States and other powers, said Pezeshkian appeared \"determined to revive\" the accord which fell through after Washington unilaterally withdrew from it in 2018, re-imposing biting sanctions.\n\nDiplomatic efforts have since faltered to revive the deal, which aimed to curb Tehran's nuclear activity in return for sanctions relief.\n\nPezeshkian, 69, is an outspoken heart surgeon who has represented the northwestern city of Tabriz in parliament since 2008.\n\nHe is among the leading contenders in Iran's six-way presidential race along with conservative parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf and ultraconservative former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili.\n\nReformist figures, including former president Mohammad Khatami and ex-foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, have endorsed Pezesh\u00adkian's candidacy.", "source":

Less than half of all Iranians bother to vote in elections, so the clerics likely viewed Dr Pezeshkian's presence on the ballot paper as a potential electoral attraction.\n\nYet perhaps just as significantly, Dr Pezeshkian initially appeared to have little chance of winning the ballot: he belonged to Iran's Azeri minority and was relatively unknown to the public.\n\nNow, however, the clerics on the Guardian Council must bitterly regret their choice.\n\nFor soon after his name appeared on the ballot paper, Dr Pezeshkian started attracting a large following.\n\nIn particular, his comments on a live state television electoral debate in which he openly criticised the 2022 killing of Ms Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old who protested against the mandatory wearing of the hijab veil by all Iranian women, galvanised opponents of the regime to the Pezeshkian candidacy.\n\nDr Pezeshkian also seems to have attracted solid support from both his fellow ethnic Azeris and the Kurdish people of Iran, who may amount to about a third of the country's inhabitants.", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Straits Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

With the possible return of Trump to the White House after November's U.S. presidential election and Jalili's possible election win, the deal's resurgence seems improbable.\n\nBefore the nuclear pact, Jalili served as Iran's top nuclear negotiator for five years from 2007, a period in which Tehran took a confrontational and uncompromising approach to discussions with global powers about its uranium enrichment programme.\n\nIn those years, three U.N. Security Council resolutions were imposed on Iran, and several attempts to resolve the dispute failed.\n\nDuring the current election campaign, Jalili was heavily criticised in debates on state TV by other candidates for his uncompromising nuclear stance and his opposition to Iran signing up to two conventions on financial crime recommended by the Financial Action Taskforce, an international crime watchdog.\n\nSome hardliners, like Jalili, argue that the acceptance of the Convention on Combating the Financing of Terrorism and the Convention on Combating Transnational Organized Crime could hamper Iran's support for its paramilitary proxies across the region, including Lebanon's Hezbollah.\n\nJalili has been trying for the presidency for years. He finished third in the 2013 contest, and stood again in 2021 but eventually withdrew to support Raisi.\n\nBorn in the holy Muslim Shi'ite city of Mashhad in 1965, Jalili lost his right leg in the 1980s in fighting during the Iran-Iraq war and joined the Foreign Ministry in 1989. Despite his hardline views, he is outwardly soft-spoken.\n\nHe gained a doctorate in political science at Imam Sadiq University, a training ground for Iranian leaders, where he wrote a study entitled \"Foreign policy of (the) Prophet of Islam\", according to a biography that was for a time posted on the Foreign Ministry website for a time.\n\nFor four years from 2001, he worked at Khamenei's office.\n\nWhen hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was elected president in 2005, he chose Jalili to be his adviser, and within months made him deputy foreign minister.\n\nJalili was appointed in 2007 as the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, a post that automatically made him chief nuclear negotiator.\n\n(Writing by Parisa Hafezi; Editing by William Maclean and Frances Kerry)",

Pezeshkian narrowly beat hardline Saeed Jalili for first place in Friday's first round vote but the two men will now face a run-off election on July 5, since Pezeshkian did not secure the majority of 50% plus one vote of ballots cast needed to win outright.\n\nOne gun, 34 dead: Inside Ecuador's war on black-market weapons\n\nThe gun - a 9-milimeter pistol - blazed a violent trail even by the standards of one of Ecuador's most dangerous neighborhoods, the Nueva Prosperina precinct of Guayaquil. Shell casings from bullets fired by the weapon, recovered at the scenes of 27 separate violent incidents, were linked to 34 deaths, according to a police forensic unit. And a police forensic official told Reuters the authorities believe the pistol remains on the streets.\n\nUK Reform leader Farage speech interrupted by banner mocking Putin views\n\nA speech being delivered by Nigel Farage, the leader of Britain's right-wing Reform UK party, was interrupted late Saturday when a banner of Russian President Vladimir Putin descended from the ceiling at an election rally. Campaign group Led by Donkeys, which opposes Farage's views, said it was responsible for the stunt at the Columbine Centre, at Walton on the Naze in southeast England, and posted a video of the unveiling on X.\n\nNorth Korea blames South Korea, U.S. and Japan ties as Asian version of NATO\n\nNorth Korea criticised a joint military exercise by South Korea, Japan and the United States held this month, state media said on Sunday, saying such drills show the relationship among three countries has developed into \"the Asian version of NATO\". On Thursday, the three countries began large-scale joint military drills called \"Freedom Edge\" involving navy destroyers, fighter jets and the nuclear-powered U.S. aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, aimed at boosting defences against missiles, submarines and air attacks.\n\nIran presidential candidate Jalili is fiercely loyal to Khamenei\n\nSaeed Jalili, a zealous ideologue loyal to Iran's supreme leader, plans to resolve the country's social, political and economic ills by adhering rigidly to the hardline ideals of the 1979 Islamic Revolution if he wins the country's presidential election. Jalili was narrowly beaten in Friday's first round vote by moderate Massoud Pezeshkian but the two men will now face a run-off election on July 5, since Pezeshkian did not secure the majority of 50% plus one vote of ballots cast needed to win outright.\n\nFar-right Alternative for Germany reports surge in membership\n\nLeaders of the far-right Alternative for Germany on Saturday reported a surge in membership and vowed to build on the party's success in the European Parliament election, as they target wins in three state votes in the east this year. The AfD jumped to second place in nationwide polls last year amid frustration with infighting in Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition, worries over sluggish growth in Europe's largest economy, and concerns over the impact of the war in Ukraine.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com",

While much attention has been focused on Pezeshkian, a veteran parliamentarian and former health minister, less has been said about the intense dynamics within the conservative camp.\n\nIran's presidential election, scheduled for June 28, has effectively narrowed to a three-way contest among reformist Masoud Pezeshkian and the two leading conservative candidates, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf and Saeed Jalili. While much attention has been focused on Pezeshkian, a veteran parliamentarian and former health minister, less has been said about the intense dynamics within the conservative camp.\n\nThis is a mistake. While Pezeshkian is leading in several polls, the race is far from settled, and his chances greatly improve if the conservatives fail to unite behind a single candidate. Meanwhile, the conservative infighting is crucial, as the differences between their two leading candidates are significant and can profoundly shape Iran's future direction.\n\nThe conservative camp in Iran, known domestically as \"principlists\" and often referred to as hard-liners abroad, is far from monolithic. The recent parliamentary elections highlighted these internal divisions, where various conservative factions competed against one another. The establishment conservative list, known by its Persian acronym SHANA and which included Ghalibaf, who has been the speaker of Iran's parliament since 2020, faced significant losses to more hard-line groups led by conservative clerics and activists. That same dynamic is now playing out in the presidential race, complicating efforts for conservative unity and inadvertently benefiting the reformist candidate, Pezeshkian.\n\nThe contrast between the leading conservative candidates becomes quickly apparent in their respective resumes. Ghalibaf is seeking the presidency for the fourth time and has a background as a former Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander and Tehran's mayor. During his tenure as mayor, Ghalibaf focused on modernizing Tehran's infrastructure, leading notable projects like building out the metro system. Politically, he positions himself as a pragmatic conservative, advocating for reduced government intervention in the economy, emphasizing the harmful impact of sanctions, and supporting negotiations to alleviate them. He has long presented himself as a strongman leader equipped to steer the country through challenging times with effective management.\n\nSaeed Jalili, the former chief nuclear negotiator, is distinguished by his firm opposition to the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Jalili's prominence grew during his tenure as Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), where he oversaw nuclear negotiations from 2007 to 2013. Like Ghalibaf, Jalili is a veteran of the Iran-Iraq War, in which he lost a leg. He is closely aligned with Iran's most conservative factions and is considered more ideologically rigid than Ghalibaf, prioritizing self-reliance and resistance to Western influence.\n\nThe rivalry between Jalili and Ghalibaf traces back to the 2013 presidential election, where both competed in a crowded conservative field and neither withdrew in favor of the other. This lack of unity among conservatives contributed to the split in their vote, ultimately facilitating the victory of moderate candidate Hassan Rouhani. In that election, Jalili received a significant endorsement from the late Ayatollah Mesbah Yazdi, one of Iran's most conservative clerics, who lauded him as the \"most qualified\" candidate.\n\nNotably, Mesbah Yazdi was known as the spiritual leader of Iran's most conservative faction, the Front of Islamic Revolution Stability, or Jebhe Paydari. This group has officially endorsed Jalili in the current presidential race, and who have had a tumultuous relationship with Ghalibaf. T ideological divide has become increasingly evident in Iran's current parliament. Jalili's allies Jebhe Paydari allies in parliament have criticized Ghalibaf, for example, for reportedly trying to water down a bill aimed at increasing enforcement of the mandatory hijab. Ghalibaf allies have condemned Jalili's camp in return, accusing them of pursuing a \"purification\" purge similar to the one that sidelined former moderate conservative parliamentary speaker Ali Larijani. Ghalibaf himself has labeled these figures, including those in Jebhe Paydari, as \"super revolutionaries\" who undermine unity within the conservative camp.\n\nThis parliamentary bickering has been an ideological preview of the presidential contest. Jalili's uncompromising stance on negotiations with the West, especially his strong opposition to the 2015 nuclear deal stands in stark contrast to Ghalibaf's more pragmatic approach. Jalili has emphatically stated, \"If I had become president, I would not have signed the JCPOA because my thinking is different.\" Throughout his current run for president, he has consistently emphasized his commitment to a self-reliant vision for Iran, showing little interest in pursuing sanctions relief. This rigid position underscores his belief in long-term self-sufficiency over immediate economic concessions\n\nIn contrast, Ghalibaf has consistently highlighted the detrimental effects of international sanctions, advocating for a strategy of diplomacy. He proposes lifting sanctions through a process of reciprocal, phased concessions, reflecting a more flexible mindset. Ghalibaf's approach seeks to mitigate the immediate economic hardships faced by Iranians, presenting himself as a leader capable of navigating complex international negotiations.\n\nThe current contest between Ghalibaf and Jalili has been marked by sharp public criticisms. Ghalibaf has openly questioned Jalili's lack of executive experience and his ability to build consensus, arguing, \"We should not have a president who wants to test their ideas. ... We should not have a president who is not knowledgeable about the issues and lacks authority. We should not have someone who cannot build consensus, has no strong record, and lacks experience.\" Highlighting his own extensive background as Tehran's mayor and the head of the IRGC air force, Ghalibaf presents himself as a seasoned leader. Jalili, however, has countered by dismissing Ghalibaf's executive experience as merely \"contracting,\" asserting, \"The position of the presidency is not a position of execution in the sense of contracting. It is a place for discernment and decision-making.\"\n\nSupporters of both candidates have ramped up their rhetoric, with each camp aggressively targeting the other's weaknesses. Majid Rafiei, a media activist for Ghalibaf's team, labeled Jalili a \"dreamer,\" stating, \"The presidency is not a place for trial and error. The fate of a nation is at stake. Some candidates should at least have the experience of contracting a three-story building in their resumes.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Jalili's supporters have capitalized on controversies surrounding Ghalibaf's family and associates, emphasizing corruption allegations. They frequently bring up the \"baby clothes scandal,\" where Ghalibaf's pregnant daughter was accused of purchasing a large amount of goods in Turkey in 2022 amid Iran's economic struggles. Additionally, they point to individuals in Ghalibaf's circle with histories of corruption charges. This narrative has been bolstered by the imprisonment of three journalists -- Saba Azarpeik, Yashar Soltani, and Vahid Ashtari -- who have reported extensively on Ghalibaf's alleged corruption, further questioning his integrity and leadership.\n\nDespite their differences, Ghalibaf and Jalili do share significant commonalities as they both hail from the broader principlist camp. Compared to Pezeshkian, both candidates are more resistant to improving ties with the US, aligning closely with the Supreme Leader's vision for Iran's foreign policy orientation. Domestically, they are less supportive of social and political liberalization, favoring policies that uphold the principles of the Islamic Revolution and maintain conservative values.\n\nAs the election approaches, pressure is mounting for either Ghalibaf or Jalili to withdraw to avoid splitting the conservative vote. Leading conservative figures and newspapers, such as Vatan Emrooz, have suggested that Ghalibaf has a better chance of defeating Pezeshkian, urging Jalili to step aside. Vatan Emrooz highlighted a survey indicating that if Ghalibaf withdraws, only 38.2 percent of his votes would go to Jalili, whereas if Jalili withdraws, a significant 45.7 percent of his votes would shift to Ghalibaf, enhancing the conservatives' chances. Hossein Shariatmadari, the editor in chief of the influential conservative newspaper Kayhan, echoed this sentiment, calling on principlists to \"change the situation from multiple candidates to a single candidate\" to prevent a Pezeshkian victory.\n\nHowever, both Ghalibaf and Jalili appear resolute in their candidacies. Recent statements from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei have been interpreted by both camps as supportive, further entrenching their positions. Khamenei has maintained close relationships with both figures; however, a Jalili presidency is more likely to antagonize disenchanted Iranians who seek fundamental political change and secularization. Conversely, Ghalibaf might offer greater stability.\n\nIf neither candidate withdraws, the election is likely to go to a runoff, with the likely scenario involving Pezeshkian facing either Ghalibaf or Jalili. However, should voter turnout exceed expectations in the first round, and if both conservative candidates remain in the race, splitting their vote, Pezeshkian could achieve an upset victory similar to Rouhani's in 2013. If the election proceeds to a second round, Pezeshkian could generate additional public enthusiasm by framing the contest as a direct showdown against the conservative track record in recent years. The upcoming election thus hinges on whether the conservative factions can unify in time or if their internal divisions will enable a reformist resurgence. The next few days will be crucial in determining the outcome of this high-stakes political contest, with significant implications for both Iran and the West.", "source": {"uri": "foreignpolicy.com",

They occur amidst a delicate period for the Islamic Republic, grappling with internal tensions and geopolitical risks from Gaza to the nuclear issue, just months before the U.S. presidential election, its longstanding adversary.\n\nWhile the campaign began quietly, this election year is notably contentious due to the presence of reformist Masoud Pezeskian, emerging as one of the top contenders alongside conservative parliament speaker Mohammad-Bagher Ghalibaf and ultra-conservative Saeed Jalili, former negotiator on Iran's nuclear program.\n\nThe competition may necessitate a second round, a rare occurrence in Iran's 45-year history except for the 2005 election. For Masoud Pezeskian to prevail, a robust voter turnout is crucial, unlike the 2021 elections which saw a record 51% abstention due to the absence of reformist candidates.\n\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urged Iranians on Tuesday to vote in large numbers for a \"high turnout,\" although some citizens like Neda expressed skepticism: \"There's no point in me voting because whoever wins won't change anything for the people.\" In contrast, Zaleh, a 60-year-old housewife, views voting as a duty amidst pressing issues like unemployment and poverty.\n\nAccording to Ali Baez of the International Crisis Group, the next president faces the challenge of bridging the growing gap between the state and society, yet none of the candidates have proposed concrete solutions so far.\n\nMasoud Pezeskian, a 69-year-old reformist, remains optimistic about addressing Iran's issues despite critics questioning his limited governmental experience. In contrast, Mohammad-Bagher Ghalibaf, a 62-year-old veteran of politics, is favored by voters like Alireza Valandhani for his administrative expertise and military background with the Revolutionary Guards.\n\nMeanwhile, 58-year-old Saeed Jalili, a war veteran, attracts staunch supporters advocating for Tehran's tough stance against the West. Pezeskian advocates for warming relations with the U.S. and Europe to ease crippling sanctions, supported by former foreign minister Javad Zarif.\n\nThe next president will be a civilian, departing from the previous clerical leadership, and will not be seen as a potential successor to Ayatollah Khamenei, aged 85.", "source": {"uri": "en.protothema.gr", "dataType": "news", "title": "protothemanews.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christine_giannou@en.protothema.gr", "name": "Christine Giannou", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebrahim_Raisi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ebrahim Raisi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reformism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_program_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear program of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voter turnout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Bagher_Ghalibaf", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saeed_Jalili", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saeed Jalili"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Leader of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Khamenei", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ali Khamenei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Revolutionary_Guard_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Javad_Zarif", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohammad Javad Zarif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Russia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Foreign Affairs (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Crisis_Group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Crisis Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://en.protothema.gr/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-26-at-12.14.01-PM.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692323", "eventUri": "eng-9692323", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-19", "textStart": 361, "textEnd": 367}], "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

It did not provide names of the people who were acquitted.\n\nKhamenei protege, sole moderate to battle in Iran's presidential run-off\n\nA moderate lawmaker will face Iran supreme leader's protege in a run-off presidential election on July 5 after the country's interior ministry said on Saturday that no candidate secured enough votes in the first round of voting. Friday's vote to replace Ebrahim Raisi after his death in a helicopter crash came down to a tight race between a low-profile lawmaker Massoud Pezeshkian, the sole moderate in a field of four candidates, and former Revolutionary Guards member Saeed Jalili.\n\nAttacker killed after firing crossbow at policeman guarding Israeli embassy in Serbia\n\nAn attacker who fired a crossbow at a police officer guarding the Israeli embassy in Belgrade was shot and killed on Saturday in what Interior Minister Ivica Dacic called a terrorist attack against Serbia. The policeman is in a life-threatening condition and is undergoing surgery, Serbian news agency Tanjug quoted Dacic as saying. No embassy employees were wounded, the Israeli foreign ministry said.\n\nMauritanians vote as President Ghazouani seeks re-election\n\nMauritanians voted on Saturday in a presidential election that incumbent Mohamed Ould Ghazouani is widely expected to win with a pledge to boost investment in the West African country as it prepares to start producing natural gas.

Pezeshkian narrowly beat hardline Saeed Jalili for first place in Friday's first round vote but the two men will now face a run-off election on July 5, since Pezeshkian did not secure the majority of 50% plus one vote of ballots cast needed to win outright.\n\nOne gun, 34 dead: Inside Ecuador's war on black-market weapons\n\nThe gun - a 9-milimeter pistol - blazed a violent trail even by the standards of one of Ecuador's most dangerous neighborhoods, the Nueva Prosperina precinct of Guayaquil. Shell casings from bullets fired by the weapon, recovered at the scenes of 27 separate violent incidents, were linked to 34 deaths, according to a police forensic unit. And a police forensic official told Reuters the authorities believe the pistol remains on the streets.\n\nSecurity concerns rise over Paris Pride ahead of elections\n\nThe French interior ministry called for security reinforcement around LGBTQIA+ events ahead of elections, including Saturday\u00b4s Paris Pride, in a letter to police and local authorities sent on Friday. As France heads to the polls on Sunday for the first round of a snap parliamentary election that could bring the far-right to power, there has been an increase in discriminatory acts that could target events organized by the LGBTQIA+ community, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin's letter said.\n\nChina, Peru completed 'substantial negotiations' to upgrade FTA\n\nChina and Peru have achieved \"substantial conclusion of negotiations\" on the upgrading of a free trade agreement between both countries, Chinese state media said on Friday.

Between the war's start last October and recent days, the United States has transferred at least 14,000 of the MK-84 2,000-pound bombs, 6,500 500-pound bombs, 3,000 Hellfire precision-guided air-to-ground missiles, 1,000 bunker-buster bombs, 2,600 air-dropped small-diameter bombs, and other munitions, according to the officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nIran presidential candidate Jalili is fiercely loyal to Khamenei\n\nSaeed Jalili, a zealous ideologue loyal to Iran's supreme leader, plans to resolve the country's social, political and economic ills by adhering rigidly to the hardline ideals of the 1979 Islamic Revolution if he wins the country's presidential election. Jalili was narrowly beaten in Friday's first round vote by moderate Massoud Pezeshkian but the two men will now face a run-off election on July 5, since Pezeshkian did not secure the majority of 50%

Notably, economic reforms in Mauritania, rising security concerns for Paris Pride, and significant arms shipments from the U.S. to Israel mark pressing issues. The world is on alert as these stories develop.\n\nFollowing is a summary of current world news briefs.\n\nPanama court acquits 28 people tied to Panama Papers, Operation Car Wash\n\nA Panamanian court has acquitted 28 people charged with money-laundering under cases linked to the Panama Papers and \"Operation Car Wash\" scandals, the country's judicial branch said in a statement on Friday. It did not provide names of the people who were acquitted.\n\nKhamenei protege, sole moderate to battle in Iran's presidential run-off\n\nA moderate lawmaker will face Iran supreme leader's protege in a run-off presidential election on July 5 after the country's interior ministry said on Saturday that no candidate secured enough votes in the first round of voting. Friday's vote to replace Ebrahim Raisi after his death in a helicopter crash came down to a tight race between a low-profile lawmaker Massoud Pezeshkian, the sole moderate in a field of four candidates, and former Revolutionary Guards member Saeed Jalili.\n\nAttacker killed after firing crossbow at policeman guarding Israeli embassy in Serbia\n\nAn attacker who fired a crossbow at a police officer guarding the Israeli embassy in Belgrade was shot and killed on Saturday in what Interior Minister Ivica Dacic called a terrorist attack against Serbia. The policeman is in a life-threatening condition and is undergoing surgery, Serbian news agency Tanjug quoted Dacic as saying. No embassy employees were wounded, the Israeli foreign ministry said.\n\nMauritanians vote as President Ghazouani seeks re-election\n\nMauritanians voted on Saturday in a presidential election that incumbent Mohamed Ould Ghazouani is widely expected to win with a pledge to boost investment in the West African country as it prepares to start producing natural gas. Ghazouani, 67, a former top soldier, has promised investor-friendly policies to spur a commodities boom in the country of 5 million people, many of whom live in poverty despite its fossil fuel and minerals wealth.\n\nModerate Pezeshkian makes it to Iran presidential run-off\n\nIn an election campaign dominated by hardliners, Iranian presidential hopeful Massoud Pezeshkian stood out as a moderate, backing women's rights, more social freedoms, cautious detente with the West and economic reform. Pezeshkian narrowly beat hardline Saeed Jalili for first place in Friday's first round vote but the two men will now face a run-off election on July 5, since Pezeshkian did not secure the majority of 50% plus one vote of ballots cast needed to win outright.\n\nOne gun, 34 dead: Inside Ecuador's war on black-market weapons\n\nThe gun - a 9-milimeter pistol - blazed a violent trail even by the standards of one of Ecuador's most dangerous neighborhoods, the Nueva Prosperina precinct of Guayaquil. Shell casings from bullets fired by the weapon, recovered at the scenes of 27 separate violent incidents, were linked to 34 deaths, according to a police forensic unit. And a police forensic official told Reuters the authorities believe the pistol remains on the streets.\n\nSecurity concerns rise over Paris Pride ahead of elections\n\nThe French interior ministry called for security reinforcement around LGBTQIA+ events ahead of elections, including Saturday's Paris Pride, in a letter to police and local authorities sent on Friday. As France heads to the polls on Sunday for the first round of a snap parliamentary election that could bring the far-right to power, there has been an increase in discriminatory acts that could target events organized by the LGBTQIA+ community, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin's letter said.\n\nChina, Peru completed 'substantial negotiations' to upgrade FTA\n\nChina and Peru have achieved \"substantial conclusion of negotiations\" on the upgrading of a free trade agreement between both countries, Chinese state media said on Friday. In a meeting with Peruvian President Dina Boluarte in Beijing, President Xi Jinping said both sides should coordinate and promote cooperation in fields such as minerals, energy, manufacturing, agriculture and others, state broadcaster CCTV said.\n\nUS has sent Israel thousands of 2,000-pound bombs since Oct. 7\n\nThe Biden administration has sent to Israel large numbers of munitions, including more than 10,000 highly destructive 2,000-pound bombs and thousands of Hellfire missiles, since the start of the war in Gaza, said two U.S. officials briefed on an updated list of weapons shipments. Between the war's start last October and recent days, the United States has transferred at least 14,000 of the MK-84 2,000-pound bombs, 6,500 500-pound bombs, 3,000 Hellfire precision-guided air-to-ground missiles, 1,000 bunker-buster bombs, 2,600 air-dropped small-diameter bombs, and other munitions, according to the officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nIran presidential candidate Jalili is fiercely loyal to Khamenei\n\nSaeed Jalili, a zealous ideologue loyal to Iran's supreme leader, plans to resolve the country's social, political and economic ills by adhering rigidly to the hardline ideals of the 1979 Islamic Revolution if he wins the country's presidential election. Jalili was narrowly beaten in Friday's first round vote by moderate Massoud Pezeshkian but the two men will now face a run-off election on July 5, since Pezeshkian did not secure the majority of 50% plus one vote of ballots cast needed to win outright.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com",

Among the sources of friction with Western and other states is Tehran's nuclear program, which has advanced steadily as international diplomacy aimed at limiting its progress drifts.\n\nFive of the six candidates who made it through the vetting gauntlet hail from the conservative-to-hardline end of the Iranian political spectrum, which Raisi also represented. Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf is on his fourth attempt to helm the executive branch. A veteran of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and a former Tehran mayor, Qalibaf retained his position as speaker of the conservative-dominated parliament following legislative elections in March. Also seeking the top job is Saeed Jalili, a hardline insider to Qalibaf's ideological right who serves as Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei's representative on the Supreme National Security Council. Though his experience and dogmatic views have embedded him in the circles of power, Jalili's past efforts at securing elected office have yielded lacklustre results, including two failed runs for parliament, a third-place finish in the 2013 presidential race and a withdrawal from the 2021 contest. Tehran mayor Alireza Zakani and Amirhossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi, a vice president under Raisi, are also in the mix. Mostafa Pourmohammadi, who has served as a minister during both conservative and pragmatist presidencies, is the only cleric in contention. During a series of televised debates, he has been the most vocal critic of the status quo among the candidates.\n\nThe sixth man running, and the sole reformist candidate, is Massoud Pezeshkian, who was minister of health during the Mohammad Khatami administration (1997-2005) and has been a member of parliament since 2008. Pezeshkian registered for the 2021 presidential election but was disqualified. In the current race, he is backed by reformist and pragmatist elements that declined to mount organised campaigns in the last three national elections, mainly because of what they regarded as the Guardian Council's exclusion of their preferred candidates. Among those who have endorsed Pezeshkian are the Reformist Front, comprising over 30 factions; former Presidents Khatami and Hassan Rouhani; and senior members of Rouhani's administration, such as Foreign Minister Javad Zarif.", "source": {"uri": "crisisgroup.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crisis Group"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type":

The accident occurred amidst challenging weather conditions in a mountainous region, leading to an extensive search operation that yielded no survivors. Raisi's sudden death had significant implications for Iran, as he was widely viewed as a potential successor to the Supreme Leader.\n\nFollowing this unfortunate event, an interim president was swiftly appointed, adhering to Iran's constitutional mandate that mandates new presidential elections within 50 days in case of the incumbent's unnatural death during their term. Today, on June 28th, 2024, Iran held these crucial elections to elect a new permanent president.\n\nIn this electoral landscape, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf has emerged as a leading contender. Ghalibaf, a seasoned Iranian politician, boasts an impressive resume, having served prominently as the Mayor of Tehran and as Speaker of the Parliament (Majlis). His influence extends into Iranian foreign policy, where he has played a pivotal role in relations with countries like India within the BRICS framework. Despite Iran not being a formal member of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa), Ghalibaf remains optimistic about the alliance's potential to counterbalance the existing global order.\n\nIran's elections hold significant importance for India due to the longstanding cordial bilateral relationship between the two countries rooted in historical affinities, cultural ties, strategic interests, and shared vision for the Global South. Iran's Ambassador to India, Iraj Elahi, emphasized the importance of trade conducted in local currencies, noting that India and Iran have engaged in such transactions in the past and are expected to resume them once technical issues are resolved. Elahi also announced that India will establish four polling stations in Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, and Hyderabad to accommodate the voting needs of over 3,000 Iranians studying and working in India.\n\nGhalibaf's political career is marked by extensive experience and administrative success. He has run for the presidency three times before -- in 2005, 2013, and 2017 -- demonstrating resilience and determination in the face of electoral challenges. Notably, he withdrew from the 2017 race to throw his support behind Raisi's candidacy, showcasing strategic decision-making and political manoeuvring.\n\nKnown for his pragmatic approach, Ghalibaf prioritizes both domestic economic issues and foreign policy matters. This approach has garnered him significant popularity among Iranian voters, as recent surveys indicate his support at 28.7%, placing him ahead of notable competitors. Other notable candidates include Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh-Hashemi, a highly conservative medical doctor and staunch supporter of Raisi's administration. Saeed Jalili, known for his unwavering anti-Western stance from his time as a former nuclear negotiator. Massoud Pezeshkian stands the sole reformist candidate. Mostafa Pourmohammadi, the only cleric among Iran's presidential contenders. Lastly, Alireza Zakani, Tehran's mayor since August 2021, with strong ultraconservative credentials. Among all these candidates, Ghalibaf seems to enjoy popular support of the people.\n\nGhalibaf's appeal is bolstered by his past leadership roles, particularly his tenure as Tehran's mayor and his command within Iran's security and air forces. His economic agenda focuses on creating jobs, reducing unemployment, and enhancing living standards through structural reforms and advancements in the IT sector has attracted massive popularity from voters.\n\nDespite facing setbacks in previous presidential bids, Ghalibaf remains a prominent figure in Iranian politics. His current role as Speaker of Parliament underscores his ongoing influence and ability to unite political elites, ensuring continuity in leadership and institutional stability.\n\nGhalibaf is widely regarded as an ambitious politician with a long-term vision for Iran's political landscape, aiming to leave a lasting legacy. He skilfully navigates the demands of Iranian society and political elites, positioning himself as a central figure in national politics and symbolizing continuity in Iranian political leadership.\n\nHis repeated nominations for the presidency underscore his resilience and determination in seeking higher office, reflecting his adeptness at integrating societal aspirations into his political agenda. Ghalibaf aims to bolster Iran's global standing while addressing domestic challenges, presenting a blend of experience, strategic foresight, and widespread public appeal. His campaign resonates strongly with Iranians seeking stability and economic progress amid regional and global uncertainties. Overall, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf's candidacy represents a pivotal moment in Iranian politics, shaping the future direction of the Islamic Republic.", "source": {"uri": "tfiglobalnews.com",

{"id": 243254256, "title": "Camila Cabello gets some collab love for new album 'C,XOXO': review", "text": "Just as spring began to bloom, it blossomed into one of the greatest diva seasons in pop history \u2014 from Ariana Grande\u2019s \u201cEternal Sunshine\u201d and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d to Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d Dua Lipa\u2019s \u201cRadical Optimism\u201d and Billie Eilish\u2019s \u201cHit Me Hard and Soft.\u201d But as we set summer off, there are no signs of diva fever cooling off, with the likes of Sabrina Carpenter, Gracie Abrams and Chappell Roan bringing that femme heat. And let\u2019s not forget about Camila Cabello, who is back with her new album \u201cC,XOXO,\u201d out on Friday. It\u2019s her fourth album since going solo from Fifth Harmony \u2014 and how the hell did that happen? Wasn\u2019t she just, like, breaking up the group? Well, since then, she hasn\u2019t exactly become the next Beyonc\u00e9. But, don\u2019t get it twisted, she\u2019s still had hits like \u201cHavana,\u201d which hit No. 1 back in 2017, to \u201cSe\u00f1orita,\u201d another chart-topping single that she had with Shawn Mendes back when they were together. And on her new LP, Cabello collabs with everyone from Playboi Carti (on the trappy opener \u201cI Luv It\u201d) to Lil Nas X (on the electro-popping \u201cHe Knows\u201d) to former City Girls JT and Yung Miami (on the reggaeton jam \u201cDream-Girls\u201d). But the A-plus-list guest is Drake, who shows up on not one but two tracks. And my jam is their joint \u201cHot Uptown\u201d \u2014 which is hot for real y\u2019all. It takes you back to the house vibes of Drake\u2019s 2022 album \u201cHonestly, Nevermind,\u201d and almost reminds me a little bit of his \u201cTake Care\u201d collab with Rihanna. And there\u2019s even a hint of the Afrobeats bliss of Tyla\u2019s \u201cWater.\u201d There are other bops on the album, as well as ballads \u2014 she\u2019s generally weaker at the latter, although she flexes some vocal skills when she slows it down on \u201cB.O.A.T.\u201d (which stands for \u201cbest of all time\u201d). But despite its overall solidness, the album is a little all over the place \u2014 and Cabello doesn\u2019t have the singular vocal beastness of, say, Christina Aguilera to hold it all together. And as far as chart goals go, I don\u2019t hear another \u201cHavana\u201d or \u201cSe\u00f1orita\u201d here. Still, Camila is getting some XOXO from me.", "summary": "On her fourth solo album, \"C,XOXO,\" Camila Cabello collabs with everyone from Playboi Carti and Lil Nas X to former City Girls JT and Yung Miami \u2014 but it's Drake who is the A-plus-list guest.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/28/entertainment/camila-cabello-gets-some-collab-love-for-new-album-cxoxo-review/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/84637974.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ElUNKhg3-RyIcpnTz.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:04:53", "author": "Chuck Arnold", "authors": ["Chuck Arnold"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.164}

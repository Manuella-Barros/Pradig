{"id": 223669306, "title": "Wes Streeting\u2019s three-word formula for how Labour will govern", "text": "Wes Streeting has set out a three word vision of the guiding philosophy of a Labour government if, as expected, it wins power on 4 July. The shadow health secretary had echoes of Tony Blair\u2019s New Labour when he promised that his party would be \u201ccompensatory not confiscatory\u201d. Mr Streeting was in discussion with The Independent\u2019s editor-in-chief Geordie Greig in front of an audience at the Hay Festival discussing the election, politics and his book One Boy, Two Bills and a Fry Up. Mr Greig noted that the UK is now \u201cin the foothills of an election campaign\u201d and asked: \u201cWhere is Labour going to find out that common centre ground? What is the formula? What are the words?\u201d Mr Streeting replied: \u201cA Labour Party which wins a mandate to govern and govern well is compensatory not confiscatory.\u201d When pressed on what this means he insisted that it is one which celebrates success and encourages ambition and aspiration, although he denied that it is a version of \u201cToryism\u201d. The discussion had followed an in depth interview with The Independent where Mr Streeting had brandished his Blairite credentials insisting that he will not bow to junior doctor demands for a pay rise and taking on his critics in his own party from the left about including private health providers in the NHS to bring down waiting lists. Before the election was called he had been actively involved in talks with potential defectors from the Tory party and had been one of the first to welcome rightwing Dover MP Natalie Elphicke to his party\u2019s ranks. He had also made it clear he is not in favour of \u201chandouts\u201d as a means to end poverty in opposing an end to the two child benefit cap even though in his book he described how he and his mother had survived on benefits. But speaking at the Hay Festival he insisted that a Labour government would be about \u201crewarding people\u201d who work hard. He noted: \u201cThe anxiety about Labour governments and what traditionally stops people from voting Labour that we need to vote Labour to form a government is that in the pursuit of social justice and equality we will be anti success and if you are successful we will take from you and we will resent your success.Because that\u2019s how you level the country and create equality.\u201d Taking this characterisation on, he said: \u201cI think it has to be the other way round.\u201d Going back to his life story in his autobiography, he said: \u201cThe thing that myself, Keir [Starmer], Angela [Rayner], Bridget Philipson and others around the shadow cabinet table have in common is through different routes - in my case the University of Cambridge, in Angela\u2019s case the university of life and trade union movement - we've worked our way up and understand the barriers that are in the way of people from working class backgrounds like ours. \u201cWe know that to build a successful country, you have to create a culture in which people can be successful to be successful, in which everyone has a stake in it, in which everyone makes a contribution. \u201cOne where everyone derives a benefit through the provision of good public services, good social infrastructure, the right culture, the right leadership, and entrepreneurial country where business leaders can succeed, and why this country is a destination for global talent.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Wes Streeting has signalled Labour is ready to usher in a new era of Blairism but with an update </p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/wes-streeting-labour-general-election-hay-festival-b2551756.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/04/30/16/5bb47de4-8ea1-44c9-bf25-e258c39895b4.jpg?width=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/lkQ4093F-4VHSaSK0.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:00:59", "author": "David Maddox", "authors": ["David Maddox"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.15}

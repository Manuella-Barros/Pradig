{"id": 223723626, "title": "Chicago vet's photos from front lines of World War II published in son's tribute to his dad", "text": "Fred Brems grew up captivated by the tales his father shared from his days serving in World War II. \u201cThe way he talked about it, he knew what he was doing out there,\u201d said Brems, 75. \u201cThere was an element of luck.\u201d Now, Brems hopes to share those stories with others as his way of honoring his father, who died in 2014. He spent 18 years compiling his father\u2019s photos and stories from the war into a book titled \u201cKnights of Freedom.\u201d \u201cI really love these pictures, because it was my dad taking them,\u201d Brems said. \u201cHe was always telling stories.\u201d His father, Lt. Col. Frederick C. Brems, from Belmont Cragin, loved photography \u201cfrom the get-go\u201d and helped sell cameras at a Chicago department store. He took his Rolleiflex camera to war, documenting everything from burning vehicles to portraits of his comrades. \u201cThe camera was part of him,\u201d his son said. Brems preserved those pictures in a box, totaling around 900. But for the longest time, Brems could not see much detail in them because they were such small pictures \u2014 2\u00bc-by-2\u00bc inches. That changed after his cousin, a professional photographer, digitized them. The cousin took the \u201clittle dinky photos and blew them up to 12 megabytes,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they were blown up, I was amazed,\u201d Brems said. \u201cI realized I was looking through my dad\u2019s eyes. I saw what he saw when he took those photos.\u201d Brems\u2019 father served in the 2nd Armored Division, which he called his \u201chome.\u201d The division, nicknamed \u201cHell on Wheels,\u201d was one of the most renowned units of military history, serving in North Africa, Germany, France and more. Michael Bell, executive director of the Jenny Craig Institute for the Study of War and Democracy, said the 2nd Armored Division had \u201can amazing record\u201d in combat. The division inflicted eight times the casualties on the enemy than it received, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a division that always had an incredible reputation of high standards and great performance,\u201d Bell said. The 2nd Armored Division was a key unit in the Allied invasion of Germany, a difficult campaign known for high casualty rates, Bell said. Bell said firsthand accounts are crucial to learning about the day to day of soldiers\u2019 lives. \u201cTheir memories are so incredibly vivid that we can get insights that you can\u2019t otherwise understand,\u201d Bell said. Karen Dellinger\u2019s father, Ray Stewart, served alongside Brems\u2019 father. Though Stewart died this year, his daughter said she learned about him from reading Brems\u2019 book. \u201cI could care less about guns,\u201d Dellinger said. \u201cThe book does a good job of the everyday. Some of it\u2019s mundane. Some of it\u2019s interesting. Some of it\u2019s courageous.\u201d Brems was \u201cresearch driven\u201d in his writing, she said. Her father advised Brems to tell the stories \u201clike it happened,\u201d even if the stories were emotionally difficult. \u201cA lot of these guys go through experiences they don\u2019t repeat,\u201d Dellinger said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t reach out to younger people and let them know the stories, they will be forgotten.\u201d For his service, Brems\u2019 father was honored with a Silver Star and a Bronze Star. Brems\u2019 father eventually commanded a tank company. Bell said high casualties required leaders to step up and assume responsibilities quickly. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s an amazing story,\u201d Bell said. \u201cIt\u2019s a testament to identify the soldier to do that and move forward.\u201d After the war, Brems said his father worked at a paper company near the Merchandise Mart for 40 years. He also served in the reserves until 1977. Later, his father moved to Wood Dale, where Brems was born in 1948, and Algonquin. Since then, his stories have carried on through his son. \u201cMy dad\u2019s my hero, and he always has been,\u201d Brems said.", "url": "https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago/2024/05/26/fred-brems-world-war-ii-history-knights-of-freedom", "image": "https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/acffcbe/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1499x856+0+482/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F95%2F0a%2F255795e544a2be1d8085887c5529%2F17145", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:00:00", "author": "Jessica Ma", "authors": ["Jessica Ma"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.32}

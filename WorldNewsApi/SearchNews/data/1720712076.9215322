As the number of people being acknowledged for their contributions to the community falls sharply, Andrews and McGowan, premiers of Victoria and Western Australia who both retired last year, and Crean, who led the party and served as a minister in the Hawke, Keating, Rudd and Gillard governments, were recognised as Companions of the Order of Australia. Crean, who retired from politics in 2013, died last year. He was recognised for his service to the federal parliament, the university sector, to business and to industrial relations. Andrews was recognised for \u201ceminent service to the people and Parliament of Victoria\u201d, for his work on public health through COVID and for infrastructure development. McGowan was acknowledged for his \u201ceminent\u201d service to Western Australians, for his role during the pandemic, during which his state was shut off to the rest of Australia, and service to international trade relations.", "summary": "Contentious premiers Daniel Andrews and Mark McGowan along with former Labor leader Simon Crean head a slimmed-down honours list.", "url": "https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/labor-leaders-top-a-shaved-down-king-s-birthday-honours-list-20240609-p5jkbz.html", "image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.1037%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/59d4b2fa1f0ef22f67dd89131b56a0213553e3ae", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 12:01:00", "author": "Shane Wright", "authors": ["Shane Wright"], "language": "en", "source_country": "au", "sentiment": 0.059}

JD Vance, R-Ohio, arrive a campaign rally, July 20, 2024, in Grand Rapids, Mich.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Roughly 3 in 4 American adults believe the upcoming presidential election is vital to the future of U.S. democracy, although which candidate they think poses the greater threat depends on their political leanings, according to a poll.\n\nThe survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that most Democrats, Republicans and independents see the election as \"very important\" or \"extremely important\" to democracy, while Democrats have a higher level of intensity about the issue. More than half of Democrats say the November election is \"extremely important\" to the future of U.S. democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 independents and Republicans.\n\nDemocrat Pamela Hanson, 67, of Amery, Wisconsin, said she has grave concerns for the future of democracy in the country if Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump gets elected.\n\n\"His statements tend towards him being a king or a dictator, a person in charge by himself,\" Hanson said. \"I mean, the man is unhinged in my opinion.\"\n\nBut Republican Ernie Wagner from Liberty, New York, said it's President Joe Biden's administration -- of which Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, is a part -- that has abused the power of the executive branch.\n\n\"Biden has tried to erase the student loans, and he's been told by the courts that it's unconstitutional to do that,\" said Wagner, 85. \"He's weaponized the FBI to get at his political opponents.\"\n\nThe poll findings suggest that many Democrats continue to view Trump as a threat to democracy after he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election, embraced the rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and threatened to seek retribution against his opponents if he wins reelection.\n\nBut they also indicate that many of Trump's supporters agree with him that Biden is the real threat to democracy. Trump and his allies have accused Biden of weaponizing the Justice Department as it has pursued charges against the former president over his effort to halt certification of the 2020 election and keeping classified documents, though there is no evidence Biden has had any involvement or influence in the cases.\n\nTrump has framed himself as a defender of American values and portrayed Biden as a \"destroyer\" of democracy. He said multiple times after he survived an assassination attempt last month that he \"took a bullet for democracy.\"\n\nThe poll, conducted in the days after Biden dropped out of the race and Harris announced her campaign, is an early glimpse of Americans' views of a reshaped contest.\n\nMajorities of both Democrats and Republicans say democracy could be at risk in this election depending on who wins the presidency, responses generally in line with the findings when the question was last asked in an AP-NORC poll in December 2023.\n\nHanson, the Wisconsin Democrat, said she worries Trump in a second term would use the conservative-dominated U.S. Supreme Court to overrule important freedoms. She also is concerned that he would fill his Cabinet with loyalists who don't care about the well-being of everyone in the country and defund agencies that regulate key functions of society.\n\nBut Wagner, the New York Republican, brushed off those concerns and pointed to Trump's time in office.\n\n\"When he was in the White House, we had peace, we had prosperity, we had energy independence,\" he said. \"What's undemocratic about that?\"\n\nHe said he didn't think Trump's intentions leading up to and on Jan. 6 were criminal.\n\n\"I just think he was misguided,\" Wagner said.\n\nSome independents also are carefully considering the stakes of the upcoming election on the country's democratic future.\n\n\"I believe that this is the most important election of my lifetime,\" said 53-year-old Patricia Seliga-Williams of LaVale, Maryland, an independent who is leaning toward voting for Harris.\n\nSeliga-Williams said she's barely scraping by on $15 an hour as a hotel breakfast attendant and remembers Trump handling the economy and immigration well. But she didn't like it when he recently quipped that he plans to be a \"dictator\" on day one in office.\n\n\"We all know Donald Trump could run the country,\" she said. \"But he's just too aggressive anymore, and I don't think I can trust that as a voter.\"\n\nNot everyone agrees that this year's presidential election will be an inflection point for the country's democracy, offering starkly different reasons, according to the AP-NORC poll. About 2 in 10 Americans say democracy in the U.S. is strong enough to withstand the outcome of the election no matter who wins, while another 2 in 10 believe democracy is already so seriously broken that the outcome doesn't matter.\n\nThe poll also shows the stakes of democracy in the election are felt more by older adults rather than younger ones. About half of adults 45 and older say the outcome of the election is extremely important for the future of democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 adults under 45.\n\n\"Making the claim that the other candidate is trying to destroy democracy, it doesn't really land for me,\" said Daniel Oliver, 26, an independent from suburban Detroit. \"I think that we have things in place that should safeguard against when you kind of play at destroying democracy. We have other branches of government. We have people that believe in voting. So, it would be hard for a candidate to take over and become some kind of dictator.\"\n\nHe said he'll be looking for candidates to talk about issues he's more interested in, such as reducing inflation and investing in clean energy sources.\n\nBiden and Trump spent months sparring over whose second term would be worse for democracy. The president nodded to the consequences when he ended his campaign last month, saying in his Oval Office address that \"the defense of democracy is more important than any title.\"\n\nHarris has focused more on the concept of \"freedom\" in the early days of her campaign. She has said Trump's reelection could result in Americans losing the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence and the freedom for women to make decisions about their own bodies. Her debut campaign ad last month was set to Beyonc\u00e9's 2016 track \"Freedom,\" and it has become a campaign anthem for her at rallies ever since.\n\nHarris didn't mention democracy in her first two presidential campaign rallies, but she returned to the topic in remarks to Sigma Gamma Rho sorority members in Houston last week, saying \"our fundamental freedoms are on the ballot, and so is our democracy.\"\n\nThe poll of 1,143 adults was conducted July 25-29, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.\n\nThe Associated Press\u202freceives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

Tim Walz arrive at a campaign rally in Philadelphia, Aug. 6, 2024. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke)\n\nRoughly 3 in 4 American adults believe the upcoming presidential election is vital to the future of U.S. democracy, although which candidate they think poses the greater threat depends on their political leanings, according to a poll.\n\nThe survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that most Democrats, Republicans and independents see the election as \"very important\" or \"extremely important\" to democracy, while Democrats have a higher level of intensity about the issue. More than half of Democrats say the November election is \"extremely important\" to the future of U.S. democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 independents and Republicans.\n\nDemocrat Pamela Hanson, 67, of Amery, Wisconsin, said she has grave concerns for the future of democracy in the country if Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump gets elected.\n\n\"His statements tend towards him being a king or a dictator, a person in charge by himself,\" Hanson said. \"I mean, the man is unhinged in my opinion.\"\n\nBut Republican Ernie Wagner from Liberty, New York, said it's President Joe Biden's administration -- of which Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, is a part -- that has abused the power of the executive branch.\n\n\"Biden has tried to erase the student loans, and he's been told by the courts that it's unconstitutional to do that,\" said Wagner, 85. \"He's weaponized the FBI to get at his political opponents.\"\n\nThe poll findings suggest that many Democrats continue to view Trump as a threat to democracy after he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election, embraced the rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and threatened to seek retribution against his opponents if he wins reelection.\n\nBut they also indicate that many of Trump's supporters agree with him that Biden is the real threat to democracy. Trump and his allies have accused Biden of weaponizing the Justice Department as it has pursued charges against the former president over his effort to halt certification of the 2020 election and keeping classified documents, though there is no evidence Biden has had any involvement or influence in the cases.\n\nTrump has framed himself as a defender of American values and portrayed Biden as a \"destroyer\" of democracy. He said multiple times after he survived an assassination attempt last month that he \"took a bullet for democracy.\"\n\nThe poll, conducted in the days after Biden dropped out of the race and Harris announced her campaign, is an early glimpse of Americans' views of a reshaped contest.\n\nMajorities of both Democrats and Republicans say democracy could be at risk in this election depending on who wins the presidency, responses generally in line with the findings when the question was last asked in an AP-NORC poll in December 2023.\n\nHanson, the Wisconsin Democrat, said she worries Trump in a second term would use the conservative-dominated U.S. Supreme Court to overrule important freedoms. She also is concerned that he would fill his Cabinet with loyalists who don't care about the well-being of everyone in the country and defund agencies that regulate key functions of society.\n\nBut Wagner, the New York Republican, brushed off those concerns and pointed to Trump's time in office.\n\n\"When he was in the White House, we had peace, we had prosperity, we had energy independence,\" he said. \"What's undemocratic about that?\"\n\nHe said he didn't think Trump's intentions leading up to and on Jan. 6 were criminal.\n\n\"I just think he was misguided,\" Wagner said.\n\nSome independents also are carefully considering the stakes of the upcoming election on the country's democratic future.\n\n\"I believe that this is the most important election of my lifetime,\" said 53-year-old Patricia Seliga-Williams of LaVale, Maryland, an independent who is leaning toward voting for Harris.\n\nSeliga-Williams said she's barely scraping by on $15 an hour as a hotel breakfast attendant and remembers Trump handling the economy and immigration well. But she didn't like it when he recently quipped that he plans to be a \"dictator\" on day one in office.\n\n\"We all know Donald Trump could run the country,\" she said. \"But he's just too aggressive anymore, and I don't think I can trust that as a voter.\"\n\nNot everyone agrees that this year's presidential election will be an inflection point for the country's democracy, offering starkly different reasons, according to the AP-NORC poll. About 2 in 10 Americans say democracy in the U.S. is strong enough to withstand the outcome of the election no matter who wins, while another 2 in 10 believe democracy is already so seriously broken that the outcome doesn't matter.\n\nThe poll also shows the stakes of democracy in the election are felt more by older adults rather than younger ones. About half of adults 45 and older say the outcome of the election is extremely important for the future of democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 adults under 45.\n\n\"Making the claim that the other candidate is trying to destroy democracy, it doesn't really land for me,\" said Daniel Oliver, 26, an independent from suburban Detroit. \"I think that we have things in place that should safeguard against when you kind of play at destroying democracy. We have other branches of government. We have people that believe in voting. So, it would be hard for a candidate to take over and become some kind of dictator.\"\n\nHe said he'll be looking for candidates to talk about issues he's more interested in, such as reducing inflation and investing in clean energy sources.\n\nBiden and Trump spent months sparring over whose second term would be worse for democracy. The president nodded to the consequences when he ended his campaign last month, saying in his Oval Office address that \"the defense of democracy is more important than any title.\"\n\nHarris has focused more on the concept of \"freedom\" in the early days of her campaign. She has said Trump's reelection could result in Americans losing the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence and the freedom for women to make decisions about their own bodies. Her debut campaign ad last month was set to Beyonc\u00e9's 2016 track \"Freedom,\" and it has become a campaign anthem for her at rallies ever since.\n\nHarris didn't mention democracy in her first two presidential campaign rallies, but she returned to the topic in remarks to Sigma Gamma Rho sorority members in Houston last week, saying \"our fundamental freedoms are on the ballot, and so is our democracy.\"\n\nThe poll of 1,143 adults was conducted July 25-29, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

More than half of Democrats say the November election is \"extremely important\" to the future of U.S. democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 independents and Republicans.\n\nDemocrat Pamela Hanson, 67, of Amery, Wisconsin, said she has grave concerns for the future of democracy in the country if Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump gets elected.\n\n\"His statements tend towards him being a king or a dictator, a person in charge by himself,\" Hanson said. \"I mean, the man is unhinged in my opinion.\"\n\nBut Republican Ernie Wagner from Liberty, New York, said it's President Joe Biden's administration -- of which Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, is a part -- that has abused the power of the executive branch.\n\n\"Biden has tried to erase the student loans, and he's been told by the courts that it's unconstitutional to do that,\" said Wagner, 85. \"He's weaponized the FBI to get at his political opponents.\"\n\nThe poll findings suggest that many Democrats continue to view Trump as a threat to democracy after he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election, embraced the rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and threatened to seek retribution against his opponents if he wins reelection.\n\nBut they also indicate that many of Trump's supporters agree with him that Biden is the real threat to democracy. Trump and his allies have accused Biden of weaponizing the Justice Department as it has pursued charges against the former president over his effort to halt certification of the 2020 election and keeping classified documents, though there is no evidence Biden has had any involvement or influence in the cases.\n\nTrump has framed himself as a defender of American values and portrayed Biden as a \"destroyer\" of democracy. He said multiple times after he survived an assassination attempt last month that he \"took a bullet for democracy.\"\n\nThe poll, conducted in the days after Biden dropped out of the race and Harris announced her campaign, is an early glimpse of Americans' views of a reshaped contest.\n\nMajorities of both Democrats and Republicans say democracy could be at risk in this election depending on who wins the presidency, responses generally in line with the findings when the question was last asked in an AP-NORC poll in December 2023.\n\nHanson, the Wisconsin Democrat, said she worries Trump in a second term would use the conservative-dominated U.S. Supreme Court to overrule important freedoms. She also is concerned that he would fill his Cabinet with loyalists who don't care about the well-being of everyone in the country and defund agencies that regulate key functions of society.\n\nBut Wagner, the New York Republican, brushed off those concerns and pointed to Trump's time in office.\n\n\"When he was in the White House, we had peace, we had prosperity, we had energy independence,\" he said. \"What's undemocratic about that?\"\n\nHe said he didn't think Trump's intentions leading up to and on Jan. 6 were criminal.\n\n\"I just think he was misguided,\" Wagner said.\n\nSome independents also are carefully considering the stakes of the upcoming election on the country's democratic future.\n\n\"I believe that this is the most important election of my lifetime,\" said 53-year-old Patricia Seliga-Williams of LaVale, Maryland, an independent who is leaning toward voting for Harris.\n\nSeliga-Williams said she's barely scraping by on $15 an hour as a hotel breakfast attendant and remembers Trump handling the economy and immigration well. But she didn't like it when he recently quipped that he plans to be a \"dictator\" on day one in office.\n\n\"We all know Donald Trump could run the country,\" she said. \"But he's just too aggressive anymore, and I don't think I can trust that as a voter.\"\n\nNot everyone agrees that this year's presidential election will be an inflection point for the country's democracy, offering starkly different reasons, according to the AP-NORC poll. About 2 in 10 Americans say democracy in the U.S. is strong enough to withstand the outcome of the election no matter who wins, while another 2 in 10 believe democracy is already so seriously broken that the outcome doesn't matter.\n\nThe poll also shows the stakes of democracy in the election are felt more by older adults rather than younger ones. About half of adults 45 and older say the outcome of the election is extremely important for the future of democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 adults under 45.\n\n\"Making the claim that the other candidate is trying to destroy democracy, it doesn't really land for me,\" said Daniel Oliver, 26, an independent from suburban Detroit. \"I think that we have things in place that should safeguard against when you kind of play at destroying democracy. We have other branches of government. We have people that believe in voting. So, it would be hard for a candidate to take over and become some kind of dictator.\"\n\nHe said he'll be looking for candidates to talk about issues he's more interested in, such as reducing inflation and investing in clean energy sources.\n\nBiden and Trump spent months sparring over whose second term would be worse for democracy. The president nodded to the consequences when he ended his campaign last month, saying in his Oval Office address that \"the defense of democracy is more important than any title.\"\n\nHarris has focused more on the concept of \"freedom\" in the early days of her campaign. She has said Trump's reelection could result in Americans losing the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence and the freedom for women to make decisions about their own bodies. Her debut campaign ad last month was set to Beyonc\u00e9's 2016 track \"Freedom,\" and it has become a campaign anthem for her at rallies ever since.\n\nHarris didn't mention democracy in her first two presidential campaign rallies, but she returned to the topic in remarks to Sigma Gamma Rho sorority members in Houston last week, saying \"our fundamental freedoms are on the ballot, and so is our democracy.\"", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "linley_sanders@detroitnews.com", "name": "Linley Sanders", "type": "author",

More than half of Democrats say the November election is \"extremely important\" to the future of US democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 independents and Republicans.\n\nDemocrat Pamela Hanson, 67, of Amery, Wisconsin, said she has grave concerns for the future of democracy in the country if Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump gets elected.\n\n\"His statements tend towards him being a king or a dictator, a person in charge by himself,\" Hanson said. \"I mean, the man is unhinged in my opinion.\"\n\nBut Republican Ernie Wagner from Liberty, New York, said it's President Joe Biden's administration -- of which Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, is a part -- that has abused the power of the executive branch.\n\n\"Biden has tried to erase the student loans, and he's been told by the courts that it's unconstitutional to do that,\" said Wagner, 85. \"He's weaponized the FBI to get at his political opponents.\"\n\nThe poll findings suggest that many Democrats continue to view Trump as a threat to democracy after he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election, embraced the rioters who attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, and threatened to seek retribution against his opponents if he wins reelection.\n\nBut they also indicate that many of Trump's supporters agree with him that Biden is the real threat to democracy. Trump and his allies have accused Biden of weaponizing the Justice Department as it has pursued charges against the former president over his effort to halt certification of the 2020 election and keeping classified documents, though there is no evidence Biden has had any involvement or influence in the cases.\n\nTrump has framed himself as a defender of American values and portrayed Biden as a \"destroyer\" of democracy. He said multiple times after he survived an assassination attempt last month that he \"took a bullet for democracy.\"\n\nThe poll, conducted in the days after Biden dropped out of the race and Harris announced her campaign, is an early glimpse of Americans' views of a reshaped contest.\n\nMajorities of both Democrats and Republicans say democracy could be at risk in this election depending on who wins the presidency, responses generally in line with the findings when the question was last asked in an AP-NORC poll in December 2023.\n\nHanson, the Wisconsin Democrat, said she worries Trump in a second term would use the conservative-dominated US Supreme Court to overrule important freedoms. She also is concerned that he would fill his Cabinet with loyalists who don't care about the well-being of everyone in the country and defund agencies that regulate key functions of society.\n\nBut Wagner, the New York Republican, brushed off those concerns and pointed to Trump's time in office.\n\n\"When he was in the White House, we had peace, we had prosperity, we had energy independence,\" he said. \"What's undemocratic about that?\"\n\nHe said he didn't think Trump's intentions leading up to and on January 6 were criminal.\n\n\"I just think he was misguided,\" Wagner said.\n\nSome independents also are carefully considering the stakes of the upcoming election on the country's democratic future.\n\n\"I believe that this is the most important election of my lifetime,\" said 53-year-old Patricia Seliga-Williams of LaVale, Maryland, an independent who is leaning toward voting for Harris.\n\nSeliga-Williams said she's barely scraping by on $15 an hour as a hotel breakfast attendant and remembers Trump handling the economy and immigration well. But she didn't like it when he recently quipped that he plans to be a \"dictator\" on day one in office.\n\n\"We all know Donald Trump could run the country,\" she said. \"But he's just too aggressive anymore, and I don't think I can trust that as a voter.\"\n\nNot everyone agrees that this year's presidential election will be an inflection point for the country's democracy, offering starkly different reasons, according to the AP-NORC poll. About 2 in 10 Americans say democracy in the US is strong enough to withstand the outcome of the election no matter who wins, while another 2 in 10 believe democracy is already so seriously broken that the outcome doesn't matter.\n\nThe poll also shows the stakes of democracy in the election are felt more by older adults rather than younger ones. About half of adults 45 and older say the outcome of the election is extremely important for the future of democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 adults under 45.\n\n\"Making the claim that the other candidate is trying to destroy democracy, it doesn't really land for me,\" said Daniel Oliver, 26, an independent from suburban Detroit. \"I think that we have things in place that should safeguard against when you kind of play at destroying democracy. We have other branches of government. We have people that believe in voting. So, it would be hard for a candidate to take over and become some kind of dictator.\"\n\nHe said he'll be looking for candidates to talk about issues he's more interested in, such as reducing inflation and investing in clean energy sources.\n\nBiden and Trump spent months sparring over whose second term would be worse for democracy. The president nodded to the consequences when he ended his campaign last month, saying in his Oval Office address that \"the defense of democracy is more important than any title.\"\n\nHarris has focused more on the concept of \"freedom\" in the early days of her campaign. She has said Trump's reelection could result in Americans losing the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence and the freedom for women to make decisions about their own bodies. Her debut campaign ad last month was set to Beyonc\u00e9's 2016 track \"Freedom,\" and it has become a campaign anthem for her at rallies ever since.\n\nHarris didn't mention democracy in her first two presidential campaign rallies, but she returned to the topic in remarks to Sigma Gamma Rho sorority members in Houston last week, saying \"our fundamental freedoms are on the ballot, and so is our

She also is concerned Trump would fill his Cabinet with loyalists and defund agencies that regulate key functions of society.\n\nBut Wagner, the New York Republican, brushed off those concerns and pointed to Trump's time in office.\n\n\"When he was in the White House, we had peace, we had prosperity, we had energy independence,\" he said. \"What's undemocratic about that?\"\n\nHe said he did not think Trump's intentions leading up to and on Jan. 6 were criminal.\n\n\"I just think he was misguided,\" Wagner said.\n\nSome independents also are carefully considering the stakes of the upcoming election on the country's democratic future.\n\n\"I believe that this is the most important election of my lifetime,\" said 53-year-old Patricia Seliga-Williams of LaVale, Maryland, an independent who is leaning toward voting for Harris.\n\nSeliga-Williams said she's barely scraping by on $15 an hour as a hotel breakfast attendant and remembers Trump handling the economy and immigration well. But she didn't like it when he recently quipped that he plans to be a \"dictator\" on day one in office.\n\n\"We all know Donald Trump could run the country,\" she said. \"But he's just too aggressive anymore, and I don't think I can trust that as a voter.\"\n\nNot everyone agrees this year's presidential election will be an inflection point for the country's democracy, offering starkly different reasons, according to the AP-NORC poll. About 2 in 10 Americans say democracy in the U.S. is strong enough to withstand the outcome of the election no matter who wins, while another 2 in 10 believe democracy is already so seriously broken that the outcome does not matter.\n\nThe poll also shows the stakes of democracy in the election are felt more by older adults rather than younger ones. About half of adults 45 and older say the outcome of the election is extremely important for the future of democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 adults under 45.\n\n\"Making the claim that the other candidate is trying to destroy democracy, it doesn't really land for me,\" said Daniel Oliver, 26, an independent from suburban Detroit. \"I think that we have things in place that should safeguard against when you kind of play at destroying democracy. We have other branches of government. We have people that believe in voting. So, it would be hard for a candidate to take over and become some kind of dictator.\"\n\nHe said he will be looking for candidates to talk about issues he is more interested in, such as reducing inflation and investing in clean energy sources.\n\nBiden and Trump spent months sparring over whose second term would be worse for democracy. The president nodded to the consequences when he ended his campaign last month, saying in his Oval Office address that \"the defense of democracy is more important than any title.\"\n\nHarris has focused more on the concept of \"freedom\" in the early days of her campaign. She has said Trump's reelection could result in Americans losing the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence and the freedom for women to make decisions about their own bodies. Her debut campaign ad last month was set to Beyonc\u00e9's 2016 track \"Freedom,\" and it has become a campaign anthem for her at rallies ever since.\n\nHarris did not mention democracy in her first two presidential campaign rallies, but she returned to the topic in remarks to Sigma Gamma Rho sorority members in Houston last week, saying \"our fundamental freedoms are on the ballot, and so is our democracy.\n\nNORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel polled 1,143 adults July 25-29.

More than half of Democrats say the November election is \"extremely important\" to the future of U.S. democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 independents and Republicans.\n\nDemocrat Pamela Hanson, 67, of Amery, Wisconsin, said she has grave concerns for the future of democracy in the country if Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump gets elected.\n\n\"His statements tend towards him being a king or a dictator, a person in charge by himself,\" Hanson said. \"I mean, the man is unhinged in my opinion.\"\n\nBut Republican Ernie Wagner from Liberty, New York, said it's President Joe Biden's administration -- of which Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, is a part -- that has abused the power of the executive branch.\n\n\"Biden has tried to erase the student loans, and he's been told by the courts that it's unconstitutional to do that,\" said Wagner, 85. \"He's weaponized the FBI to get at his political opponents.\"\n\nThe poll findings suggest that many Democrats continue to view Trump as a threat to democracy after he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election, embraced the rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and threatened to seek retribution against his opponents if he wins reelection.\n\nBut they also indicate that many of Trump's supporters agree with him that Biden is the real threat to democracy. Trump and his allies have accused Biden of weaponizing the Justice Department as it has pursued charges against the former president over his effort to halt certification of the 2020 election and keeping classified documents, though there is no evidence Biden has had any involvement or influence in the cases.\n\nTrump has framed himself as a defender of American values and portrayed Biden as a \"destroyer\" of democracy.

More than half of Democrats say the November election is \"extremely important\" to the future of U.S. democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 independents and Republicans.\n\nRelated Story: The Next Month in the Economy Could be Crucial for the Presidential Election\n\nDemocrat Pamela Hanson, 67, of Amery, Wisconsin, said she has grave concerns for the future of democracy in the country if Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump gets elected.\n\n\"His statements tend towards him being a king or a dictator, a person in charge by himself,\" Hanson said. \"I mean, the man is unhinged in my opinion.\"\n\nBut Republican Ernie Wagner from Liberty, New York, said it's President Joe Biden's administration -- of which Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, is a part -- that has abused the power of the executive branch.\n\n\"Biden has tried to erase the student loans, and he's been told by the courts that it's unconstitutional to do that,\" said Wagner, 85. \"He's weaponized the FBI to get at his political opponents.\"\n\nRelated Story: Russia Is Relying on Unwitting Americans to Spread Election Disinformation, US ...\n\nThe poll findings suggest that many Democrats continue to view Trump as a threat to democracy after he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election, embraced the rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and threatened to seek retribution against his opponents if he wins reelection.\n\nBut they also indicate that many of Trump's supporters agree with him that Biden is the real threat to democracy. Trump and his allies have accused Biden of weaponizing the Justice Department as it has pursued charges against the former president over his effort to halt certification of the 2020 election and keeping classified documents, though there is no evidence Biden has had any involvement or influence in the cases.\n\nTrump has framed himself as a defender of American values and portrayed Biden as a \"destroyer\" of democracy. He said multiple times after he survived an assassination attempt last month that he \"took a bullet for democracy.\"\n\nThe poll, conducted in the days after Biden dropped out of the race and Harris announced her campaign, is an early glimpse of Americans' views of a reshaped contest.\n\nMajorities of both Democrats and Republicans say democracy could be at risk in this election depending on who wins the presidency, responses generally in line with the findings when the question was last asked in an AP-NORC poll in December 2023.\n\nHanson, the Wisconsin Democrat, said she worries Trump in a second term would use the conservative-dominated U.S. Supreme Court to overrule important freedoms. She also is concerned that he would fill his Cabinet with loyalists who don't care about the well-being of everyone in the country and defund agencies that regulate key functions of society.\n\nBut Wagner, the New York Republican, brushed off those concerns and pointed to Trump's time in office.\n\n\"When he was in the White House, we had peace, we had prosperity, we had energy independence,\" he said. \"What's undemocratic about that?\"\n\nHe said he didn't think Trump's intentions leading up to and on Jan. 6 were criminal.\n\n\"I just think he was misguided,\" Wagner said.\n\nRelated Story: Extreme Heat Is Impacting Most Americans' Electricity Bills, AP-NORC Poll ...\n\nSome independents also are carefully considering the stakes of the upcoming election on the country's democratic future.\n\n\"I believe that this is the most important election of my lifetime,\" said 53-year-old Patricia Seliga-Williams of LaVale, Maryland, an independent who is leaning toward voting for Harris.\n\nSeliga-Williams said she's barely scraping by on $15 an hour as a hotel breakfast attendant and remembers Trump handling the economy and immigration well. But she didn't like it when he recently quipped that he plans to be a \"dictator\" on day one in office.\n\n\"We all know Donald Trump could run the country,\" she said. \"But he's just too aggressive anymore, and I don't think I can trust that as a voter.\"\n\nNot everyone agrees that this year's presidential election will be an inflection point for the country's democracy, offering starkly different reasons, according to the AP-NORC poll. About 2 in 10 Americans say democracy in the U.S. is strong enough to withstand the outcome of the election no matter who wins, while another 2 in 10 believe democracy is already so seriously broken that the outcome doesn't matter.\n\nThe poll also shows the stakes of democracy in the election are felt more by older adults rather than younger ones. About half of adults 45 and older say the outcome of the election is extremely important for the future of democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 adults under 45.\n\n\"Making the claim that the other candidate is trying to destroy democracy, it doesn't really land for me,\" said Daniel Oliver, 26, an independent from suburban Detroit. \"I think that we have things in place that should safeguard against when you kind of play at destroying democracy. We have other branches of government. We have people that believe in voting. So, it would be hard for a candidate to take over and become some kind of dictator.\"\n\nHe said he'll be looking for candidates to talk about issues he's more interested in, such as reducing inflation and investing in clean energy sources.\n\nBiden and Trump spent months sparring over whose second term would be worse for democracy. The president nodded to the consequences when he ended his campaign last month, saying in his Oval Office address that \"the defense of democracy is more important than any title.\"\n\nHarris has focused more on the concept of \"freedom\" in the early days of her campaign. She has said Trump's reelection could result in Americans losing the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence and the freedom for women to make decisions about their own bodies. Her debut campaign ad last month was set to Beyonc\u00e9's 2016 track \"Freedom,\" and it has become a campaign anthem for her at rallies ever since.\n\nHarris didn't mention democracy in her first two presidential campaign rallies, but she returned to the topic in remarks to Sigma Gamma Rho sorority members in Houston last week, saying \"our fundamental freedoms are on the ballot, and so is our democracy.\"", "source": {"uri": "gvwire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GV Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@gvwire.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency":

But which candidate they see as the greatest threat varies based on their political leanings.\n\nThe research of The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that most Democrats, Republicans and independents view the election as \"very important\" or \"extremely important\" to democracy, with Democrats expressing a higher degree of intensity about the issue. More than half of Democrats say the November election is \"extremely important\" to the future of American democracy, compared with about 4-in-10 independents and Republicans.\n\nDemocrat Pamela Hanson, 67, of Amery, Wisconsin, said she is deeply concerned about the future of democracy in the country if the Republican presidential nominee... Donald Trump is elected.\n\n\"His statements tend to be that he's a king or a dictator, a person who's just in charge,\" Hanson said. \"I mean, the man is, in my opinion, deranged.\"\n\nBut Republican Ernie Wagner of Liberty, New York, said it is the administration of President Joe Biden -- which includes Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee -- that has abused the power of the executive branch.\n\n\"Biden has tried to forgive student loans, but the courts have told him it is unconstitutional to do so,\" said Wagner, 85. \"He has used the FBI as a weapon to target his political opponents.\"\n\nThe poll results show that many Democrats still see Trump as a threat to democracy after he tried overturn the results of the Elections 2020embraced the rioters who attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021 and threatened seek revenge against his opponents if he is re-elected.\n\nBut they also indicate that many of Trump's supporters agree with him that Biden is the real threat to democracy. Trump and his allies have accused Biden of the Ministry of Justice because it has filed charges against the former president for his efforts to stop the certification of the 2020 election and the retention of secret documents, although there is no evidence that Biden had any involvement or influence in the cases.\n\nTrump has portrayed himself as a defender of American values and Biden as a \"destroyer\" of democracy. He said several times after he survived an attempted murder last month that he had taken \"a bullet for democracy.\"\n\nThe poll, which was held in the days after Biden withdrew of the race and Harris announced her campaign is a first glimpse into how Americans are looking at a new shape of the race.\n\nMajorities of both Democrats and Republicans say democracy could be in jeopardy in this election, depending on who wins the presidency. These responses are generally consistent with the findings when the question was last asked. an AP-NORC poll in December 2023.\n\nHanson, the Wisconsin Democrat, said she worries that Trump could win a second term conservative dominated US Supreme Court to ignore important freedoms. She also worries that he would fill his cabinet with loyalists who do not care about the well-being of everyone in the country and that he would defund agencies that regulate important functions of society.\n\nBut Wagner, the New York Republican, dismissed those concerns, pointing to Trump's time in the White House.\n\n\"When he was in the White House, we had peace, prosperity, energy independence,\" he said. \"What's undemocratic about that?\"\n\nHe said he did not believe Trump's intentions leading up to and on January 6 were criminal.\n\n\"I think he just did the wrong thing,\" Wagner said.\n\nSome independents are also thinking carefully about what the upcoming elections will mean for the country's democratic future.\n\n\"I believe this is the most important election of my lifetime,\" said Patricia Seliga-Williams, 53, of LaVale, Maryland, an independent who is leaning toward voting for Harris.\n\nSeliga-Williams said she barely gets by on $15 an hour as a hotel breakfast server and remembers Trump handling the economy and immigration well. But she didn't like it when he recently joked that he plans to a \"dictator\" on day one in the office.\n\n\"We all know Donald Trump can run the country,\" she said. \"But he's just too aggressive anymore, and I don't think I can trust that as a voter.\"\n\nNot everyone agrees that this year's presidential election will be a turning point for the country's democracy, and the reasons given vary widely, according to the AP-NORC poll. About 2 in 10 Americans say democracy in the U.S. is strong enough to withstand the election's outcome regardless of who wins, while another 2 in 10 believe democracy is so badly broken that the outcome won't matter.\n\nThe poll also shows that commitment of democracy in the election are felt more by older adults than by younger ones. About half of adults 45 and older say the election outcome is extremely important for the future of democracy, compared with about 4 in 10 adults under 45.\n\n\"The claim that the other candidate is trying to destroy democracy doesn't really move me,\" said Daniel Oliver, 26, an independent from the Detroit suburbs. \"I think we have things in place that protect against when you try to destroy democracy. We have other branches of government. We have people who believe in voting. So it would be hard for a candidate to take over and become some kind of dictator.\"\n\nHe said he will look for candidates who can talk about issues that interest him more, such as reducing inflation and investing in clean energy sources.\n\nBiden And Trump months of fighting over whose second term would be worse for democracy. The president nodded to the implications when he ended his campaign last month, saying in his Oval Office speech that \"defending democracy is more important than any title.\"\n\nHarris has focused more on the concept of \"freedom\" in the early days of her campaign. She has said that Trump's re-election could lead to Americans freedom to votethe freedom to be safe from gun violence and the freedom for women to make decisions about their own bodies. Her debut campaign ad last month was set to Beyonc\u00e9's 2016 song \"Freedom,\" and it has since become a campaign anthem for her at rallies.\n\nHarris didn't mention democracy in her first two presidential campaign rallies, but she returned to it last week in her speech to members of the Sigma Gamma Rho sorority in Houston. \"Our fundamental freedoms are on the ballot, and so is our democracy,\" she said.\n\n___\n\nThe poll of 1,143 adults was conducted July 25-29, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

About 2 in 10 Americans say democracy in the U.S. is strong enough to withstand the outcome of the election no matter who wins, while another 2 in 10 believe democracy is already so seriously broken that the outcome doesn't matter.\n\nThe poll also shows the stakes of democracy in the election are felt more by older adults rather than younger ones.

We have other branches of government. We have people that believe in voting. So, it would be hard for a candidate to take over and become some kind of dictator.\"\n\nHe said he'll be looking for candidates to talk about issues he's more interested in, such as reducing inflation and investing in clean energy sources.\n\nBiden and Trump spent months sparring over whose second term would be worse for democracy. The president nodded to the consequences when he ended his campaign last month, saying in his Oval Office address that \"the defense of democracy is more important than any title.\"\n\nHarris has focused more on the concept of \"freedom\" in the early days of her campaign. She has said Trump's reelection could result in Americans losing the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence and the freedom for women to make decisions about their own bodies. Her debut campaign ad last month was set to Beyonc\u00e9's 2016 track \"Freedom,\" and it has become a campaign anthem for her at rallies ever since.\n\nHarris didn't mention democracy in her first two presidential campaign rallies, but she returned to the topic in remarks to Sigma Gamma Rho sorority members in Houston last week, saying \"our fundamental freedoms are on the ballot, and so is our democracy.\"\n\n___\n\nThe poll of 1,143 adults was conducted July 25-29, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press\u202freceives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke)\n\nThe poll findings suggest that many Democrats continue to view Trump as a threat to democracy after he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election, embraced the rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and threatened to seek retribution against his opponents if he wins reelection.\n\nBut they also indicate that many of Trump\u00b4s supporters agree with him that Biden is the real threat to democracy. Trump and his allies have accused Biden of weaponizing the Justice Department as it has pursued charges against the former president over his effort to halt certification of the 2020 election and keeping classified documents, though there is no evidence Biden has had any involvement or influence in the cases.\n\nTrump has framed himself as a defender of American values and portrayed Biden as a \"destroyer\" of democracy. He said multiple times after he survived an assassination attempt last month that he \"took a bullet for democracy.\"\n\nThe poll, conducted in the days after Biden dropped out of the race and Harris announced her campaign, is an early glimpse of Americans' views of a reshaped contest.\n\nMajorities of both Democrats and Republicans say democracy could be at risk in this election depending on who wins the presidency, responses generally in line with the findings when the question was last asked in an AP-NORC poll in December 2023.\n\nHanson, the Wisconsin Democrat, said she worries Trump in a second term would use the conservative-dominated U.S. Supreme Court to overrule important freedoms. She also is concerned that he would fill his Cabinet with loyalists who don\u00b4t care about the well-being of everyone in the country and defund agencies that regulate key functions of society.\n\nBut Wagner, the New York Republican, brushed off those concerns and pointed to Trump\u00b4s time in office.\n\n\"When he was in the White House, we had peace, we had prosperity, we had energy independence,\" he said. \"What\u00b4s undemocratic about that?\"\n\nHe said he didn't think Trump's intentions leading up to and on Jan. 6 were criminal.\n\n\"I just think he was misguided,\" Wagner said.\n\nSome independents also are carefully considering the stakes of the upcoming election on the country\u00b4s democratic future.\n\n\"I believe that this is the most important election of my lifetime,\" said 53-year-old Patricia Seliga-Williams of LaVale, Maryland, an independent who is leaning toward voting for Harris.\n\nSeliga-Williams said she\u00b4s barely scraping by on $15 an hour as a hotel breakfast attendant and remembers Trump handling the economy and immigration well. But she didn\u00b4t like it when he recently quipped that he plans to be a \"dictator\" on day one in office.\n\n\"We all know Donald Trump could run the country,\" she said. \"But he\u00b4s just too aggressive anymore, and I don\u00b4t think I can trust that as a voter.\"\n\nNot everyone agrees that this year's presidential election will be an inflection point for the country's democracy, offering starkly different reasons, according to the AP-NORC poll. About 2 in 10 Americans say democracy in the U.S. is strong enough to withstand the outcome of the election no matter who wins, while another 2 in 10 believe democracy is already so seriously broken that the outcome doesn\u00b4t matter.\n\nThe poll also shows the stakes of democracy in the election are felt more by older adults rather than younger ones. About half of adults 45 and older say the outcome of the election is extremely important for the future of democracy, compared to about 4 in 10 adults under 45.\n\n\"Making the claim that the other candidate is trying to destroy democracy, it doesn\u00b4t really land for me,\" said Daniel Oliver, 26, an independent from suburban Detroit. \"I think that we have things in place that should safeguard against when you kind of play at destroying democracy. We have other branches of government. We have people that believe in voting. So, it would be hard for a candidate to take over and become some kind of dictator.\"\n\nHe said he\u00b4ll be looking for candidates to talk about issues he\u00b4s more interested in, such as reducing inflation and investing in clean energy sources.\n\nBiden and Trump spent months sparring over whose second term would be worse for democracy. The president nodded to the consequences when he ended his campaign last month, saying in his Oval Office address that \"the defense of democracy is more important than any title.\"\n\nHarris has focused more on the concept of \"freedom\" in the early days of her campaign. She has said Trump\u00b4s reelection could result in Americans losing the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence and the freedom for women to make decisions about their own bodies. Her debut campaign ad last month was set to Beyonc\u00e9\u00b4s 2016 track \"Freedom,\" and it has become a campaign anthem for her at rallies ever since.\n\nHarris didn't mention democracy in her first two presidential campaign rallies, but she returned to the topic in remarks to Sigma Gamma Rho sorority members in Houston last week, saying \"our fundamental freedoms are on the ballot, and so is our democracy.\"\n\nThe poll of 1,143 adults was conducted July 25-29, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC\u00b4s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.\n\nThe Associated Pressreceives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

Biden also endorsed Harris the day he withdrew from the race, and she is now the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee to challenge Trump, the GOP presidential nominee, in November.\n\nA major talking point in this election cycle has been protecting democracy. Since losing the 2020 election, Trump has continued to question the legitimacy of the results, leading many Democrats to claim the former president is a threat to democracy. Trump, meanwhile, has hurled those claims back at the Democrats and said multiple times after he survived an assassination attempt last month that he \"took a bullet for democracy.\"\n\nA poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research from July 25 to 29 found that 45 percent of U.S. adults across party lines said the future of democracy in the U.S. is \"extremely important\" and 29 percent said it is \"very important.\"\n\nOverall, 59 percent of poll respondents said that democracy could be at risk depending on who wins the 2024 election. Meanwhile, 21 percent said democracy is strong enough to withstand any outcome of the upcoming election, and 18 percent said democracy is already so seriously broken that it doesn't matter who wins.\n\nThe poll surveyed 1,143 adults nationwide and has an overall margin of error of plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.\n\nWhile a majority of Democrats and Republicans in the poll believe democracy could be at risk (67 and 58 percent, respectively), and 42 percent of independents believe so as well, which nominee poses a greater threat differs depending on Americans' political leanings.\n\nPamela Hanson, a 67-year-old Democrat from Amery, Wisconsin, told the AP of Trump: \"His statements tend towards him being a king or a dictator, a person in charge by himself,\" adding that the former president is \"unhinged.\"\n\nDuring a town hall event hosted by Fox News host Sean Hannity in December 2023, Hannity pressed Trump to pledge that he would never \"abuse power as retribution against anybody,\" as had been suggested previously, if he's reelected. In response, Trump suggested that he would only behave in such a way on the first day of his hypothetical second term.\n\n\"Except for day one,\" the former president said. \"No, no, no, other than day one. We're closing the border and we're drilling, drilling, drilling. After that, I'm not a dictator.\"\n\nHis drilling comment was a reference to his vow to expand oil drilling in the United States. He later said that the comments were made in a \"joking manner.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ernie Wagner, an 85-year-old Republican from Liberty, New York, accused the Biden administration of abusing the power of the executive branch.\n\n\"Biden has tried to erase the student loans, and he's been told by the courts that it's unconstitutional to do that,\" Wagner told the AP. \"He's weaponized the FBI to get at his political opponents.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education (DOE) announced in late July that the Biden administration had approved $168 billion in student loan forgiveness for 4.8 million Americans over a period of time after the Supreme Court struck down Biden's original plan in June 2023 to forgive about $430 billion of federal student loan debt.\n\nThere is no evidence to support that Biden had anything to do with Trump's four criminal indictments -- two of which deal with election fraud; one involving classified documents, which was dismissed; and one involving a hush money payment to an adult film actress. In late May, Trump was found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records related to that hush money payment. He maintains his innocence in the case and all the other cases, claiming they are politically motivated. The former president has moved to dismiss the hush money case.\n\nMeanwhile, Patricia Seliga-Williams, a 53-year-old independent from LaVale, Maryland, told the AP: \"We all know Donald Trump could run the country,\" however, she said he's \"just too aggressive anymore, and I don't think I can trust that as a voter.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"},

It essentially posits that if \"A\" happens bad thing \"B\" will follow, when \"A\" has already happened and \"B\" didn't.\n\nMore simply, we've been there and done that--Trump's four years in the White House were chaotic, embarrassing, cringe-inducing on an almost daily basis, with a perhaps a historically unequalled degree of incompetence. But however ugly and stupid those times were, at no point do I recall fearing that our democratic institutions were under serious threat, that what Charles Krauthammer called the \"guardrails\" of our constitutional order would fail to hold.\n\nDespite all the lies and reckless rhetoric, Trump, unlike the other side, made no effort to put his opponents in prison or have them taken off electoral ballots or to censor critical media.\n\nBut these tactics have now been deemed acceptable by our would-be saviors of democracy. Because so much is supposedly at stake, and desperation grows.\n\nWithin this context, one could be forgiven for believing that Alvin Bragg's prosecution of Trump in New York will eventually come to be viewed as undermining democracy to a greater extent than Jan. 6, 2021, or anything else Trump was implicated in, in terms of setting a precedent for the use of the criminal justice system against political opponents that makes a mockery of the rule of law without which democracy cannot survive.\n\nAlso lost in all the apocalyptic rhetoric is any consideration of what happens if the worst happens, and Trump actually wins a free, fair election in November and returns to the White House; more precisely, how Democrats explain how the people, fully warned beforehand, decided that democracy was threatened more by them than by Trump.\n\nAfter all, at the heart of Democratic demagoguery regarding saving democracy is the inescapable assumption that they are saving it not so much from Trump, who is merely a symptom, but from the roughly half of the electorate who apparently intend to vote for him.\n\nThe idea that the voters in a democracy are enemies of democracy if they choose to vote for the other side is about as pernicious a slander of both the voters and democracy as one could conceive, but that is the message that Democrats keep sending out.\n\nIn listening to the left talk about how Trump is a fascist and even a would-be Hitler, it is difficult to not think of perhaps history's greatest moral hypothetical: What if you had the opportunity to somehow go back in time, to Weimar Germany in 1933, and knowing what we now know, eliminate through whatever means the real item?\n\nIs there any possible moral calculus, World War II and the Holocaust sure to follow otherwise, that would lead to the answer \"no\"?\n\nBut isn't this the very same question, by how they have depicted Trump and framed the election, that Democrats are now asking of the electorate?\n\nThe real threat to democracy is any political party that claims democracy is on the ballot in a democratic election.\n\nAmerican democracy is sturdy enough to withstand Trump; nay, already has. I'm not sure it's sturdy enough to survive what the Democrats are doing to stop him.\n\nFreelance columnist Bradley R.

Please try again later.\n\nWhat does Kamala Harris believe? It's hard to be sure. The vice president has been shedding her prior liberal policy commitments left and right and hasn't yet replaced them with anything coherent. As her campaign approaches the three-week mark, though, we can glean some insight into what she thinks a Democratic presidential nominee should care about. To do this, we analyzed the words and phrases that Harris has most often used in her campaign -- from stump speeches to campaign emails -- and compared them with President Joe Biden's language before he left the race.\n\nThe clearest message from the Harris camp so far: Biden was doing it wrong. The vice president is quietly but firmly replacing her boss' approach with an untested one that radically updates the way Democrats compete against former president Donald Trump.\n\nThe largest -- and smartest -- shift has to do with the subject of democracy, which was one of Biden's favorite issues. This past spring, one of his closest advisers said that the Capitol riot of Jan. 6, 2021, and Trump's threat to the republic would be the \"overwhelming\" focus of his reelection campaign. Biden's first few ads posted on YouTube mentioned democracy seven times, with multiple allusions to Jan. 6. Harris's ads on the platform have been silent on the issue, referencing neither democracy nor the storming of the Capitol. Her speeches have mentioned democracy four times. Biden brought it up 17 times in campaign speeches given before he dropped out; she hasn't spoken of Jan. 6 at all.\n\nThis is a good move on her part. As dangerous as Trump might be, he is not a mortal threat. There are few, if any, plausible scenarios in which he could transform the United States into an autocracy. If Trump wins a second term, American democracy might suffer, but it will not die. U.S. institutions are strong, resilient and capable of withstanding considerable pressure. Alarmism might rally the base, but it risks desensitizing voters, who have been hearing that democracy is under threat since 2016.\n\nFollow Shadi Hamid\n\nFollow\n\nThat said, Trump still poses a far greater danger to the republic than Harris does. A Trump presidency would likely exacerbate polarization, weaken checks and balances, and foment instability. These dangers are exactly why his opponents should campaign strategically. Losing the language of democracy aligns with this goal. Undecided voters rank democracy protection low on their list of priorities. Ironically, swing voters also trust Trump more on democracy than they trusted Biden, so playing up the issue probably only hurts Democrats.\n\nHarris's strategy is different. First of all, she laughs on the campaign trail more than four times as often as Biden did, as measured by C-SPAN transcripts. Talking about serious issues doesn't require constant seriousness. Nor does it require overstating threats from the other side.\n\nShe has spoken more about abortion and border security, mentioning these issues more than twice as frequently as Biden did. This, too, is smart politics. The Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade has been an electoral boon for Democrats, and Harris has been the administration's unofficial messenger on abortion. The vice president's immigration focus is the boldest choice, because voters trust Republicans far more on the issue. But Harris is right to try to neutralize one of her -- and her party's -- biggest weaknesses.\n\nHarris's campaign emails also emphasize the border and de-emphasize democracy. They mention Republicans being \"weird\" twice as much as they do the events of Jan. 6.\n\nBut the main distinction between the Biden and Harris campaigns lies in two F's: freedom and the future. Harris utters these words more than four times as often as Biden did. She is positioning herself simultaneously as the incumbent defending hard-won freedoms and the anti-incumbent promising to usher in a different future.\n\nBoth future and freedom are Rorschach terms onto which voters who are unsure about Harris can project their own hopes. The future is attractive precisely because it is undefined and unburdened by what has been. Same with Harris's open-ended notion of freedom, which she has defined as the ability \"not just to get by, but to get ahead.\" Who could disagree with that?\n\nHarris's choice of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to join the ticket is fitting for a campaign in which vibes and vague pronouncements rule the day. Notwithstanding his progressive policy record, Walz rose to national prominence thanks to a viral clip of him calling Republicans \"weird.\"\n\nIn less than a month, Harris has upended the prevailing Democratic dogma, which assumed that the importance of an issue -- as judged by party elites -- should dictate its share of campaign airtime. But voters can't be cudgeled into caring, and the Democratic Party is finally meeting the voters where they are. This means talking less about climate, more about the border. Less about democracy, more about reproductive rights.\n\nThis change is healthy for national discourse. No longer draped in apocalyptic overtones, the new Democratic campaign seems closer to normal. Taking democracy off the ballot has a calming effect on the political mood. Harris strengthens democracy by avoiding the subject -- and instead going for joy and optimism.

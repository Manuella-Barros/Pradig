For us the mission doesn't change. We want to go out and win a game. We want to win this cup, it's no secret. It should be a fun one to have a pre-game meal at 7:30 a.m.\"\n\nAsked what he would be eating at this time, he replied: \"Good question. I don't know if I can do pasta that early. So probably some other carbs: toast, whatever, fruit, yogurt. We'll see.\"\n\nMontreal coach Laurent Courtois played down the unusual kickoff time.\n\n\"It's early for both teams,\" he said.\n\n\"We're going to talk about everything (Monday night). (Tuesday) we're going to have breakfast, two reminders and then go play a soccer game. No excuse,\" he added,\n\nThe early kickoff time won't phase Forge coach Bobby Smyrniotis.\n\n\"It doesn't change a lot for my plans,\" he said. \"I'm normally in here by 6:30, 7 o'clock in the morning each and every day ... The difference is you're not preparing for training, you're preparing for this match.\"\n\nThe quarterfinal second legs are scheduled for May 21 at Toronto and Vancouver, May 22 at Montreal and May 29 at Pacific.\n\nTuesday's Forge game was originally slated to be a league outing against Halifax Wanderers FC, the 500 match in CPL history. But the cup took over the calendar slot.\n\nThe CPL will now mark the milestone 500th game Friday when York United FC hosts Valour FC.\n\nMore than 10,000 students from 100-plus schools are expected Tuesday at Tim Hortons Field. Forge has booked some 2,300 school buses to get the young fans to the stadium, with some schools taking care of their own transport.\n\nForge averaged 5,484 per home game last season. The club record of 17,611 was set in the league's first-ever match, on April 27, 2019.\n\nVancouver and 2023 runner-up Montreal had byes in the first round of the 14-team cup tournament while Cavalry and Forge eliminated fellow CPL opposition in Vancouver FC and York United FC, respectively.\n\nThe Canadian Championship winner hosts the Voyageurs Cup and qualifies for the CONCACAF Champion's Cup, the confederation's elite men's club competition\n\nIt marks the fourth year in a row that Forge and Montreal have clashed in Cup play with the MLS side winning all three meetings: 8-7 in a penalty shootout in the 2021 semifinal, 3-0 in the '22 quarterfinal and 2-0 in the '23 semifinal.\n\nThe game is also a matchup of brothers with David Choiniere playing for Forge and younger brother Mathieu Choiniere wearing Montreal colours.\n\nThe Forge-Montreal winner will face either TFC or CS Saint-Laurent in the semifinal.\n\nForge last played April 27, defeating visiting Valour FC 21 to improve to 3-0-0 in CPL play. Montreal (3-4-3, having played eight of the 10 games away from home) lost 4-1 at Nashville SC on Saturday.\n\nThe Calgary-based side defeated Vancouver 2-1 on aggregate in the third qualifying round of the 2019 cup competition, before falling to eventual champion Montreal (3-1 on aggregate) in the semifinal.\n\nThe Whitecaps avenged that loss by dispatching Cavalry 5-3 in a penalty shootout in the 2022 quarterfinals. Cavalry was at the wrong end of another penalty shootout in the 2023 preliminary round, losing 5-3 to Pacific FC.\n\nVancouver, which stands fourth in the MLS Western Conference at 5-3-2, has lost just one of its last six games (3-1-2) and is coming off a scoreless draw with visiting Austin FC in its 50th anniversary match.\n\nCavalry, fifth in the CPL standing at 1-1-2, is unbeaten in three games (1-0-2) since dropping the season opener 2-1 at Forge.\n\n\"We're in a good place,\" said Cavalry coach and GM Tommy Wheeldon Jr. \"What we've got to do now is rise to the challenge of playing an established club like the Whitecaps who are in a good run of form themselves.\"\n\nVancouver is looking to win the cup for a third straight year.\n\n\"That would be a huge statement to everyone in the country that we are kind of the leading team,\" said Whitecaps coach Vanni Sartini.\n\nVancouver is missing the injured Sam Adekugbe, who grew up in Calgary, and Damir Kreilach.\n\nCavalry will be without midfielder Shamit Shome, suspended after being sent off in the cup win over Vancouver FC. While Jesse Daly and Eryk Kobza are back training, Tom Field and Ali Muse are doubtful, according to Wheeldon.\n\n---\n\nFollow @NeilMDavidson on X platform, formerly known as Twitter\n\nThis report

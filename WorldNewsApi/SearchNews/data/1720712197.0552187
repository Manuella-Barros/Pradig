{"id": 231961620, "title": "A minister from Thrissur, Modi ki guarantee fulfilled", "text": "\"A Union minister from Thrissur is Modi's guarantee,\" said BJP candidate Suresh Gopi said during the election campaign for the 2024 Lok Sabha election. 'Modi ki guarantee' has worked for Suresh Gopi. The MP-elect from Thrissur is set to take oath as a minister in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ministry.Suresh Gopi created history by winning the BJP its maiden seat in Kerala, which has been a Left bastion. One has to remember that it was Kerala that gave India its first Left government in 1957.His electoral success is a lesson for the Kerala BJP, which has been struggling against the CPM-led LDF and the Congress-led UDF in the state.Who gets which ministry in Modi 3.0? Form your 'Dream Cabinet' and win prizes.link__elec{padding:0 0 12px} .link__elec div{margin-bottom:7px;}.link__elec a{color: var(--linkcolor); text-decoration: underline;font-size:18px; line-height:24px; font-weight:600;} Suresh Gopi defeated the CPI\u2019s VS Sunil Kumar by a decent margin of 74,000 votes in a three-cornered fight. The Congress fielded K Muraleedharan from the Thrissur Lok Sabha seat. Gopi contested the 2019 Lok Sabha election from Thrissur on a BJP ticket but came third.The actor-politician was made a Rajya Sabha member by the BJP and used his MP funds for social outreach, which seems to have worked for him in the 2024 general election.He has reached out to the Christian community and won the trust of voters by grassroots protest against the CPM's alleged cooperative bank funds scam. That Suresh Gopi is a survivor is known from his celluloid career. Known for his acting skills and dialogue delivery, the Malayalam star has survived several troughs in his career as an actor.Being in the BJP is kind of a 180-degree turn for Suresh Gopi, who was influenced by Communist ideas in his college days and was a member of the Students Federation of India (SFI), the students' wing of the CPM.Gopi then became close to Kerala chief minister K Karunakaran of the Congress and his family. This is where the story circles back to Thrissur and Muralidheeran, Karunakaran's son and Congress candidate who came third in the 2024 Lok Sabha election.Ahead of the election, Karunakaran\u2019s daughter Padmaja Venugopal left the Congress for the BJP and worked with Suresh Gopi to defeat her brother Muraleedharan.\"Never in the history of Thrissur has an MP from Thrissur become a Union minister, Modi\u2019s guarantee will fulfil that,\" Suresh Gopi said in an interview in April.With Gopi's inclusion in Modi 3.0 ministry, the BJP wants to show its seriousness about its plans for Kerala, which will be going to the polls in 2026.So, here is Suresh Gopi now, having created history as the first BJP MP from Kerala and in the Union council of ministers.

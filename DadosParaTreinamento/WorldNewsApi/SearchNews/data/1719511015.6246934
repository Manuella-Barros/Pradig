Storms also caused damage in Oklahoma, where guests at an outdoor wedding were injured. Tens of thousands of residents were without power across the region. \u201cIt\u2019s just a trail of debris left. The devastation is pretty severe,\u201d Cooke County Sheriff Ray Sappington told The Associated Press. Officials said multiple people were transported to hospitals by ambulance and helicopter in the Texas county of Denton, but they did not immediately know the full extent of the injuries. Sappington said the dead in Texas included three family members who were found in one home near the small community of Valley View. At least one person was killed in Arkansas in Benton County, according to Melody Kwok, a county communications director. She said multiple other people were injured and that emergency workers were still responding to calls. \u201cWe are still on search and rescue right now,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a very active situation.\u201d The destruction continued a grim month of deadly severe weather in the nation\u2019s midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa this week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. The deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. In Texas, a tornado crossed into Denton County, north of Dallas, overturning tractor-trailers and halting traffic on Interstate 35, county spokesperson Dawn Cobb said. A shelter was opened in the rural town of Sanger. Sappington said at least 60 to 80 people were inside a highway truck stop, some of them seeking shelter, when the storm barreled through, but there were no serious injuries. Daybreak began to reveal the full scope of the devastation. Aerial footage showed dozens of damaged homes, including many without roofs and others reduced to rubble. Residents woke up to overturned cars and collapsed garages. Some residents could be seen pacing around and sorting through scraps of wood, assessing the damage. Nearby, neighbors sat on the foundation of a wrecked home. At the height of the storms, more than 24,000 homes and businesses lost power in Oklahoma, according to the state Office of Emergency Management. The agency also reported extensive damage from baseball-sized hail and multiple injuries at an outdoor wedding that was being held in rural Woods County. Meteorologists and authorities issued urgent warnings to seek cover as the storms marched across the region overnight. \u201cIf you are in the path of this storm take cover now!\u201d the National Weather Service office in Norman posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. In Texas, the Denton Fire Department posted on social media that emergency crews near Dallas were responding to a marina \u201cfor multiple victims, some reported trapped.\u201d Inaccessible roads and downed power lines in Oklahoma also led officials in the town of Claremore, near Tulsa, to announce on social media that the city was \u201cshut down\u201d due to the damage. April and May have been a busy month for tornadoes, especially in the Midwest. Iowa was hit hard last week, when a deadly twister devastated Greenfield. Other storms brought flooding and wind damage elsewhere in the state. The system causing the latest severe weather was expected to move east over the rest of the Memorial Day weekend, bringing rain that could delay the Indianapolis 500 auto race Sunday in Indiana and more severe storms in Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and Kentucky. The risk of severe weather moves into North Carolina and Virginia on Monday, forecasters said. ___ Tareen reported from Chicago, and McCormack reported from Concord, N.H.", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3Rvcm5hZG9lcy13ZWF0aGVyLXRleGFzLW9rbGFob21hLTkzMDAxZTFkODFmMTIwZDBkNTVjOGRmYTI0OTM4MjUw0gEA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">At least 7 dead in Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas after severe weather roars across region</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">The Associated Press</font>", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/tornadoes-weather-texas-oklahoma-93001e1d81f120d0d55c8dfa24938250", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/ddfd774/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1688+0+255/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F77%2Fa0%2F6696b97d0876eed255c86b4ee4a7%2Fbd89d1f3ae694c4181a88e8a1dcbbade", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:21:00", "author": "Acacia Coronado,Kathy Mccormack,Sophia Tareen", "authors": ["Acacia Coronado", "Kathy Mccormack", "Sophia Tareen"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.293}

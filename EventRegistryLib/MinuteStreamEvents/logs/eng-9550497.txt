Ron DeSantis personally directed the Florida Highway Patrol's response to the recent pro-Palestinian campus protests in Florida, a top state official said Wednesday.\n\n\"On countless occasions, campus and local law enforcement has requested the assistance of Florida Highway Patrol. And on countless other occasions, we have proactively assisted campus and local law enforcement,\" said Dave Kerner, executive director of the Florida Department of Safety and Motor Vehicles, which oversees the highway patrol.\n\n\"In all instances,\" Kerner said, \"these actions were taken at the direction of Gov. DeSantis.\"\n\nHis comments came during a DeSantis news conference at the University of Florida campus, near a spot on the campus green where round-the-clock protests have been taking place for 15 days. As DeSantis, Kerner and other officials spoke in praise of Florida's response to the demonstrations, protesters could be heard chanting.\n\nDeSantis' office and Kerner's agency did not respond last week to questions about the governor's involvement in the protest response. Kerner on Wednesday acknowledged the questions, saying his department was asked if the governor was \"personally\" involved.\n\n\"The answer is yes,\" he said.\n\nThe governor's office did not immediately respond when asked to elaborate on Kerner's remarks. It was unclear how many universities his directives impacted, or how engaged he was in the details of law enforcement tactics.\n\nAt least 37 protesters were arrested in demonstrations last week at UF, the University of South Florida, Florida State University and the University of North Florida. The law enforcement response at USF included the use of tear gas.\n\n\"As we have seen very clearly, there is a stark difference between Florida and many other states in this nation,\" Kerner said. \"This is very intentional. Our governor will not bend to the shrill and illogical will of an entitled and reckless super-minority. He will not tolerate for a moment our campuses degenerating into collectives of violence and anti-American and antisemitic dogma, and neither will the Florida Highway Patrol.\"\n\nDeSantis thanked state universities and law enforcement agencies for their responses last week, and held them in contrast to \"elite colleges and universities that have allowed themselves to be overrun with encampments, graffiti as well as a lot of really nasty antisemitism.\"\n\nHe pointed to his efforts last year in allowing Jewish students seeking refuge to transfer to Florida universities and investments in security for Jewish Day schools in Florida.\n\nDeSantis said he thought many protesters were joining a \"chic cause\" without understanding history and \"spouting nonsense.\"\n\n\"It's very concerning, some of these elite institutions around the country: Are they just graduating a bunch of imbeciles?\" he said. \"I think unfortunately that's the case. That's why a lot of these people are not going to have job offers. You see even a lot of the big financial institutions, which are very liberal, are now saying we're not going to be entertaining this nonsense anymore.\"\n\nDeSantis also linked the protest groups to Hamas and called attention to a chant frequently repeated at protests across the state and country -- \"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.\"\n\n\"Part of it is people can say what they want, but when you're talking about 'from the river to the sea,' you're essentially saying you want a second Holocaust, that you want to wipe Israel off the map,\" DeSantis said. \"That's what Hamas stands for.\"\n\nLaila Fakhoury, a UF alumni and part of the UF Divest Coalition, was one of the protesters out Wednesday. She said barricades were set so far away from DeSantis that protesters were not able to hear what he said, but later found out and called it \"nonsense.\"\n\n\"Saying things like that is just like a very classic tactic of trying to conflate the idea of antisemitism with criticizing government, criticizing a military, which is not antisemitic at all,\" Fakhoury said. \"It's more than just pro-Palestine or pro-Israel. It's pro-human at the end of the day, and all of us are standing for humanity. So when we say chants like that, 'from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,' it's literally exactly what it sounds like: that Palestine will be free within our lifetime, and we'll continue to keep standing up to advocate for that.\"\n\nDeSantis also questioned why protesters weren't out after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack that launched Israel's military response.\n\n\"I'm sure the protesters were all very upset at the fact that Hamas went into Israeli communities and baked babies in ovens, raped women, assassinated elderly people in very brutal ways,\" he said. \"I'm sure they were very upset about that. Oh wait, no, they weren't. That's right. They didn't care about that. They were completely fine with those massacres happening. And they had no concern about that.\"\n\nHe added his views on Gaza, saying the territory was not occupied and that it was a Hamas \"sanctuary\" that focused on terrorism instead of more productive pursuits.\n\nFakhoury said many of the protesters are Jewish and felt the governor ignored parts of history.\n\nAlso speaking at the news conference was Ray Rodrigues, chancellor of the State University System, who said Florida would continue to take a \"law and order\" approach to the protests.\n\nHe said some universities have made \"shameful\" concessions to protesters, including creating new faculty positions for Palestinians, establishing a cultural center for Middle Eastern studies and waiving charges for those arrested in the protests.\n\n\"In Florida, there will be no negotiations,\" Rodrigues said. \"There will be no appeasement, there will be no amnesty and there will be no divestment under Gov. DeSantis.\"\n\nFakhoury, with the protest group, said the demonstrators would not be deterred. The goals of the protests, she said, go beyond how universities respond.\n\n\"It's not the only thing that matters to us,\" she said. \" We're making a statement and a presence just by being out there with our flags and our keffiyehs and showing people that we are not going to be silenced by these lies and the rhetoric that they've been pushing.\"", "source": {"uri": "americanmilitarynews.com",

Ron DeSantis personally directed the Florida Highway Patrol's response to the recent pro-Palestinian campus protests in Florida, a top state official said Wednesday.\n\n\"On countless occasions, campus and local law enforcement has requested the assistance of Florida Highway Patrol. And on countless other occasions, we have proactively assisted campus and local law enforcement,\" said Dave Kerner, executive director of the Florida Department of Safety and Motor Vehicles, which oversees the highway patrol.\n\n\"In all instances,\" Kerner said, \"these actions were taken at the direction of Gov. DeSantis.\"\n\nHis comments came during a DeSantis news conference at the University of Florida campus, near a spot on the campus green where round-the-clock protests have been taking place for 15 days. As DeSantis, Kerner and other officials spoke in praise of Florida's response to the demonstrations, protesters could be heard chanting.\n\nDeSantis' office and Kerner's agency did not respond last week to questions about the governor's involvement in the protest response. Kerner on Wednesday acknowledged the questions, saying his department was asked if the governor was \"personally\" involved.\n\n\"The answer is yes,\" he said.\n\nThe governor's office did not immediately respond when asked to elaborate on Kerner's remarks. It was unclear how many universities his directives impacted, or how engaged he was in the details of law enforcement tactics.\n\nAt least 37 protesters were arrested in demonstrations last week at UF, the University of South Florida, Florida State University and the University of North Florida. The law enforcement response at USF included the use of tear gas.\n\n\"As we have seen very clearly, there is a stark difference between Florida and many other states in this nation,\" Kerner said. \"This is very intentional. Our governor will not bend to the shrill and illogical will of an entitled and reckless super-minority. He will not tolerate for a moment our campuses degenerating into collectives of violence and anti-American and antisemitic dogma, and neither will the Florida Highway Patrol.\"\n\nDeSantis thanked state universities and law enforcement agencies for their responses last week, and held them in contrast to \"elite colleges and universities that have allowed themselves to be overrun with encampments, graffiti as well as a lot of really nasty antisemitism.\"\n\nHe pointed to his efforts last year in allowing Jewish students seeking refuge to transfer to Florida universities and investments in security for Jewish Day schools in Florida.\n\nDeSantis said he thought many protesters were joining a \"chic cause\" without understanding history and \"spouting nonsense.\"\n\n\"It's very concerning, some of these elite institutions around the country: Are they just graduating a bunch of imbeciles?\" he said. \"I think unfortunately that's the case. That's why a lot of these people are not going to have job offers. You see even a lot of the big financial institutions, which are very liberal, are now saying we're not going to be entertaining this nonsense anymore.\"\n\nDeSantis also linked the protest groups to Hamas and called attention to a chant frequently repeated at protests across the state and country -- \"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.\"\n\n\"Part of it is people can say what they want, but when you're talking about 'from the river to the sea,' you're essentially saying you want a second Holocaust, that you want to wipe Israel off the map,\" DeSantis said. \"That's what Hamas stands for.\"\n\nLaila Fakhoury, a UF alumni and part of the UF Divest Coalition, was one of the protesters out Wednesday. She said barricades were set so far away from DeSantis that protesters were not able to hear what he said, but later found out and called it \"nonsense.\"\n\n\"Saying things like that is just like a very classic tactic of trying to conflate the idea of antisemitism with criticizing government, criticizing a military, which is not antisemitic at all,\" Fakhoury said. \"It's more than just pro-Palestine or pro-Israel. It's pro-human at the end of the day, and all of us are standing for humanity. So when we say chants like that, 'from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,' it's literally exactly what it sounds like: that Palestine will be free within our lifetime, and we'll continue to keep standing up to advocate for that.\"\n\nDeSantis also questioned why protesters weren't out after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack that launched Israel's military response.\n\n\"I'm sure the protesters were all very upset at the fact that Hamas went into Israeli communities and baked babies in ovens, raped women, assassinated elderly people in very brutal ways,\" he said. \"I'm sure they were very upset about that. Oh wait, no, they weren't. That's right. They didn't care about that. They were completely fine with those massacres happening. And they had no concern about that.\"\n\nHe added his views on Gaza, saying the territory was not occupied and that it was a Hamas \"sanctuary\" that focused on terrorism instead of more productive pursuits.\n\nFakhoury said many of the protesters are Jewish and felt the governor ignored parts of history.\n\nAlso speaking at the news conference was Ray Rodrigues, chancellor of the State University System, who said Florida would continue to take a \"law and order\" approach to the protests.\n\nHe said some universities have made \"shameful\" concessions to protesters, including creating new faculty positions for Palestinians, establishing a cultural center for Middle Eastern studies and waiving charges for those arrested in the protests.\n\n\"In Florida, there will be no negotiations,\" Rodrigues said. \"There will be no appeasement, there will be no amnesty and there will be no divestment under Gov. DeSantis.\"\n\nFakhoury, with the protest group, said the demonstrators would not be deterred. The goals of the protests, she said, go beyond how universities respond.\n\n\"It's not the only thing that matters to us,\" she said. \"We're making a statement and a presence just by being out there with our flags and our keffiyehs and showing people that we are not going to be silenced by these lies and the rhetoric that they've been pushing.\"\n\nTimes Staff Writer Kirby Wilson contributed to

DeSantis touts response to campus 'nonsense'", "body": "ORLANDO, Fla. -- Protesters chanted \"Free Palestine\" and other slogans nonstop at the University of Florida on Wednesday as Gov. Ron DeSantis touted the efforts by Florida universities to prevent the \"nonsense\" happening on other campuses across the country.\n\nStanding on the Plaza of the Americas in front of the school's main library with UF President Ben Sasse and university Chancellor Ray Rodrigues, DeSantis never acknowledged the dozens of protesters as he criticized how Columbia, UCLA and other schools have dealt with the encampments, occupation of school buildings and disruption of graduation ceremonies.\n\n\"We don't do that here in the state of Florida. And so they did have an encampment here, and it lasted about a few minutes,\" DeSantis said.\n\n\"You don't have the right to commandeer property. You don't have the right to take over parts of the university. You don't have the right to attack students based on their ethnicity, and we're going to make sure that's upheld,\" DeSantis said. \"If they're not keeping order, we will find new people who will keep order.\"\n\nEven though protesters were banned from setting up tents on the UF campus, they have maintained a 24/7 presence by maintaining their spot in shifts, according to the Independent Alligator, the student-run newspaper.\n\nOn Wednesday, metal barriers and state troopers stood between the protesters and DeSantis. One sign read: \"UF: DIVEST FROM DEATH.\" Several people held bundled, bloody representations of dead babies.\n\nThe protests have been sparked by the war between Israel and Hamas terrorists that began when Hamas attacked Israel neighborhoods near Gaza on Oct. 7. During those attacks, 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and more than 240 people were taken hostage.\n\nDeSantis and others have characterized the protests as pro-Hamas instead of pro-Palestinian and antisemitic instead of in opposition to Israel's execution of the war. DeSantis claimed the campus protesters \"didn't care\" that Hamas terrorists raped women and killed Israeli men, women and children.\n\nProtesters have called on universities to divest from Israel, citing the reported deaths of more than 34,000 Palestinian men, women and children in Gaza from Israel's bombings and ground assault.\n\nPolice in Florida have people since protests began, including nine at UF on April 29. At the University of South Florida in Tampa, 10 were arrested on April 30 after authorities used tear gas to disperse a crowd. Authorities arrested five people at Florida State University that same day and 16 protesters at the University of North Florida on May 2.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType":

Ron DeSantis touted the efforts by Florida universities to prevent the \"nonsense\" happening on other campuses across the country.\n\nStanding on the Plaza of the Americas in front of the school's main library with UF President Ben Sasse and university Chancellor Ray Rodrigues, DeSantis never acknowledged the dozens of protesters as he criticized how Columbia, UCLA and other schools have dealt with the encampments, occupation of school buildings and disruption of graduation ceremonies.\n\n\"We don't do that here in the state of Florida. And so they did have an encampment here, and it lasted about a few minutes,\" DeSantis said.\n\n\"You don't have the right to commandeer property. You don't have the right to take over parts of the university. You don't have the right to attack students based on their ethnicity, and we're going to make sure that's upheld,\" DeSantis said. \"If they're not keeping order, we will find new people who will keep order.\"\n\nEven though protesters were banned from setting up tents on the UF campus, they have maintained a 24/7 presence by maintaining their spot in shifts, according to the Independent Alligator, the student-run newspaper.\n\nOn Wednesday, metal barriers and state troopers stood between the protesters and DeSantis. One sign read: \"UF: DIVEST FROM DEATH.\" Several people held bundled, bloody representations of dead babies.\n\nThe protests have been sparked by the war between Israel and Hamas terrorists that began when Hamas attacked Israel neighborhoods near Gaza on Oct. 7. During those attacks, 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and more than 240 people were taken hostage.\n\nDeSantis and others have characterized the protests as pro-Hamas instead of pro-Palestinian and antisemitic instead of in opposition to Israel's execution of the war. DeSantis claimed the campus protesters \"didn't care\" that Hamas terrorists raped women and killed Israeli men, women and children.\n\nProtesters have called on universities to divest from Israel, citing the reported deaths of more than 34,000 Palestinian men, women and children in Gaza from Israel's bombings and ground assault.\n\nPolice in Florida have people since protests began, including nine at UF on April 29. At the University of South Florida in Tampa, 10 were arrested on April 30 after authorities used tear gas to disperse a crowd. Authorities arrested five people at Florida State University that same day and 16 protesters at the University of North Florida on May 2.\n\nThe UF arrests came as protesters tried to set up camps last week. Local police and Florida Highway Patrol troopers quickly broke up the crowd, according to the Independent Florida Alligator.\n\nThey were arrested because they broke the rules laid out by the university for peaceful protest, officials said.\n\nUF President Ben Sasse said the university will \"always uphold speech and assembly rights\" as well as the law, as long as students don't cross the line.\n\n\"Our goal is not to arrest but to get in compliance with the law,\" Sasse said at DeSantis' event.\n\nHe said Jewish students will be protected, noting that UF has the highest concentration of Jewish students of any school in the U.S.\n\nThe cost to taxpayers of the governor's trip to UF with his security and other staff could not be determined because of a law passed in 2023 that keeps his travel records secret.\n\n-------\n\n(The Gainesville Sun and Independent Florida Alligator contributed to this report.)\n\n-------", "source": {"uri": "charlotteobserver.com", "dataType": "news",

It was unclear how many universities his directives impacted, or how engaged he was in the details of law enforcement tactics.\n\nAt least 37 protesters were arrested in demonstrations last week at UF, the University of South Florida, Florida State University and the University of North Florida.

Ron DeSantis likes to compare Florida to other states. And the handling of pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses is no different.\n\nDeSantis held a public appearance yesterday on the University of Florida's campus in Gainesville to boast about Florida's actions on the issue. He described campuses in other states as being \"overrun with encampments,\" of showing disrespect and of vandalizing buildings with graffiti.\n\n\"That is not happening here in the state of Florida,\" he said, as protest chants could be heard in the background on a video recording his comments. \"You are going to behave appropriately and if not you're going to be shown the door.\"\n\nPolice have arrested more than three dozen protesters in Florida, per the Tampa Bay Times, which also reported officers used tear gas at a demonstration at USF in Tampa. Left-leaning nonprofit organizations criticized Florida's \"unnecessary use of force\" and more than 2,100 protesters have been arrested nationwide, per the Associated Press. UF President Ben Sasse stressed during the event with DeSantis that he wanted to protect speech and assembly rights, but also ensure students were safe.\n\nProtesters want universities to divest from weapons manufacturers and other corporations they view as helping Israel. Some colleges have worked to accommodate students' demands -- but not in Florida. Ray Rodrigues, chancellor of the State University of Florida, said during yesterday's event that Florida wouldn't be negotiating with demonstrators.\n\nDeSantis' comments and actions in Florida are similar to those of other prominent Republicans, who argue that their party is more willing to impose \"law and order.\" Ever since the demonstrations broke out weeks ago, the Trump campaign and other Republicans have cast Joe Biden as a president unable to control the chaos around him.\n\nBiden last week spoke out against protests that had turned violent. But the GOP had already begun harnessing messaging on the issue because the White House initially dismissed the demonstrations as isolated incidents. Making matters more difficult politically for Biden is that the protests have divided the party, and outcry followed after Biden said last night that the U.S. would no longer supply weapons to Israel if it invades Rafah.\n\nDeSantis holding public events on the issue -- and broadcasting it over his social media channels -- helps him maintain a national megaphone and also indirectly helps Donald Trump, his former rival whom he recently promised to help with fundraising.\n\nIt furthermore gives DeSantis a way to keep hammering his accomplishments to supporters, such as the executive order he mentioned yesterday that allows Jewish students to transfer to Florida public universities more easily to escape antisemitism.\n\nFinally, it gives DeSantis an opening to preview state dollars heading to different causes. At various bill signings and public events in recent weeks, DeSantis has sprinkled in his intentions to authorize certain parts of the budget the Legislature sent him. Yesterday he said he would approve security funding for public schools and Jewish Day Schools, for historically Black colleges and universities, and for construction of a UF Jacksonville campus.\n\nHave a tip, story, suggestion, birthday, anniversary, new job, or any other nugget for Playbook?

He also announced several initiatives for school and student safety. His office shared this advisory with BocaNewsNow.com:\n\nToday, Governor Ron DeSantis touted Florida's success in maintaining order and ensuring student safety on Florida's campuses. In Florida, pro-Hamas encampments were disbanded in minutes, and Jewish students were kept safe from harassment. \"In Florida, we prioritize order and student safety on campus,\" said Governor Ron DeSantis. \"While other states allowed their college campuses to be vandalized and taken over by antisemitic agitators, Florida held the line.\"\n\n\"The Florida Highway Patrol is proud to protect citizens from the intentional and unlawful criminal actions and antisemitic behavior that threaten the safety of our college campuses and communities,\" said Executive Director of the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles Dave Kerner. \"Through the direction and support of Governor DeSantis, Floridians can rest assured that FHP will not tolerate antisemitic agitators and will not stand on the sidelines, but instead will take immediate action to ensure public safety from radicalized intimidation and violence.\"\n\n\"Over the last few weeks we witnessed a descent into chaos across the country,\" said Chancellor of the State University System of Florida Ray Rodrigues. \"Under the leadership of Governor DeSantis, we were able to maintain law and order by taking necessary security measures. Campus presidents had every resource at their disposal to protect all students and ensure that no student missed his or her 2024 commencement ceremony. Antisemitism will not be tolerated at our universities in the free state of Florida.\"\n\nGovernor DeSantis also directed colleges and universities in Florida to ensure commencement ceremonies are not canceled or disrupted. Additionally, Governor DeSantis further announced support for the following budgetary items to provide student safety funding:\n\n$569 million for K-12 school safety funding;\n\n$20 million to protect Jewish Day Schools; and\n\n$20 million to protect Florida's Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).\n\nGovernor DeSantis will approve this funding when he signs the Focus on Florida's Future budget for 2024-2025. Since 2019, Governor DeSantis has invested a total of $1.4 billion for all K-12 student safety initiatives for public school and Jewish Day School campuses. This includes nearly $196 million for school hardening and over $43 million for security guards and security infrastructure at Jewish Day Schools.\n\nAdditional Student Safety Measures\n\nThis week, Governor DeSantis signed HB 1473, which makes improvements to school safety across the state. In part, this bill: Requires classroom doors and gates to be locked at all times; Streamlines the process for former law enforcement officers to become school guardians; Mandates instruction to students on using the Fortify Florida tool, which is the state's anonymous tip reporting tool; and Prohibits the operation of a drone over a school campus or Jewish Day School.\n\nProtecting Jewish Students\n\nFollowing the terror attacks in Israel on October 7th, Governor DeSantis directed the State University System of Florida and the Florida College System to waive certain transfer application requirements for Jewish students at schools in other states who have a well-founded fear of antisemitic persecution at their current institution.\n\nExecutive Order 23-242 did the following:\n\nWaived credit hour requirements for transfer applications that would typically affect first-and second-year postsecondary students.\n\nWaived application date windows for transfers that would otherwise burden academically eligible students who are seeking to flee discriminatory circumstances. Additionally, Governor DeSantis urged colleges and universities to use, at their discretion, their existing statutory authority to grant out-of-state tuition waivers on a case-by-case basis for those students who may face financial hardship when transferring to a Florida postsecondary institution from another state.", "source": {"uri": "bocanewsnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Ron DeSantis remade the Florida Supreme Court over the past five years, reshaping the state's political universe heading into the November elections.\n\nAlong the way, it may have created an enduring part of DeSantis' legacy. The seven-member court cleared the way for the state's new six-week abortion ban and gave a green-light to an abortion access initiative that will now go before voters. And there are still two big cases looming.\n\nWhile national Democrats have focused their attention on former President Donald Trump because he appointed the justices that overturned Roe v. Wade and made the six-week ban possible, those who have followed the issue in Florida say the restriction is due more to DeSantis, who appointed five of the justices.\n\n\"Without DeSantis we wouldn't have the court we have,\" said John Stemberger, president of Liberty Counsel Action, who spent decades leading one of the state's most influential anti-abortion groups. \"Without those judicial picks and their philosophy we would have never got there. I think Ron DeSantis gets to take credit indirectly.\"\n\nFlorida's six-week ban is the result of the \"Florida Supreme Court more than anything else,\" said Mary Ziegler, a University of California at Davis professor and legal historian who has written about the history of abortion.\n\n\"Florida has had conservative governors and legislative majorities for many years at this point,\" Ziegler said. \"Florida had been more progressive on abortion rights than neighboring states and arguably many other progressive states because of the way the state's Constitution had been interpreted. This decision marked more of a big sea change more than anything else.\"\n\nThe question is whether there will be any more surprises from this court in the near future. Two cases -- both of which involve DeSantis directly -- remain in flux. And both could loom large for the governor over the next two-and-a-half years left in his term.\n\nOne case involves the congressional map that DeSantis muscled through the Legislature which helped the GOP take back the House. The map proposed by the governor dismantled a North Florida seat that had been held by a Black Democrat and ultimately helped Republicans net four more seats. A federal court earlier this year rejected a lawsuit against the map, but the state Supreme Court still needs to decide if the map conflicts with voter-approved gerrymandering standards.\n\nThe case is currently on a timeline that suggests a hearing won't happen until after the summer. So it won't affect this year's elections, but a ruling rejecting the map could loom large for DeSantis if he inches toward a 2028 bid.\n\nThe high court also has a pending case regarding the suspension of Central Florida prosecutor Monique Worrell. DeSantis suspended her from office last August after asserting she was too lenient with criminals and was endangering the public. Worrell challenged the suspension and her case was heard by the court last December. Both Worrell and Andrew Warren, a Tampa prosecutor suspended by the governor in 2022, are running this year to win back their jobs.\n\nThen there's the question of whether this same court will ultimately be asked to weigh in yet again on abortion. Critics of the amendment, including DeSantis, have questioned the wording on the voter initiative and its overall impact.\n\n\"There's still a lot up in the air in Florida,\" said Ziegler.\n\n-- Gary Fineout\n\nWHERE'S RON? Gov. DeSantis is holding a press conference in Gainesville at 9:30 a.m. with Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles Director Dave Kerner and State University System of Florida Chancellor Ray Rodrigues.\n\nHave a tip, story, suggestion, birthday, anniversary, new job, or any other nugget for Playbook? Get in touch at: [email protected].\n\nFORGET ABOUT IT -- \"DeSantis says he has no plans to call a special session of the Florida Legislature,\" reports News Service of Florida. \"Amid widespread speculation about lawmakers possibly returning to Tallahassee, Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday he has 'no plans' to call a special session but would back stricter immigration measures from the Republican-controlled Legislature.\"\n\nIN COURT -- \"Judges sound skeptical about DeSantis push for executive privilege,\" by POLITICO's Gary Fineout. \"Judges on a Florida appeals court sounded skeptical Tuesday about assertions by Gov. Ron DeSantis that he can sidestep the state's public records laws by asserting he has executive privilege -- a right that has not been recognized previously in state law. The highly watched case before the 1st District Court of Appeals could have repercussions for media organizations and members of the public and allow DeSantis and future governors a way to shield records detailing deliberations and discussions inside the governor's office. But at the same time the three judges on the panel also acknowledged that they could sidestep the entire legal question and reject the underlying lawsuit for other reasons, including that it was brought by an anonymous person.\"\n\nAFFORDABLE AND HIGH GRAD RATES -- \"Yes, Florida is No. 1 in the country for education. Here's why,\" by Tim Smart of U.S. News & World Report. \"Florida still fares well in many education metrics, and for the second year in a row is the top state for education in U.S. News & World Report's Best States rankings. That placement is largely fueled by several stellar metrics in higher education, and less so by Florida's still fairly strong performance in the prekindergarten- through-12th-grade arena.\"\n\n-- \"Sales-tax holidays ahead for storm prep and school; there's a new break on insurance premiums, too,\" reports Anthony Man of the South Florida Sun Sentinel.\n\n300-MEMBER FORCE -- \"An infamous Miami cop joins Ron DeSantis' paramilitary force,\" reports Ana Ceballos and Charles Rabin of the Miami Herald. \"Javier Ortiz, the Miami police captain whose long history of citizen complaints alleging beatings, false arrests and harassment made him notorious in the city he swore to protect and serve, has joined Ron DeSantis' Florida State Guard. Ortiz, 44, joined the paramilitary organization in February, about a year after the Miami Police Department rescinded his firing on the condition that he give up his work-issued gun, work a nighttime desk job and commit to an early retirement.\n\nNEW LAW -- \"Florida poised to start new crackdown on massage centers, therapists,\" reports Florida Politics' Christine Jordan Sexton. \"The new measure (HB 197) -- which Gov. Ron DeSantis signed this week -- requires the state to suspend the licenses of massage therapists and massage establishments if any employee of a massage therapist or establishment is arrested for any spate of offenses, including having sex with minors, prostitution, kidnapping or false imprisonment.\"\n\n-- \"Bob Graham's family plans South Florida events commemorating late governor and senator,\" by the South Florida Sun Sentinel's Anthony Man.\n\n-- \"Florida toughens its street-racing, school-safety laws,\" reports News Service of Florida.\n\nCOMING SOON -- \"Balloons harm wildlife.

It was championed by environmentalists and sponsored by two Republican lawmakers from the Tampa Bay area, Linda Chaney, a state representative and Nick DiCeglie, a state senator ... The bill closes a loophole in an existing Florida law that allowed for the outdoor release of up to nine balloons per person in any 24-hour period, a provision that critics say didn't achieve the goal of reducing marine trash.\"\n\nGOOD FOR TOURISM -- \"Disney's adjusted profit tops forecasts as theme park numbers keep rising,\" reports the Associated Press. \"Revenue at Disney's domestic theme parks rose 7 percent ... The company reported more spending by guests at Walt Disney World because of higher ticket prices.\"\n\n'TRANSFORMATIONAL' -- \"FAMU donor, CEO speaks out after skepticism around record $237 million donation,\" reports Tarah Jean of the Tallahassee Democrat. \"The 30-year-old hemp farmer, investor and entrepreneur drew the national spotlight with his gift, which appears to be both the largest in history at FAMU and any of the other 100-plus historically Black colleges and universities, or HBCUs, in the country.\"\n\nELIMINATING -- \"Brightline ending $10-per-ride South Florida pass program to make room for Orlando riders,\" reports Mike Diamond of the Palm Beach Post. \"Brightline, unable to accommodate many of its Orlando passengers, is eliminating a popular $10-per-ride monthly pass program for South Florida commuters and has already begun reducing the number of seats available for purchase on short trips between Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties. It is all part of a plan to help get as many passengers as possible on the longer and more profitable route to Orlando International Airport, but it is coming at the expense of users in South Florida.\"\n\nOTHERS WANT IN -- \"Brightline high-speed rail to Tampa? City officials discuss what's next,\" by the Tampa Bay Times' Olivia George. \"On a Wednesday morning last month, a group of senior city staff and business leaders huddled with Mayor Jane Castor to discuss plans connecting Tampa and Orlando with high-speed rail. The meeting came about six weeks after Florida lawmakers decided not to include a requested $50 million to spur rail expansion along Interstate 4. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis later said at a news conference that taxpayers wouldn't be 'on the hook' to pay for construction by private operator Brightline. Castor wanted an update on what's next.\"\n\nPANTHERS -- \"As students protest Israel, has the Florida Democratic Party drifted to the right?\" by the Tampa Bay Times' Kirby Wilson. \"With a November election looming, Democrats are treading carefully when it comes to the progressive issue of the day: American support for Israel's war on Hamas. Some of the state's most prominent Democrats, including Florida Democratic Party chairperson Nikki Fried and U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, are Jewish and staunch backers of Israel. At the same time, President Joe Biden is relying on an outpouring of support from young people in November -- like he did in his 2020 victory over Donald Trump. While Florida Democrats work to turn out the vote on college campuses, protesters on some of those same campuses have taken to quads in recent days with chants of 'Biden, Biden, you can't hide. You're supporting genocide.'\"\n\n-- \"Sen. Corey Simon among North Florida delegates going to the Republican National Convention,\" reports Jeff Burlew of the Tallahassee Democrat.\n\nNEW BILL -- \"Sen. Rick Scott joins Miccosukee Tribe in argument over Big Cypress Preserve protections,\" reports the Miami Herald's Alex Harris. \"Sen. Rick Scott filed a bill Monday to block a move by the federal Department of Interior that would ratchet up protections for the broad swath of cypress forest in Southwest Florida. Scott, who is up for re-election in November, aims to stop the federal government from designating the preserve as 'wilderness,' like it has done for the preserve's southern neighbor, Everglades National Park.\"\n\nBULLISH -- \"Tony Fabrizio feels good about Trump's chances. And it's 'kinda weird,'\" by the Bulwark's Marc Caputo. \"What's less known about Fabrizio is that, among political insiders, he has a reputation as a clear-eyed pessimist, one who won't search for silver linings because he's too concerned about the storm clouds. Yet despite the unprecedented challenges Trump faces -- an embarrassing and time-consuming sex-scandal criminal trial; a massive cash disadvantage; a huge disparity in paid advertising; a small on-the-ground campaign footprint compared to Biden's; and a corresponding drumbeat of negative coverage -- Fabrizio on Saturday sounded uncharacteristically . . . optimistic.\"\n\nDELAYED -- \"Judge Cannon indefinitely postpones Trump's classified docs trial,\" reports POLITICO's Kyle Cheney. \"The judge presiding over Donald Trump's criminal case in Florida -- on charges that he hoarded classified secrets at his Mar-a-Lago estate after his presidency -- has indefinitely postponed the trial, once scheduled for May 20.\"\n\n-- \"Trump invited to get $54,000 in unclaimed property. Florida CFO says money could help fight 'very, very nasty people,'\" by the South Florida Sun Sentinel's Ron Hurtibise.\n\nFLEET WEEK -- Blue Star Families hosted a kickoff concert celebration last night at PortMiami for the city's inaugural fleet week, which will bring more than 1,500 service members to the 305. During the concert, Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro announced that a nuclear-powered submarine will be named U.S.S. Miami and sponsored by Gloria Estefan. The singer and actress danced to \"Conga,\" and the reggae band The Wailers performed.

Ron DeSantis (R-FL) spoke at the University of Florida (UF) on Wednesday, making it clear that his administration will not tolerate unruly pro-Hamas, anti-Israel protesters calling the shots on campuses, briefly mocking those who continue in their endeavors to disrupt.\n\nDeSantis went directly to the campus, where some students continued to protest, as chants could be heard in the background. However, that did not stop DeSantis, who continued in his remarks despite the distant chants.\n\n\"You know, I wasn't here after October 7 on the campus; I'm sure the protestors were all very upset at the fact that Hamas went into Israeli communities and baked babies in ovens, raped women, [and] assassinated elderly people in very brutal ways,\" DeSantis said during the press conference as chants could be heard in the background.\n\n\"I'm sure they were very upset about that -- oh no, they weren't. That's right, they didn't care about that. They were completely fine with those massacres happening, and they had no concern about that,\" he noted, making it clear that the attempts to \"squat at the University of Florida\" were shut down immediately.\n\nWHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW: Horror of the Hamas Terror Attack on Civilians at Kibbutz Be'eri in Israel\n\n\"There was an attempt to set up an encampment last week. And I know that we've seen this throughout the rest of the country where this has kind of become a common occurrence,\" he said. \"Well, we don't do that here in the state of Florida, and so, they did have an encampment, and it lasted about a few minutes.\"\n\nIndeed, the university released a statement following the arrest of some pro-Hamas, anti-Israel protesters, making it clear that the campus is not a \"daycare.\"\n\n\"This is not complicated: The University of Florida is not a daycare, and we do not treat protesters like children -- they knew the rules, they broke the rules, and they'll face the consequences,\" UF President Ben Sasse said in a statement.\n\nDeSantis continued, emphasizing that the state universities in Florida are ensuring that order is maintained, unlike other parts of the country where protesters are ruling the campuses.\n\nInsane! Columbia University Protesters Smash Windows, Barricade Themselves Inside Building\n\n\"You do not have a right to commandeer property. You don't have a right to go take over parts of the university. You don't have a right to go after other students based on their ethnicity, and we're going to ensure that that's upheld in the state of Florida,\" he said, highlighting the contrast between the way Florida universities are handling the agitators and other areas, such as Columbia University in New York.\n\nIf you look around the country, you have a lot of elite colleges and universities that have allowed themselves to become overrun with encampments, graffiti, as well as a lot of really nasty antisemitism. At Columbia, pro-Hamas activists stormed buildings, took cleaning staff hostage, and destroyed iconic academic halls. At UCLA, Jewish students were barred from entering buildings on campus by pro-Hamas activists. At Portland State, the library was taken over and subsequently trashed by vagrants who weren't even students of the university to begin with. And we see some of the chants that are done at these universities, such as \"from the river to the sea.\" Some are saying, \"We don't want no two-state; we take it all.\" And, you know, part of it is, you know, people can kind of say what they want, but when you're talking about \"from the river to the sea,\" you're essentially saying you want a second holocaust, that you want to wipe Israel off the map, and that's what Hamas stands for.\n\n\"That's why Hamas perpetrated the October 7 attack. So, when you see that, that is not what we want to be producing in terms of leaders around this country,\" DeSantis said, questioning how many of these protesters have actually studied the history of the conflict.\n\nThe reality is, if you actually study the history of this, you would be able to see there's never been a Palestinian state. That was [the] Ottoman Empire for hundreds of years, then the British Mandate, then the UN Partition Plan, and, basically, Israel accepted that, and the Arabs rejected it, and they went to war, and they lost.

Some of these elite institutions around the country, are they just graduating a bunch of imbeciles?\" DeSantis asked while speaking at the University of Florida. \"I think, unfortunately, that's the case, and that's why a lot of these people are not going to have job offers.\"\n\nDeSantis also criticized the \"really disrespectful\" behavior many of the protesters have exhibited, referencing how protesters at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, had replaced the U.S. flag with the Palestinian flag. The governor also condemned protesters at George Washington University for vandalizing a statue of George Washington.\n\n\"So we've seen a lot of failures of leadership, we've seen some of these schools get overrun.

John Fetterman (D-PA), who argued on Tuesday that Sasse's handling of the situation is \"on point\" for how schools ought to respond.

DeSantis vows to 'keep order' as pro-Palestine protests continue at Florida universities", "body": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A confrontational Gov. Ron DeSantis on Wednesday morning touted recent arrests and dismantling of pro-Palestine encampments at Florida universities. That was as protesters at the University of Florida chanted nearby, close enough they could be heard during a morning press conference.\n\n\"This has kind of become a common occurrence,\" DeSantis said. \"Well, we don't do that here in the state of Florida, and so they did have an encampment, and it lasted about a few minutes.\"\n\nFor more than a half hour, DeSantis and other state education officials denounced how UCLA, Columbia and other schools have dealt with similar protests. Some resulted in the disruption of graduations as demonstrators occupied buildings and grounds. The governor vowed he'd \"keep order\" and wouldn't let something similar happen here.\n\n\"We're going to do it right,\" DeSantis said. \"We're going to be focusing on academic rigor. We're going to be focusing on the pursuit of truth. We will not let the inmates run the asylum in the Sunshine State.\"\n\nBut members of DeSantis' party think more could be done. State lawmaker Rep. Randy Fine, R-Palm Bay, said earlier this week Florida's antisemitism laws already on the books aren't being used to the fullest -- a policy he helped craft.\n\n\"It's been a great source of disappointment to me,\" Fine said. \"The legislation requires students who engage in antisemitic behavior to be treated the same way as students who engage in racist behavior. ... If someone was chanting the N-word, walking through campus, they'd be gone in 30 seconds, as they should be.\"\n\nFlorida's chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, meanwhile, has denounced the governor for already going too far. Recent student arrests at Florida State, the University of Florida and the University of South Florida, mixed with rhetoric conflating pro-Palestine protests with the terror group Hamas, are chilling free speech, CAIR said.\n\n\"All they (students) are asking for are conversations to have, and how they want their universities to be invested and I feel they have a right to do that.\"\n\nProtesters have called for schools to divest from Israel as one of their main goals. The request was a nonstarter for Florida's University Chancellor Ray Rodrigues. During the morning news conference, he said there would be no appeasement or divestment for Florida's universities. Later, Rodrigues then dismissed concerns that state officials were chilling speech.\n\n\"You may have seen a very large group of students and outside campus agitators joining in to protest our very speech,\" Rodrigues said. \"None of them seemed chilled... and that's my answer.\"", "source": {"uri": "wptv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WPTV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "forrest_saunders@wptv.com", "name": "Forrest Saunders", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Florida", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbia, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbia, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallahassee,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tallahassee, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tallahassee, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Fine", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Randy Fine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_on_American\u2013Islamic_Relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_University_System_of_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State University System of Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeasement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Appeasement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_South_Florida", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of South Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigger", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigger"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Rodrigues", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ray Rodrigues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Student", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Student", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4b9880f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x672+0+24/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fx-default-stgec.uplynk.com%2Fause%2Fslices%2F3f8%2F2fbf8a5e953e4a01960f2f5161cc4953%2F3f8b1604812348ada8dc0a3ac5265884%2Fposter_7ad087d102704a92828a7c5530b51e0b.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550497", "eventUri": "eng-9550497", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tallahassee, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Ron DeSantis visits University of Florida to discuss pro-Palestinian protests, and Black voters could be influential in November.\n\nDeSantis vows to maintain law and order in Florida over pro-Palestinian protests\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis spoke at the University of Florida on Wednesday, touting Florida's efforts to maintain law and order as pro-Palestinian protests have been seen across the country in recent weeks, causing chaos on some college campuses.\n\n\"In Florida, we prioritize order and student safety on campus,\" DeSantis said. \"While other states allowed their college campuses to be vandalized and taken over by antisemitic agitators, Florida held the line.\"\n\nState leaders made it clear that if protesters break the law, they are no longer a protester, but a criminal instead.\n\nWhile protests continue at UF and at other universities across the country, incidents like harassment or camping out have led to roughly 40 arrests in Florida so far.\n\nDeSantis praised the school's quick actions to disband encampments made by protesters, calling it the \"Encampment-Free University of Florida\" and saying \"you do not have a right to commandeer property.\"\n\nSome arrested students are facing year-long bans from the campus, while others are being banned from attending their graduation.\n\n\"I think there are great days ahead, not just for this university but throughout the state of Florida,\" DeSantis said. \"But we're going to do it right. We're going to be focusing on academic rigor. We're going to be focusing on the pursuit of truth. We will not let the inmates run the asylum in the Sunshine State.\"\n\nDuring the news conference, DeSantis also announced further support for student safety funding, including:\n\nAccording to the governor's office, DeSantis will approve that funding when he signs the Focus on Florida's Future budget for 2024-2025.\n\nThis week, DeSantis also signed House Bill 1473, which improves school safety across the state by:\n\n33 arrested at George Washington University as D.C. mayor's congressional hearing is canceled\n\nPolice using pepper spray cleared a pro-Palestinian tent encampment at George Washington University and arrested dozens of demonstrators on Wednesday, just as city officials were set to appear before hostile lawmakers in Congress to account for their handling of the two-week protest.\n\nThe House Committee on Oversight and Accountability canceled the hearing after the crackdown, with its chairman and other Republicans welcoming the police action. House Speaker Mike Johnson said: \"It should not require threatening to haul D.C.'s mayor before Congress to keep Jewish students at George Washington University safe.\"\n\nDistrict of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, said she and Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith decided to clear the camp based on shifting information about increased threats. Smith said there were signs \"the protest was becoming more volatile and less stable.\"\n\nAmong them were indications that protesters had \"gathered improvised weapons\" and were \"casing\" university buildings with the possible intention of occupying them, police said.\n\nTensions have ratcheted up in standoffs with protesters of the Israel-Hamas war on campuses across the United States and increasingly in Europe. Some colleges cracked down immediately, while others have tolerated the demonstrations. Some have begun to lose patience and call in police over concerns about disruptions to campus life and safety.\n\nPolice also moved in Tuesday night to break up an encampment at the University of Massachusetts. Video from the scene in Amherst showed an hourslong operation as dozens of police officers in riot gear systematically tore down tents and took protesters into custody.\n\nThe operation continued into early Wednesday, and police said about 130 people had been arrested after protesters refused orders to disperse.\n\nD.C. police said officers moved to disperse demonstrators at George Washington because \"there has been a gradual escalation in the volatility of the protest.\" They said 33 arrests were made, including for assault on a police officer and unlawful entry.\n\nThey confirmed they used pepper spray outside the encampment against protesters who were trying to break police lines and enter.\n\nGeorge Washington had warned of possible suspensions for continuing the camp on University Yard. Protesters carrying signs reading \"Free Palestine\" and \"Hands off Rafah\" also marched to school President Ellen Granberg's home Tuesday night.\n\nThe school said in a statement that while it is committed to free expression, \"the encampment had evolved into an unlawful activity, with participants in direct violation of multiple university policies and city regulations.\"\n\nThroughout the roughly two weeks of the encampment, the scene had been largely tranquil.\n\nThe tightly organized demonstrators and pro-Israeli counter-protesters who stood along the edges interacted without serious conflict. Some of the most charged confrontations involved people objecting to the treatment of a George Washington statue, wrapped with Palestinian scarves and flags with \"Genocidal Warmonger University\" spray painted on its base.\n\nSince April 18, about 2,800 people have been arrested on 50 campuses, figures that are based on Associated Press reporting and statements from universities and law enforcement agencies after this latest anti-war movement was launched by a protest at Columbia University in New York.\n\nAs the upcoming 2024 election approaches, there's a group of society that lags behind other racial and demographic groups when it comes to voter participation.\n\nPew Research estimates Black Americans will make up about 14% of the electorate in this November's presidential election.\n\nBut while Black women make up a higher percentage of women who vote, Black men make up a smaller percentage of overall men who vote.\n\nThat data shows Black women's participation in election is about ten percentage points higher than Black men.\n\nIn an election that could be close, campaigns know getting out the vote among all parts of the electorate could be key.\n\nMarquis McKenzie found himself unable to vote for 10 years after being locked up for armed robbery.\n\nIn a perilous prison sentence, he found pride in cleaning, something he knew he could do well.\n\n\"My dorm came in first place for six months straight, so I'm like if I'm doing this for free, when I get out I might as well do it,\" he said. \"Because I didn't think any establishment would be worse than cleaning a prison. So it's something I learned a passion for at an early age.\"\n\nWhen McKenzie was released from prison, he had trouble moving up in jobs because of his felony conviction, and eventually started his own cleaning business.\n\nBut even a successful business owner, it took 10 years for McKenzie to regain his right to vote, only after Florida voters approved a ballot amendment pushed by the Florida Rights Restoration Coaltion.\n\nHe now works for the organization to help other returning citizens returning from incarceration fully regain their voting rights. He said the state voter registration system, though, can create confusion.\n\n\"We've seen people who felt they were whole-heartedly eligible to vote receive a voter registration card, and then they go vote and turn around and get arrested,\" he said.\n\nHe said that can lead to apathy.\n\n\"They just totally check out of the process, right?\" he said. \"Even those who are eligible or right there at the finish line, one little hiccup, can cause them to not want to be involved in democracy, which is crazy.\"\n\nMcKenzie said when he first got out of prison, he didn't care about voting.\n\n\"I think for a lot of people, they don't understand it so they stay away from it,\" he said. \"And I didn't think voting was necessary, and I didn't think it was a tool I needed to survive, so it was the last use of my worries, to be honest,.\"\n\nNow that he can vote again, McKenzie said he doesn't miss an election. But he gets why other Black men don't vote.\n\nWith that segment of society disproportionately incarcerated, McKenzie says even if they regain their voting rights, many don't care to vote. He said those running for office must make the connection.\n\nAs a small business owner, the economy is everything. As a father of three, he's also concerned about education. And if government leaders or candidates aren't addressing affordable housing, he believes many in his community lose faith in the system.", "source": {"uri": "mynews13.com", "dataType": "news",

Ron DeSantis touted recent arrests and dismantling of pro-Palestine encampments at Florida universities Wednesday morning. That was as protestors at the University of Florida chanted nearby, close enough they could be heard during a morning press conference.\n\n\"This has kind of become a common occurrence,\" said the Republican governor. \"Well, we don't do that here in the state of Florida. And so they did have an encampment. And it lasted about a few minutes.\"\n\nFor more than a half hour, DeSantis and other state ed officials denounced how UCLA, Columbia, and other schools have dealt with similar protests. Some resulted in the disruption of graduations as demonstrators occupied buildings and grounds. The governor vowed he'd \"keep order\" and wouldn't let something similar happen here.\n\n\"We're going to do it right,\" said DeSantis. \"We're going to be focusing on academic rigor, we're going to be focusing on the pursuit of truth. We will not let the inmates run the asylum in the Sunshine State.\"\n\nBut members of DeSantis' own party think more could be done. State lawmaker Rep. Randy Fine (R-Palm Bay) said earlier this week Florida's antisemitism laws already on the books aren't being used to the fullest -- a policy he helped craft.\n\n\"It's been a great source of disappointment to me,\" said Fine. \"The legislation requires students who engage in antisemitic behavior to be treated the same way as students who engage in racist behavior... If someone was chanting the N-word, walking through campus, they'd be gone in 30 seconds, as they should be.\"\n\nFlorida's chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, meanwhile, has denounced the governor for already going too far. Recent student arrests at Florida State, UF, and USF, mixed with rhetoric conflating pro-Palestine protests with the terror group Hamas are chilling free speech, CAIR said.\n\n\"All they [students] are asking for are conversations to have, and how they want their universities to be invested and I feel they have a right to do that.\"\n\nProtestors have called for schools to divest from Israel as one of their main goals. The request was a nonstarter for Florida's University Chancellor Ray Rodrigues. During the AM press conference, he said there would be no appeasement or divestment for Florida's Universities. Later, Rodrigues then dismissed concerns that state officials were chilling speech.\n\n\"You may have seen a very large group of students and outside campus agitators joining in to protest our very speech,\" said the Chancellor and former Republican state senator. \"None of them seemed chilled... and that's my answer.\"\n\nOutside Jimmy Klass's mobile home in Clearwater, symbols of American pride hang all around his residence.

Ron DeSantis on Wednesday condemned pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses across the country.\n\n\"We are here on the campus quad at the University of Florida, where there was an attempt to set up an encampment last week. And I know that we've seen this throughout the rest of the country where this has kind of become a common occurrence. Well, we don't do that here in the state of Florida. And so they did have an encampment, and it lasted about a few minutes,\" DeSantis said, flanked by state and university leaders.\n\nMORE: 8 students, 8 other adults arrested by university police at UNF pro-Palestine protest, school says\n\nAs DeSantis spoke, chants could be heard from nearby protesters who had gathered behind a barrier for the speech.\n\nTensions have ratcheted up in standoffs with protesters of the Israel-Hamas war on campuses across the United States and increasingly in Europe. Some colleges cracked down immediately. Others have tolerated the demonstrations. Some have begun to lose patience and call in police over concerns about disruptions to campus life and safety.\n\nRELATED: In Holocaust remembrance, Biden condemns antisemitism sparked by college protests and Gaza war\n\n\"In the state of Florida, you do not have a right to commandeer property, you don't have a right to go take over parts of the university.

And we're going to ensure that that's upheld in the state of Florida,\" DeSantis said. \"How many of them actually have studied the history of this? Very few. They're just doing this because they think it's a cheap cause.\"\n\nSince April 18, just over 2,600 people have been arrested on 50 campuses, figures based on AP reporting and statements from universities and law enforcement agencies after this latest anti-war movement was launched by a protest at Columbia University in New York.\n\nRELATED: 33 are arrested at George Washington University as DC mayor's congressional hearing is canceled\n\nThe war began when Hamas militants breached Israel's defenses on Oct. 7 and swept through nearby army bases and farming communities, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Hamas is still believed to be holding around 100 hostages and the remains of more than 30 others after most of the rest were released during a November cease-fire.\n\nThe war has killed over 34,800 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, and has driven some 80% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million Palestinians from their homes. Israel's military campaign has been one of the deadliest and most destructive in recent history, reducing large parts of Gaza to rubble.", "source": {"uri": "news4jax.com", "dataType": "news",

Ron DeSantis visited the University of Florida on May 8 to praise his state's ability to maintain \"law and order\" on college campuses while a group of more than two dozen pro-Palestine protesters gathered behind a three-layered barrier of barricades, Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers, and more barricades.\n\nThe rebel band performed their album of chants that included classics such as \"Free Free Palestine,\" as well as new releases that catered to the moment, like \"Ronny, Ronny, you can't hide! You're supporting genocide\" in an attempt to drown out Mr. DeSantis's address on May 8 that praised the work of the State University System and law enforcement for ensuring no protest disrupted or called a single graduation ceremony earlier this month.\n\n\"I want to thank the university here, as well as all of our state universities, for ensuring that we're going to maintain order in the state of Florida,\" Mr. DeSantis said.\n\n\"We are here on the campus quad at the University of Florida, where there was an attempt to set up an encampment last week. And I know that we've seen this throughout the rest of the country where this has kind of become a common occurrence. Well, we don't do that here in the state of Florida. And so they did have an encampment, and it lasted about a few minutes.\"\n\nThe governor denounced the destructive actions by protesters at other schools like Columbia and affirmed his stance that protestors don't have the right to \"take over parts of a university,\" nor do they have a right to \"go after other students based on their ethnicity,\" and if any students were to take over a building or take someone as a hostage, they would be expelled.\n\nHe also called out what he called \"disrespectful\" actions being seen, such as the replacement of the U.S. flag with the Palestinian flag on the campus of UCLA and the desecration of the statue of George Washington at George Washington University.\n\nThe governor was also joined by several state lawmakers, University of Florida President Ben Sasse, and State University System of Florida Chancellor Ray Rodrigues, who, through consultation with the governor, worked to ensure that \"no commencement ceremony was canceled.\"\n\nMr. Rodrigues spoke firmly through the waves of shouting about how other colleges and universities capitulated to their protesters, going so far in some cases as to grant amnesty to all students involved in the protests.\n\nHe also highlighted the fact that the class of 2024 was also the high school class of 2020 who lost out on that graduation due to COVID-19 and said the protestors looked to deny the same students yet another opportunity to walk across the stage and receive their degree.\n\nMr. Rodrigues expressed his pride for the university leadership and various law enforcement agencies for providing the necessary resources and working together to ensure every commencement ceremony planned went ahead \"without disruption, without discrimination, without intimidation, and without arrest.\n\nMr. Sasse also touted the professionalism of Florida's law enforcement officers in dealing with the protests, saying, \"What you have done in the face of being spit on [and] shouted at with profanity has been amazing.\"\n\n\"Too often in our time and place, we give the most voice to the loudest and angriest people, and The University of Florida is not filled with angry people,\" he said.\n\nMr. Sasse also expressed pride in being the president of the school with the most Jewish students in the country. A current Jewish student came forward to vouch for the school's efforts over the recent weeks, affirming, \"Despite the challenges posed by protests, they've remained committed to protecting all students regardless of their backgrounds.\"\n\nMr. DeSantis also announced hundreds of millions of dollars in further funding for school safety, including $20 million to protect Jewish Day Schools, $20 million to protect Florida's historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), and $569 million for K-12 school safety funding.\n\nHe also reminded the press that his executive order allowing the streamlining of the transfer requests of Jewish students from out of state remains in effect.\n\nAs the school year moves into Summer vacation, Mr. Rodrigues said that many protesters said they would be back in the fall \"ready to pick up right where they are leaving off.\" He promised that \"There will be no negotiation. There will be no appeasement. There will be no amnesty, and there will be no divestment.\"\n\n\"If you had the courage of your conviction, you wouldn't need a mask,\" Rep. Chuck Clemons, speaker pro tempore of the State House of Representatives, told The Epoch Times after the event. \"If you believe in the First Amendment, you would not feel the need to shout other

He reflected on the absence of protests during his prior visit to the campus, contrasting it with the recent situation.\n\n\"You know, I wasn't here after Oct. 7 on the campus,\" DeSantis remarked. \"I'm sure those protesters were all very upset at the fact that Hamas went into Israeli communities and baked babies in ovens, raped women, assassinated elderly people in very brutal ways. I'm sure they were very upset about that - Oh no, they weren't. That's right. They didn't care about that. They were completely fine with those massacres happening and they had no -- no concern about that.\"\n\nIn addition to addressing the protests, Governor DeSantis criticized the notion of the \"occupation of the Gaza strip.\"\n\n\"The Gaza strip is not occupied, OK?\" DeSantis asserted. \"That's been Hamas' sanctuary for many years now, and did they create opportunities for people? Did they utilize the natural resources? No. They focused their efforts on terrorism and that's what's happened. And so, so much of this is just such a farce. It's just kind of embarrassing to hear some of this nonsense.\"\n\nThe governor's remarks come amid ongoing tensions in the region and continued efforts at diplomacy to address the conflict between Israel and Hamas.

Notably absent was Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican presidential candidate who declined to join Biden after he suggested that the Democrat's presence could hinder disaster response efforts.\n\nBiden, when asked about his rival's absence, said he was not disappointed by the turn of events, but welcomed the presence of Rick Scott, one of the state's two Republican U.S. senators.\n\nHe pledged the federal government's total support for Floridians.\n\n\"I'm here today to deliver a clear message to the people of Florida and throughout the Southeast,\" Biden said after the walking tour. He spoke outdoors near a church that had parts of its sheet metal roof peeled back by Idalia's powerful winds and a home half crushed by a fallen tree.\n\n\"As I've told your governor, if there's anything your state needs, I'm ready to mobilize that support,\" he continued. \"Anything they need related to these storms. Your nation has your back and we'll be with you until the job is done.\"\n\nEarlier, the mayor of Live Oak, which is about 80 miles east of Tallahassee, the state capital, thanked Biden and first lady Jill Biden for coming and \"showing us that we're important to you.\"\n\n\"Everybody thinks Florida is rich, but this is not one of the richest counties in the state and there are people who are suffering,\" said Frank Davis, adding he knew of no loss of life or serious injury.\n\nAt Suwannee Pineview Elementary School, where the Bidens were briefed on the storm damage, local officials offered praise for early disaster declarations by the White House and the quick flow of federal aid. \"What the federal government is doing ... is a big deal,\" Scott said.\n\nHelping Floridians and their communities get back on their feet was the emphasis at the briefing on response and recovery efforts, with DeSantis' conspicuous absence seemingly not a concern for residents and officials.\n\nDeanne Criswell, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, told reporters as the president flew from Washington that her team and the governor's team had \"worked collectively\" to determine that Biden would visit Live Oak. She said her teams \"have heard no concerns over any impact to the communities that we're going to visit today.\"\n\nOn Friday, hours after Biden said he would be meeting with DeSantis, the governor's office issued a statement saying there were no plans for that. \"In these rural communities, and so soon after impact, the security preparations alone that would go into setting up such a meeting would shut down ongoing recovery efforts,\" DeSantis spokesman Jeremy Redfern said in a statement.\n\nDeSantis' office said his public schedule Saturday included stops in Keaton Beach, about 60 miles southwest of Live Oak, and Horseshoe Beach, about 75 miles away, with the last event beginning at 1:45 p.m.\n\nCriswell said aboard the flight that power is being restored and the roads are all open in the area where Biden was going. \"Access is not being hindered,\" she said, adding that her team had been in \"close coordination\" with the governor's staff.\n\nIdalia made landfall Wednesday morning along Florida's sparsely populated Big Bend region as a Category 3 storm, causing widespread flooding and damage before moving north to drench Georgia and the Carolinas.\n\nAs Biden left Washington on Saturday morning, reporters asked what happened with the meeting. \"I don't know. He's not going to be there,\" the president said of DeSantis.\n\nThe political disconnect between both sides is a break from the recent past, since Biden and DeSantis met when the president toured Florida after Hurricane Ian hit the state last year, and following the Surfside condo collapse in Miami Beach in summer 2021. But DeSantis is now running to unseat Biden, and he only left the Republican presidential primary trail with Idalia barreling toward his state.\n\nPutting aside political rivalries following natural disasters can be tricky, meanwhile.\n\nAnother 2024 presidential candidate, former Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, has long been widely criticized in GOP circles for embracing then-President Barack Obama during a tour of damage 2012's Hurricane Sandy did to his state. Christie was even asked about the incident last month, during the first Republican presidential debate.\n\nBoth Biden and DeSantis at first suggested that helping storm victims would outweigh partisan differences. But the governor began suggesting that a presidential trip would complicate response logistics as the week wore on.\n\n\"There's a time and a place to have political season,\" the governor said before Idalia made landfall. \"But then there's a time and a place to say that this is something that's life threatening, this is something that could potentially cost somebody their life, it could cost them their livelihood.\"\n\nBy Friday, the governor was telling reporters of Biden, \"one thing I did mention to him on the phone\" was \"it would be very disruptive to have the whole security apparatus that goes\" with the president \"because there are only so many ways to get into\" many of the hardest hit areas.\n\n\"What we want to do is make sure that the power restoration continues and the relief efforts continue and we don't have any interruption in that,\" DeSantis said.\n\nThe post-Idalia political consequences are high for both men.\n\nAs Biden seeks reelection, the White House has asked for an additional $4 billion to address natural disasters as part of a supplemental funding request to Congress. That would bring the total to $16 billion and highlight that intensifying extreme weather is imposing ever higher costs on U.S. taxpayers.\n\nDeSantis has built his White House bid around dismantling what he calls Democrats' \"woke\" policies. The governor also frequently draws applause at GOP rallies by declaring that it's time to send \"Joe Biden back to his basement,\" a reference to the Democrat's Delaware home, where he spent much of his time during the early lockdowns of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBut four months before the first ballots are to be cast in Iowa's caucuses, DeSantis still lags far behind former President Donald Trump, the Republican primary's dominant early front-runner. And he has cycled through repeated campaign leadership shakeups and reboots of his image in an attempt to refocus his message.\n\nThe super PAC supporting DeSantis' candidacy also has halted its door-knocking operations in Nevada, which votes third on the Republican presidential primary calendar, and several states holding Super Tuesday primaries in March -- a further sign of trouble.\n\n--

But Biden's visit to see its effects threatened to be engulfed by political clashes since DeSantis' statement came hours after the president himself earlier Friday that he would be meeting with the governor.\n\nIn response to DeSantis eventually preemptively calling off a meeting, White House spokeswoman Emilie Simons said, \"President Biden and the first lady look forward to meeting members of the community impacted by Hurricane Idalia and surveying impacts of the storm.\"\n\n\"Their visit to Florida has been planned in close coordination\" with Federal Emergency Management personnel \"as well as state and local leaders to ensure there is no impact on response operations,\" Simons said in a statement.\n\nThe political disconnect between both sides is a break from the recent past, since Biden and DeSantis met when the president toured Florida after Hurricane Ian hit the state last year, and following the Surfside condo collapse in Miami Beach in summer 2021. But DeSantis is now running to unseat Biden, and he only left the Republican presidential primary trail with Idalia barreling toward his state.\n\nPutting aside political rivalries following natural disasters can be tricky, meanwhile.\n\nAnother 2024 presidential candidate, former Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, has long been widely criticized in GOP circles for embracing then-President Barack Obama during a tour of damage 2012's Hurricane Sandy did to his state. Christie was even asked about the incident last month, during the first Republican presidential debate.\n\nBoth Biden and DeSantis at first suggested that helping storm victims would outweigh partisan differences. But the governor began suggesting that a presidential trip would complicate response logistics as the week wore on.\n\n\"There's a time and a place to have political season,\" the governor said before Idalia made landfall. \"But then there's a time and a place to say that this is something that's life threatening, this is something that could potentially cost somebody their life, it could cost them their livelihood.\"\n\nBy Friday, the governor was telling reporters of Biden, \"one thing I did mention to him on the phone\" was \"it would be very disruptive to have the whole security apparatus that goes\" with the president \"because there are only so many ways to get into\" many of the hardest hit areas.\n\n\"What we want to do is make sure that the power restoration continues and the relief efforts continue and we don't have any interruption in that,\" DeSantis said.\n\nBiden joked while delivering pizzas to workers at FEMA's Washington headquarters on Thursday that he'd spoken to DeSantis so frequently about Idalia that \"there should be a direct dial\" between the pair. Homeland Security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall pointed to the experiences after Ian and Surfside collapse in saying earlier this week that Biden and DeSantis \"are very collegial when we have the work to do together of helping Americans in need, citizens of Florida in need.\"\n\nThe post-Idalia political consequences are high for both men.\n\nAs Biden seeks reelection, the White House has asked for an additional $4 billion to address natural disasters as part of its supplemental funding request to Congress. That would bring the total to $16 billion and highlight that wildfires, flooding and hurricanes have intensified during a period of climate change, imposing ever higher costs on U.S. taxpayers.\n\nDeSantis has built his White House bid around dismantling what he calls Democrats' \"woke\" policies. The governor also frequently draws applause at GOP rallies by declaring that it's time to send \"Joe Biden back to his basement,\" a reference to the Democrat's Delaware home, where he spent much of his time during the early lockdowns of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBut four months before the first ballots are to be cast in Iowa's caucuses, DeSantis still lags far behind former President Donald Trump, the Republican primary's dominant early front-runner.

Ron DeSantis and First Lady Casey DeSantis touted new state data about the program while offering about $140,000 to area charities from the Hope Florida fund.\n\n\"This is just the right thing to do,\" said Gov. DeSantis (R-FL). \"But it's also beneficial for taxpayers because as you get people off this government assistance, we are able to save taxpayers almost $100 million per year.\"\n\nHope Florida uses what are called Hope Navigators who act a bit like social workers -- connecting those in need with help outside government like churches and nonprofits.\n\nSince starting as a pilot in 2020, Hope Florida has helped about 100,000. Among them, 73% of those who wanted jobs got them, 62% who were looking for housing secured it, and 68% who needed child care found it. In total, nearly 30,000 have reduced or eliminated the need for public aid.\n\n\"We make a connection, and then we get out of the way,\" First Lady DeSantis told us last week.\n\nThe First Lady has been leading the Hope Florida effort since 2021 and recently showed us how it all works. The CarePortal website is a key aspect, where the need and the help are mapped out and triaged. Hope Navigators then coordinate the connections between them.\n\nCritics, however, have said the state should invest more in its welfare programs instead of trying to circumvent them.\n\n\"The reality is that often the Hope Navigators will not only refer people back to my legislative office but also to the same overworked state agencies where you have case workers that have a backlog,\" said Rep. Anna Eskamani (D-Orlando).\n\nEskamani said she supports public/private partnerships, though she wanted to see Florida focus its resources on big things like expanding Medicaid. That, she said, or work on boosting agency caseworkers and call centers and clear service backlogs.\n\n\"We actually had a situation where somebody was homeless and trying to access services,\" said Eskamani. \"They were told by the Hope Navigator to just continue sleeping under the bridge. I mean, it's just not an answer we want to give to someone.\"\n\nThe First Lady sees things differently. Hope Florida, she said, is about tapping into previously untapped resources and giving the government more ways to help without government.\n\n\"They would basically say, 'Here's some government assistance, this is all I can do, we'll see you maybe in six months'-- and that was it,\" said Casey DeSantis. \"Now they are empowered to be able to make a difference in someone's life, they take on someone's story. And they have a personal goal to help this person reach economic self-sufficiency. It's personal for them.\"\n\nIf you want to learn more about Hope Florida, how it works, how to help, or how to get it -- the easiest way is to head to their website HopeFlorida.com -- or their number 850-300-HOPE(4673).\n\nOutside Jimmy Klass's mobile home in Clearwater, symbols of American pride hang all around his residence.

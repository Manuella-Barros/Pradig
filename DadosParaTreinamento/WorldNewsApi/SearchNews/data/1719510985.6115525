Set-piece specialist MacPhee\u2019s influence at Villa Park was clear during the season just gone. Unai Emery\u2019s side scored an impressive 14 goals from dead-ball situations as they finished fourth in the Premier League. And Scotland boss Steve Clarke hopes he can have a similar impact at this summer\u2019s European Championships. MacPhee will be part of the coaching set-up alongside Clarke and assistant John Carver as the Tartan Army take on hosts Germany, Switzerland and Hungary in the group stages.

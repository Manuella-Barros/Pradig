On her 16th birthday, Eva is forced onto the surface of a planet called Orbona. There, she tries to connect with other humans and find her place in the world.\n\nWhile Mason was aware of the books by Tony DiTerlizzi, she didn't know how the characters would look or where the animated series might go. \"They kept it a secret as it unfolded,\" she says. \"The amazing thing about getting to do an animated series is it takes so long to make and it's wildly collaborative - more so than on-camera stuff. It's pieced together over time; when they didn't know what would happen, we would figure it out together sometimes.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

What would a robot sound like?\"\n\nMuthr's programming was designed to keep a child safe, nurtured and learning. \"Those are relatable, motherly agendas, but they wouldn't be dissimilar to what might be programmed into a caretaking robot.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nAlready, Hatcher says, parents have devices that serve as babysitters. \"I personally don't think that's great, but I also have a lot of empathy with why parents end up doing. It's a balance.\"\n\nLike Mason, she didn't have other actors to play off. \"I might have seen a rough sketch of Muthr initially, but I think it sort of evolved. It wasn't until the end that I finally saw a trailer and (thought), 'Wow, this is amazing. You almost forget you're in it because you're looking at everybody else's amazing performances.\"\n\nWith \"Coraline,\" another animated film, Hatcher got to see what the characters looked like before she started because it employestop-motion techniques. \"The animation was more arduous - just individual people knitting tiny, tight sweaters to put on puppets. 'Coraline' took longer\" and found the Golden Globe-winning actress playing another mother. \"Some mothers are good and some are not so good,\" she says with a smile.\n\nFor Mason, \"WondLa\" is a dream job. \"Every actor I know is desperately trying to get into voice (work) and it's tough. I sent sound samples for years, just hoping to get something.\" She landed a role in \"Trolls,\" then won the lead in this new series. \"It's the closest I've had to a 9-to-5, going in every day and recording, recording, recording. It was so fun.\"\n\nA fan of animation (\"Finding Nemo,\" \"Toy Story\" and \"Monsters Inc.\" are among her favorites), the \"Roswell, New Mexico\" star obsessed over the films, practicing each of the voices. \"That was my lifeblood growing up. They gave me the idea to become an actor eventually.\"\n\nTo be part of something new, \"a young Latina navigating the world...is so meaningful to me. I can't wait for young people to watch it.\"\n\nAnd dancing? The \"WondLa\" star says she'll keep doing it. \"I couldn't quit...even I wanted to.\"\n\n\"WondLa\" begins June 28 on AppleTV+.\n\nBruce Miller is editor of the Sioux City Journal.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0

On her 16th birthday, Eva is forced onto the surface of a planet called Orbona. There, she tries to connect with other humans and find her place in the world.\n\nWhile Mason was aware of the books by Tony DiTerlizzi, she didn't know how the characters would look or where the animated series might go. \"They kept it a secret as it unfolded,\" she says. \"The amazing thing about getting to do an animated series is it takes so long to make and it's wildly collaborative - more so than on-camera stuff.

What would a robot sound like?\"\n\nMuthr's programming was designed to keep a child safe, nurtured and learning. \"Those are relatable, motherly agendas, but they wouldn't be dissimilar to what might be programmed into a caretaking robot.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nAlready, Hatcher says, parents have devices that serve as babysitters. \"I personally don't think that's great, but I also have a lot of empathy with why parents end up doing. It's a balance.\"\n\nLike Mason, she didn't have other actors to play off. \"I might have seen a rough sketch of Muthr initially, but I think it sort of evolved. It wasn't until the end that I finally saw a trailer and (thought), 'Wow, this is amazing. You almost forget you're in it because you're looking at everybody else's amazing performances.\"\n\nWith \"Coraline,\" another animated film, Hatcher got to see what the characters looked like before she started because it employestop-motion techniques. \"The animation was more arduous - just individual people knitting tiny, tight sweaters to put on puppets. 'Coraline' took longer\" and found the Golden Globe-winning actress playing another mother. \"Some mothers are good and some are not so good,\" she says with a smile.\n\nFor Mason, \"WondLa\" is a dream job. \"Every actor I know is desperately trying to get into voice (work) and it's tough. I sent sound samples for years, just hoping to get something.\" She landed a role in \"Trolls,\" then won the lead in this new series. \"It's the closest I've had to a 9-to-5, going in every day and recording, recording, recording.

The story revolves around Eva, a spirited teenager who ventures onto the transformed surface of Earth, now called Orbona, after an attack on her underground bunker.\n\nIn a recent interview with Inside South Florida, Tony DiTerlizzi shared his inspiration for creating the world of \"WondLa\" and the character of Eva. The idea was born over a decade ago when DiTerlizzi was contemplating the rapid changes in the world and the potential future for his then two-year-old daughter. He considered humanity's increasing reliance on technology, our disconnection from nature, and the importance of found family. These themes are central to \"WondLa,\" which aims to offer a hopeful vision of the future despite its dystopian setting.\n\nDiTerlizzi expressed his satisfaction with how closely the TV series translates the original book. He was deeply involved with the production team at Skydance Animation, ensuring that the themes and characters remained true to his vision. \"It is alchemy. You're transmuting a book into a film and it doesn't always go right, but I feel like the team at Skydance just did an amazing job,\" he said.\n\nOne of the most significant challenges in adapting \"WondLa\" was bringing its rich array of characters and creatures to life, particularly Eva. DiTerlizzi praised Jeanine Mason, who voices Eva, for her performance. \"I remember being in the recording booth - it was all virtual - and Jeanine is in New York recording. We're just looking at a still, she's not even animated, it's just a picture of what the character is going to look like. And Jeanine is talking, and you can see it in your mind. It was such an exciting moment to realize she was breathing life into this character,\" he noted. Mason's portrayal helps ground the futuristic and sci-fi elements of the story, making Eva a relatable and beloved character.\n\n\"WondLa\" is set in a post-apocalyptic world and features an array of fascinating characters and creatures. The TV series offers an engaging and immersive experience, staying true to the spirit of the books while bringing something new to the screen.\n\nThe TV series \"WondLa\" is already generating excitement and anticipation among fans of the book series and new viewers alike. With its compelling storyline and well-developed characters, it is poised to become a favorite among audiences of all ages.\n\nThe \"WondLa\" series is set premiere on Apple TV+ on June 28, 2024.

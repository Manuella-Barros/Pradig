{"id": 232058118, "title": "Emmerdale's Sam and Cain go to war as huge Dingle feud explodes", "text": "To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Up Next The Dingle code means that Emmerdale\u2019s most populous family sticks together whenever one of their own is threatened. But when one family member turns against another it all soon descends into civil war. That\u2019s where we are currently, after Samson Dingle (Sam Hall) was stabbed and he accused Matty Barton (Ash Palmisciano) of deliberately attacking him without any provocation. In coming episodes we\u2019ll see battle lines drawn between Cain (Jeff Hordley) and Sam (James Hooton), as Sam supports his son\u2019s version of events and Cain sides with his son-in-law Matty. Viewers know that the truth of the matter is that Matty is totally innocent. Samson and his friend Josh (Osian Morgan) had come to the Hide to celebrate Samson passing his driving test. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Up Next Josh turned out to be quite the troublemaker and started off the evening by pestering Matty\u2019s wife Amy (Natalie Ann Jamieson), who firmly told him she wasn\u2019t interested. After she\u2019d gone home, Josh turned his attention to Matty, berating him with transphobic slurs, using his deadname and generally being obnoxious. Matty was handling the situation well but when Josh demanded money from the till in the Hide. and Matty refused, Josh pushed Samson towards him \u2013 and Samson was stabbed with the knife that Matty happened to have been holding. In the aftermath, with Samson bleeding and needing an ambulance, Josh changed the story so it seemed that Matty had been the one taunting him and Samson, and had launched an unprovoked attack on them. Samson was stabbed after Josh pushed him into Matty (Picture: ITV) This, of course, is a ridiculous idea to anyone who knows Matty because he\u2019s a peaceful, gentle soul who isn\u2019t aggressive. Moira (Natalie J. Robb) knows this and so, really, do the rest of the family. But Sam feels he has no choice but to stand by Samson, who is sticking to his story that he was the innocent party. In coming episodes Cain demands that Samson should tell the truth, but when Matty also has a go at getting Samson to change his story Samson tells the police that Matty has been trying to intimidate him. There\u2019s an angry confrontation between the two, which ends up with Matty being taken away by the police.

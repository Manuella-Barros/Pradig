In an interview with Vulture alongside his brother No Malice, Pusha expressed admiration for Kendrick's lyrical prowess.\n\nFinally Revealing His Reaction\n\nWhen asked about his reaction to being name-dropped on \"euphoria,\" Pusha T responded enthusiastically, describing Kendrick's lyrics as an \"incredible display of battle raps.\" No Malice, his Clipse counterpart, echoed this sentiment, labeling the song a \"master class\" in the art of lyrical confrontation.\n\nReleased in April as a direct response to Drake's \"Push Ups\" and \"Taylor Made Freestyle,\" Kendrick Lamar's track reignited tensions stemming from Pusha T and Drake's longstanding feud. In the song, Kendrick cleverly references Pusha's history with Drake, highlighting their past exchanges through biting wordplay.\n\nThe feud between Pusha T and Drake dates back over a decade, originally sparked during Pusha's conflict with Lil Wayne in the mid-2000s. Drake's involvement escalated the tension, resulting in a series of subliminal disses exchanged between the two camps, culminating in high-profile diss tracks like \"Exodus 23:1\" and Drake's \"Tuscan Leather.\"\n\nHowever, the feud reached its pinnacle in 2018 with Pusha T's release of \"The Story of Adidon,\" a scathing track that exposed Drake's secret son to the public. This move significantly damaged Drake's previously pristine reputation and cemented Pusha T's place in hip-hop lore as a formidable adversary.\n\nPusha T's reaction to Kendrick Lamar's nod on \"euphoria\" is indicative of his steadfast stance against reconciliation with Drake. Over the years, Pusha has made it clear that the feud is far from over, despite intermittent periods of calm between diss tracks and public statements. In fact, many wanted to see Kendrick recruit Pusha for a feature on a new diss aimed at Drake.\n\nFurther Insights\n\nBeyond Pusha T, Kendrick Lamar's \"euphoria\" also referenced several other notable figures in the music industry, including Gunna, BEAM, Sexyy Red, and YNW Melly. The mention of YNW Melly sparked controversy, particularly among fans and critics who scrutinized Lamar's nod to Melly's double murder case.\n\nIn a broader context, Pusha T and No Malice shared insights into their upcoming music project with Pharrell Williams, marking their first collaborative effort since 2009's \"Til The Casket Drops.\" The duo expressed excitement about Pharrell's involvement, emphasizing their commitment to creating cohesive bodies of work that transcend mere collections of songs.\n\n\"This is what the true evolution of the Clipse looks like,\" No Malice remarked, teasing the thematic depth and high-level lyricism fans can expect from their forthcoming project. For Pusha T, the collaboration with Pharrell represents an opportunity to produce music that tells stories and resonates on a cinematic scale.\n\nAs Pusha T continues to navigate the complexities of hip-hop rivalry and artistic collaboration, his reaction to Kendrick Lamar's \"euphoria\" serves as a testament to the enduring intensity of rap beefs and the power of lyrical craftsmanship in shaping public perception within the genre.\n\nClipse's Musical Evolution with Pharrell: A New Chapter Unfolds\n\nPusha T and No Malice, collectively known as Clipse, are gearing up for a significant musical comeback with the guidance of Pharrell Williams. In their interview with Vulture, the brothers discussed their upcoming project, highlighting Pharrell's integral role as producer and collaborator.\n\nAfter more than a decade since their last joint album, Clipse expressed enthusiasm about returning to the studio under Pharrell's creative direction. Pusha T emphasized their shared vision of creating full-bodied albums that transcend individual tracks, likening their music to cinematic experiences that unfold narrative arcs.\n\nPharrell's involvement signifies a strategic shift for Clipse, who are known for their intricate lyricism and distinctive sound rooted in Virginia's rap scene. The upcoming project aims to showcase the evolution of their artistic expression while maintaining the high standards of storytelling and lyrical prowess that define their legacy.\n\n\"No Malice described the collaboration with Pharrell as a testament to Clipse's growth and maturity as artists. He teased that their new music project represents a departure from their previous works, offering fans a glimpse into the next chapter of their musical journey.\n\nAs Clipse prepares to reintroduce themselves to the music world, the anticipation surrounding their reunion with Pharrell underscores the enduring impact of their discography and the potential for their upcoming project to resonate with both longtime fans and new listeners alike.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "burtland_dixon@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Burtland Dixon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Malice", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "No Malice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diss_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diss (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pusha_T", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pusha T"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharrell_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pharrell Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipse", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clipse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_Networks", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Complex Networks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YNW_Melly", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YNW Melly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_rap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battle rap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Word play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lil_Wayne", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lil Wayne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_of_Adidon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Story of Adidon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunna_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gunna (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Storytelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyrics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lyrics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Pusha-T-breaks-silence-on-Kendrick-Lamars-Euphoria-shout-out-listen-man.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668600", "eventUri": "eng-9668600", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

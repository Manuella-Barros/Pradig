I think everybody knows what he's going through right now, but if you keep reminding him, it's going to come back.\"\n\nPeralta and his teammates are hoping a return to baseball will help take Marte's mind off the tragedy and perhaps help the healing process. Speaking with reporters a few hours before Friday's game, Marte said he was feeling better, but he appeared on the verge of tears at multiple points during a short interview.\n\nHis mother, Elpidia Valdez, was involved in a car accident on Sunday, an incident that Marte said occurred not long after he spoke to her on the phone. The call happened, he said, just before the Diamondbacks flew from St. Louis to Chicago late Sunday afternoon.\n\nWhen the flight landed, he said he got word of the accident but was under the impression his mother was going to be all right. Not long after, while he was out to dinner with teammates, he found out she died.\n\n\"It was definitely heartbreaking,\" said Diamondbacks right-hander Taijuan Walker, who was with Marte when he got the news. \"I've known Ketel since he first got signed by the Mariners. We were just all hanging out and he got that call and it hit me, too. It made me think, 'What if I would have got a call like that?' I probably wouldn't want to play the rest of the season. I'd probably want to be home with my family.\"\n\nBut Marte said his family wanted him to return to the team.\n\n\"They just told me to go back to work,\" he said. \"(They said), 'You know what you have to do. Now you have to work harder for us.' I will work harder for my family, for my mom.\"\n\nHe had already accomplished one thing this season that his mother had requested: He reached the double-digit mark in home runs, hitting six with Triple-A Reno and four more with the Diamondbacks.\n\n\"When I was playing softball in the Dominican (during the offseason) with my friend, she saw me hit a long homer,\" Marte said. \"One day, before I came to spring training, she said, 'I want 10 homers this year.' Now, I've got 10 homers. When I hit my last homer, I called her. She had watched the game. I said, 'Now you've got 10 homers, how about that?' She was crying. It's a crazy moment for me right now.\"\n\nDiamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said he kept Marte out of the lineup on Friday because he hadn't picked up a baseball in four days, but he's planning to start him on Saturday night.\n\n\"Hopefully getting back and playing as soon as possible,\" Lovullo said, \"will take his mind off some things.\"\n\nMore: Paul Goldschmidt earns his MVP moment\n\nBickley: Zack Godley a godsend for the Diamondbacks\n\nMore: Diamondbacks had reasons for not adding a starter\n\nReach Piecoro at (602) 444-8680 or nick.piecoro@arizonarepublic.com.

He bashed three home runs. Each came after a rain delay. One left the park, one almost hit the scoreboard and the last was a game-winning blast that saved the team from an awful collapse.\n\nIt was more than just the biggest victory of the season. It was the kind of high-profile game that will create awareness around Goldschmidt's candidacy, giving the quiet slugger his MVP moment.\n\nReally, it's about time. Goldschmidt has twice been runner-up for the prestigious award. He has no holes in his game. He's currently ranked as the sixth most effective baserunner in the National League. He's among the most underpaid, under-appreciated superstars on the planet.\n\nGoldschmidt doesn't help himself because he doesn't care about publicity or self-promotion. None of his home runs on Thursday elicited much reaction at all. When asked to describe the thrill of his game-winning blast, Goldschmidt was typically unimpressed with himself.\n\nHe responded by saying (A) he just wanted to get on base for his teammate, J.D. Martinez; (B) he called his victim, Wade Davis, one of the best pitchers in baseball; and (C) that he was just thankful to get the barrel of the bat on the baseball.\n\nThat's what makes him so awesome, even if it hurts his national profile. But the last thing the world needs is another shameless narcissist.\n\nA more telling tribute came from the Cubs following the game, when the organization issued a telling Tweet:\n\n\"We promise not to pitch to Paul Goldschmidt tomorrow.\"\n\nWe promise not to pitch to Paul Goldschmidt tomorrow. -- Chicago Cubs (@Cubs)\n\nAugust 4, 2017\n\nToo late for that. But just in time for Goldschmidt's candidacy and a sports market that could use another trophy.\n\nOur four major franchises have combined to play 121 seasons.

When he finally did, he flashed a smile befitting a pitcher who had just earned his first victory in the major leagues.\n\n\"It's honestly the greatest feeling in the world,\" Banda said. \"I'm not going to lie.\"\n\nBanda threw six strong innings, summoning composure when it was needed, and behind another big performance at the plate by Paul Goldschmidt, the Diamondbacks came away with a 2-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants.\n\nTheir performance at AT&T Park was notable for several reasons. For one, it marked their first three-game win streak in more than a month. It was their second win in as many days in a game started by an opposing left-hander, both of whom are former All-Stars.\n\nThere was an eighth-inning shutdown by erstwhile - and, perhaps, current - setup man David Hernandez, an outing that brought back memories of 2011.\n\nAnd, of course, there was Banda, a rookie making his second major-league start who, on a couple of occasions, looked to be on the verge of collapsing. In the fourth, after forcing home a run with his second walk of the inning, he suddenly found the strike zone and retired back-to-back hitters to avoid further damage.\n\nThen, two innings later, he looked rattled after hitting Giants slugger Brandon Belt with an off-target breaking ball but navigated his way through the inning without further incident.\n\n\"When things like that happen for a young pitcher, it's a great learning experience,\" manager Torey Lovullo said. \"He did his job.\"\n\nA day after Paul Goldschmidt's first career three-homer performance, AT&T Park managed to contain him, but he still found a way to do damage, this time doing it against Giants lefty Madison Bumgarner.\n\nGoldschmidt's triple into the right-center gap drove home A.J. Pollock with the game's first run in the fourth, and he delivered again two innings later, lining a long single off the left field wall to score David Peralta.\n\n\"The right guy in the right spot,\" Lovullo said. \"Every hitter looks for runs like that. He's locked in, doing his job and without him, we don't win this game.\"\n\nThat was all the scoring the Diamondbacks would get, and it was all they would need. Banda deserves most of the credit for that. His command was erratic for much of the night, but he threw just enough strikes to overcome it.\n\n\"Just trusting my stuff, trusting (catcher Chris) Iannetta back there,\" Banda said. \"We have a game plan, we went with it and we were successful as far as the outcome.\"\n\nAfter his 79 mph curveball hit off the right side of Belt's helmet to lead off the sixth, Banda squatted near the mound and held his glove over his face.\n\n\"It's never good to have that happen to anybody,\" Banda said. \"Unfortunately, it was a curveball and it got away from me and I really hope he comes back healthy and he's OK. To the Giants fans and everybody, it happens, but I hope for the best for him and I hope he has a speedy recovery if he is banged up a little bit.\"\n\nPrior to beating the Cubs in a game started by Jose Quintana, the Diamondbacks had lost five consecutive starts against lefties dating to early July. They still have some of the worst numbers in the league against left-handed pitching, but there is some reason to believe things are trending in the right direction.\n\nThey have a healthy Pollock. Goldschmidt is heating up. And newcomer J.D. Martinez represents a new weapon to combat opposing lefties.\n\nThat said, the struggles against left-handers did not appear to be a frontburner issue for the club's best player.\n\n\"We haven't (been good)?\" Goldschmidt asked. \"I didn't know.\"\n\nIncredibly, the Diamondbacks went from June 8 to July 4 without facing a lefty. But they've faced them in three of the past four starts - and might see another one next week when the Dodgers visit Chase Field.\n\n\"It comes in bunches, I hope, because we're probably going to face some coming up,\" Goldschmidt said. \"There's some good left-handed pitchers (in the National League) and we're going to have to beat them.\"\n\nMORE: Ketel Marte rejoins Diamondbacks after mother's death\n\nMORE: Robbie Ray back to baseball activities\n\nArizona Diamondbacks vs. San Francisco Giants Fullscreen Arizona Diamondbacks right fielder David Peralta, center, celebrates with teammates after a baseball game against the San Francisco Giants in San Francisco, Friday, Aug. 4, 2017.

Earlier, as the Sun Devils lined up, he told a young boy in the crowd to get ready, \"because I think you're about to see a touchdown.\" It didn't happen, but Likens wasn't let down, moving on to the next play with similar passion.\n\nASU receivers coach Rob Likens talking with N'Keal Harry after Tuesday's practice. pic.twitter.com/SzPZ5iLwSA -- Doug Haller (@DougHaller)\n\nAugust 1, 2017\n\nAnd now here he was on the sideline, talking to Harry in the same spirit. When it was time to sprint the width of the field, the position coach took off with Harry, running alongside him as he talked, across the field and back, delivering his message.\n\nEight days into preseason camp, the education continues for Harry, primed for a higher level after a Freshman All-America season. Ask teammates what they expect for him this year, and you will get responses of no limitations. Even now, four weeks before ASU's season opener, it's not a stretch to call Harry ASU's best offensive weapon, ahead of even senior running backs Kalen Ballage and Demario Richard.\n\nLikens' initial impression:\n\n\"One thing I noticed, it took, I don't know, maybe the first five minutes of practice in the spring,\" the first-year ASU receivers coach said. \"We have a saying in the coaching business: There's guys playing football, and then there's football players. That guy is just an all-out natural football player.\"\n\nPhotos: ASU receiver N'Keal Harry Fullscreen ASU fans cheer as N'Keal Harry scores a touchdown during a 2016 game against Utah.

Or perhaps ASU simply is trying to motivate him. He is one of two players on the roster not available for media interviews. For parts of last year, this was the case as well. Offensive coordinator Billy Napier said Harry had some \"growing pains\" in the winter and spring. Junior quarterback Manny Wilkins said Harry needs to mature and turn into an offensive leader.\n\nGraham said to look at it this way: In high school, a talent such as Harry (some ranked him as the nation's No. 1 receiver) didn't have to study football, he could just go out and get by on talent. In college, talent isn't always enough, even for someone like him.\n\nGET THE APP: Download ASU XTRA\n\n\"For a highly recruited guy, he really works hard,\" Graham said. \"The key is having the same application in the classroom, in learning football, in mastering his craft. Not having false steps, not having missed assignments. All those things.\"\n\nGraham continued:\n\n\"That's the challenge with a great player, to get them to understand where they've relied on their athleticism their whole career, you need to rely on your service, your character and your discipline. Those are the two percent that accomplish their goals. It's mental maturity. We're working on that and he's making strides.\"\n\nLast year, Harry had a freshman school-record 58 catches for 659 yards and five touchdowns. His 31-yard scoring run against Utah - which came on a broken play - was the highlight of a dismal season.\n\n\"He blew my expectations out of the water last year,\" redshirt-freshman cornerback and former Chandler High teammate Chase Lucas said.\n\nAnd the scary thing:\n\n\"He was not in shape the way he's in shape this year,\" Graham said. \"He struggled a little bit because it was his freshman year and he just didn't understand how fast it would be in the training.\"\n\nHarry is built like an NFL receiver. He stands 6-4, 216 pounds. He's strong. He's fast. He jumps well. But he has something else, too.\n\nCAMP TONTOZONA REPORT: WR Humphrey practices at CB\n\n\"What makes a great receiver is lateral movement. When you stick your foot in the ground, and you're over here,\" Likens said, shifting to his left. \"And being that big and weighing that much, it's not like he's a 195-pound kid, he's a train coming through there and he can go side-to-side with great lateral movement. That's what makes him special.\"\n\nAfter what Napier called an \"outstanding\" summer, Harry opened camp with three strong practices, but nagging injuries forced him off the field for a few days. Harry returned Tuesday and mostly lined up with the second team, receiving some first-team reps near the end of practice.\n\nThen he met with Likens for additional instruction.\n\n\"It's a process,\" Likens said. \"He had a tough childhood. I did too in some areas. And when you do that, you're not used to a great amount of accountability and what it's like. When another man speaks to you and holds you accountable, sometimes you can throw that wall up a little bit. That's why I'm proud of him. He's allowed me to come into his life and coach him. That's been a great thing for him and me.\"\n\nContact Doug Haller at 602-444-4949 or at doug.haller@arizonarepublic.com. Follow him at Twitter.com/DougHaller. Subscribe to the ASU Pick Six Podcast.

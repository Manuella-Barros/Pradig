Kim made a shock return to professional golf after 12 years away in February, after the American announced he had joined LIV Golf as a 2024 wildcard. Kim had been absent from the game and public eye for over a decade, with the 38-year-old enduring a number of injury issues in 2012 whilst playing on the PGA Tour. He has since opted to make his comeback, throwing himself into the centre of the saga between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf, which has seen the sport left torn in two over the past two years.

The LIV wildcard re-lit the fuse between the pair earlier this week, taking aim at Chamblee's lack of experience at the pinnacle of pro golf. \"Guys like that are what is wrong with golf. Brandel talks about stuff he knows nothing about,\" Kim told the Country Club Adjacent podcast. \"I saw an interview that Mark Lye did, Brandel and David Duval were on the Golf Channel. Brandel went on and on about what its like in the Ryder Cup room. How the ---- would you know? \u201cHere\u2019s David Duval who was No. 1 in the world and played in multiple Ryder Cup teams, has all these sorts of records, and won a million times. You are over-talking him about what it is like and what they are feeling. If they are talking about what it is like to drive to the Korn Ferry [Tour] event and miss the cut, we would call you Brandel!\u201d For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US. Kim and Chamblee first trade blows last month, after the the former hit out at the latter's comments claiming the PGA Tour siding with the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia (PIF) \"is the better end of the bargain\", despite being a previous PIF critic. \"Ramble Chamblee,\" Kim tweeted. \"@chambleebrandel ur such a ----- 4 beating on ur chest and basically saying never retreat & hypocritically retreat. It is well known this talentless fool is disliked by most people in the golf world. U still gonna cover golf if @livgolf_league is involved?\u201d LIV critic Chamblee didn't take long before he brutally hit back. \"This is about as inaccurate as a lot of Mickelson\u2019s drives and sadly ironical coming two tweets after you asked for advice on raising your daughter that you would refer to someone as a female body part in a juvenile attempt to denigrate them,\" he tweeted. \"As for your criticism of me saying a deal with the Saudis is the best deal for golf right now, it\u2019s something I\u2019ve said recently, because I don\u2019t think the Saudis are going to turn away from the game and they will continue to be a poaching threat and dilute the product of the PGA Tour. \"It\u2019s the sad reality of you and your brethren on the LIV tour willingly dealing with a murderous dictator for profit so that he can hide his atrocities, that golf has had to try to figure out how to mitigate the influence of MBS, PIF and LIV in the otherwise philanthropical and merit based world of professional golf.\" Chamblee later told Golf Channel that he later thought Kim's initial tweet was a 'bot', before realising it was Kim's personal account, who claimed was 'bought'. Unsurprisingly the LIV Golf star hit back, taking aim at Chamblee's wife, Bailey Mosier. \"Again an inaccurate statement by someone who would know about hanging around ball pits when he left his family and four kids for someone half his age @GolfChannel,\" Kim hit back.\"Very unprofessional. also I'm not for sale I chose to play @livgolf_league [because] it was best for me and my family.\"", "summary": "Anthony Kim and Brandel Chamblee have been involved in a war of words over social media in recent months, and the LIV Golf star has again taken aim at the Golf Channel analyst", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/golf/anthony-kim-liv-golf-chamblee-32989245", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32989198.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_MIRROR-UK-Anthony-Kim-reignites-feud-with-Brandel-Chamblee-after-taking-brutal-Ryder-Cup-dig.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:56:16", "author": "Joshua Lees,Joshua-Lees", "authors": ["Joshua Lees", "Joshua-Lees"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.062}

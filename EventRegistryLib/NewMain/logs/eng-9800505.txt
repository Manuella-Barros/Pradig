Without doubt, the Holy Spirit is also at work in them, responding by Mary's intercession,\" the letter said, saying the interreligious presence at the shrine \"should not be considered as a form of syncretism or mixing of religions.\"\n\n\"The Sanctuary is a place where the closeness of Mary, who welcomes everyone and demonstrates the love of the Lord to those who reflect on it, is manifested. Those who cannot receive the sacraments of the Catholic Church are not denied the consolation of the Mother of Jesus,\" the letter said.\n\nIn turning to the issue of , in his 1 August letter addressed to Bishop Eusebio Ramos Morales of Caguas, Fernand\u00e9z clarified that while the Marian spirituality and devotion de Jes\u00fas spread was legitimate, the belief among some that she was the Virgin Mary are false.\n\nA Puerto Rican missionary and catechist who lived in the late 1800s to early 1900s, de Jes\u00fas established the Marian Sanctuary of the Holy Mountain in the southern diocese of Caguas, and was known for promoting Marian spirituality and devotion, and for her work with the poor.\n\n\"It cannot be denied that the figure of Elenita de Jes\u00fas is of great value for the Church in Puerto Rico and should be considered as a stimulus to total dedication to the Kingdom of God,\" Fernand\u00e9z said in the letter.\n\nHowever, he also cautioned that those devoted to her must see her \"as a motivation to give themselves to God alone and avoid directing toward her the gestures of devotion that correspond to the Mother of Jesus Christ. It is better not to damage this treasure by distorting its original meaning.\"\n\nTo this end, Fernand\u00e9z gave a firm constat de non supernaturalitate, or \"not supernatural\" ruling, to the belief that de Jes\u00fas was the Virgin Mary.\n\n\"Any identification of Elenita with Our Lord Jesus Christ, the only Redeemer, or with the Virgin Mary, first cooperator in the work of her Son, must be totally avoided,\" he said, saying, \"Elenita de Jes\u00fas is not the Virgin Mary\".\n\nDe Jes\u00fas was, however, a holy woman who \"lived under the influence of the Holy Spirit, in charity and in proclaiming the Gospel, inspired by a deep love for our Heavenly Mother, the Virgin Mary,\" the letter said, saying de Jes\u00fas's life \"speaks to us of love for Jesus Christ and Mary, of the dignity of women, of generous dedication, commitment, austerity,\" and of the care and defence of the poor.\n\nIn the letter, Fernand\u00e9z said Pope Francis has a special affiliation for popular piety and for the Vailankanni shrine, and that for this reason, he has offered a special blessing to all pilgrims who will attend the 8 September celebrations there this year.\n\nHe recalled that Pope John Paul II in 2002 chose the shrine for the Church's celebration of the World Day of the Sick, saying, \"the same Virgin Mary who manifested herself at Lourdes also manifested herself in India as the Mother of Health\".\n\n\"It is not merely a matter of bodily health...but also one that touches the soul,\" Fernand\u00e9z said, saying, \"Contemplating the image of Mary we can all recognize the love of Jesus Christ that can heal our sadness, our anguish and our fears.\"", "source": {"uri": "catholicherald.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Catholic Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Highlighting various positive aspects of Genovese's works, specifically the relationship between the Trinity and mercy, the letter said that \"The Trinity is the source of mercy and its perfect realization.\"\n\n\"The marginalization of the Trinitarian mystery in the theological reflection and spirituality of past centuries is well known. In this sense, Mr. Genovese's spiritual experience is in line with the rediscovery of the centrality of the Most Holy Trinity for the faith and Christian life that occurred in the last century,\" the letter said.\n\nIt said the truth of the nature of the Trinity is \"expressed insistently\" in Genovese's writings, and that \"the Church is called to rediscover more and more in the gestures of Christ that infinite mercy of the Triune God, who in the writings of Mr. Genovese is called by the name 'Trinity Mercy'. This is the center of all the messages because, ultimately, it is the center of Revelation.\"\n\nHowever, the letter also offered some clarifications, specifically in Genovese's occasional use of the plural \"we\" to describe the incarnation of Jesus.\n\n\"Such expressions are not acceptable and their diffusion must be avoided, as they can easily be interpreted in a way contrary to the Catholic faith since only the Son became incarnate,\" the letter said, but insisted that this is not an error in Genovese's writings, as in subsequent texts \"we find clarifications that lead us towards the correct interpretation.\"\n\nThe letter also acknowledged the difficulty even for trained theologians to be precise in their language describing complex spiritual concepts such as the Trinity, saying the portions of text requiring clarification in Genovese's writings are not so much errors as a lack of precise terminology.\n\nAt the beginning of this month the Vatican also issued two more rulings, offering a clear word of caution on devotion surrounding a Puerto Rican laywoman named Elenita de Jes\u00fas, and approving devotion at the popular Marian shrine of Our Lady of Good Health in Vailankanni, India.\n\nA Puerto Rican missionary and catechist who lived in the late 1800s to early 1900s, de Jes\u00fas established the Marian Sanctuary of the Holy Mountain in the southern diocese of Caguas, and was known for promoting Marian spirituality and devotion, and for her work with the poor.\n\nIn an Aug. 1 letter addressed to Bishop Eusebio Ramos Morales of Caguas, Fernand\u00e9z clarified that while the Marian spirituality and devotion de Jes\u00fas spread was legitimate, the belief among some that she was the Virgin Mary are false.\n\n\"It cannot be denied that the figure of Elenita de Jes\u00fas is of great value for the Church in Puerto Rico and should be considered as a stimulus to total dedication to the Kingdom of God,\" Fernand\u00e9z said in the letter.\n\nHowever, he also cautioned that those devoted to her must see her \"as a motivation to give themselves to God alone and avoid directing toward her the gestures of devotion that correspond to the Mother of Jesus Christ. It is better not to damage this treasure by distorting its original meaning.\"\n\nTo this end, Fernand\u00e9z gave a firm constat de non supernaturalitate, or \"not supernatural\" ruling, to the belief that de Jes\u00fas was the Virgin Mary.\n\n\"Any identification of Elenita with Our Lord Jesus Christ, the only Redeemer, or with the Virgin Mary, first cooperator in the work of her Son, must be totally avoided,\" he said, saying, \"Elenita de Jes\u00fas is not the Virgin Mary.\"\n\nDe Jes\u00fas was, however, a holy woman who \"lived under the influence of the Holy Spirit, in charity and in proclaiming the Gospel, inspired by a deep love for our Heavenly Mother, the Virgin Mary,\" the letter said, saying de Jes\u00fas's life \"speaks to us of love for Jesus Christ and Mary, of the dignity of women, of generous dedication, commitment, austerity,\" and of the care and defense of the poor.\n\nOn Aug. 1 the DDF also published a letter to Bishop-elect Sagayaraj Thamburaj of Tanjore Diocese in India issuing a nulla osta to devotion at the Vailankanni Marian shrine, which is Asia's biggest Marian shrine and is visited by millions of pilgrims annually.\n\nTradition holds that apparitions of the Virgin Mary in Vailankanni date to the 16th century, when Mary allegedly appeared to a man carrying milk to a customer, asking the man to give the milk to the child she was holding.\n\nThe man agreed and gave her the milk, but discovered upon reaching his customer that the milk was still in the jar.\n\nA shrine to Our Lady of Health was later established in Vailankanni and on Sept. 8, large crowds are expected to come for the celebration of the feast of Our Lady of Health.\n\nIn their letter, signed by Fernand\u00e9z, the DDF noted that the shrine has also become a popular destination for non-Christians who seek spiritual graces.\n\n\"The many spiritual fruits that are produced at this Shrine make us recognize the constant action of the Holy Spirit in this place,\" the letter said, noting that many non-Christian pilgrims who come obtain special graces and even what they believe are miracles.\n\n\"Some of them are healed of their illnesses and many find peace and hope. Without doubt, the Holy Spirit is also at work in them, responding by Mary's intercession,\" the letter said, saying the interreligious presence at the shrine \"should not be considered as a form of syncretism or mixing of religions.\"\n\n\"The Sanctuary is a place where the closeness of Mary, who welcomes everyone and demonstrates the love of the Lord to those who reflect on it, is manifested. Those who cannot receive the sacraments of the Catholic Church are not denied the consolation of the Mother of Jesus,\" the letter said.\n\nFernand\u00e9z in the letter said Pope Francis has a special affiliation for popular piety and for the Vailankanni shrine, and that for this reason, he has offered a special blessing to all pilgrims who will attend the Sept. 8 celebrations there.\n\nHe recalled that Pope John Paul II in 2002 chose the shrine for the church's celebration of the World Day of the Sick, saying, \"the same Virgin Mary who manifested herself at Lourdes also manifested herself in India as the Mother of Health.\"\n\n\"It is not merely a matter of bodily health...but also one that touches the soul,\" Fernand\u00e9z said, saying, \"Contemplating the image of Mary we can all recognize the love of Jesus Christ that can heal our sadness, our anguish and our fears.\"\n\n\"If we pause before Mary, even in a brief moment of faith and love, her maternal gaze restores peace to us,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "cruxnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crux"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elise_ann_allen@cruxnow.com", "name": "Elise Ann Allen", "type": "author", "isAgency":

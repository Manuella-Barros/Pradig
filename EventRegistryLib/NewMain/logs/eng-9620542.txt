It can be paired with a 6-speed manual transmission or a 6-speed automatic transmission.\n\n1.5-litre TSI Engine: For those seeking a more spirited driving experience, the 1.5-litre TSI engine delivers 150 PS of power and 250 Nm of torque. This engine comes mated to a 6-speed manual transmission or a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission (DCT) for smoother gear shifts.\n\nQ: When did the Volkswagen Taigun and Virtus receive the standard 6 airbags update?\n\nA: The announcement regarding the standard six airbags for the Taigun and Virtus was made recently.\n\nQ: Are there any other safety features offered on the Taigun and Virtus besides the airbags?\n\nA: Yes, both models come equipped with additional safety features such as electronic stability control (ESC), hill hold assist, rear parking camera, and rear parking sensors.

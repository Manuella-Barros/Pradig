It's safe to say that social media is mourning the loss of the pair, with many left to wonder if there could be the possibility of some ex-islanders making a return for Casa Amor or later down the line.\n\nWhile nothing of the sort has been confirmed for Casa, we do have a complete line-up of new islanders and something tells us this is going to be quite the week of Love Island action.\n\nRead on for everything you need to know about the Casa Amor season 11 cast.\n\nThe full line-up of Casa Amor 2024 cast members for the summer is below:\n\nScroll on to find out more about the confirmed Casa Amor islanders below.\n\nHailing from Southampton, Hugo describes himself as \"massively driven\" and he's looking for someone he can have a laugh with and who doesn't take themselves too seriously. He already has his eye on Uma and Jess and is prepared to step on some toes to find love.\n\nSpeaking about what kind of islander he'll be, Hugo says: \"I'll be an honest Islander and I'm never afraid to be myself. I always take people's opinions on board but I'm not a yes man - I'm going in there to find love and prepared to step on toes to do so.\"\n\nJake from Essex isn't short on confidence and describes himself as \"quite a social butterfly\".\n\nHe says: \"I'm going to be quite keen, going for it. I'm quite loud and the one that likes to talk... I do like to have a chat. I'm going to be flirty, that's the game plan for me.\"\n\nHe's already got Matilda in his eyesight but says of his Love Island arrival: \"This whole experience is about trying to find someone that's got the banter and the personality that can match me and match my energy.\"\n\nWith over half a million followers on Instagram already, Moziah is entering Casa Amor to find a \"genuine connection with somebody\" and says he will be his \"best self\".\n\nSpeaking about what other islanders need to know about him, he says: \"When I see someone I want, I am going to go after them. I am not into love triangles. If your girl is my type, that is who I am going to pursue.\"\n\nAn interesting fact about Moziah is he has a brown belt in karate. But in terms of who he has his eyes on in the villa, he reveals: \"Grace is my type, the way she carries herself is very attractive to me.\n\n\"Uma is stunning and I think we would get on really well. Also, Mimii is a great girl.\"\n\nStevenage-based Blade is looking to come and shake things up in the villa and is looking for a \"Queen\" who is \"down to earth and up for a laugh\". He's not opposed to \"healthy competition\" from the boys and tries to adhere to bro code when he can.\n\nSpeaking about himself, he says: \"If your type is tall, dark and handsome, now is a good time to mention that I'm 6ft4 with a Jamaican/ Indian/ Scottish and Danish blend ... I'm the undisputed champion of giving the best hugs and I'm after someone who is up for adventure, seeing the world and living life to the fullest.\"\n\nThe Devon-based content creator and podcast host has just finished up at university and says that \"if you can talk economics and politics with me all day, you can talk me into bed.\"\n\nJoel admits that he has an ex-girlfriend named Grace that looks like Grace so has his eyes on her, as well as Uma.\n\nSpeaking about what kind of islander he'll likely be, Joel says: \"Hopefully quite a cheeky one. I'm quite impulsive. I speak before I think and clear up the mess afterwards... which is kind of funny. I'm going in to try and pull someone quickly, so you've got to be loose and straight to the point. It's a good time for me to go in.\"\n\nDescribing himself as a \"smooth talker and a smooth operator\", Reading-based Lionel is looking for the love of his life in Casa Amor.\n\nOn what he's looking for in a partner, he says: \"Non-negotiables are; a good sense of humour and the ability to flirt, good energy, and a good exchange of vibes. I want someone that's smart and isn't afraid of anything.\"\n\nAs for who he's going to be trying to get to know, Lionel reveals: \"Top three girls in no particular order, Mimii, Uma and Grace. Besides the fact that they're all very beautiful, in terms of personality, Mimii is more the reserved, chilled type. That matches me.\n\n\"And then Uma brings in that energy, she's very bubbly. That brings out the energised side of me. Grace is kind of a mix of the two. She's more on the reserved side. That's why I like her, as well as Mimii. They all seem cool and really nice.\"\n\nLondoner Diamant\u00e9 is upfront about the fact that she's in the villa for love and nothing else, admitting: \"I won't really be much of a girls' girl, otherwise I'd go make friends and I wouldn't be on Love Island.\"\n\nShe's not afraid to speak her mind and has blocked over 500 people in her life. She has her eyes on Wil, saying that she thinks \"he's waiting for me to arrive, he just doesn't know it yet.\"\n\nIn terms of what kind of islander she'll be, she says: \"I have so many different moods, I can't even describe to you what kind of person I am for starters.

I don't feel the need to whisper behind someone's back.\"\n\nGlasgow-born Lucy says she's planning to be \"honest and speak my mind but I'll definitely be someone that Islanders can come to for support.\"\n\nAdmitting that she's not afraid to pull the boys for chats, Lucy is interested in Ciaran and Wil but wants to \"assess the energy\".\n\nSpeaking about the things she looks for in a partner, Lucy says: \"They have got to be good looking but also need great banter. I like to wind my partner up and have some fun. I want someone who can be my best friend as well as my boyfriend.\"\n\nIt's set to be a reunion of sorts for Cardiff-born Ellie and Ciaran as Ellie admits that they have chatted in the past. She admits that she's \"looking forward to reconnecting with him in Casa Amor\", with the pair following each other on Instagram.\n\nWill she step on Nicole's toes in going after Ciaran? We'll have to wait and see but Ellie admits she does have a \"fiery personality. My friends would say I am a little chaotic.\"\n\nLondoner Jessica describes herself as \"funny, flirty, sassy and ready to find love\" and has her eyes on one man in particular: Ayo. Even though he has a connection with Mimii, Jessica admits she fancies Ayo \"so much\" but also thinks Wil \"seems like a catch\".\n\nSpeaking about what other islanders need to know about her, Jessica says: \"I don't take myself too seriously and am good at going with the flow, but I only have a short time in Casa Amor so I am ready to find the one.\"\n\nThe social media content creator and salon owner wants to couple up with Wil, saying that he seems \"kind and intelligent. He seems lovely.\"\n\nBut she may ruffle a couple of feathers, saying: \"I am going to be a very dramatic Islander, a very loud Islander and a very entertaining Islander.\"\n\nHailing from Manchester, Emma admits that she's travelled around the world, partied and \"been crazy\" but is now at the stage of her life where she's ready to find someone - and that person could very well be Joey Essex.\n\nEmma admits: \"I had a brief thing with Joey a few years ago. We've been friends for years and I would be open to reconnecting with Joey. We get on really well and we have a lot of mutual friends. I am also friends with Grace in Manchester, so it's a little bit awkward.\"\n\nLove Island continues on Sunday night at 9pm on ITV2 and ITVX.", "source": {"uri": "radiotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "morgan_cormack@radiotimes.com", "name": "Morgan Cormack", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Villa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_twist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plot twist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Essex"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Essex"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southampton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southampton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tall,_dark_and_handsome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tall, dark and handsome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Matilda", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Empress Matilda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_triangle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Love triangle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adventure film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wil"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wil"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITVX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ITVX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Essex", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joey Essex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_(gathering)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salon (gathering)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV2", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ITV2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2024/06/love-island-2024-2-6ce8baa.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693227", "eventUri": "eng-9693227", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5372549019607844, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

He's also part of the podcast All Gains No Game alongside his co-host Jacob Ward, with the two interviewing pretty iconic reality TV stars such as Aesha from Below Deck. He also appeared on an episode of Below Deck and let's just say he and his friends didn't exactly come across as the most well behaved... still if that means more drama in Casa Amor then bring it on!\n\nHe's a keen gym enthusiast and even offers one on one gym coaching, explaining how he used to feel \"skinny and insecure\" but that fitness helped him transform. He's had his OnlyFans account for just over two years and uploads \"once or twice a week with DMed photos regularly.\" His current subscription price is \u00a38.29 for 30 days of content.\n\nAn insider told The Sun: \"Joel set up the account a couple of years ago. There's nothing too saucy on there - it's mainly cheeky topless pics. Joel just completed a degree in international development and the OnlyFans account was to fund his way through university.

There's exes, situationships, conquests and affiliations.\"\n\nAhead of the Casa Amor craziness, The Sun speaks to body language expert Judi James, who says the \"biggest shock\" could actually be \"who does stay faithful\".\n\nShe says: \"Ronnie and Joey are like a Destiny's Child-ish tribute act already and a Casa flip-flop would be so much on the cards that Ronnie in particular might surprise us.\n\n\"But with Grealish's ex rumoured to be going in there, will footballer Ron be able to avoid trying to pick up this obvious trophy bombshell?\n\n\"While Joey only needs one more identical blonde beauty - after Grace Jackson and Jessy Potts - to complete the set.\n\n\"There are about three couples in there right now that will provide some real emotional shocks if they stray - they will - and at least two who will really shock if they go against type and remain faithful, which is a new twist this season.\n\n\"Another difference is that we usually see the girls behaving themselves in Casa but this season they will be like a hunting pack as most will either be out for revenge on their guys or they've been knocked back all season and desperate to crack on with anything, even one of the daybeds if necessary!\"\n\nHere Judi gives her verdict on who is likely to 'cheat' in Casa Amor including one star who could be \"running for the hills\" and into the arms of a bombshell due to his beau's bizarre body language.\n\nWhile recruitment consultant Matilda and salesman Sean appear to be an established Love Island couple, Judi puts them \"high on my list of Casa straying\".\n\nShe says: \"Matilda's body language suggests she's getting the 'ick' from Sean, while Sean's previous inability to pull has left him showing hints of arrogance and ruthlessness behind the 'sweet' act.\n\n\"His ego took such a bruising in the early weeks that he looks desperate to prove he's an alpha mover.\n\n\"Which means he's open to being snaffled in Casa as long as any bombshell can stomach his constant sweet-based patter.\"\n\nShe says: \"Jess now has skin in the game again thanks to the late latching onto Trey.\n\n\"She snaffled him in the way only she knows how but her dominatrix-style body language with him - pointing to her cheek saying 'You can kiss me here' or telling him they'd have nice babies during their first chat - might have him running for the hills.\n\n\"Fans of love rival Harriett will be grabbing the popcorn to watch her instant Karma if he does.\n\n\"Although she could also devour a new bombshell guy just to prove she can.\"\n\nSplit rating: 9/10\n\nThe TOWIE hunk could be set to cause trouble in Casa Amor - but Judi hopes there may be a twist in the tale.\n\nShe says: \"Now we know Joey isn't going for the popularity prize it's obvious he's fighting for camera time and the starring role in plotlines which means he will want to be in the spotlight in Casa.\n\n\"They must have lined up a new blonde ex for him in there or maybe a few just to confuse him.\n\n\"There is a high likelihood he will cheat although hopefully it will be her cheating on him.\"\n\nSplit rating: 10/10\n\nDespite Harriet fancying Ronnie from day one, he has previously coupled up with Jess White and Tiffany Leighton.\n\nJudi says he shows \"no remorse\" for his actions so far but she suspects there may be a surprise in store for fans.\n\nShe says: \"If ever there was a couple primed and ready for Casa dramas it's these two.\n\n\"Ronnie doesn't give a flying fig about being seen to be playing the field and has been in one love triangle after the other.\n\n\"He shows no signs of guilt while appearing to be like catnip to the likes of Harriett and Jess.\n\n\"His lack of guilt or remorse plus his constantly roving eye should make him a prime target for the Casa bombshells but it would be a much stronger plot line if he just happened to be faithful to poor 'fake tears' Harriett.\n\n\"Which is why I'm bucking the trend and giving them low odds.\n\n\"The fans are beginning to warm to Harriett and this could actually be the 'love' story happy ending everyone is craving right now.\n\n\"If Ronnie comes back faithful there won't be a dry eye in the villa!\"\n\nSplit rating: 5/10\n\nWhile mental health nurse Mimii and footballer Ayo remain an \"established\" couple in the villa, Judi says they \"could sadly provide the one real Casa shocker\".\n\nShe explains: \"They profess to be happy but Mimii's body language of 'love' is not looking convincing recently.\n\n\"When Ayo straddled her and kissed her during the heart rate challenge she seemed to be backing away and she has become quieter and more subdued in the villa despite allegedly being in a close relationship.\n\n\"They should be established but Mimii's body language is hinting there's something wrong...

But who is he? Well what we know, is that he's a graduate in International Development and funded his university degree by creating an OnlyFans account - yes that's right. But this is not Joel's first experience of reality TV, as he has also appeared on Below Deck.\n\nSpeaking of his OnlyFans background, a close pal of Joel told The Sun: \"There's nothing too saucy on there - it's mainly cheeky topless pics. Joel just completed a degree in international development and the OnlyFans account was to fund his way through university. A lot of people might judge OnlyFans creators, but it's actually a clever way to make money if you're studying.\"\n\nApart from modelling on the racy social media platform, the star also co-hosts a podcast, titled All Gains No Game, with pal Jacob Ward. The pair have interviewed the likes of Aesha Scott from Below Deck. Fans of Love Island can also find Joel on Instagram and boasts a following of 118,000 people. A lot of his content is of him working out and hiking, which explains his toned physique. Joel is set to enter Casa Amor on Sunday June 30.\n\nElsewhere, earlier this week viewers witnessed an explosive scene between Grace Jackson and her beau Joey Essex. When Grace first arrived at the villa, the pair couldn't keep their hands off each other but their loyalty to one another was put to the test as a new bombshell Konnor Ewudzi picked Grace at the recoupling. And this left Joey seething as he had only rekindled his romance with Grace.\n\nBut just after the heart-rate challenge, Harriett received a text message asking joey to head out of the villa as another islander was waiting to date him. And instead of staying silent, Grace struggled to hold in her frustration and blurted out \"boring!\", as Joey also appeared peeved at the twist.\n\nBut it wasn't that long ago that Grace and Joey came under fire over Samantha Kenny's shock departure. Samantha had been coupled with Joey before Grace arrived but she soon noticed Joey's attention had moved on to Grace, which left the reality TV star devastated. And she blamed Joey for how he had handled the situation.\n\nA few days later, Samantha was the latest star to exit the villa and her departure was met with tears from some of the islanders who had grown close to the Liverpool born make-up artist. Soon after her exit, she posted a message on social media, showing an emotional reunion with her family.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok,Snapchat,Instagram,Twitter,Facebook,YouTubeandThreads", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lucretia_munro@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Lucretia Munro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnlyFans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OnlyFans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Kirby", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jack Kirby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Villa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Essex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joey Essex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Below_Deck", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Below Deck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_degree", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academic degree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SMS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make-up_artist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make-up artist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33135476.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Who-is-Love-Islands-new-Casa-Amor-arrival-Joel-Kirby.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693227", "eventUri": "eng-9693227", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 1488, "textEnd": 1495}], "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Fans of the ITV2 dating show are convinced another dumping is on the cards, with one unfortunate couple set to pack their bags and jet home.\n\nThe Casa Amor line-up has been unveiled, with six girls and six boys set to arrive on Love Island. However, there are currently seven couples in the villa, meaning there isn't a bombshell for everyone.\n\nFans think this means two Islanders are set to be axed ahead of Casa Amor beginning. Taking to X, one person said: \"There's six Casa girls and six boys... that means one more couple have to leave the villa before Casa starts.\"\n\nA second person wrote: \"Just saw the casa line up for #loveIsland. There is six bombshells but there are currently seven couples in the villa. I think another couple might be getting dumped tomorrow before casa begins.\"\n\nThe speculation comes after Ronnie Vint and Harriet Blackmore, who were both part of the original Love Island line-up, were dumped from the island. The couple received the least amount of votes from the public, who were asked to vote to save their favourite couple.\n\nRonnie, 27, and Harriet, 24, wound up in the bottom three with Grace and Konnor, and Uma and Wil. After it was announced Ronnie and Harriet would be leaving the villa, Harriet wondered if their on-off romance had put viewers off from voting for them.\n\nAs their stunned co-stars sat in silence, Ronnie said he'd \"had a blinder\" in the villa. However, Harriet said she was \"so confused\" and proceeded to say the exit was \"down to Ronnie's behaviour\".\n\nCasa Amor is set to begin on Sunday, 30 June with the Islanders being split up. Usually, the girls will head off to Casa Amor with the boys remaining at the main villa.\n\nSix new girls will join the boys, while six boys will head off to live with the girls. The Islanders have no contact with one another, meaning they are unaware if their partner is getting to know someone new. At the end of the twist, they must decide whether to recouple with one of the new bombshells or remain with their current partner - who they won't have seen for several days.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

The pool in Portsmouth is not giving. I've tried dating and speaking to people on social media and it just hasn't been successful. Applying was a spontaneous thing, I didn't expect to get here!\n\nWHAT WILL YOU BRING TO THE VILLA? My girls are my rocks and I'm theirs, so I'll be a good friend as well as going in there to find a man. I like dressing up, so I'll bring style, and I'd like to think I'm quite funny so I'll make people laugh. Bringing honesty as well - I'm good at picking up on people's personality traits and side-eyeing those who might be liars.\n\nNAME: Sean Stone\n\nAGE: 24\n\nFROM: Hertford\n\nOCCUPATION: Sweets Salesman\n\nWHY LOVE ISLAND? I've always been one for relationships, and when you have found someone you want to be with it's the best feeling. Now is the perfect time, the one thing that is missing is my soulmate.\n\nHOW WOULD FRIENDS/FAMILY DESCRIBE YOU? Very loving, caring and thoughtful. I'm the kind of guy that, if you broke down on the motorway and needed your tyre changed, I'd be there at any time of night.\n\nNAME: Ayo Odukoya\n\nAGE: 25\n\nFROM: Canning Town\n\nOCCUPATION: Model\n\nWHAT WILL YOU BRING TO THE VILLA? I think I'd bring excitement and joy. I think people would have someone to come to and talk to and feel comfortable being around or to have a laugh with. I think I'm somebody everyone would take to.\n\nWHY SHOULD SOMEBODY DATE YOU? I feel like the way I carry myself is very respectful and I think people take to that and once you show who you are to somebody you get it back tenfold. The way I am gives off a good enough energy for people to feel comfortable around me.\n\nNAME: Nicole Samuel\n\nAGE: 24\n\nFROM: Aberdare, Wales\n\nOCCUPATION: Accounts Manager\n\nWHY ARE YOU SINGLE? I've been enjoying single life and the attention of different boys, it's fun. I've enjoyed being able to go on holiday with the girls and not having to worry about someone back home. All the girls are there texting in their room and I'm out till 4 in the morning living my best life.\n\nWHAT IS SOMETHING NOT MANY PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT YOU?

I was a professional street dancer.\n\nNAME: Jess White\n\nAGE: 25\n\nFROM: Stockport\n\nOCCUPATION: Retail Manager\n\nWHY ARE YOU SINGLE? I don't underestimate the fact that I'm hard work. I know what I want, and I'm not easily pleased. When you're a loud, outgoing woman, sometimes it can intimidate men - men don't always want that.\n\nWHAT'S YOUR TYPE ON PAPER? I love a set of white Turkey teeth but a good set of Turkey teeth. I would say, personality traits: you have to be family orientated. You have to be tall, you can't be shorter than me, I can't be having to question whether I can wear heels around you and what height of heels I can wear. If you're vertically challenged, it's not for me.\n\nNAME: Ciaran Davies\n\nAGE: 21\n\nFROM: Pencoed, South Wales\n\nOCCUPATION: Surveyor\n\nWHAT'S YOUR TYPE ON PAPER? Obviously looks but humour is a big thing for me, I'm a bit of a wind up so I want a girl who can give it back. Loyalty is another one for me: I think that's the most important thing to look for in a relationship.\n\nWHAT IS SOMETHING NOT MANY PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT YOU? When I was in Malia on a boys holiday I pretended to be Liam Reardon from series 7 to get into a club because they wouldn't let us in.

As for the rest of the boys and girls, will they stick with their current flames or move on in just a matter of days?\n\nHere's what we know about the 12 incoming contestants:\n\nMeet the girls\n\n21-year-old Diamant\u00e9 Laiva is a natural beauty business owner living in London.\n\nAhead of her stint in the villa, she said: 'I have so many different moods, I can't even describe to you what kind of person I am for starters. If I have a problem with something, whoever it is, I'll tell them right then and there. I don't feel the need to whisper behind someone's back.'\n\nDiamant\u00e9 has her sights set on Wil, adding that Joey is growing on her and there's just something about Ciaran that takes her fancy.\n\nLucy Graybill, from Glasgow, is a 26-year-old retail store manager.\n\n'I'm not afraid to pull the boys,' the feisty bombshell admitted. 'We are all there for the same reasons but I will go about it in a respectful way, staying true to myself.'\n\nThe 26-year-old revealed that Wil and Ciaran are her 'frontrunners' at the moment, but that could all change...\n\n22-year-old Ellie Jackson, who hails from Cardiff, works as a senior executive assistant. She revealed she's looking for someone who is 'family oriented', adding that 'loyalty is number one' for her.\n\n'I can guarantee I will make everyone in the Villa laugh but at the same time, I do have a fiery personality. My friends would say I am a little chaotic.'\n\nJessica Spencer, 25, is a fashion stylist living in London.\n\n'I'm funny, flirty, sassy and ready to find love,' she said, adding: 'I don't take myself too seriously and am good at going with the flow, but I only have a short time in Casa Amor so I am ready to find the one.'\n\nJessica has eyes for Ayo, despite his connection with Mimii, gushing that she fancies him 'so much'.\n\nRuby Dale is a 23-year-old social media content creator living in Surrey. She insisted: 'I am going to be a very dramatic Islander, a very loud Islander and a very entertaining Islander.'\n\nRuby has an eye for Wil, as he 'seems kind and intelligent'.\n\n30-year-old Emma Milton, who works as a fashion content creator in Manchester, has a history with Joey.\n\nShe explained: 'I had a brief thing with Joey a few years ago. We've been friends for years and I would be open to reconnecting with Joey. We get on really well and we have a lot of mutual friends. I am also friends with Grace in Manchester, so it's a little bit awkward.'\n\nWill sparks fly between them once more when they come face to face in Casa Amor?\n\nMeet the boys\n\n24-year-old Hugo Godfroy is an electrician from Southampton.\n\nHe claimed: 'I'll be an honest Islander and I'm never afraid to be myself. I always take people's opinions on board but I'm not a yes man - I'm going in there to find love and prepared to step on toes to do so.'\n\nHugo likes the way Uma 'carries herself' but Jess is also his type on paper.\n\nAnother electrician! Jake Spivey's a 25-year-old from Essex.\n\n'This whole [Love Island] experience is about trying to find someone that's got the banter and the personality that can match me and match my energy,' he said. 'Obviously, they're all going to be good looking girls. If I can get a vibe with someone that's what I'm going for.'\n\nAs for who he's got an eye on, Jake admitted: 'Matilda, she's my frontrunner. She's my type to a tee. She said she likes muscles, tan, teeth... I thought, cool, she seems like a good ball of fun. I'm going to go for her. Grace is attractive as well.'\n\n29-year-old Moziah Pinder works as a personal trainer in Brighton.\n\n'When I see someone I want, I am going to go after them,' he admitted. 'I am not into love triangles. If your girl is my type, that is who I am going to pursue.'\n\nWho does he want to pursue though? Moziah said: 'Grace is my type, the way she carries herself is very attractive to me. Uma is stunning and I think we would get on really well. Also, Mimii is a great girl.'\n\nBlade Siddiqi, 29, works as a Butler in the Buff in Stevenage.\n\n'First and foremost, I'm looking to come and shake things up,' he said. Big talk! 'I want to bring the energy, get amongst it and really consider myself as someone who is looking for something genuine moving forward.'\n\n'I want a queen by my side. I'm hoping to find that in the Villa with someone who is down to earth and up for a laugh.'\n\n22-year-old Joel Kirby is a post-grad and content creator from Devon.\n\nWhen asked what kind of Islander he's going to be, he claimed: 'Hopefully quite a cheeky one. I'm quite impulsive. I speak before I think and clear up the mess afterwards... which is kind of funny.'\n\n'I'm going in to try and pull someone quickly, so you've got to be loose and straight to the point. It's a good time for me to go in.'\n\n24-year-old Lionel Awudu is a financial advisor from Reading. 'I'm trying to find the love of my life, who can appreciate me and I can appreciate them,' he admitted. We wish him well!\n\n'There's no better place than Love Island. I've tried traditional dating methods, but it hasn't really worked out for me. In life I feel like it's better to try something new.'", "source": {"uri": "evoke.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "EVOKE.ie"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emma_costigan@evoke.ie", "name": "Emma Costigan",

Meet the full new cast of Casa Amor set to cause carnage on Love Island", "body": "There's nothing like the introduction of Casa Amor to really spice Love Island up, and if the new cast is anything to go by then this could be the most explosive Casa we've seen so far. There are going to be six new girls and guys entering the villa, and all of them already have their eyes on at least one or two people in the main villa.\n\nIn fact, one of the girls already has a history with Joey Essex but is also friends with Grace outside the villa, so that's sure to create some tension. But let's get down to what we all care about, and meet the full new cast of Casa Amor who are set to cause absolute carnage in the Love Island villa.\n\nThe first of the new Casa Amor cast to be joining Love Island is 24 year old electrician, Hugo Godfrey from Southampton. He admitted the type of Islander he thinks he'll be, revealing: \"I'll be an honest Islander and I'm never afraid to be myself. I always take people's opinions on board but I'm not a yes man - I'm going in there to find love and prepared to step on toes to do so.\"\n\nAs for the number one thing he looks for in a partner it's a girl who he can have a laugh with. And it looks like he already has his eye on one girl in the villa as he admitted he really likes Uma: \"I think she carries herself well and seems very respectful. The same with Jess as my type is brunette.\"\n\nJake is 25 and currently lives in Essex as an electrician as well. As for the type of Islander he'll be, he admitted: \"Very direct. I'm very, very confident. I'm quite a social butterfly, I mingle with everyone and throw myself in at the deep end. I'm not going to be holding back or be afraid to go in there and go for what I want. I'm going to be quite keen, going for it. I'm quite loud and the one that likes to talk... I do like to have a chat. I'm going to be flirty, that's the game plan for me. \"\n\nHe's looking for someone who will be able to match his banter and personality, and reckons Matila could be the one for him. He revealed: \"Matilda, she's my frontrunner. She's my type to a tee. She said she likes muscles, tan, teeth... I thought, cool, she seems like a good ball of fun. I'm going to go for her. Grace is attractive as well.\"\n\nMoziah is 29 and is a personal trainer from Brighton. He's an \"observant person\" and wants to find a \"genuine connection\" with one of the other Love Island cast members in Casa Amor. He wants his other Islander to know: \"When I see someone I want, I am going to go after them. I am not into love triangles. If your girl is my type, that is who I am going to pursue.\"\n\nAs for what he's looking for in a partner he's after \"someone I can trust 100% and be vulnerable with. If I can find someone I can be vulnerable with and honest with that for me is a person I want to be committed to and locked in with.\" And he's already got his eyes on Grace, explaining that the ways she carries herself is \"very attractive.\"\n\nBlake is 29 and currently lives in Stevenage whilst being a butler in the buff. He describes himself as: \"First and foremost, I'm looking to come and shake things up. I want to bring the energy, get amongst it and really consider myself as someone who is looking for something genuine moving forward. I want a queen by my side. I'm hoping to find that in the villa with someone who is down to earth and up for a laugh.\"\n\nHe's looking for a girl who would make him \"hang up his bow tie for good\" and already has his eye on Uma, Grace and Matilda. He revealed: \"Matilda she seems really fun, kind, bubbly, she's come in with great energy, a great figure, great pair of eyes. Straight away she's getting the nod from me. I like someone who is down-to-earth. In a world where egos are regularly inflated, being down-to-earth is great.\n\n\"Uma is absolutely stunning. I love her eyes. She's got a great figure on her to be honest. I like the way she carries herself, she's upfront and direct. She's not afraid to give guys a bit of a run for her money and that's a turn on in my opinion. We'd bounce off of each other. Grace is stunning; she is the spitting image of my ex-girlfriend. She's an absolute worldie and seems really caring and considerate. She does her best to keep other people's feelings in mind and seems like a fun girl and quite mature as well.\"\n\n22 year old Joe Kirby is another new Casa Amor cast member who will be joining the girls at the main Love Island villa, he currently lives in Devon and is a post-grad and content creator. He thinks of himself as \"cheeky\" and admits that he's\"impulsive and speaks before he thinks.\" I'm sure that won't cause any problems whatsoever...\n\nThe number one thing he looks for in a partner is a girl who doesn't take herself too seriously and has a sense of humour. The girls he's currently interested in the villa are Uma and Grace. He admitted: \"Uma seems really sound, I feel like we'd get on. Grace, she looks like my ex-girlfriend who was also called Grace.\" I'm sorry but why do all these men seem so hung up on their exes?\n\nLionel is 24 and lives in Reading as a financial advisor. He's appearing on Love Island because: \"I'm trying to find the love of my life, who can appreciate me and I can appreciate them. There's no better place than Love Island. I've tried traditional dating methods, but it hasn't really worked out for me. In life, I feel like it's better to try something new.\"\n\nThe most important thing he's looking for in a partner is \"a good sense of humour and the ability to flirt, good energy, and a good exchange of vibes. I want someone that's smart and isn't afraid of anything.\"\n\nThe top three girls he's interested in are Mimii, Uma and Grace. He explained: \"Besides the fact that they're all very beautiful, in terms of personality, Mimii is more the reserved, chilled type. That matches me. And then Uma brings in that energy, she's very bubbly. That brings out the energised side of me. Grace is kind of a mix of the two. She's more on the reserved side. That's why I like her, as well as Mimii. They all seem cool and really nice.\"\n\n21 year old Diamant\u00e9 lives in London and has her own natural beauty business. As for the kind of Islander she's going to be, she admitted: \"I have so many different moods, I can't even describe to you what kind of person I am for starters. If I have a problem with something, whoever it is, I'll tell them right then and there. I don't feel the need to whisper behind someone's back.\" She also revealed she's not really going to be \"much of a girls' girl, otherwise I'd go make friends and I wouldn't be on Love Island.\"\n\nAs for what she's looking for in a partner: \"He has to be a real man, not just a boy in a man's body, he should handle things like a man should. I like a man who likes to take control over the relationship, but not too much. A mature man.\"\n\nShe currently has her eye on Wil, saying: \"He gives that energy like he's got something to him. He's not opened up yet. I feel like he's waiting for me to arrive, he just doesn't know it yet. So he's been reserving himself. But I do like them a bit reserved. I don't like a man who's too over excited and 'talk, talk, talk' - it gives me the ick. Joey has started to grow on me... Ciaran does take my fancy as well, we're similar age and he is quite mature for his age and I like a man with an accent.\"\n\nLucy is 26 and lives in Glasgow as a retail store manager. She thinks she'll be the type of Islander who is \"always honest and speak my mind but I'll definitely be someone that Islanders can come to for support.\"\n\nHer future partner \"has to be good looking but also needs great banter. I want someone who can be my best friend as well as my boyfriend.\" As for who her future boyfriend could be, it looks like Ciaran and Wil are the two frontrunners at the moment. She also needs a \"boy who can park my car for me! If you're good behind the wheel you're in with a chance.\"\n\nEllis is 22 and lives in Cardiff as a senior executive assistant. She thinks she'll be the type of Islander who: \"Will make everyone in the villa laugh but at the same time, I do have a fiery personality. My friends would say I am a little chaotic.\"\n\nHer partner being loyal and family oriented is massively important to her and it turns out she's already chatted to Ciaran in the past and is \"looking forward to reconnecting with him in Casa Amor.\" Sounds like some serious drama to me.\n\n25 year old Jessica works as a fashion stylist and currently lives in London. She describes herself as \"funny, flirty, sassy and ready to find love.\" She wants her future partner to have \"good communication and honesty. They are both incredibly important traits to me.\" She's interested in getting to know Ayo \"despite his connection with Mimii. I fancy Ayo so much. Wil also seems like a catch and someone I want to explore a connection with.\"\n\nRuby is 23 and lives on Surret as a social media content creator. She describes herself as very \"dramatic, loud and entertaining.\" She wants her other Love Island and Casa Amor cast members to know that she \"always gets what I want.\" The only thing she's looking for in a partner is a man with \"a brain\" and wants to couple up with Wil as he seems \"kind, intelligent and lovely.\"\n\nFinally, we have Emma who is 30 from Manchester and is a fashion content creator. She thinks her confidence makes her a great catch and says her friends think she has an aura about her.\n\nThe number one thing she's looking for in a partner is a boy who is \"secure in themselves and knows who they are, there is nothing more attractive to me.\" It turns out she already has a history with Joey Essex and would be open to reconnecting with him, but she's also friends with grace outside the villa.

The hit Casa Amor villa will see a dozen newbies enter in an attempt to steal the hearts of one of its existing contestants.\n\nThe current couples will be split up as the temptation of meeting someone new has the potential to tear them away from one another. And one of the six new male contestants on the scene is Devon's very own Joel Kirby.\n\nAt 22-years-old, Joel has already amassed a huge social media following of more than 120,000 followers. The fitness content creator and postgraduate student hails from the Braunton area in North Devon and shares his life with his fans.\n\nREAD MORE: Beautiful Devon park with glorious lake hides secret past\n\nREAD MORE: Grieving Devon family's 'perfect' tribute to beloved dog\n\nJoel regularly posts revealing snaps of his svelte body and workout routines to Instagram, including workouts across various beaches in Devon and some of his travels. He also hosts his podcast called All Gains No Game.\n\nA source told the Mail Online he also has an Only Fans account he set up to \"fund his way through university\". But they say no steamy snaps are on there, mostly topless shots.\n\nJoin DevonLive on WhatsApp to get the news first\n\nJoining him are five other men hoping to find love and secure a place on Love Island once their stint in the divisive Casa Amor comes to an end. They include Blade, 29, from Stevenage, Hugo, 24, from Southampton and Jake, 25, from Essex. Lionel, aged 24 from Reading will also be joining them.\n\nSix new women will also be in the mix. Diamant\u00e9, 21, from London, Ellie, 22, from Cardiff, Emma, 30, from Manchester, Jessica, 25, from London and Lucy, 26 from Glasgow.\n\nCasa Amor is always a huge hit with fans as it causes chaos when the boys and girls are split up and temptation is put in their way.

It's a good time for me to go in.\n\nWhat do the other Islanders need to know about you?\n\nI'm 100% just going in to get what I want and go for it.\n\nWhat's the number one thing you look for in a partner?\n\nHaving a sense of humour and being funny. I don't like a girl that takes anything or themselves too seriously. I need to have a joke with you. And I like intelligence. If there's nothing in the head then we won't get along. That won't interest me.\n\nWho do you have your eye on in the Villa?\n\nUma seems really sound, I feel like we'd get on. Grace, she looks like my ex-girlfriend who was also called Grace.\n\nTell us something you'd put on your dating profile\n\nI've just finished my degree, so if you can talk economics and politics with me all day, you can talk me into bed.\n\nLionel Awudu, 24, financial advisor from Reading\n\nWhat kind of Islander are you going to be?\n\nI'm trying to find the love of my life, who can appreciate me and I can appreciate them. There's no better place than Love Island. I've tried traditional dating methods, but it hasn't really worked out for me. In life I feel like it's better to try something new.\n\nWhat do the other Islanders need to know about you?\n\nI'll bring confidence to the Villa, good energy and good vibes. I love flirting. Just being very direct in what I want and who I want. I won't be afraid to step on people's toes and do my own thing. One day they could be in your bed, the next day they could be in mine...\n\nWhat's the number one thing you look for in a partner?\n\nNon-negotiables are; a good sense of humour and the ability to flirt, good energy, and a good exchange of vibes. I want someone that's smart and isn't afraid of anything.\n\nWho do you have your eye on in the Villa?\n\nTop three girls in no particular order, Mimii, Uma and Grace. Besides the fact that they're all very beautiful, in terms of personality, Mimii is more the reserved, chilled type. That matches me. And then Uma brings in that energy, she's very bubbly. That brings out the energised side of me. Grace is kind of a mix of the two. She's more on the reserved side. That's why I like her, as well as Mimii. They all seem cool and really nice.\n\nTell us something you'd put on your dating profile\n\nI'm a smooth talker and a smooth operator.\n\nDiamant\u00e9 Laiva, 21, natural beauty business owner from London\n\nWhat kind of Islander are you going to be?\n\nI have so many different moods, I can't even describe to you what kind of person I am for starters. If I have a problem with something, whoever it is, I'll tell them right then and there. I don't feel the need to whisper behind someone's back.\n\nWhat do the other Islanders need to know about you?\n\nI'm straightforward, I plan to be very flirty, at the end of the day, it's Love Island! I won't really be much of a girls' girl, otherwise I'd go make friends and I wouldn't be on Love Island.\n\nWhat's the number one thing you look for in a partner?\n\nHe has to be a real man, not just a boy in a man's body, he should handle things like a man should. I like a man who likes to take control over the relationship, but not too much. A mature man.\n\nWho do you have your eye on in the Villa?\n\nWil; he gives that energy like he's got something to him. He's not opened up yet. I feel like he's waiting for me to arrive, he just doesn't know it yet. So he's been reserving himself. But I do like them a bit reserved. I don't like a man who's too over excited and 'talk, talk, talk' - it gives me the ick. Joey has started to grow on me... Ciaran does take my fancy as well, we're similar age and he is quite mature for his age and I like a man with an accent.\n\nTell us something you'd put on your dating profile\n\nIf you give me the ick once, I'm blocking you. Without warning as well. I reached the limit of blocking people...over 500 combined I think.\n\nLucy Graybill, 26, retail manager from Glasgow\n\nWhat kind of Islander are you going to be?\n\nI am always honest and speak my mind but I'll definitely be someone that Islanders can come to for support.\n\nWhat do the other Islanders need to know about you?\n\nI'm not afraid to pull the boys. We are all there for the same reasons but I will go about it in a respectful way, staying true to myself.\n\nWhat's the number one thing you look for in a partner?\n\nThey have got to be good looking but also need great banter. I like to wind my partner up and have some fun. I want someone who can be my best friend as well as my boyfriend.\n\nWho do you have your eye on in the Villa?\n\nCiaran and Wil are both my front runners at the moment so I am looking forward to going in there, getting to know them and assess the energy. Hopefully I can swoop in at the right time.\n\nTell us something you'd put on your dating profile\n\nI need a boy who can park my car for me! If you're good behind the wheel you're in with a chance.\n\nMoziah Pinder, 29, fitness trainer from Brighton\n\nWhat kind of Islander are you going to be?\n\nI am an observant person and here to find a genuine connection with somebody - I will be my best self in Casa Amor.\n\nWhat do the other Islanders need to know about you?\n\nWhen I see someone I want, I am going to go after them. I am not into love triangles. If your girl is my type, that is who I am going to pursue.\n\nWhat's the number one thing you look for in a partner?\n\nSomeone I can trust 100% and be vulnerable with. If I can find someone I can be vulnerable with and honest with that for me is a person I want to be committed to and locked in with.\n\nWho do you have your eye on in the Villa?\n\nGrace is my type, the way she carries herself is very attractive to me. Uma is stunning and I think we would get on really well. Also, Mimii is a great girl.\n\nTell us something you'd put on your dating profile\n\nI am a brown belt in Karate. Not many people know that, but it's one of my hidden talents.\n\nEllie Jackson, 22, senior executive assistant from Cardiff\n\nWhat kind of Islander are you going to be?\n\nI can guarantee I will make everyone in the Villa laugh but at the same time, I do have a fiery personality. My friends would say I am a little chaotic.\n\nWhat do the other Islanders need to know about you?\n\nThey need to know that I have zero filter and am not afraid to call someone out if I do not agree with something. I am a little bubble of weirdness!\n\nWhat's the number one thing you look for in a partner?\n\nLoyalty is number one, but also being family oriented is special to me.\n\nWho do you have your eye on in the Villa?\n\nI have chatted to Ciaran in the past and am looking forward to reconnecting with him in Casa Amor. Wil and Sean also seem like great guys, so I would be up for getting to know them both a little better.\n\nTell us something you'd put on your dating profile\n\nI love a boy who can cook and has a dog. I love a wholesome, down to earth boy.\n\nJessica Spencer, 25, fashion stylist from London\n\nWhat kind of Islander are you going to be?\n\nI'm funny, flirty, sassy and ready to find love.\n\nWhat do the other Islanders need to know about you?\n\nI don't take myself too seriously and am good at going with the flow, but I only have a short time in Casa Amor so I am ready to find the one.\n\nWhat's the number one thing you look for in a partner?\n\nGood communication and honesty. They are both incredibly important traits to me.\n\nWho do you have your eye on in the Villa?\n\nI have my eyes on Ayo, despite his connection with Mimii. I fancy Ayo so much. Wil also seems like a catch and someone I want to explore a connection with.\n\nTell us something you'd put on your dating profile\n\nIf you don't like pasta, we can't be a thing. I could eat pasta for breakfast, lunch and dinner.\n\nHugo Godfroy - 24-year-old an electrician from Southampton\n\nWhat kind of Islander are you going to be?\n\nI'll be an honest Islander and I'm never afraid to be myself. I always take people's opinions on board but I'm not a yes man - I'm going in there to find love and prepared to step on toes to do so.\n\nWhat do other Islanders need to know about you?\n\nI'll get on with everyone, I'm very generous but I am definitely in there to find the one.\n\nWhat's the number one thing you look for in a partner?\n\nSomeone I can have a laugh with and they don't take themselves too seriously.\n\nWho have you got your eye on in the Villa?\n\nI like Uma, I think she carries herself well and seems very respectful. The same with Jess as my type is brunette.\n\nTell us something about yourself you'd put on your dating profile\n\nI am massively driven. I love having a purpose in life and it would be nice to meet someone that matches that.\n\nBlade Siddiqi, 29, \"Butler in the Buff\" from Stevenage\n\nWhat kind of Islander are you going to be?\n\nFirst and foremost, I'm looking to come and shake things up. I want to bring the energy, get amongst it and really consider myself as someone who is looking for something genuine moving forward. I want a Queen by my side. I'm hoping to find that in the Villa with someone who is down to earth and up for a laugh.\n\nWhat do the other Islanders need to know about you?\n\nI would consider myself as a kind and considerate person. I'm one of the boys and I do try and go by bro code when I can - that being said, I am very competitive. I've always had a very competitive nature in me... I don't mind a bit of healthy competition. I'm up for a laugh, and happy to just shake things up and I'm not afraid to be myself. I'm not afraid of failure. I'm flaunting what I've got.\n\nWhat's the number one thing you look for in a partner?\n\nI'm looking to find a girl who would make me want to hang up my bow tie for good.\n\nWho do you want to couple up with?\n\nThere are some great girls in there. The three that have really caught my eye are Uma, Grace and Matilda. They each have their own qualities. Matilda she seems really fun, kind, bubbly, she's come in with great energy, a great figure, great pair of eyes. Straight away she's getting the nod from me. I like someone who is down-to-earth. In a world where egos are regularly inflated, being down-to-earth is great.\n\nUma is absolutely stunning. I love her eyes. She's got a great figure on her to be honest. I like the way she carries herself, she's upfront and direct. She's not afraid to give guys a bit of a run for her money and that's a turn on in my opinion. We'd bounce off of each other. Grace is stunning; she is the spitting image of my ex-girlfriend. She's an absolute worldie and seems really caring and considerate. She does her best to keep other people's feelings in mind and seems like a fun girl and quite mature as well.\n\nTell us something about yourself you'd put on a dating profile...\n\nIf your type is tall, dark and handsome, now is a good time to mention that I'm 6ft4 with a Jamaican/ Indian/ Scottish and Danish blend... I'm the undisputed champion of giving the best hugs and I'm after someone who is up for adventure, seeing the world and living life to the fullest.\n\nCan't get enough of the Love Island drama?

They do the girls dirty every year. I'm convinced they do it on purpose so only the boys can have fun. :/\"\n\nA third commented: \"Wait are these some of the boys for Casa??? I fear there's not gonna be no amor here,\" and another commented: \"Is this the casa amor line up? Does this show hate women or what?\" And one fan went so far as to say: \"cancel casa amor.\"\n\nThe men who are coming in for such criticism include Jake Spivey, an electrician from Essex who has his eye on Matilda. \"She's my frontrunner,\" he says. \"She's my type to a tee. She said she likes muscles, tan, teeth... I thought, cool, she seems like a good ball of fun. I'm going to go for her. Grace is attractive as well.\"\n\nHe'll be joined by 22 year old Joel Kirby, a graduate from Devon, who also mentions Grace. \"Uma seems really sound, I feel like we'd get on. Grace, she looks like my ex-girlfriend who was also called Grace,\" he says.\n\nGrace will, it appears, be fending off attention from all directions as Lionel Awudu is interested in her, too. \"Top three girls in no particular order, Mimii, Uma and Grace,\" he lists. \"Besides the fact that they're all very beautiful, in terms of personality, Mimii is more the reserved, chilled type. That matches me. And then Uma brings in that energy, she's very bubbly. That brings out the energised side of me. Grace is kind of a mix of the two. She's more on the reserved side. That's why I like her,\" he adds, having clearly thought a lot about potential matches before his arrival at the villa.\n\nMoziah Pinder, a 29 year old fitness trainer, agrees with Lionel's choices, too. \"Grace is my type, the way she carries herself is very attractive to me,\" he says. \"Uma is stunning and I think we would get on really well. Also, Mimii is a great girl.\"\n\nHugo Godfroy, an electrician from Southampton, also mentions Uma: \"I think she carries herself well and seems very respectful,\" and Stevenage boy Blake Siddiqi, who works as a 'butler in the buff', waxed lyrical about Grace and Uma too.\n\n\"Uma is absolutely stunning. I love her eyes,\" he says. \"She's got a great figure on her to be honest. I like the way she carries herself, she's upfront and direct.

Joel just completed a degree in international development and the OnlyFans account was to fund his way through university. A lot of people might judge OnlyFans creators, but it's actually a clever way to make money if you're studying.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Molly-Mae Hague makes statement on Tommy Fury after 'bickering' admission\n\nREAD MORE: Idris Elba says showering with his wife Sabrina part of his 'selfless self-care' routine\n\nApart from modelling on the racy social media platform, the star also co-hosts a podcast, titled All Gains No Game, with pal Jacob Ward. The pair have interviewed the likes of Aesha Scott from Below Deck. Fans of Love Island can also find Joel on Instagram and boasts a following of 118,000 people. A lot of his content is of him working out and hiking, which explains his toned physique. Joel is set to enter Casa Amor on Sunday June 30.\n\nElsewhere, earlier this week viewers witnessed an explosive scene between Grace Jackson and her beau Joey Essex. When Grace first arrived at the villa, the pair couldn't keep their hands off each other but their loyalty to one another was put to the test as a new bombshell Konnor Ewudzi picked Grace at the recoupling. And this left Joey seething as he had only rekindled his romance with Grace.\n\nBut just after the heart-rate challenge, Harriett received a text message asking joey to head out of the villa as another islander was waiting to date him. And instead of staying silent, Grace struggled to hold in her frustration and blurted out \"boring!\", as Joey also appeared peeved at the twist.\n\nBut it wasn't that long ago that Grace and Joey came under fire over Samantha Kenny's shock departure. Samantha had been coupled with Joey before Grace arrived but she soon noticed Joey's attention had moved on to Grace, which left the reality TV star devastated. And she blamed Joey for how he had handled the situation.\n\nA few days later, Samantha was the latest star to exit the villa and her departure was met with tears from some of the islanders who had grown close to the Liverpool born make-up artist. Soon after her exit, she posted a message on social media, showing an emotional reunion with her family.\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

The same with Jess as my type is brunette.\"\n\nJake also works as an electrician - so he'll have plenty to natter to Hugo about.\n\nThe Essex lad admits he's direct, \"very confident\" and a \"social butterfly\" - so he'll be gunning for what he wants.\n\nThat happens to be bombshell Matilda and he said: \"She's my type to a tee. She said she likes muscles, tan, teeth... I thought, cool, she seems like a good ball of fun. I'm going to go for her. Grace is attractive as well.\"\n\nBrighton-based Moziah works as a PT - so that'll explain the ripped abs.\n\nHe's not after a love triangle - rather a \"genuine connection\" - and vowed to be his \"best self\" in the spin-off villa.\n\nThe karate brown belt has his sights set on Grace, Mimii and Uma - the latter of whom he describes as \"stunning.\"\n\nBody-confident Blade works as a butler in the buff - and has vowed to \"shake things up\" in Casa Amor.\n\nThe Stevenage lad is 6'4 and after someone who \"would make me want to hang up my bow tie for good.\"\n\nHe reckons this could be Uma, Grace or Matilda, describing Grace as the \"spitting image\" of his ex.\n\nJoel is an economics and politics post-grad - and reckons a sophisticated natter will \"talk me into bed.\"\n\nThe Devon lad has let slip his direct manner and said: \"I'm quite impulsive. I speak before I think and clear up the mess afterwards... which is kind of funny. I'm going in to try and pull someone quickly, so you've got to be loose and straight to the point.\"\n\nHe's after pulling Uma and Grace for chats in the spin-off villa.\n\nThe financial advisor from Reading is bringing \"confidence, good energy and good vibes.\"\n\nMimii, Uma and Grace top his list.\n\nIn a potential threat for Mimii's partner Ayo, he said: \"Besides the fact that they're all very beautiful, in terms of personality, Mimii is more the reserved, chilled type. That matches me.\"\n\nThe Londoner works as the owner of a natural beauty firm - and isn't afraid to stir the pot.\n\nShe said: \"If I have a problem with something, whoever it is, I'll tell them right then and there. I don't feel the need to whisper behind someone's back.\"\n\nAs well as causing potential conflict she's after Wil - who she said is \"waiting for me to arrive, he just doesn't know it yet.\"\n\nThe Glasgow girl is after \"someone who can be my best friend as well as my boyfriend.\"\n\nShe works as a retail store manager and insists she's the perfect balance between a straight talker and a shoulder for support.\n\nLucy's not afraid to meddle in a closed off couple either - listing Ciaran as one of her targets.\n\nThe blonde admits she has a \"fiery\" personality - and a connection with Ciaran.\n\nCardiff-based Ellie, who is a senior executive assistant, has enjoyed chats with the rugby ace and admitted she is \"looking forward to reconnecting with him in Casa Amor.\"\n\nThe Welsh lass is after a \"wholesome, down to earth boy\" - with Wil and Sean also in the mix.\n\nJessica works in London as a fashion stylist.\n\nShe admits she \"fancies Ayo so much\" despite his connection with Mimii, and has branded Wil \"a catch.\"\n\nHer red flag is a foodie one and she said: \"If you don't like pasta, we can't be a thing. I could eat pasta for breakfast, lunch and dinner.\n\nThe Surrey lass vows to be \"very dramatic\" in the villa - so something's bound to go down.\n\nSocial media content creator Ruby vows to be \"loud\" and \"entertaining\" and insists \"I always get what I want.\"\n\nShe's after a lad with a brain, and has flagged Wil as the lucky guy.\n\nEmma, from Manchester, is representing the north in Casa Amor.\n\nShe is a fashion content creator and ready to bring her \"looks\" into the villa.\n\nYet she's sure to see sparks fly after revealing her connection to Joey as she said: \"I had a brief thing with Joey a few years ago. We've been friends for years and I would be open to reconnecting with Joey. We get on really well and we have a lot of mutual friends.

I've just given birth to the seventh child now. And there is still no pain relief as of yet either [in the era the show is set]...\n\n'To be honest, I find if I build up adrenaline and then don't think about it and then watch it back, I think I sounded like a sheep on one thing that I saw back before.\n\n'I'd just have loads of caffeine and then get really built up and then I'm sure one day maybe if I ever give birth I'll realise I was totally wrong.'\n\nThe actress has also found the music of Mumford & Sons helpful to listen to before she films the intense scenes.\n\nShe said: 'On set, I have got into the habit of listening to Mumford & Sons during the birth scenes. I think there is something about the banjo, something about the adrenalin.'\n\nThe actress' next work project is starring alongside Tom Glynn-Carney in gritty upcoming crime drama The Jetty.\n\nShe

There was no third party involved.\n\n'Jenna's career is going from strength to strength, she's being offered increasingly more roles abroad, especially Los Angeles, and she wants to focus on this while she's still young.'\n\nTheir romance was a case of life imitating art for the pair who began dating in 2016 after they met on set.\n\nJenna and Tom's romance almost never happened, as the actress revealed she turned down the role of the iconic monarch Victoria twice, before finally accepting the part.\n\nThe series' third season hit screens back in 2019, but since then ITV haven't announced any plans for a fourth.\n\nSpeaking to Radio Times, Jenna said of the near-miss: 'I had just finished doing nearly four years on Doctor Who and I didn't want to do another long TV project.\n\n'I wanted to do lots of different things, but now I'm doing Victoria, I find her quite addictive.'\n\nBefore Tom, Jenna was in a relationship with Bodyguard and Game Of Thrones star Richard Madden.\n\nThe pair dated on and off for four years after getting together in 2012.\n\nRead More Jenna Coleman stirs speculation that she might have tied the knot with boyfriend Jamie Childs\n\nTheir relationship coincided with their soaring careers, with Richard starring inGame Of Thrones at the time while Jenna had landed her Doctor Who role.\n\nIn the early days of their relationship, a proud Richard gushed about visiting his girlfriend on the set of Doctor Who. 'I've watched Doctor Who since I was a kid. I loved it, and I still love it,' he declared.\n\n'I was selfie-ing the s**t out of it, and sending it to my dad! 'Look, it's me in the TARDIS!' I thought it was the coolest thing ever. I can geek out about it, like when I go to set and see the TARDIS.'\n\nWhile they often showed their support for one another at red carpet premieres of their various projects, the couple ended up splitting for good in 2015.\n\nDespite their split, Jenna and Richard appeared to stay on friendly terms, as they posed for a selfie together after reuniting in Barcelona in March 2024.\n\nThe actress famously keeps her relationships private and has never spoken publicly about her romance with Jamie.\n\nJenna also previously dated her Emmerdale co-star Karl Davies, during her four-year stint on the soap as Jasmine Thomas.\n\nThe star was also linked to Prince Harry back in 2015, after the pair were pictured looking cosy at a charity polo match.\n\nOne onlooker said: 'Harry sneaked outside with Jenna. He took her by the hand and led her away from the crowd in the sponsor's tent. They sat alone and talked.\n\n'It was a very flirty, very tactile encounter. She was leaning in to him and he had his hand on her knee. From their body language, it looked like they were really enjoying each other's company.\n\n'They were sitting very close, laughing lots and touching each other.'\n\nJenna attempted to brush off the rumours during an awkward appearance on Good Morning Britain in 2016, when host Kate Garraway asked: 'Talking about passion, there have been pictures of you and Prince Harry, I'm assuming you were together for research, for the Royal Family.'\n\nLowering her smile, Jenna politely replied: 'No, he is a friend of mine.'\n\nBack in 2019, while in a relationship with Tom, Jenna said she wasn't under any pressure to start a family, and instead wanted to see more of the world.\n\n'Half of my friends have babies, and half don't, so it doesn't feel like a pressure. I want to take my time,' she told Harpers Bazaar.\n\n'There's a whole lot more of the world for me to see first. I'd love to have children one day. But not nine of them. I can tell you that as a fact.'\n\nJenna has previously joked she has had practice for labour, having played Queen Victoria in the ITV drama, which saw her watch One Born Every Minute to prepare for the labour scenes, as Victoria had nine children.\n\nSpeaking on The Jonathan Ross Show in 2019, she said: 'I have had many a labour scene now, I'm running out of noises for labour scenes.\n\n'I try to [change it up]... I've just given birth to the seventh child now. And there is still no pain relief as of yet either [in the era the show is set]...\n\n'To be honest, I find if I build up adrenaline and then don't think about it and then watch it back, I think I sounded like a sheep on one thing that I saw back before.\n\n'I'd just have loads of caffeine and then get really built up and then I'm sure one day maybe if I ever give birth I'll realise I was totally wrong.'\n\nRead More Jenna Coleman stars as Detective Ember Manning in upcoming crime drama The Jetty\n\nThe actress has also found the music of Mumford & Sons helpful to listen to before she films the intense scenes.\n\nShe said: 'On set, I have got into the habit of listening to Mumford & Sons during the birth scenes. I think there is something about the banjo, something about the adrenalin.'\n\nThe actress' next work project is starring alongside Tom Glynn-Carney in gritty upcoming crime drama The Jetty.\n\nShe portrays Detective Ember Manning in the new series.\n\nTom, 29 - is best known for his role as Aegon II Targaryen in HBO drama House Of Dragon - but his character is yet to be revealed.\n\nThe new show also stars Archie Renaux, known for his roles in The Greatest Beer Run, Shadow and Bone, and Romulus.\n\nThe four-part series follows the aftermath of a fire tearing through a lake house in the aptly named Detective Ember's scenic Lancashire town.\n\nEmber attempts to find out how the fire links to a podcast journalist investigating a missing person's cold case as well as a disturbing 'love' triangle between a man in his twenties and two underage girls.\n\nJenna has previously joked she has had practice for labour, having played Queen Victoria in the ITV drama. The monarch had nine children (pictured with co-star Tom Hughes)\n\nThe unfortunate truth threatens to destroy Ember's life, forcing her to re-evaluate everything she thought she knew about her past, present and the town she's always called home.\n\nAs much a coming-of-age story as a detective thriller, The Jetty asks big questions about sexual morality, identity and memory, in the places that Me Too has left behind.\n\nJenna told the BBC of the project: 'Working with BBC and Firebird Pictures on bringing the complex and enigmatic character of Ember Manning to life has been an incredible experience.\n\n'I can't wait for everyone to meet this new heroine and to find out what's lurking beneath the surface of The Jetty.'\n\nWednesday night's dinner celebrated ERDEM's Spring Summer 2024

The 38 year old star unveiled her growing baby bump at a special event celebrating the opening of a new exhibition at Chatsworth House on June 19, 2024.\n\nPhotographs from the event show the expectant mother cradling her bump, looking radiant and quite far along in her pregnancy, dressed in a stunning green and white floral dress. This news follows months of speculation about whether she had tied the knot with The Sandman director, Jamie Childs, 35, where she plays a leading role.\n\nRecent images of Jenna, who has starred in everything from Waterloo Road, Doctor Who, Emmerdale to Captain America, often depict her in large coats and dark, baggy yet fashionable attire. Just last week, the BBC released new photos of Jenna Coleman in the upcoming crime drama The Jetty, with no hints of her impending motherhood.\n\nThe four-part BBC mystery, shot in and around Lancashire, delves into sexual morality, age of consent, grooming, identity and memory.\n\nREAD MORE: BBC The Traitors' Diane Carson and Christine McGuinness among celebs announced for Celebrity MasterChef 2024\n\nBlackpool's Jenna is a well-established actress, having starred in some of the UK's most popular shows. In addition to being a regular on TV and film, she also frequently appears in theatres and the West End, reports the Mirror.\n\nOne of her most notable roles was in 2015 when Coleman was cast in ITV's eight-part drama following the reign of Queen Victoria, the British monarch and Empress of India. The actress admitted that she wasn't fully versed in Victorian history but undertook research for the role.\n\nJenna Coleman, in a candid chat on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, shared her respect for the Queen and discussed how her role helped her escape the \"box\" of being typecast as a northern working-class character, a label she felt was attached to her during her time on Emmerdale.\n\nColeman made a triumphant return to the West End stage in January 2023, starring opposite Aidan Turner in the revival of Sam Steiner's 2015 play, Lemons Lemons Lemons Lemons Lemons. The production kicked off with a nine-week stint at London's Harold Pinter Theatre before touring Manchester and Brighton, concluding in April.\n\nIn the same year, Jenna Coleman took on the role of Liv Taylor in the Amazon Prime Video thriller series Wilderness, an adaptation of B. E. Jones' novel. She starred alongside Oliver Jackson-Cohen, with the show premiering on the streaming service on 15 September 2023.\n\nColeman also graced the silver screen as Bo in the thriller Jackdaw, directed by Jamie Childs, marking another collaboration with co-star Oliver Jackson-Cohen. The film premiered at Fantastic Fest in Austin, Texas, in September 2023.\n\nRumours swirl around Netflix's The Sandman, where it's believed Jenna met the potential father of her child, director Jamie Childs, while on set. The duo later joined forces again for Childs' directorial debut, Jackdaw.\n\nAs for the eagerly awaited second season of The Sandman, details remain scarce, leaving fans in suspense about its release date.\n\nNetflix has yet to announce a release date or timeframe for the series, which was notably missing from Netflix's February 2024 Next on Netflix series preview that confirmed over 90 new and returning shows and films. Currently, we anticipate the series to return to our screens by 2025 at the latest - however, this could now be uncertain due to the impending arrival of the couple's baby.", "source": {"uri":

rumours during an awkward appearance on Good Morning Britain in 2016, when host Kate Garraway asked: 'Talking about passion, there have been pictures of you and Prince Harry, I'm assuming you were

The Doctor Who star, 38, displayed her blossoming bump while attending a glitzy exhibition opening at Chatsworth House on Wednesday night (19 June).\n\nJenna, who played Jasmine Thomas in Emmerdale until 2009, was photographed cradling her large bump as she posed at the historic venue during the opening of Imaginary Conversations: An ERDEM Collection Inspired by Duchess Deborah.\n\nThe happy news comes just a few months after the actress refused to be drawn into speculation that she'd married her director boyfriend, Jamie Childs, after she was spotted with a ring on her engagement finger.\n\nThe couple met in 2020 on the set of the smash Netflix series The Sandman, in which Jenna played the lead and Jamie was director. She has never spoken publicly of her relationship with him, and has yet to speak about her pregnancy.\n\nThere have also been no clues on her social media, and there was no sign of a baby bump in recent pictures released by the BBC to plug her new crime drama, The Jetty, in which she plays rookie detective Ember Manning in a scenic Lancashire lake town.\n\nPrior to meeting Jamie, Jenna was in a relationship with actor Tom Hughes, who played her on-screen husband Prince Albert in ITV's period drama Victoria. She also dated Richard Madden, who starred in Bodyguard with Keeley Hawes and played Robb Stark in Game of Thrones.\n\nLast year Jenna impressed audiences with her portrayal of Liv Taylor in the Amazon Prime thriller Wilderness, based on a novel of the same name by B.E. Jones. Liv discovers her husband Will, played by Oliver Jackson-Cohen, is having an affair, upending their seemingly perfect life.\n\nSpeaking about the role at the time, Jenna said: \"For Liv, it's about accepting who you are - of really being in your own skin, of being happy without needing anyone else. I feel like co-dependent relationships are very common. Wanting to lose yourself in someone else is common. For Liv, that's a very sobering acceptance.\"\n\nHer latest project, The Jetty, which is due out soon, is described by the BBC as \"as much a coming-of-age story as a detective thriller\", The Jetty asks big questions about sexual morality, identity and memory, in the places that Me Too has left behind.\n\nSpeaking previously about the four-part series, Jenna said: \"Working with the BBC and Firebird Pictures on bringing the complex and enigmatic character of Ember Manning to life has been an incredible experience. I can't wait for everyone to meet this new heroine and to find out what's lurking beneath the surface of The Jetty.\"", "source": {"uri": "ok.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ok"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mitya_underwood@ok.co.uk", "name": "Mitya Underwood", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmerdale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emmerdale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jasmine Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenna_Coleman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jenna Coleman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatsworth_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatsworth House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doctor_(Doctor_Who)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Doctor (Doctor Who)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Sandman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Historical drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodyguard_(British_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bodyguard (British TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hughes_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Hughes (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeley_Hawes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keeley Hawes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Madden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Madden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert,_Prince_Consort", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Albert, Prince Consort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crime film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queen Victoria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Game of Thrones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ITV (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detective"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lancashire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lancashire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Jackson-Cohen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oliver Jackson-Cohen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming-of-age_story", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming-of-age story"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morality"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.ok.co.uk/incoming/article33068742.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2158325736.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666608", "eventUri": "eng-9666608", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 233, "textEnd": 240}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

I want to take my time,' she told Harpers Bazaar.\n\n'There's a whole lot more of the world for me to see first. I'd love to have children one day. But not nine of them. I can tell you that as a fact.'\n\nTom Hughes\n\nThe actress previously dated Tom Hughes, who played her husband Prince Albert in ITV 's Victoria\n\nThey met in 2013 on the set of BBC drama series Dancing On The Edge, but went their separate ways in 2020 (pictured in 2017)\n\nThe actress previously dated Tom Hughes, who played her husband Prince Albert in ITV's Victoria.\n\nThey met in 2013 on the set of BBC drama series Dancing On The Edge, but went their separate ways in 2020.\n\nAt the time it was reported that the pair were 'terribly sad' by the end of their relationship, with the actress moving into her own pad and they reportedly attempted to 'salvage a friendship.'\n\nAn insider told The Sun at the time the pair later met up in an attempt to keep things 'as friendly and civil as possible.'\n\nThe source said: 'They are trying to salvage a friendship but obviously these are trying times, and it's not easy.\n\n'Both Tom and Jenna are terribly sad, but the relationship ran its course. There was no third party involved.\n\n'Jenna's career is going from strength to strength, she's being offered increasingly more roles abroad, especially Los Angeles, and she wants to focus on this while she's still young.'\n\nTheir romance was a case of life imitating art for the pair who began dating in 2016 after they met on set.\n\nJenna and Tom's romance almost never happened, as the actress revealed she turned down the role of the iconic monarch Victoria twice, before finally accepting the part.\n\nThe series' third season hit screens back in 2019, but since then ITV haven't announced any plans for a fourth.\n\nSpeaking to Radio Times, Jenna said of the near-miss: 'I had just finished doing nearly four years on Doctor Who and I didn't want to do another long TV project.\n\n'I wanted to do lots of different things, but now I'm doing Victoria, I find her quite addictive.'\n\nPrince Harry\n\nBack in 2015, Jenna and Prince Harry sparked romance rumours after they were pictured putting of a cosy display at a charity polo match (pictured) which she later downplayed\n\nThe romance rumours were short lived, however, as Prince Harry met his now wife Meghan Markle a year later\n\nBack in 2015, Jenna and Prince Harry, 39, sparked romance rumours after they were pictured putting of a cosy display at a charity polo match.\n\nOne onlooker said: 'Harry sneaked outside with Jenna. He took her by the hand and led her away from the crowd in the sponsor's tent. They sat alone and talked.\n\n'It was a very flirty, very tactile encounter. She was leaning in to him and he had his hand on her knee. From their body language, it looked like they were really enjoying each other's company.\n\n'They were sitting very close, laughing lots and touching each other.'\n\nJenna attempted to brush off the rumours during an awkward appearance on Good Morning Britain in 2016, when host Kate Garraway asked: 'Talking about passion, there have been pictures of you and Prince Harry, I'm assuming you were together for research, for the Royal Family.'\n\nJenna politely replied: 'No, he is a friend of mine.'\n\nThe romance rumours were short lived as Prince Harry met his now wife Meghan Markle, 42, a year later.\n\nRichard Madden\n\nBefore Tom, Jenna was in a relationship with Bodyguard and Game Of Thrones star Richard Madden and they had an off-on four year romance (pictured in 2015)\n\nDespite their split, Jenna and Richard appeared to stay on friendly terms, as they posed for a selfie together after reuniting in Barcelona in March 2024\n\nBefore her long-term romance with Tom, Jenna was in a relationship with Bodyguard and Game Of Thrones star Richard Madden.\n\nThe pair dated on and off for four years after getting together in 2012.\n\nTheir relationship coincided with their soaring careers, with Richard starring in Game Of Thrones at the time while Jenna had landed her Doctor Who role.\n\nIn the early days of their relationship, a proud Richard gushed about visiting his girlfriend on the set of Doctor Who. 'I've watched Doctor Who since I was a kid. I loved it, and I still love it,' he declared.\n\n'I was selfie-ing the s**t out of it, and sending it to my dad! \"Look, it's me in the TARDIS!\" I thought it was the coolest thing ever. I can geek out about it, like when I go to set and see the TARDIS.'\n\nWhile they often showed their support for one another at red carpet premieres of their various projects, the couple ended up splitting for good in 2015.\n\nDespite their split, Jenna and Richard appeared to stay on friendly terms, as they posed for a selfie together after reuniting in Barcelona in March 2024.\n\nKarl Davies\n\nJenna auditioned for Emmerdale shortly after leaving the private Arnold House School in her home town of Blackpool and dated her co-star Karl Davies for two years (pictured in 2009)\n\nJenna auditioned for Emmerdale shortly after leaving the private Arnold House School in her home town of Blackpool with straight As at A-level - and landed the part of lesbian schoolgirl Jasmine Thomas.\n\nIt was a role that developed into one of the soap's racier storylines when Jasmine had an affair with her best friend Debbie, fell pregnant by Debbie's father, had an abortion and then killed the father with a chair leg.\n\nWhile on the ITV soap she started a two-and-a-half-year relationship with her co-star Karl Davies.\n\nAt the time, he admitted: 'On her first day she walked into the green room at Emmerdale and I just thought, \"Wow.\" I fell for her pretty quickly.'\n\nBy coincidence, Karl also starred in Game Of Thrones where he played Alton Lannister.\n\nMore recently he has has starred in The Bay as Carl McGregor and The Nevers.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

She also dated Richard Madden, who starred in Bodyguard with Keeley Hawes and played Robb Stark in Game of Thrones.\n\nOne of Jenna's most recent hit series was Wilderness where she played Liv Taylor - a woman who has it all, until she discovers a shocking secret.\n\nJenna revealed: \"Wilderness is a very big story. It's about a woman who finds out her husband is cheating on her, and she begins to plot ways and means in which to kill him.\n\n\"But what ensues is a very different chain of events, almost like a roller-coaster or an acid trip.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nFormer Emmerdale star Jenna Coleman has announced she is expecting her first child. The 38-year-old Doctor Who actress showcased her growing baby bump at a glamorous exhibition opening at Chatsworth House on Wednesday night.\n\nJenna, who portrayed Jasmine Thomas in Emmerdale until 2009, was snapped tenderly holding her prominent bump as she posed at the historic location during the launch of Imaginary Conversations: An ERDEM Collection Inspired by Duchess Deborah.\n\nThe joyous announcement comes just months after the actress sidestepped rumours she had wed her director beau, Jamie Childs, following sightings of a ring on her engagement finger reports OK!.\n\nThe pair crossed paths in 2020 on the set of the hit Netflix series The Sandman, where Jenna took the lead role and Jamie directed. She has remained tight-lipped about their relationship and has yet to comment on her pregnancy.\n\nThere have been no hints on her social media platforms, and recent images released by the BBC promoting her new crime drama, The Jetty, showed no evidence of a baby bump. In the show, she portrays rookie detective Ember Manning in a picturesque Lancashire lake town.\n\nBefore her relationship with Jamie, Jenna was romantically involved with actor Tom Hughes, who played her on-screen spouse Prince Albert in ITV's historical drama Victoria. She also dated Richard Madden, known for his roles in Bodyguard and Game of Thrones.\n\nLast year, Jenna garnered acclaim for her compelling performance as Liv Taylor in the Amazon Prime suspense series Wilderness, adapted from B. E.\n\nJoin the Daily Record's WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages.\n\nReflecting on her character, Jenna remarked: \"For Liv, it's about accepting who you are of really being in your own skin, of being happy without needing anyone else. I feel like co-dependent relationships are very common. Wanting to lose yourself in someone else is common. For Liv, that's a very sobering acceptance.\"\n\nHer forthcoming endeavour, The Jetty, soon to be released, has been billed by the BBC as a gripping blend of bildungsroman and mystery, delving into profound themes of sexual ethics, identity, and recollection, in the wake of the Me Too movement.\n\nDiscussing the upcoming four-part drama, Jenna expressed: \"Working with the BBC and Firebird Pictures on bringing the complex and enigmatic character of Ember Manning to life has been an incredible experience.

The 38-year-old was seen cradling the bump while wowing in a green and white floral dress.\n\nJenna and Jamie first met in 2020 while filming The Sandman, and have also worked together on Jamie's film Jackdaw. Before Jamie, Jenna had dated some of Hollywood's most eligible bachelors, including a dabble with royalty.\n\nRead on to find out all about Jenna's dating life...\n\nJenna's first boyfriend came about from her acting career, with the star crossing paths with Karl when they starred together in Emmerdale. Jenna played iconic character Jasmine Thomas, with Karl playing Robert Sugden.\n\nKarl has previously admitted to falling for Jenna at first sight and their relationship continued to go strong even when Karl quit the soap. Speaking to the Mirror, Jenna said: \"But I don't know why anyone would be interested in us. We're just a normal couple. We like going out for dinner or to the cinema.\"\n\nShe also confessed that the pair kept their romance under wraps in the early days, worried about how people might react. The pair are believed to have split in 2009.\n\nIn 2011, Jenna and The Bodyguard star Richard Madden became an item with the pair having an on-off relationship for four years. A self-confessed 'Whovian', Richard couldn't be prouder that his beau was playing the iconic Time Lord's companion and would regularly visit the set.\n\nHe joked: \"I've watched Doctor Who since I was a kid. I loved it, and I still love it. I was selfieing the [expletive] out of it and sending it to my dad! 'Look, it's me in the TARDIS!' I thought it was the coolest thing ever. I can geek out about it, like when I go to set and see the TARDIS.\"\n\nAlthough the pair went their separate ways in 2015, they still enjoy a close friendship and earlier this year the pair holidayed together in Spain.\n\nAlthough neither ever confirmed a relationship, Jenna was spotted getting cosy with the Duke of Sussex at a charity polo match. During an appearance on Good Morning Britain, Jenna put the rumours to bed when questioned about their \"passion\" telling presenter Kate Garraway: \"He is a friend of mine.\"\n\nDuring her time on Victoria, Jenna dated her on-screen husband, Tom Hughes, with the pair beginning their relationship in 2016. However, in 2020, the couple decided to go their separate ways.\n\nAt the time, a source said \"the relationship ran its course\" and that the pair were doing their best to remain friends.\n\nJenna is currently in a relationship with Sandman director Jamie Childs, with the pair meeting on the set of the hit Netflix show.\n\nThe couple were rumoured to be engaged when Jenna was spotted with a gold band on her finger, but she no longer wore this as she debuted her baby bump.\n\nRELATED: Presumed Innocent star Ruth Negga: from famous fiance to relationship status", "source": {"uri": "hellomagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HELLO!"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Sandman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenna_Coleman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jenna Coleman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Madden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Madden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor's_degree", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor's degree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodyguard_(British_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bodyguard (British TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jasmine Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sugden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Sugden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TARDIS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doctor Who"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmerdale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmerdale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumed_Innocent_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presumed Innocent (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hughes_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Hughes (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman_(wrestler)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Sandman (wrestler)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Garraway", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kate Garraway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Negga", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ruth Negga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Polo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queen Victoria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Questionnaires", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Questionnaires", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/E-zines", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/E-zines", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/70ef7677ff0f-jenna-coleman-dating-history.jpg?tx=c_fill,w_1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666608", "eventUri": "eng-9666608", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

The pair later worked together again on Childs' first film Jackdaw.\n\nPreviously, Coleman dated Tom Hughes, her co-star who played Prince Albert in ITV's Victoria, from 2016 until their split in 2020.\n\nBefore Hughes, she was in a relationship with Richard Madden, known for his roles in Bodyguard and Game Of Thrones, from 2012 until 2015.\n\nColeman is known for keeping her relationships private and has never publicly discussed her romance with Childs.\n\nIn 2019, the British star explained that she didn't feel pressured to start a family and preferred to explore more of the world first.\n\nShe told Harper's Bazaar UK at the time: \"Half of my friends have babies, and half don't, so it doesn't feel like a pressure.

The pair have remained on good terms, and spent time together in Barcelona in March, with Coleman posting a selfie of them on a shaded street to her Instagram story.\n\nLast week, the BBC released new images of the actor in the forthcoming crime drama, The Jetty, in which Coleman is not visibly pregnant.\n\nIn the series, Coleman plays a rookie detective named Ember Manning, who investigates a fire that tears through a holiday home in Lancashire.\n\nThroughout the four-part mystery, she must figure out how the fire links to a podcast journalist investigating a missing person's cold case and an illicit encounter between a man in his twenties and two underage girls.\n\nWhen the programme was announced in January, Coleman shared her excitement in a statement.\n\n\"Working with the BBC and Firebird Pictures on bringing the complex and enigmatic character of Ember Manning to life has been an incredible experience,\" she said. \"I can't wait for everyone to meet this new heroine and to

The pair met on set when the Victoria star was cast in a Netflix drama where Childs was working behand the camera. While the pair have kept quiet about their personal relationship, we take a look at how their relationship grew from professional to personal.\n\nThe Serpent star sky-rocketed to fame when she was cast as the companion to the eleventh Time Lord, played by Matt Smith, in 2012. She starred in the hit show until 2017 and also worked with Peter Capaldi as The Doctor. While it is not known if their paths ever crossed on the BBC sci-fi show, Childs has also worked on Doctor Who. He directed several episodes of Doctor Who in 2018 when Jodie Whittaker was The Doctor.\n\nColeman and Childs are said to have begun dating after they worked together on Netflix drama The Sandman in 2020. Coleman played occult detective Johanna Constantine in the fantasy drama based on Neil Gaiman's comic book, appearing in three episodes of the 11 part series. Childs directed four episodes of the show.\n\nAs love blossomed Childs cast Coleman as the leading lady in his debut feature film, Jackdaw. Released in January 2024 the action thriller starred Oliver Jackson-Cohen and Thomas Turgoose. Childs wrote and directed the crime drama set in Hartlepool, which follows a former motorcross champion and army veteran as he searches for his kidnapped brother. Coleman played a character called Bo and learned to do a Geordie accent for the role.\n\nAt the time of its release she said in an interview: \"I feel like I've definitely done my time of thrillers and murderers. My time of murdering and... thrilling? is done.\" And added she would like to do more comedy.\n\nIn January 2024 Coleman sparked rumours she and Childs had tied the knot after she was pictured wearing a chunky gold ring on her wedding finger while out walking in North-west London with Childs. But after the marriage speculation began Coleman was seen with the same ring moved to her middle finger.\n\nColeman has developed several actors after meeting them at work. Back in 2006 she began a two-and-half year relationship with Emmerdale star Karl Davies when they were both acting in the ITV soap.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

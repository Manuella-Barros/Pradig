The accident occurred late last night when a Swift Dzire drove the wrong way onto the Samruddhi Highway after refuelling and collided with an Ertiga, which was heading from Nagpur to Mumbai, NDTV reported. According to the eyewitnesses, the impact of the collision was so severe that it caused the Ertiga to be thrown into the air, landing on the highway\u2019s barricade, while passengers were thrown out onto the road. The other car involved was left severely damaged, becoming a twisted mass of metal. Six individuals involved in the terrible crash died on the spot with visuals showing the sight of their bloodied bodies lying on the highway. Upon receiving information about the accident, both the Samruddhi Highway Police and Jalna Police promptly responded to the scene. A crane was utilised to clear the wreckage from the highway, and the injured people were immediately rushed to the district hospital for necessary medical treatment. The Samruddhi Mahamarg, a 701-km-long access-controlled expressway in Maharashtra, serves as a vital link between Mumbai and Nagpur, two major cities in the state. This project, known as one of the country\u2019s longest greenfield road initiatives, aims to enhance connectivity and facilitate smoother transportation between these key locations. However, this is not the first such brutal accident on the Samruddhi Highway but several such major crashes have taken place over the years. In October last year, at least 12 people, including an infant, died and over 20 others sustained injuries after a speeding mini-bus they were travelling in lost control and rammed into a container on the Samruddhi Expressway in Maharashtra\u2019s Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar district. The bus was carrying 35 passengers who were returning from a pilgrimage to Sailani Baba Dargah in Buldhana and heading back to Nashik.", "summary": "According to the eyewitnesses, the impact of the collision was so severe that it caused the Ertiga to be thrown into the air, landing on the highway's barricade", "url": "https://www.news18.com/india/samruddhi-mumbai-nagpur-highway-accident-tragic-collision-wrong-side-six-killed-swift-dzire-hit-ertiga-maharahstra-news-8948334.html", "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/06/samruddhi-highway-collision-jg-2024-06-248f22483ba8128341c281b387294dd5-16x9.png?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 03:39:27", "author": "Kavya Mishra,News18", "authors": ["Kavya Mishra", "News18"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.8}

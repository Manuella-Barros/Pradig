It's the world's only major producer of separated rare earths outside of China. Rare earths are used in many high-tech and future-facing applications, including electronics, wind turbines, and hybrid and electric vehicles.\n\nBefore this week, Hancock Prospecting owned 54.4 million Lynas shares, representing 5.8% of the ASX 200 mining stock.\n\nLynas reported in an ASX announcement today that Hancock Prospecting had increased its stake by 12.34 million Lynas shares since the last notice in April 2024. This investment takes its stake to 7.14% of the rare earth business.\n\nThe miner advised that Hancock Prospecting had made numerous investments over the last three months, with this week's two transactions being the biggest. Yesterday, it bought 1.18 million Lynas shares for $5.97 per share, and on Tuesday, it bought 1.32 million Lynas shares for $5.99 per share.\n\nIt appears Rinehart and her business associates are excited about the rare earth miner and want to keep boosting their stake because of its strategic importance.\n\nLynas recently gave the market its operational update for the three months to 30 June 2024, which wasn't the most inspiring set of figures.\n\nThe miner reported gross sales revenue dropped 13.3% to $136.6 million, while sales receipts dropped 37.8% to $117.5 million.\n\nLynas reported it produced 2,188 rare earth oxide (ROE) tonnes, down year over year from 4,475 tonnes in the fourth quarter of FY23. NdPr production was 1,504 ROE tonnes, down from 1,864 tonnes in the prior corresponding period.\n\nThe ASX 200 mining stock explained the lower production was due to essential maintenance conducted at Lynas Malaysia during the quarter.\n\nLynas reported there was a \"slight improvement\" in China's domestic end-product demand, though market prices \"remained low\". However, the average selling price \"improved through the quarter\" as it \"carefully managed the timing of sales, especially for heavy rare earth which were quite volatile throughout the quarter.\"\n\nAs the chart below shows, the Lynas share price is down around 15% from the start of the year and has dropped 14.4% since 21 May 2024.

Copper spot averaged US$4.42/lb in the quarter - hitting an all time high of almost US$11,000/t in May - with MAC making US$21m in free cash on a sales price of US$4.41/lb.\n\nThat brought its first half output to 19,650t at a total cash cost of $2.86/lb, with MAC reducing debt levels by 9% to US$231m and holding US$88.6m in the bank and paying a US$23.2m stamp duty bill.\n\nWhile costs were lower with reduced development rates in the months of May and June, there are some reasonably big ticket items coming up with $42m to spend on a vent project, due to be completed by mid-2026, while development to a new mining area called 8430 FWD north has begun.\n\nMAC thinks it can lift mining rates to 1.7Mtpa through the investment, something assisted by a deal to get rights for water held by nearby explorer Polymetals Resources (ASX:POL).\n\nWhile grades have risen 20% in the past quarter, MAC CEO Mick McMullen suggested analysts should be guiding 3.7-3.8% Cu stope grades in the half ahead.\n\nLynas Rare Earths (ASX:LYC) has placed a $25 million bill on the construction of a heavy rare earths circuit at its Malaysian refinery which could produce up to 1500t of a heavy rare earths compound from mid next year.\n\nIt would see the company break into a stronghold of the Chinese rare earths market, having previously been a large producer of light rare earths neodymium and praseodymium.\n\nThe key materials here are terbium and dysprosium, which like NdPr are used in the production of permanent magnets.\n\nWhile NdPr average US$44/kg in China in June (minus local value added tax), dysprosium collected US$226/kg and terbium US$678/kg, with dysprosium in particular keeping its value better than its rare earth counterparts in the past year.\n\nLynas MD Amanda Lacaze flagged the miner was interested in acquiring more projects or inking supply deals with to access more heavies.\n\n\"At this stage we are considering feeding those facilities with material from Mt Weld, but we are also discussing with the various different projects which are focused on producing materials which have heavy rare earths in them about potential future supply,\" she said on a conference call today.\n\n\"As you know there are many projects (but) there's relatively little production outside South-East Asia at this stage with the exception of one firm in South America.\n\n\"We are actively engaged, we certainly would like to see additional material come into the market but if not we will feed from out Mt Weld deposit.\"\n\nLacaze said Lynas would be more sophisticated in mining by element rather than grade at Mt Weld to optimise its mix of heavy and light rare earths.\n\nImproved sales volumes from 2310t to 3231t of rare earth oxides saw Lynas grow its revenue from $101.2m in the March quarter to $136.6m in the June quarter, its best outcome for the financial year.\n\nSales receipts of $117.5m were a marked improvement on the March quarter but below the $128.5m mark set in September last year. Lynas saw its average sale price fall from $43.8/kg to $42.3/kg, but weathered weak commodity pricing by timing sales to improve its basket price.\n\nLynas' production was lower, falling from 3545t REO to 2188t REO and 1724t NdPr to 1504t NdPr, maintenance affected, closing the quarter with $523.8m in cash (down QoQ from $616.7m).\n\nBut it delivered the first shipment of mixed rare earth carbonate from its overdue Kalgoorlie plant, with ramp up running 'in accordance with plan'.\n\nThe plant has run into a major conundrum with BHP (ASX:BHP) shutting its Kalgoorlie Nickel Smelter later this year, cutting off WA's top supplier of sulphuric acid, a key input for Lynas. It will work with BHP to source sulphuric acid under its existing contract up to 2027.\n\n\"We're working on it ... it's not as easy as our suphuric in Malaysia, which is literally over the back fence, but we are confident we can find a pathway through,\" Lacaze said.\n\nMeanwhile, Lacaze flagged Lynas would continue to hold inventory, saying Lynas had the cash behind it now to avoid selling into a weak spot market.\n\nThe materials sector slid 0.45% today as iron ore, gold and copper prices slid, the latter threatening to break below US$100/t for the first time in months. Lynas ate a small 0.7% loss.", "source": {"uri": "stockhead.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stockhead"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_chiat@stockhead.com.au", "name": "Josh Chiat", "type":

But the good news is that Lynas' average selling price improved through the quarter as it carefully managed the timing of sales, especially for Heavy Rare Earth which were quite volatile throughout the quarter.\n\nLynas' average selling price during the fourth quarter was A$42.3 per kg. This is down slightly year on year and quarter on quarter.\n\nTotal rare earth oxide (REO) production came in 51.1% lower year on year at 2,188 tonnes and neodymium and praseodymium (NdPr) production fell 19.3% year on year to 1,504 tonnes.\n\nManagement advised that this production decline reflects its decision to undertake essential maintenance at Lynas Malaysia during the quarter.\n\nOnce complete, the company continued the ramp up downstream production to its interim target of 9,000 tonnes per annum. It is now working towards increasing its production to 10,500 tonnes per annum.\n\nAt the end of the period, Lynas' cash and equivalents balance was $523.8 million.

Despite challenges such as Malaysian refining operations not meeting expectations due to shipping delays and unforeseen maintenance, Lynas managed to maintain sales by utilizing inventory and achieving higher-than-expected pricing. The company's progress on their ramp towards a 10.5 ktpa NdPr production capacity in Malaysia remains on schedule, which shows potential for future growth. Additionally, Lynas has plans to increase production of heavy rare earth elements with new circuit implementations, indicating a strategic move to diversify and strengthen their market position.\n\nOn the financial side, Lynas experienced a significant decrease in cash reserves over the fiscal year but is nearing the end of major capital expenditures with the completion of its Malaysian and Mt Weld expansions. The cash burn rate appears to be easing as the company exits a period of heavy investment. Furthermore, Lynas's expansion projects, including the Kalgoorlie site, continue to move forward despite minor setbacks and are expected to contribute to increased production capacity in the near future. However, Deckelbaum's rating suggests that while the company is making progress, the current market conditions and operational hiccups warrant a cautious approach to the stock, leading to a Hold recommendation.\n\nTipRanks tracks over 100,000 company insiders, identifying the select few who excel in timing their transactions.

The latest package will be piled on top of an existing loan from the taxpayer-funded Export Finance Australia.\n\nArafura said it was now casting its sight towards an eyewatering equity raise of $US793m, nearly three times the size of its current market capitalisation of $427.4m.\n\nHancock Prospecting is Arafura biggest shareholder with a 10 per cent stake and will likely pour funds into the massive capital injection.\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails", "source": {"uri": "thewest.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "The West Australian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gina_Rinehart", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gina Rinehart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare-earth_element", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rare-earth element"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hancock_Prospecting", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hancock Prospecting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mineral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_ore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iron ore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agribusiness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agribusiness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praseodymium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Praseodymium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neodymium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neodymium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oil refinery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magnet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Mineral_Exploration_and_Extraction", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Mineral Exploration and Extraction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Supplies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Consulting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-15471605/f61fac1b5ad46b2b485486e6334738be412255bf-16x9-x268y138w957h538.jpg?imwidth=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9755261", "eventUri": "eng-9755261", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

With the hype around a lot of their stars returning from stints in the NHL, it seemed like the seventh-seed Calgary Wranglers who only won one game in April stood no chance. However, the Roadrunners ran into the unstoppable force known as Dustin Wolf as he singlehandedly dragged the Wranglers to a 2-0 win to capture game one. Here are some takeaways from Wednesday night's game.\n\nThroughout the whole game, it was clear that this match and series were going to rely on the goaltenders. Wolf was unbeatable. It's clear why he is being hailed as the next big star for the Calgary Flames in net. Despite numerous chances by future NHL stars Dylan Guenther and Josh Doan, the Gilroy native stood strong with highlight reel save after save. In the end, it was his play and his play only that kept the Roadrunners at bay and eventually secured the Wranglers a win.\n\nSign up for our NHL Prospects & Draft Substack newsletter\n\nIn total, Wolf saved 46 shots. It was impressive for him to step right back into the Wranglers organization after spending most of the past couple of months with the Flames. Now he aims to repeat his performance on Friday to secure the series wins for his team. It wouldn't be the first time where the Flames' American Hockey League (AHL) team has won a playoff series in the AHL all thanks to Wolf. The young goaltender backstopped the Stockton Heat to the Western Conference Finals in 2022.\n\nHowever, the loss is no discredit to Matt Villalta who also stood on his head. The Kingston native has had a breakout season for the Roadrunners becoming their starting goaltender after the departure of Ivan Prostetov. While it was his team-leading in shots for the whole game, it was Villalta who stopped the handful of breakaways the Roadrunners allowed.\n\nRelated: \"We Shall Return\" - Takeaways From Meruelo/Bettman Presser\n\nHead coach Steve Potvin has been praising Villalta all season. Now, into the postseason, Potvin doesn't just consider his young goaltender a star on his team but a star in the league.\n\n\"He was massive, especially in the first period when we weren't really getting into our game,\" Potvin said. \"We've said this all along. He helps us get to our identity. He makes those saves and then we're able to get into the game and find our identity. It doesn't happen without his goaltending and saves. He's a star on this team, there's no doubt but I think he's one of the stars in the league.\"\n\nThis series is going to be relying heavily on goaltending. Both Villalta and Wolf are some of the best goalies in the AHL and it showed as it took until the middle of the second period for the Wranglers to figure out Villalta and they could only do it once. It's going to take the whole Roadrunners offense to eventually find a way to beat Wolf.\n\nThroughout the season, the Roadrunners have relied on their star players to help them win games. The core of Doan, Guenther, Aku Raty, and Jan Jenik are some of the future faces of the Utah NHL team. Conor Geekie joined the team as well on Wednesday after the conclusion of the Swift Current Broncos' season. It couldn't have come at a better time for Potvin and his team as those players provide a lot to the Roadrunners' play.\n\n\"You can see they brought a lot of energy tonight,\" Potvin said. \"Doaner and Gunner were hard on the puck, made a lot of plays, and showed a lot of good energy. They came back and handled it well.\"\n\nAs in the regular season, they were expected to help the Roadrunners have a chance. Unfortunately in game one, a lot of them weren't that noticeable.\n\nGuenther was easily the best performer, racking up a good volume of shots and putting in some hard work. Doan, however, was invisible until the third period with the exception of a poor line change during a two-on-one. He looked good in the third period, hitting the crossbar towards the end of the game but it wasn't enough. Jenik looked injured, Raty and Kesselring barely got any ice time, and Geekie looked out of place whenever he was on the ice.\n\nOf course, there are excuses. Doan, Raty, Kesselring, and Guenther all haven't played hockey since two weeks ago when the Coyotes played their final game against the Edmonton Oilers. Kesselring hasn't even played with the Roadrunners since the very beginning of the season. Geekie hasn't played a pro game in his career. However, excuses can only be acceptable for so long.\n\nDoan knows there was going to be a transition phase going back to the Roadrunners after spending a couple of weeks with the Coyotes. However, he knows when the team's offense gets going, there's no stopping it.\n\n\"I thought our line played well,\" Doan said. \"I'm pretty comfortable. Obviously, Gunts felt the same thing and played really well tonight. There's a couple that we both kind of want back and he's the guy that doesn't miss too many times. So I think when he gets going, it's going to be tough to stop.\"\n\nThe Roadrunners need their young stars to start producing and figuring out a way to beat Wolf. If they continue playing the way they did in game one, this series will be over on Friday.\n\nNow down 1-0 in the series, the Roadrunners can be eliminated from the playoffs on Friday. It's not what the team expected to happen going into the playoffs as the second seed in the Pacific Division. With the hype around getting Doan, Guenther, Raty, and Kesselring back from the Arizona Coyotes and Geekie coming over from the Swift Current Broncos, this isn't the beginning anyone in the organization wanted.\n\nFriday could also be the Roadrunners' last game in Tucson. With the sale and relocation of the Coyotes, Roadrunners owner Alex Meruelo announced his intentions to relocate the AHL team to Mullett Arena in Tempe. This would leave behind a passionate and growing hockey community in Tucson.\n\nThe Roadrunners have played out of the Tucson Convention Center since they arrived in 2015. Wednesday showed that they have anchored themselves into the community. Fans brought back the \"whiteout\" for the first playoff game in Tucson since 2018. Some also armed themselves with signs saying \"Stay in Tucson.\" Little pamphlets with a QR code leading to a petition to keep the Roadrunners in Tucson were handed out all across the arena. It's clear that if Meruelo relocates this franchise, he'll be losing a passionate community down south that could lose its last pro sports franchise apart from an indoor football team.\n\nWhile the future of the team in Tucson is still up in the air, it's up to the team on the ice to make sure the Roadrunners' season doesn't end on Friday. There's no need to panic. They played a good game on Wednesday but the lone issue was getting past Wolf. If they can replicate their efforts from game one and beat Wolf via rebounds or better shots, they'll have a chance to win game two and force a deciding game three in the series.\n\n\"I think there's no reason for us to panic right now. It's one game. It's a best of three so it's nice and short. It'll be a focal point for getting shots on him again. At the end of the day, we liked the way that we played. If we get back to that, then we'll be fine.\"\n\nThe Roadrunners will play the Wranglers for game two of the series on Friday night. The Wranglers can close out the series with a win while the Roadrunners can force a game three with a win of their own.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey Writers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chase_beardsley@thehockeywriters.com", "name": "Chase Beardsley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_State_Bakersfield_Roadrunners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cal State Bakersfield Roadrunners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Hockey_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Doan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Doan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Guenther", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dylan Guenther"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Wolf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dustin Wolf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockton_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stockton Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary_Wranglers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Calgary Wranglers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Division_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Division (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Coyotes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Coyotes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary_Flames", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Calgary Flames"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston,_Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kingston, Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kingston, Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucson_Roadrunners", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tucson Roadrunners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_Geekie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conor Geekie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Jen\u00edk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jan Jen\u00edk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_Current_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swift Current Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucson,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tucson, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tucson, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mullett_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mullett Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Meruelo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Meruelo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucson_Convention_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tucson Convention Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indoor American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempe,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tempe, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tempe, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Josh-Doan-Roadrunners-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511341", "eventUri": "eng-9511341", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

But even with that many chances, an opposing goaltender turning away every last one of them makes it literally impossible to eke out a win.\n\nThe second-seeded Roadrunners (43-24-4-2) fell behind 1-0 late in the second period before ultimately losing 2-0 to No. 7 seed Calgary (36-28-6-3) after a late empty net goal.\n\nGame 2 of the best-of-three series is Friday at 7 p.m. at Tucson Arena; a Roadrunners win in that one and the teams play again in a decisive Game 3 Sunday night, also in Tucson.\n\n\"Honestly I thought it was a playoff game, that's what it looked like,\" Tucson head coach Steven Potvin said after Wednesday's matchup. \"I thought we had a lot of good chances that we didn't capitalize on but the goalie did make some good saves. We got to make sure that we get to the inside a little bit more and just generate a little more screen shots with some second opportunities there with rebounds. He doesn't give up a lot of rebounds, so we got to make sure he doesn't see the puck so that we can try to get the second and third opportunities in the net.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

One of those is goalie Dustin Wolf, the AHL's most valuable player last season who played in 22 playoff games in 2022 and 2023.\n\nTucson entered the playoffs with a league best 6-0-1-0 streak to end the regular season, while Calgary limped into the postseason with a 0-4-1-0 mark.\n\nNot unlike their counterpart, the Roadrunners received a load of NHL talent before the AHL playoffs started too.\n\nTwo of those players, forwards Josh Doan and Dylan Guenther, led the Roadrunners with seven shots apiece.\n\n\"Their goalie played well. Obviously he's won player of the year ... and goalie of the year a couple times now, so you kind of know what to expect,\" Doan said. \"But we liked our looks tonight and a couple of those go in it's a completely different game.\"\n\nTucson goaltender Matthew Villalta was no slouch with 33 saves on 34 shots against. Two of the three stars of the game were goalies, with Wolf, after his 46-for-46 performance, first star and Villalta third.\n\n\"I think goaltending has a major impact on a series, there's no doubt. But I thought Matty played a strong game as well,\" Potvin said. \"Matty made some really key saves and the expected goals I'm sure were pretty high on both sides and I thought both goaltenders did what they could do help their teams win.\"\n\nCalgary center Cole Schwindt scored at 6:14 in the second period, assisted by right wing Adam Klapka and left wing Jakob Pelletier to give the Wranglers that 1-0 lead.\n\nTucson pulled Villalta with 1:42 left and Calgary forward Matt Coronato scored an empty net goal at 19:19 in the third after an errant back pass by Roadrunners defenseman Steven Kampfer.\n\nTucson outshot Calgary 16-9 in the third period.\n\nThe Roadrunners were 0 for 5 on the power play, while the Wranglers were 0-for-3.\n\n\"I thought we had a lot of possession time and I thought we had some shots that were quality except they missed the net,\" Potvin said. \"It looked like they had an opportunity to go in, it looked like the short side was available and we just missed the net.\n\n\"I think there were probably four shots that sailed wide and when that happens it's hard to get second opportunities but it also hard to score,\" he added.\n\nTucson went 2-1-1-0 against Calgary in the regular season, losing 5-4 in overtime on March 5 at home but winning 3-2 the next day.\n\nVillalta said he's \"not too worried\" about the other goalie but added that a game like this is fun for a netminder.\n\n\"It's fun. You're in the moment,\" Villalta said. \"Our jobs (are) to make saves. Especially in the playoffs, every opportunity counts and you got to make saves and you got to give the boys a chance to get going on the other side of it.\"\n\nWednesday's attendance of 4,823 was a Roadrunners record for a weeknight playoff game.\n\n\"It was cool tonight. Obviously I've been to a couple playoff Whiteouts in my life and this one was pretty special to be a part of,\" said Doan, seemingly referencing seeing the NHL's Arizona Coyotes, which featured his dad, Shane Doan, as their longtime captain, in playoff home games.\n\n\"Obviously we want to get the win, but we got Friday to look forward to now and take it from there.\"\n\nSlap shots\n\n* The Roadrunners changed the banners they hang in the northern and southern ends to special Whiteout ones. The team also added a new intro video that featured the Calder Cup, fans from Tucson playoff games past and footage of a snowy mountain.\n\n* The Roadrunners gave out Whiteout towels Wednesday night. There was also extra spotlights on both ends and a smoke machine in the south end.\n\n* It's unknown if a Roadrunners loss Friday (or Sunday if Tucson wins Friday) would be merely the end of the 2023-24 season, or the last Roadrunners game in Tucson at all.\n\nFlyers tied to a fan-generated petition circulated throughout Tucson Arena Wednesday -- the ask being for digital signatures in support of keeping the Roadrunners in Tucson.\n\nRoadrunners team owner Alex Meruelo, who sold the Coyotes' NHL hockey assets for $1.2 billion last week but held on to the Tucson AHL club in his portfolio, stated multiple times last week his interest in exploring a move to Tempe for the Roadrunners.\n\nIt's been reported that such a relocation proposal would need to be presented to the AHL's Board of Governors for approval. Those running the petition, which had 1,867 signatures within the hours after Wednesday's game, hope to share it with the board prior to a league vote for relocation.\n\nPhotos: Roadrunners open the Calder Cup play-offs with a 2-0 loss to Calgary, AHL playoffs Calder Cup Playoffs -- Round 1\n\nWho: (7) Calgary Wranglers at (2) Roadrunners (Calgary leads series 1-0)\n\nWhere: Tucson Arena (all games)\n\nGame 2: 7 p.m. Friday (t-shirt give away)\n\nGame 3*: 7 p.m. Sunday (*if necessary)\n\nWatch: AHLtv.com or AHL app (subscription)\n\nListen: 1450-AM\n\nTickets: tucsonroadrunners.com/whiteout (single game) or tucsonroadrunners.com/playoffs (multi-game passes)\n\nSubscribe to stay connected to Tucson.

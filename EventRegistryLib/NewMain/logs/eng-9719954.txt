Can still be honored even if they lose the semi-final against the Netherlands. - Internewscast Journal", "body": "Gareth Southgate is being tipped for a knighthood if England go on to win Euro 2024 and could receive one even if the Three Lions crash out.\n\nThe England boss is currently preparing his team for this evening's semi-final showdown with the Netherlands in Dortmund as they look to make their second successive Euros final.\n\nA number of Southgate's squad, such as captain Harry Kane, could also receive honours if they lift the trophy on Sunday in Berlin.\n\nBut when these gongs are given could be complicated by Labour's General Election victory and whether ousted Prime Minister Rishi Sunak submits a resignation honours list.\n\nAccording to The Telegraph, Southgate was close to being given a knighthood after taking England to their first major final since 1966 at Euro 2020, which they lost to Italy via a penalty shootout at Wembley.\n\nHowever, Boris Johnson's government ended talks amid questions about Southgate's involvement in a film investment scheme HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) had challenged over tax avoidance rules.\n\nA spokesman for Southgate said the former defender immediately resolved the matter when it was first raised and stressed he was a 'proud Englishman' who 'always paid his taxes and complied with HMRC fully throughout his career'.\n\nGuidance published on the Government's website states that 'poor tax behaviour is not consistent with the award of an honour', but an England triumph in Berlin on Sunday would almost certainly upstage that.\n\nSouthgate's tax affairs first came to light when he was appointed as England manager in 2016 and it did not prevent him from receiving an OBE after he led the team to the 2018 World Cup semi-final - there first since 1990.\n\nHe has since gone on to become the most successful England manager since Sir Alf Ramsey - taking his country to the Euro 2020 final, the 2022 World Cup quarter-final and Euro 2024 semi-final.\n\nSouthgate also reached his 100th match in charge whilst overseeing the dramatic penalty shootout victory against Switzerland on Saturday, only Sir Alf and Sir Walter Winterbottom have managed more.\n\nSouthgate's captain Harry Kane is also expected to be handed an upgrade to his MBE after the tournament - while other members of the squad could also be handed honours as well.\n\nDespite having a mixed Euro 2024, Kane is England's highest-ever scorer with 65 goals and is closing in on becoming just the 10th man to be capped 100 times by the country.\n\nRecent convention dictates that only the manager, captain and a handful of players get honours if England win a major sporting trophy.\n\nBut new Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who is an avid football fan and expected to attend Sunday's Euro 2024 final, may be forced to rip these rules up if England are victorious.\n\nUp to 40,000 England fans began descending on Dortmund yesterday ahead of the Three Lions' clash against the Netherlands.\n\nBut they could be outnumbered for the first time at this year's Euros as Dutch fans are expected to cross the German border - just a 45-minute drive from the semi-final venue - in big numbers.\n\nAt home 28 million fans are expected to watch or stream the game on ITV, beating the record for a match aired on a single channel.\n\nEngland's Euro 2020 semi-final against Denmark attracted 27.6 million on the same channel. Finals are shown on both BBC and ITV.\n\nIn Dortmund's main square yesterday, fans were eating and drinking after arriving from Dusseldorf, where England beat Switzerland on penalties in the quarter-finals.\n\nScott and Sam Fairbank had been due to return home on Sunday with daughter Freya, 13, but decided to remain in Germany after they 'caught the bug' of watching England.\n\nMr Fairbank, 43, from Sheffield, said extending the family's stay for the 'once-in-a-lifetime' match came at a price - two rooms for two nights in Dortmund has cost them \u00a31,600.\n\n'They've ripped our eyes out with the price of those rooms', he said.\n\n'And the accommodation is somewhat basic - but we fell in love with the whole experience around the Switzerland game'.\n\nMr Fairbank said they drove out on Friday after they told Freya's school she had 'German measles'.\n\nBut he added: 'When we decided to stay out we had to phone up the school again on Monday and come clean.'\n\nBrothers Denny and Ronnie Lovett from Dartford, Kent, also arrived in Dortmund after making the 36-mile trip from Dusseldorf - but saved cash by booking an Airbnb outside the city for \u00a350 per night.\n\nEstate agent Denny, 22, added: 'We've already booked accommodation in Berlin (for the final) - we're confident. You've got to back the team.'", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

to be one of the biggest matches of the tournament, with the Dutch supporters - known as Het Legioen (The Legion) - certain to create a raucous atmosphere.\n\nEngland fans are expected to be outnumbered, with officials estimating that 60 per cent of supporters will be from Het Legioen- 75,000 from the Netherlands are expected to travel to the city, which lies an hour from the Dutch border.\n\nFor many of the Netherlands' matches during the tournament the host city has been packed with Dutch supporters filling up fan zones in their iconic orange livery.\n\nEngland's official

Association spokesperson said that fans trying to buy tickets should do so through official routes.\n\nThomas Concannon told the i: 'Our advice to supporters would always be to go through the official Uefa portal rather than through any touts or third-party websites.'\n\nHe added that if England fans are unable to buy tickets for the match itself, they could go to fan parks and public viewing areas instead.\n\nOver the weekend the Mail spoke to fans trying to extend their stay in Germany after the success of Gareth Southgate's men against Switzerland.\n\nInvestment firm worker Rhys Godden, 28,

Pictured: England players celebrate after Trent Alexander-Arnold scores the winning penalty against Switzerland\n\nThe 80,000-capacity Westfalenstadion in Dortmund is expected to sell out for the match between England and the Netherlands\n\nOn one of these site, Viagogo, a seat in a prime location was listed as being available for \u20ac19,780 (\u00a316,500), reports The Telegraph.\n\nMeanwhile, on StubHub tickets ranged from \u20ac700 (\u00a3592) each for seats high up in one of the corners at Signal Iduna Park, rising to \u20ac16,090 (\u00a313,602) for a VIP package.\n\nREAD MORE Three Lions fans paint their towns red (and white) as they toast England making the Euro 2024 semis\n\nMany of these have since sold out, with eager fans willing to pay the price to see their team have a chance to reach the Euro 2024 final, which will be played on Sunday night at the Olympiastadion in Berlin.\n\nOutside the ground, hotels and AirBnBs are largely sold out, with Booking.com saying that 91 per cent of its listings in the city are unavailable on Wednesday night.\n\nThe Hotel Unique Dortmund Hauptbahnhof, for example, lists its cheapest room as being available for \u20ac1,803 (\u00a31,524) on its website for Wednesday's clash.\n\nBut the same sort of room a week later is priced at \u20ac83 (\u00a369).\n\nThe LivInn Hotel, a three-star establishment in the city lists a single room for an overnight stay on the day of the match as \u20ac1,235 (\u00a31,044).\n\nA week later the same room would be priced \u20ac95 (\u00a380).\n\nIt is a similar story on AirBnB, with one flat being listed for \u00a3923 for Wednesday, with the same venue costing \u00a3118 for the same days next week.\n\nWhile many England fans will have been staying in Germany over the last couple of weeks, some have been flying in and out of the country as and when the matches take place.\n\nDutch fans celebrate their teams victory over Turkey in the quarter-finals of Euro 2024 on Saturday\n\nDutch football supporters walk behind the Orangjebus during a fan walk to the Olympic stadium in Berlin ahead of their Euro 2024 clash with Turkey\n\nPlayers from the Netherlands celebrate with their fans after beating Turkey 2-1 to reach the Euro 2024 semi-finals\n\nOn StubHub the cheapest tickets for the match were being sold for \u20ac700, which is the equivalent of \u00a3592\n\nOn StubHub fans were being offered a VIP package for \u20ac16,090, which is the equivalent of \u00a313,602\n\nTwo Ryanair flights to Dortmund from London are sold out for the morning of the match, while on a third tickets are being sold at nearly five times the normal price\n\nRyanair flights from Dortmund back to London are sold out on Thursday and Friday after the match\n\nThose wanting to fly directly to Dortmund for the match this week face hiked prices for plane tickets as well, if they can get them.\n\nRyanair has two sold out flights leaving London Stansted for Dortmund on Wednesday morning, with tickets for a third flight going for a minimum of \u00a3250 when MailOnline checked earlier this morning.\n\nBy comparison flights leaving the same airport for Dortmund on the same day next week were being sold for a comparatively cheap \u00a356.\n\nAnd those looking for fly back with the same airline face a wait, with all Ryanair services from Dortmund to London sold out for Thursday and Friday, with the earliest available flight home on Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, security staff will be on alert amid claims England fans gained entry to their quarter-final win over Switzerland by 'doubling up' at turnstiles.\n\nMail Sport has seen evidence that some have been boasting about their ability to gain entry to the Dusseldorf Arena by squeezing through the entrance behind a fan with a valid ticket - and are now planning a repeat on Wednesday.\n\nFive people were arrested for trying to force their way into the stadium without a ticket, but others have bragged about managing to get inside. Such a scenario could create a considerable safety risk - amid a huge interest in the fixture - given the venue is likely to be bursting at the seams with tickets on resale markets going for as much as \u00a31,270.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I think we will win.'\n\nA group of four men from Huntingdon flew into Germany overnight, arriving in Dortmund at breakfast time and unfurled a flag with pictures of Bukayo Saka and Jordan Pickford and the title: 'Huntingdon Hotties'\n\nJosh Furnell, 26, said: 'I know it's a cliche but we really believe football is coming home this week.\n\n'England fans have waited 58 years since we won the World Cup in 1966 for the right to be called champions.\n\n'We will do it and we will be England's 12th man.'\n\nJosh Williams, 26, said: 'Each of us have paid about \u00a3500 for the whole trip. It is not a lot of money really when you take the importance of this game. If we win, we are in the final.'\n\nTheir friend Callum Barker, 32, added: 'We left Cambridge at 3 am this morning, got a redeye flight overnight from Stansted Airport and have only just got here.\n\n'We have been up all night and haven't slept. But the atmosphere is amazing. There are so many Dutch fans in Orange, we are clearly going to be outnumbered. But we will sing the loudest that we can for our team when we find the energy.'\n\nEngland fanatics Andy and Kirsty, who are there for the match, said it would be 'unbelievable' if England went all the way.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast, Andy said: 'It's my 16th tournament and it's a momentous tournament because they always are. We'll see what happens, we're feeling relatively positive. I'm feeling zen-like, we're ready.\n\n'If we win it that's my retirement from international football as a fan. I feel like we could be on a winning streak of semi-finals after so many disappointments.\n\n'We won the last semi-final against Denmark at Wembley (at Euro 2020), I feel like it's an even chance tonight.'\n\nKirsty added: '[I'm feeling] semi-confident, I've got to say. I'm really hoping to see them coming out fighting tonight. It's a big, strong, physical side we're against in the Netherlands but I'm ever hopeful.\n\n'Could you imagine if we won?! Unbelievable.'\n\nTanya, who has been in Germany to follow the team, told Good Morning Britain today that she believed football could be coming home.\n\nShe said: '[I've been here] since the third group game. It's been amazing, we're having a fantastic time and the best is yet to come.'\n\nMany of the travelling contingent have arrived in Dortmund over the last couple of days, with plenty basking in the glorious sunshine and warm temperatures yesterday.\n\nAmong those was the Fairbank family, made up of father Scott, mother Sam and their 13-year-old daughter Freya, who had been due to return home on Sunday but decided to extend their stay.\n\nScott, 43, from Sheffield, said the decision to stay on for the 'once in a lifetime' match came at a price - two rooms for two nights in Dortmund has cost them \u00a31,600.\n\n'They've ripped our eyes out with the price of those rooms', he said. 'And the accommodation is somewhat basic - but we fell in love with the whole experience around the Switzerland game'.\n\nWith a wry smile, Scott said the family drove out on Friday - having told Freya's school that she had 'German measles'.\n\nBut he added: 'When we decided to stay out we had to phone up the school again on Monday and come clean.'\n\nSam, who turned 41 yesterday, added: 'We came out earlier on for the group game against Slovenia. The match was disappointing but we had the best time in Cologne.\n\n'After Switzerland we were absolutely buzzing. We've loved our time in Germany, yet it's somewhere we would've probably never thought to travel to if it wasn't for the Euros.'\n\nBrothers Denny and Ronnie Lovett from Dartford, Kent, also moved on to Dortmund from Dusseldorf, but saved cash by staying in an AirBnB outside the city for just \u00a350 per night.\n\nDenny, 22, an estate agent, added: 'We've already booked accommodation in Berlin (for the final) - we're confident. You've got to back the team. I like it out here and don't want to go home, but I'll have to have a conversation with the boss if we win against the Dutch.'\n\nBack in England people have also been getting into the football spirit, with the Kings Guards seen playing Baddiel and Skinner's 'Three Lions' outside Buckingham Palace this morning.\n\nTonight 28million viewers are expected to watch the game on ITV and ITVX streaming, beating the record for a match aired on a single channel.\n\nEngland's Euro 2020 semi-final against Denmark attracted 27.6million on the same channel. Finals are shown on both BBC and ITV.\n\nThe audience is expected to be so great that the National Grid is preparing for a surge in demand for electricity during half time as millions of people use the toilet and put on the kettle at the same time.\n\nAnd for the pubs and breweries of Britain, the match will be one of the busiest days of the year, as 35million pints are expected to be downed by people watching the match - 17million of these will be drunk in bars and 18million at home.\n\nThree million people are expected to watch the game in bars, making it the biggest midweek night for decades thanks to 1am England-wide late licenses which were not in place for the midweek semi-finals at Euro 2020 or World Cup 2018.\n\nHowever, there will be no fan zone for fans to watch the game outside, with Mayor of London Sadiq Khan snubbed suggests of a 30,000-capacity location in Hyde Park.\n\nA spokesperson for the Mayor said the Greater London Authority is 'exploring the possibility of a screening for the final, should England progress.'\n\nIf the Three Lions do make it to the final on Sunday, Tesco will close its Express stores in England early to allow its staff to watch the game at home or in the pub, although online deliveries will continue as normal.\n\nManaging director of UK stores Kevin Tindall said: 'We will be cheering on the Three Lions tonight against the Netherlands and hope they reach a second successive Euros final.\n\n'We appreciate just how much this would mean to so many of our colleagues, and we want them to be able to celebrate with their family and friends.\n\n'So, if we make it through to the final, we will close our stores across England in time for them to get behind Gareth Southgate and the team, and we'll all be hoping that football will be coming home.'\n\nSome employers may feel the after-effects of an England victory tomorrow with 1.5million expected to call in sick, more than double the normal amount.\n\nThose who have travelled over to Dortmund have been joined by 100,000 Dutch fans, many of whom have made the relatively short journey from their home nation to the west German city in a bid to turn the streets orange.\n\nOn the table next to the Lovett brothers, Dutch students Yan Doldersam, 25, and Lucas Kalverla, 23, drove 90 minutes from their home town of Emmen. They were enjoying a beer in the central square in Dortmund with countryman Goleos Sepanial, 43 who lives in the city.\n\nYan said: 'We have had a similar tournament to England - the fans expected a lot more from our team than they have showed so far. I think tomorrow they will show it!'\n\nIn the border town of Aalten, many of its 27,000 residents have taken advantage of the close proximity of the matches and the lack of border restrictions to follow Ronald Koemen's Dutch team throughout the tournament.\n\nDutch restaurant manager Loes Oonk, who has decorated the front of her home with a giant Dutch flag with the lion emblem, will make the 60-minute journey over the border with seven friends for today's match in a mini bus.\n\nShe said: 'It is very easy for us to reach Dortmund, but not so easy for the English supporters. I think it will give our team an advantage to have so many people in orange shirts in the stadium to support them.\n\n'Maybe the English will have to work and will not be able to come in so many large numbers because of their jobs, but we will be able to come home the same evening from Germany.'\n\n'The match is the talk of Holland. We are also excited and really looking forward to it. Everyone is talking about it in this town too and getting their flags and orange shirts ready. Football is very important in the Netherlands, just like it is in England.'\n\nAhead of the match England boss Southgate said his team has the chance to make history tonight.\n\nHe said: 'We've listened to the challenges over the years and used them as motivation to break new ground.\n\n'We've never been to a final outside our own shores. These are opportunities to make a difference and that's how we have to look at it. We don't want to be burdened by what's happened before.\n\n'We have got to use this opportunity to change history as a motivation, and that's how the players see it. It's about their moment now, nothing that's gone on in the past. None of that is their fault or their concern.'\n\nAmid criticism of England's performances and Southgate's tactics throughout the Euros, the manager insisted team spirit was stronger than ever.\n\n'This group of players have really come together well over the last three or four weeks,' he said.\n\n'We've spoken about (playing with fear). When you sense that feeling, you need to confront it. It's no use hoping it will go away.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This capacity is maybe not big enough, and so we got some problems with mobility and fans will have a chance to see the match in the city centre, in the bar or in the restaurant, but they will have to find it before and it's maybe not easy half an hour before the game.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-decker_bus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Double-decker bus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flare", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westfalenstadion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Westfalenstadion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_band", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marching band"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Livery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utrecht", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Utrecht"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utrecht"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruud_Gullit", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ruud Gullit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tram", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/10/17/87169271-0-image-a-18_1720630077284.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719954", "eventUri": "eng-9719954", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 4253, "textEnd": 4260, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

According to prices on booking.com, a three-star hotel had a double room for \u00a31,546 on Wednesday but was just \u00a391 the next day.\n\nPolice have said the vast majority of England fans have been well-behaved but five were arrested for trying to get into the Dusseldorf Arena without a ticket on Saturday.\n\nWith tickets in high demand ahead of Wednesday, officers will be hoping there is no repeat of the Euro 2020 final chaos at Wembley when more than 80 fans were arrested after attempting to force their way into the ground.\n\nAs fans continued to treat the German hosts to England songs around Dusseldorf yesterday, Bukayo Saka, the hero of Saturday's win against Switzerland on penalties, also revealed that he was a fan of an adapted Abba song about him.\n\nFans have been singing \"Bukayooooo\" to the tune of the Swedish pop group's 1979 hit \"Voulez-Vous\".\n\n\"It's a lovely song,\" Saka told the Lions' Den live show from the England camp. \"It has that sound, you know, I can hear it straight away as soon as it starts.\n\n\"When I'm on the pitch I know straight away. It does [give me that buzz]. I always get carried away singing it sometimes.

After hitting a great shot at their training headquarters, Saka tripped over a golf bag, much to the amusement of his fellow players. The incident, shared online by the England team, was captioned \"From hero to zero\" with a playful note saying, \"Never change.\"\n\nFans on the move\n\nAs excitement builds for tomorrow's semi-final match against the Netherlands in Dortmund, about 30,000 England fans are making their way to Germany. The rush to secure match tickets, hotel rooms, and travel arrangements has caused prices to soar. Thousands of supporters began their journeys by plane, car, and camper van yesterday, creating an invasion that recalls the enthusiasm seen during the Italia '90 semi-finals.\n\nAirlines like Ryanair and British Airways are expected to provide extra flights to accommodate the high demand. Many fans are also undertaking the 750-mile round trips by ferry and road to ensure they don't miss the crucial match. This massive movement of supporters is likely to surpass the rush for the 1990 World Cup semi-final in Turin, where England unfortunately lost to Germany on penalties.\n\nThe 2018 World Cup semi-final in Russia saw far fewer England fans due to visa issues and security concerns. However, the current wave of enthusiasm for the semi-final in Germany is palpable. Tickets for Wednesday's game have reached astronomical prices, with some pairs selling for as much as \u00a325,376 on resale websites. Touts are taking advantage of the high demand, but the passion of England fans shows no signs of waning.\n\nEngland's build-up to the big game\n\nFans traveling to Dortmund are filled with hope and excitement. Many began their trips yesterday, forming a wave of support that stretches across Europe. This journey is reminiscent of past football pilgrimages, where fans showed unwavering support despite the odds. The determination of these fans highlights their belief in the team's potential to win.\n\nThe semi-final match against the Netherlands is crucial for Gareth Southgate's team. A victory would propel them into the final and allow them to make history. The match is set to be a challenging one, but the team is prepared to give their best performance, fueled by the support of their traveling fans.\n\nIf England wins the semi-final, they will advance to the final at Berlin's 71,000-capacity Olympiastadion. However, only 10,000 tickets will be officially allocated to England fans for the final, adding to tomorrow's match's pressure and excitement. This potential scarcity of tickets makes the semi-final even more significant, as fans hope to secure their place in football history.\n\nHistorical context and fan dedication\n\nEngland fans are no strangers to traveling long distances to support their team. The memories of the Italia '90 semi-final, despite the heartbreak of losing on penalties, remain vivid for many supporters. This time, they are hoping for a better outcome and are prepared to go to great lengths to cheer on their team.\n\nThe dedication of England fans is a testament to their unwavering support. Whether it's paying high prices for tickets or making long journeys by various means, their commitment is clear. The semi-final against the Netherlands is not just a football match; it's an event that brings people together, united by their love for the game and their national team.\n\nAs England prepares to face the Netherlands in the semi-final, the enthusiasm and dedication of their fans are evident. With thousands making the journey to Germany, the atmosphere in Dortmund is set to be electric. Bukayo Saka's light-hearted moment with the golf bag has provided a touch of humor, but the focus is now firmly on the match ahead. England fans are hoping for a victory that will take them one step closer to glory in Berlin.\n\nThe next few days will be crucial as fans and players alike gear up for what promises to be an unforgettable encounter. England's journey to Germany is not just a physical trip but a testament to their enduring passion for football.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fahad_hamid@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Fahad Hamid", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryanair", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryanair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British Airways"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Turin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiastadion_(Berlin)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympiastadion (Berlin)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Arena_and_Indoor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Arena and Indoor", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bukayo-Saka-showcases-relaxing-activity-before-Euro-2024-semifinal.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719954", "eventUri": "eng-9719954", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5529411764705883, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

But game by game - I've said that from game one in the group stages,\" Pickford said on Monday.\n\n\"We believe in ourselves but we've got to deliver on the night,\" he added.\n\nPickford's save from Manuel Akanji helped England beat Switzerland into the Euro 2024 semi-final as the game went to penalties after a 1-1 draw in extra time.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer also plans to keep an eye on the match from Washington DC, where he is currently attending the Nato summit with other global leaders.\n\nHe said that while phones were not allowed during important meetings, he hoped to be kept informed as to the game's developments.\n\n\"I've no doubt we'll be passed lots of notes with really important information about the summit, and one or two of those notes hopefully will be an update on the score, because I'm not going to be able to get it otherwise.\"\n\n\"I've sent a message to the team, obviously I wish them well, I want them to win, and let's hope they can do it,\" the prime minister added.\n\nDutch fans - who are expected to seriously outnumber England supporters tonight - are already out in force in Dortmund ahead of the match this evening\n\nTickets for tonight's match are \"like gold dust\", according to the England Football Supporters Association, with many fans flying over to Germany just to soak up the atmosphere rather than see the match in person.\n\nFans will also be keeping an especially close eye on German referee Felix Zwayer, who has history with England midfielder Jude Bellingham.\n\nThe player was fined by the German federation in 2021 after he referenced Zwayer's involvement in a match-fixing scandal back in 2006.\n\nWhen asked by ITV News Sports Editor Steve Scott if having Zwayer referee tonight's match made for an \"uncomfortable situation\", England left-back Luke Shaw said \"no, not at all\".\n\n\"I think we have to respect UEFA on whoever they decide to pick as the ref,\" Shaw said at a press conference on Monday.\n\n\"That won't change anything about us, I think we still just focus on the game in hand, not too much about what refs we've been given or this and that. So for us, it won't make any difference.\"\n\nOne half Dutch, half English football fan said she is rooting for England to \"go all the way\", but that she'll be bringing the Netherlands shirt as \"a back up\".\n\n\"My husband will be watching with his England shirt on... I normally support England and probably, if we win, I'll find myself cheering along,\" Emily Knight from Grantham, Lincolnshire said.\n\n\"It's more that the Dutch supporting element is like a back-up,\" she added.\n\nPolice presence is expected to be high in Dortmund and at fan screenings across the UK, but there were no incidents of arrests involving England fans on Tuesday, the UK Football Policing Unit confirmed.\n\nIf England win tonight's match they will face Spain after they defeated France 2-1 in their semi-final game on Tuesday.\n\nYou can watch coverage of the match on

It will be our biggest last-minute rush to a tournament. Dortmund is easy to get to and the atmosphere is amazing.\"\n\nSimon Harris, a long-standing member of the England Supporters Travel Club and a Conservative member of Shropshire Council, added: \"Why wouldn't you go? Russia and Qatar were expensive, and Covid ruined Euro 2020.\"\n\nThomas Concannon of the Free Lions Fans' Embassy, which provides travel and other advice to England supporters out in Germany, said: \"More fans are going out for the semi and there will be a good total of England fans there. Germany is much more accessible than recent tournaments.\"\n\nWere England to reach the final, they face ticket prices that had as of Monday already hit more than \u00a325,000 for a pair.\n\nResale site ticombo,com, selling 1,615 tickets to the final, was charging between \u00a33,020 and \u00a325,376 for two seats worth \u00a380-\u00a3850 at face value.\n\nTournament organiser Uefa said: \"We urge fans not to purchase tickets on the secondary market.\"\n\nThe Football Association would get just 10,000 official tickets for the final at Berlin's 75,000-capacity Olympiastadion were England to get there.\n\nBack in the UK, plans are already being looked at to put on a fan screening in London in the event that Gareth Southgate's side reach Sunday's final, but no additional events will be laid on for Wednesday's encounter.\n\nA spokesman for the Mayor of London said: \"The whole country is so proud of the England squad for making it to the semi-finals in what has been an edge-of-your-seat tournament and the Mayor can't wait to cheer them on against the Netherlands.\n\n\"Official Fan Zones are only created when London is a host city for the tournament, as was the case for the men's Euro 2020 and women's Euro 2022.\n\n\"The GLA is exploring the possibility of a screening of the final, should England progress.\"\n\nBreweries were rushing an estimated extra 50 million pints of beer to pubs in what could be their most lucrative midweek since the 2018 World Cup semi-finals after coronavirus restrictions prevented them fully cashing in on the team's run to the Euro 2020 final.\n\nA bonanza of up to \u00a3250 million from food and drink sales would provide a welcome boost to the industry and British Beer and Pub Association chief executive Emma McClarkin said: \"Breweries are busy sending extra deliveries to pubs so they are stocked for such a crucial midweek match.

One has given me a can he snuck in.\n\n'Very much a minority of the Orange army, who the vast majority have been great banter, but was started by them nonetheless.'\n\nThe fans were finally allowed to leave Sausalitos around 6.40pm, prompting Ben to post 'Finally let free by the German Old Bill, off to the game we go', with just over an hour to go before kickoff.\n\nThe UK Football Policing Unit released a statement saying: 'We are aware of some reports and videos circulating of disorder in Dortmund.\n\n'It appears that there have been several instances of Dutch fans attacking England fans in bars and attempting to steal flags.\n\n'We are also aware that in addition to the tens of thousands of Dutch fans there to enjoy the game, there are groups of risk supporters who have travelled to Dortmund from the Netherlands.'\n\nUK police are in Germany working alongside local police in Dortmund where some 80,000 Dutch fans have gathered.\n\nThat's double the 40,000 England supporters believed to be present for the semi-final game.\n\nMORE : The story behind why the Netherlands wear orange whilst playing football", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "danny_rigg@metro.co.uk", "name": "Danny Rigg", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "T-shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hurling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_in_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement in the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Joyce_(footballer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben Joyce (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulevard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boulevard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_light", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Street light"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tattoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orange County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orange County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SEC_212276652-b060_1720635093.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719954", "eventUri": "eng-9719954", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

And Gareth Southgate's side will have to tackle Ronald Koeman's players and also silence the massed ranks of an estimated 80,000 Dutch supporters who will outnumber Three Lions fans by two to one in the city.\n\nMany German 'neutrals' will also be backing their near neighbours after blaming English ref Anthony Taylor for not awarding them a penalty during the 2-1 quarter final defeat to Spain. A petition demanding he is removed from the list of Uefa referees has received more than 213,000 signatures.\n\nBut the host country's bar owners are praying England progress to the final so their fans can carry on drinking. In Dusseldorf, Vangelis Chantzis, landlord of Irish pub Fatty's, said: \"Nobody here has ever seen anything like it. We hope they stay in as long as possible.\"\n\nMarinko Miletic, an ex professional footballer who now helps out in his family owned bar Ham Ham in Dusseldorf, said: \"We are definitely hoping that England will win tomorrow and we hope that it is coming home for England, because it has been a great time with all the English fans from the start.\"\n\nUp to 40,000 England fans are expected to arrive in Dortmund for the match, with around half that cheering on the team inside the stadium, which is home to the German side Borussia Dortmund. But most fans will be staying in nearby towns and cities, as accommodation is scarce and expensive.\n\nThe Dorint hotel in Dortmund advertised a double room on Wednesday for \u00a32,188, which is available on Thursday for \u00a3102. Tens of thousands of Dutch supporters will also make the short 146 mile journey across their border to Dortmund.\n\nWhat team should England name vs the Netherlands? Share your thoughts in the comments below\n\nTickets for the sold out match are being advertised for between three and four times their face value on resale websites. Category 3 tickets, which were sold by Uefa for \u00a3164, could be bought on one site for between \u00a3560 and \u00a3633.\n\nTwo of the first English fans to arrive were Niven Penprase, 63, and Shaun Wilcox, who said they were \"living the dream\" as they soaked up the sun and downed a couple of cold beers in Dortmund. The pair from Plymouth, Devon, have been travelling around Germany with two pals in a motorhome.\n\nShaun, 60, said: \"This is a bucket list trip for us and we are loving it. To see the national team play in a tournament abroad has been tremendous. We are like little schoolboys fulfilling our dream.\"\n\nNiven, a retired gas engineer, said: \"We have seen the Bellingham goal, an extra time win and a penalty shoot-out. It has been a roller coaster ride but we are loving it.\"\n\nHe added: \"We said we would come over and stay for as long as England are in the competition and we are still here. We have got to the semi-final without playing our best. I think we have got another gear that we can up on. Hopefully we will be in Berlin next weekend.\"\n\nMax Hanson, 27, a health care assistant from Kent, has been in Germany since the start of Euro 2024 after booking the time off work last October. He said:\"I promised I would go back as soon as England got knocked out but I'm still here.\"\n\nAnd Max believes the team can reach the final. \"I think against Switzerland we looked a lot better. Defensively we have looked strong and I think a good defence wins you tournaments\" he said.\n\n\"We have a chance of winning, we definitely have the players to do so.\" He added: \"This is my first tournament and it has been really good. I've found Germany to be an amazing country. I can't fault it.\"\n\nDutch and English fans mingled happily in the sunshine outside bars and restaurants in the city on Tuesday. Gill Bishop and Mick Smith, from Preston, Lancs, had driven over in their camper van after a spur of the moment decision moments after the victory over Switzerland.\n\nIT worker Gill, 53, said: \"I had told my boss I was thinking of taking a couple of days off and then I called him on Saturday night to tell him I was going to Germany. We booked the Eurostar about ten minutes later and here we are.\"\n\nBuilder Mick added: \"Everybody is so laid back here. The atmosphere is superb.\" Russell Gibbons, 52, and Mark Partridge, 42, from Bristol, have watched three of England's games so far and are also guaranteed tickets if they reach the final.\n\nMortgage company worker Russell said: \"It has been a really good atmosphere and the policing has been superb. It has been so relaxing. We have got a train pass and have been travelling all over.\"\n\nMark said: \"The Germans have been fantastic. The people have been brilliant.\" The two pals are confident England will be going to Berlin on Sunday.\n\nRussell said: \"To be honest, the football has been dreadful, but we are still here. It has not been entertaining but who cares if we get through to Berlin and bring home the trophy.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Pauli.\n\n\"According to initial findings, a person threatened police officers with a pickaxe and an incendiary device.\n\n\"The officers then used their firearms.\n\n\"The attacker was injured and is currently receiving medical treatment.\"\n\nPolice say the attack had \"no football connection\" and the perpetrator was attacking alone at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, shots were heard during the heated Italy-Albania match, leaving a 23-year-old seriously injured.\n\nThe man was hit in his leg and arm in the Berlin district of Moabit, as cops armed with submachine guns launched an urgent manhunt for the attacker.\n\nSix shots were fired on Rathenower Strasse, near Turmstrasse, opposite the Tiergarten district court, Bild reports.", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

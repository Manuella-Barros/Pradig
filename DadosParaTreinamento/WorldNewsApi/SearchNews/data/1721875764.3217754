{"id": 239724704, "title": "Mobile AR, MR Surge At AWE 2024", "text": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin The 15th Augmented World Expo (AWE) took place in Long Beach this week. Mixed Reality (MR) on the Oculus Quest and Apple Vision Pro, and a surge in mobile AR tools, dominated the show, with AI having a remarkably low profile. So much for my predictions about the show. Collage of people on the Expo floor. AWE AWE was exceptionally well programmed, with 500 speakers over a dozen tracks in three days. The show featured a fireside chat with Oculus inventor Palmer Lucky, a marvelous XR museum, the first 101 members of the AWE Hall of Fame, and the annual Auggie awards show. On the expo floor were 300 exhibitors, with a strong showing from developers of XR entertainment content. AWE always kicks off with a \u201cState of the XR Union\u201d keynote from co-founder and Executive Director, Ori Inbar. He opened, as usual, with a few computer gags. This year he walked onto the stage wearing a Vision Pro, and repeatedly used face filters to add humor and flair to his twenty minute speech.

Slides with estimates on XR market size of $35 Billion (ARtillery Intelligence), XR related announcements tech\u2019s magnificent seven, and estimates like one in four US teens plays VR games (Pew Research), elicited cheers from the audience and exhortations like \u201cthe time is now!\u201d Inbar ended his talk with a remarkable bit of self-effacing humor, presenting a slide of his predictions for the XR industry in 2014, the most outlandish of which was the prediction of worldwide adoption of over a billion headsets by 2023. Xreal released its Beam Pro made exclusively for their Air 2 at AWE 2024. Xreal Tuesday morning also featured the most important sponsors and announcements, which came from Niantic, Qualcomm, Snap, and Zappar about mobile AR and spatial computing production tools. Niantic, the company behind the hit PokemonGo, opened up its Niantic Studio with WebXR. No app download needed. It runs in the browser. Users can utilize spatial anchors to place their creations in specific geographic places in the physical world. Niantic also released an updated version of Scaniverse. Using a new technique called Guasian Splatting the scanning app does volumetric capture in seconds using the smartphone\u2019s cameras and AI, running locally on-device. This is a category killer. No one in vol cap can compete with something this fast, free and high quality. Meta Jamie Keane of Meta opened their speaking slot with examples of successful applications of MR for enterprises and education, emphasizing that VR\u2019s killer app is training and simulation, using nursing as an example of its application in higher education.

AWE Anand Dass, Director of Mixed Reality Apps, was effusive as he shared stats to illustrate Meta\u2019s progress: $2B spent in the Quest Store, 500 titles on Quest, one fifth for MR, and more than $10M earned by 20 developers. \u201cToday we are excited to announce for the first time at AWE, The Meta Quest lifestyle app accelerator,\u201d Dass announced to applause. \u201cThis is a brand new six-month program for Quest developers and Founders to prototype new lifestyle experiences with mixed reality and AI. We want to support Founders who are interested in building fun retentive engaging consumer experiences that leverage the superpowers of the meta Quest platform in emerging lifestyle categories like food and art and music and crafts and dating and fashion and beauty and things that we haven't even thought about which a lot of you are hacking.\u201d The accelerator provides seed stage funding to prototype, access to technical product and design resources, and dedicated mentorship. Snap CTO Bobby Murphy again delivered its keynote and participated in the fireside chat with ARtillery principal Mike Boland. Murphy\u2019s talk was primarily about the evolving Generative AI tools in their proprietary game engine, Snap Lens Studio, but first he reviewed the many advances in mobile AR tools Snap has already made, and the billion user generated experiences that have been made as a result. \u201cWe want to put AI out there in the world,\u201d he said of AI. Creators can now prompt GenAI images inside Lens Studio. Previously users had to go to Turbosquid or Epic Games\u2019 Sketchfab to choose assets for AR experiences. Connell Gauld, co-founder and CTO of Zappar. Charlie Fink Connell Gauld, Zappar\u2019s CTO, demonstrated a major upgrade to the Zap.works AR game engine, now called Mattercraft, which is a browser-based 3D content development environment It\u2019s a no code, WebXR development tool solution that represents a significant upgrade in the capabilities in animation, transparent video, world tracking, and device capability. It also works with headsets. Chi Xu, founder and CEO of XReal, the most popular and successful AR eyewear maker, says his company now has 45% of the AR glasses market. They\u2019ve had the most success with the Air, which is a screen reflector that tethers to your smartphone and projects its screen as a 200\u201d display seen from several feet away. XReal introduced the Beam Pro, an Android smartphone made specifically for its headset. It also sports dual cameras, allowing stereography like the Vision Pro. After eight years of AWE, I finally got a selfie with Palmer Lucky. Charlie Fink Palmer Lucky, founder of Oculus, is the main attraction at any show he attends, particularly AWE. People trailed behind him on the show floor hoping for a selfie. Lucky was a good sport about it, chatting with each of the dozens of people who approached him. Using the Mixed Reality feature of the Meta Quest 3. AWE This was Lucky\u2019s first AWE appearance since 2018, and it fit nicely into the historic theme of this 15th annual show. As a speaker, Lucky is even more of a rock star. The man is a sound bite machine. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a whiz kid, everyone wants to talk to you. When you\u2019re a whiz man, nobody cares.\u201d - Palmer Lucky Lucky had promised on X that he would reveal details on his next headset at AWE, so the room was packed at his fireside chat with Darshan Shankar, expertly moderated by VR director Stephanie Riggs. Shankar is the founder and CEO of Bigscreen, which created the new Biscreen Beyone tethered PC VR headset. \u201cMy strong opinion is that one of the most valuable assets you have as a young person is your age. People want to help you when you\u2019re young,\u201d Lucky said. \u201cI benefited from this in my early career so much. One of the reasons John Carmak was willing to talk to me is because I was a nineteen year old kid. When you\u2019re a whiz kid, everyone wants to talk to you. When you\u2019re a whiz man, nobody cares.\u201d Darshan Shankar, founder and CEO of BigScreen VR, with Oculus founder Palmer Lucky and VR director ... [+] Stephanie Riggs Sonya Haskins Lucky made good on his promised disclosure but it was anticlimactic. He has nothing to show except he brought a prop, an antique Oculus DK-1 VR headset. All Lucky said was that his new VR headset was an extension of Anduril\u2019s defense work. His comments around the ten year old prototype allowed him to emphasize, as Inbar had, the success of VR over the past decade. Overinflated expectations are the problem, Lucky said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand how far things have come.\u201d Returning to the history theme, legendary University of Washington Professor Tom Furness gave a talk about his long history with VR, going all the way back to 1966, when he was a young lieutenant in the air force puzzling over the critical human factors in the design of fighter jets. Furness has spent his career designing what he calls \u201cthe fighter jet of the mind.\u201d The ill-fated Nintendo Virtual Boy was launched in 1995. It was the esteemed game company's biggest ... [+] flop of all time. AWE Unfortunately, I\u2019ve run out of time and space to delve deeper into this remarkable 15th annual XR show. As a teaser, here's a shot of the 1999 Nintendo Virtual Boy, included in XR history museum. There is so much to see and talk about it\u2019s impossible to fit it in one story. I follow up shortly with some more of my experiences on the show floor, the Auggie Award Winners, and Best in Show Awards.

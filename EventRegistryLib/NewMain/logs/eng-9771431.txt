The Fallout 4 mod has been praised for its story and world-building, but is plagued with crashes affecting gameplay.\n\nThe creators of the Fallout 4 total conversion mod Fallout: London have promised to fix the game's \"reported technical issues\" soon. While this Fallout 4 mod was recently released with mostly positive acclaim from fans, it currently has several game-breaking issues, effectively preventing some people from playing it.\n\nOriginally announced by the non-profit modding group Team FOLON in 2021, Fallout: London was recently released on GOG. The mod is entirely free, but it was released on the store because its files were too big for other modding platforms such as Nexus Mods. Despite being praised for its story and world-building, however, many gamers experienced constant crashes when they started playing Fallout: London.\n\nRelated\n\nFallout London: Where to Find Dove's Dilemma (Catching Up Quest Guide)\n\nThe Sidequest \"Catching Up\" has players tracking down books to help Sabertooth Syd learn his letters, but one book can be troublesome to find.\n\nNow, Team FOLON has thanked the community for their support and promised to fix the reported technical issues currently plaguing Fallout: London. While the team did not give an official date for an update, Team FOLON claims that the patch will come out \"soon.\" In the meantime, gamers should carefully read the installation instructions of the game before installing it to avoid compatibility issues. The use of Fallout 4's Buffout 4 mod is also indicated to diminish crashes.\n\nTeam FOLON Promises to Solve Fallout: London's Technical Issues\n\nAt the moment, Fallout: London has a score of 3.3/5 on GOG. While it still has many positive reviews, considering it's a huge and complex mod made by a non-profit group, the score is likely affected by the many issues gamers had while playing it. It's easy to find multiple comments on the game's page stating that Fallout: London crashes all the time, essentially making it unplayable for a significant portion of the user base.\n\nClose\n\nPC gamers who want to try out Fallout: London can do it if they currently have GOG or Steam copies of Fallout 4. Due to the need to downgrade Fallout 4's version for the mod to work, the Epic Games Store of Fallout 4 is not compatible with Fallout: London, as the EGS platform does not give players that option.\n\nUnfortunately, there are still no updates from Team FOLON regarding a console release of Fallout: London. Team FOLON has previously confirmed that Fallout: London won't be available for consoles, as its files are too big to be allowed on the console modding platforms, the same problem that prevented the game from being on Nexus Mods. If Bethesda's owner, Microsoft, would make an exception for the game, this could be possible, but gamers should not hold their breaths, as it's unlikely that this would happen.\n\nFallout 4\n\nFallout 4 is an RPG in the Fallout series, being the fourth major installment. This time around, players are in The Commonwealth, formerly Massachusetts, in the year 2287.\n\nRPG\n\nAction\n\nSystems\n\nOpenCritic Reviews Top Critic Rating:87/100 Critics Recommend:89%\n\nFranchise Fallout\n\nPlatform(s) PC , PS4 , PS5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X , Xbox Series S\n\nReleased November 10, 2015\n\nDeveloper(s) Bethesda\n\nPublisher(s) Bethesda\n\nEngine Creation\n\nESRB M FOR MATURE: BLOOD AND GORE, INTENSE VIOLENCE, STRONG LANGUAGE, USE OF DRUGS\n\nHow Long To Beat 27 Hours\n\nX|S Enhanced No\n\nPS Plus Availability Extra & Premium\n\nFile Size Xbox Series 36 GB (May 2024)\n\nExpand", "source": {"uri": "gamerant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Game Rant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gabriel_machado_pureza@gamerant.com", "name": "Gabriel Machado Pureza", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_modding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game modding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOG.com", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "GOG.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_Mods", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nexus Mods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steam (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Games_Store", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epic Games Store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Software Rating Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Role-playing video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Softworks", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bethesda Softworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Action game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Platform game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 4"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Multiplayer", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Multiplayer", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Mod", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Mod", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/fallout-london-creators-promise-fixes-to-mods-biggest-issues-soon.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771431", "eventUri": "eng-9771431", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-11-10", "textStart": 3365, "textEnd": 3382}], "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

Fallout: London mod captures the British essence with landmarks, accents, & factions like Knights of Camelot. Modding, like with Fallout: London , showcases the robustness of Bethesda's Creation Kit, allowing for total conversion mods.\n\nBethesda has always ensured that the settings of Fallout games have had a strong influence on the title that uses them, and the mod authors of Fallout: London understand this well. Whether it be the Mojave Desert of New Vegas or the Boston area of Fallout 4, each title in the series has a distinct feeling, specific factions, and recognizable landmarks from each of its settings. Without this, there wouldn't be a strong feeling of something brand new whenever another Fallout is released, and Fallout: London does this well enough to feel like a proper spin-off sequel.\n\nAlthough Bethesda is likely to keep the Fallout franchise within the US, even though it has expanded onto the silver screen, modders have decided to take the series abroad, using Fallout 4 as a base. Fallout: London is exactly what people would expect when they hear the name. The series has made it across the pond to England, specifically to its capital, where players of the mod can enjoy everything British while surviving the irradiated wasteland they all know and love from Fallout. It is a total conversion of Fallout 4 and is only available on PC.\n\nRelated\n\n10 Fun Fallout 4 Easter Eggs You Might Have Missed\n\nFallout 4 is jam-packed with references to movies, TV shows, literature, and other games for players to find with these being some of the best.\n\nSettings Are Pivotal To Each Fallout Game\n\nFactions & Storylines Depend On Them\n\nClose\n\nThe settings of Fallout games have always been an underrated part of the titles. Usually, players focus on the many, many Vaults and their experiments or the longstanding factions everyone knows and loves, like the zealous Brotherhood of Steel, but visiting famous landmarks of specific cities has always been a part of Fallout's DNA. Without it, there wouldn't be the added context of what was lost when the bombs were dropped and when the world was turned into an apocalyptic wasteland filled with irradiated cockroaches and feral Deathclaws.\n\nSettings also inform what kind of factions a Vault Dweller (or Courier) can expect when venturing out into the world. With the Mojave being in California, New Vegas made sure to give the NCR a big role in the game, with them previously appearing in Fallout 2. Caesar's Legion was made to be in conflict with the NCR, while Mr House (a play on the house always wins) was made as the ruler of New Vegas. This isn't the only game that lets its setting influence the factions and major players, as Fallout 4 did, too.\n\nMr House makes an appearance in the Fallout series. There, he's known as Robert House and is in charge of RobCo Industries.\n\nAlthough mentioned before, the Institute is a major player in Fallout 4 and was founded by surviving students of the Commonwealth Institute of Technology (C.I.T), which is Fallout's equivalent of M.I.T. The university's famed knowledge of science and technology in real life influenced the Institute, and from that, the Railroad was founded in opposition. Fallout 4 also introduced the Commonwealth Minutemen, who used Fort Independence as a base, which they later called The Castle.\n\nFallout: London Is So Delightfully British\n\nBrings London To Life\n\nArguably, the mod team behind Fallout: London takes the use of its setting even further than prior titles in the series. Everything from locations, clothing, and dog breeds has been influenced by London, with some characters wearing the Union Jack on jackets and having the punk aesthetic that took Britain by storm in the 70s. German Shepherds have been replaced by the mighty Bulldog, while players can visit landmarks like St Paul's Cathedral and the Millennium Wheel.\n\nThe Millennium Wheel was made to celebrate the millennium and is also known as the London Eye.\n\nThe mod authors have gone the extra mile with accents, too, ensuring that the many, many regional accents of London have been lovingly captured by a capable voice cast, with Lambeth being home to many with a cockney accent, for instance. The iconic Big Ben and the Elizabeth tower are present, as well as streets filled with ruined, red, double-decker buses. Even the London Underground's Tube Network has been lovingly recreated, with the tubes actually racing through the stations.\n\nMuch like other Fallout games, the factions have been influenced by the setting, too. One of Britain's most famous legends revolves around King Arthur and Camelot, so the developers took this legend and created the Knights of Camelot faction, complete with a round table and all. There are also the Vagabonds (based on British gangs like the Peaky Blinders), the Gentry (based on the British aristocracy), and Tommies, who are based on WW1 soldiers. Tommies got their name because many English soldiers were called Tommy.\n\nRelated\n\nIngenious Fallout 4 Build Makes Sure The Sole Survivor Will Never Run Out Of Ammo\n\nA Fallout 4 player has created an impressive new build that ensures they will never run out of ammo again.\n\nFallout: London Proves Modding Is Bigger Than Ever\n\nTotal Conversion Mods Are Becoming The Norm\n\nWith the level of freedom that the Creation Kit for its games provides, Bethesda has ensured that its titles can last far longer than other single-player titles just because there is a constant stream of content flowing to them. Fallout: London is a well-researched, lovingly made passion project the size of a full game, but it is not the only one made for a Bethesda title. Enderal: Forgotten Stories, a total conversion for Skyrim, is another example and shows that the Creation Kit gives players the tools as long as they bring the passion.\n\nThe Creation Kit is a modding tool made for Bethesda games, like Skyrim and Fallout 4, which uses the Creation Engine.\n\nWith references to both British history, particularly WW1 with the Tommies and WW2 with hanging Spitfire fighters, and folklore with the Camelot faction, this shows that the mod isn't just surface level when it comes to using its setting. Much like previous Fallout titles, landmarks haven't just been recreated, the areas have also been cleverly used too. Fallout: London uses the Thames River to create the shanty town-like settlement of Thameshaven and St Paul's Cathedral to make St Paul's Sanctuary, similar to Diamond City in Fallout 4.\n\nA game's setting will always be important in informing what developers can use to make their title feel more immersive. Fallout: London has followed in the footsteps of prior titles in the series by putting its setting center stage and allowing it to not only give players memorable landmarks to visit but also inform what factions are present. The way the setting has been used has made the mod both a brilliant tribute to the Fallout franchise and a creative love letter to London and all things British.\n\nSource:

Community builds in Fallout 4 have evolved in quality over the years. Exploiting glitches allows for more creativity in Fallout 4 settlement building.\n\nA Fallout 4 player online has recreated the Battle Bus from Fortnite in the game, bringing it to life above the Spectacle Island settlement. There's no shortage of amazing Fallout 4 settlements, but this latest creation is one of the coolest yet.\n\nEver since the launch of Fallout 4 in 2015, the game's community has used the settlement-building features to great effect. While many of the builds in the early years were much simpler, settlement creations recently have gone up a notch in quality, thanks to more players than ever becoming familiar with the tools, and pushing to see exactly what they're capable of. Many of these community settlement builds serve different purposes. Some are there for aesthetics, while others can be built to provide a helping hand throughout the game. One Fallout 4 player even built a super-efficient ammo factory, ensuring they were never left wanting for bullets during their playthrough.\n\nRelated\n\nFallout 4 Trick Helps You Get Best Power Armor in the Game Without Doing Its Quest\n\nA Fallout 4 player highlights a unique trick that helps in acquiring the best Power Armor in the game without doing its lengthy quest.\n\nRedditor White_Knight_413 shared their awesome Fallout 4 settlement build, which they've created above Spectacle Island. It's a fantastic recreation of the Fortnite Battle Bus, and there's even an image of it for comparison. It's safe to say that White_Knight_413 absolutely nailed it on this occasion, although it isn't clear how they actually plan to get up there without console commands to make this usable.\n\nFortnite's Battle Bus Recreated in Fallout 4\n\nMany in the thread were simply confused about the logistics of how White_Knight_413 was able to build so high up in the air in the first place. One player gave a strong explanation about how a Fallout 4 glitch may have been used, explaining \"OP built high up, built the bus on a foundation, and then removed the foundation, leaving the bus suspended.\" It's cool to see small bugs in the game be exploited in a way that allows players to be even more creative with the settlements system, and there's certainly even more potential for similar ideas using the same glitch.\n\nClose\n\nThe Fallout series is in an interesting place right now. Demand for a new title in the series is arguably as strong as it has ever been. Thanks to the TV series' success, it has a ton of new fans, but Bethesda is clearly tied up with the development of The Elder Scrolls 6, which could roll on for years yet. It also seems hesitant to pass the franchise off to a third party in the meantime. Regardless, there are still some cool Fallout things for gamers to enjoy right now. The massive mod Fallout: London recently shadow-dropped, taking the series to England for the first time, and players seem to be loving what it has to offer. While it's not an official expansion, it's still worth a try.\n\nFallout 4\n\nFallout 4 is an RPG in the Fallout series, being the fourth major installment.

Fallout 4's expansion sized total conversion mod, Fallout London, has been in development and making waves for years, and now, it is finally out, allowing players to dive into a huge, entirely new, if unofficial, Fallout journey. Here, we're going to go over all the key details that you should know about it.\n\nSTORY\n\nBeing an unofficial mod, Fallout London is obviously not going to be part of the series' canon, but it is promising to tell an interesting story. The game is set in the year 2237, which puts it between the events of Fallout 1 and 2, and roughly 50 years before the events of Fallout 4. What makes it particularly interesting, however, is the fact that, as its name gives away, it's set in London. Never in the history of the Fallout franchise have we stepped outside of the United States of America, so it should be interesting to see what Fallout London's take on the post-apocalyptic remains of the English city are. From a narrative perspective, the mod focuses on several factions vying for control over London- but more on that in a bit. For now, let's speak about London itself.\n\nMAP DETAILS\n\nBeing able to explore the post-nuclear remains of the city of London in Fallout's post-apocalyptic world is obviously one of the bigger draws of this mod, but what exactly can we expect from the map? According to the development team, Team FOLON, the mod's map is going to be quite a sizeable one- as large as the map of Fallout 4's base game and its Far Harbor DLC put together, in fact, which, if you've played those two, sounds like a huge play area. In total, the map is divided into 15 boroughs, and according to Team FOLON, there's as much as 90 hours of content for players to get through.\n\nFallout: London is looking to leverage its London setting in some truly interesting ways- including giving us a glimpse into an alternative reality where we could see what a Fallout game set outside of the USA and the series' focus on Americana-driven satire would look like. According to Team FOLON, you can expect plenty of elements that are usually staples of the franchise to be MIA in this game. For starters, in the Fallout lore the Forced Evolutionary Virus (or FEV) never made its way to London, which means all of the monstrosities and nightmarish creatures it created won't be in the mod either. That includes Super Mutants and Deathclaws, among other things. Additionally, you can also expect Vault-Tec to have no presence in London whatsoever, since it's an American company- though you can expect other, dingier underground vaults.\n\nWEAPONS\n\nAnother area where it looks like Fallout London is attempting to deliver a different kind of Fallout experience is the combat, which, according to Team FOLON, is going to be much less focused on gunplay. Instead, players can expect melee weapons to play a much larger role, to the extent of being the only weapons you'll be using at times. Gunplay has admittedly never been one of Fallout's strengths, but the shooting did see significant improvements in Fallout 4 over previous titles, so it should be interesting to see how Fallout London fares with its combat changes.\n\nFactions have always played a huge role in any Fallout experience (or any Bethesda Game Studios RPG, for that matter), and yes, there will be plenty of those that players will be crossing paths with in Fallout: London as well. The most powerful of them all is the Gentry, who are the current rulers of London and descendants of the pre-war aristocracy and government, who are looking to rebuild the United Kingdom once more. Then there are the Tommies, a militia that has become a tool for the Gentry; 5th Column, an anarchist faction looking to tear down the established rule in London in order to rebuild a new empire; and the Camelot Republic, an underground resistance movement that is also looking to remove the Gentry from power and instead replace them with a new representative republic government.\n\nMORE FACTIONS\n\nYes, there are still more factions to talk about- London is a big place after all, and there's plenty of different groups with their own motivations and goals that you'll be working with and against. There's the Isle of Dogs Syndicate, for instance, which is essentially a gang in control of Millwall that runs a sizeable smuggling operation. There are the Vagabonds, who are described as the mortal enemies of the aforementioned Ise of Dogs Syndicate, and are on a quest for revenge. There's also the elusive and mysterious group known as Angel, rumoured to be descendants of a secret pre-war science ministry who have eyes all over the city. In total, Team FOLON says there are 20 factions\n\nLike the series that it owes its existence to, Fallout London is also going to feature a number of different companion characters that players will be able to meet, recruit, and head out on quests with. In total, there are going to be seven companion characters, each of whom will bring their own story tidbits and ties to different factions.\n\nDIALOGUE\n\nFallout: London may be a mod based on Fallout 4, but it's looking to tweak the base gameplay experience in some notable ways. For instance, the base game's dialogue system has been expanded for the mod, with Team FOLON promising an experience that places choice and consequence mechanics front and center, something that Fallout 4 was criticized for not doing. Additionally, the development team has also confirmed that the main protagonist in the mod isn't voiced, which is another area where the base game drew criticism. Additionally, speaking of voice acting, though the protagonist is going to be a silent one, all major characters in Fallout: London will be fully voiced.\n\nSeveral other finer details have also been revealed on Fallout London. For instance, settlements - a core component of the Fallout 4 base game - is going to be part of the experience here as well, with a total of seven new and unique settlements included in the mod. In addition to that, players can expect dynamic new animations, new craftable items, new weapons to use in combat, as many as 200 quests, and more. Oh, and for those of you wondering whether Fallout London is ever going to show up on consoles- Team FOLON says the mod is going to be available only on PC. Will that possibly change in the future? Never say never, I guess, but that's not the plan right, at least.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nTo be able to access Fallout London, you're going to need not just the Fallout 4 base game, but also all of its DLC (which means you could also just buy the Game of the Year Edition). Available via both Steam and GoG, the mod will also need you to disable cloud saves, and will replace the actual, official game entirely. If you want to get the game back, you'll have to uninstall it and the mod, before reinstalling the former again.", "source": {"uri": "gamingbolt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GamingBolt"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shubhankar_parijat@gamingbolt.com", "name": "Shubhankar Parijat", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_modding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game modding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Game_Studios", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bethesda Game Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfield_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starfield (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canon (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Elder Scrolls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "City of London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "City of London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mutant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Mutant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4:_Far_Harbor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4: Far Harbor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melee_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melee weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Role-playing video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alternate history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristocracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aristocracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downloadable content"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quest (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOG.com", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GOG.com"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://gamingbolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/fallout-london.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771431", "eventUri": "eng-9771431", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

At the same time, the success of Amazon's Fallout TV series, combined with the almost decade-long lapse between releases, means that demand for a new Fallout is greater than ever. In light of these facts, it may be in Bethesda's best interest to outsource the IP.\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time the company has done something like this. 2010's Fallout: New Vegas, which is often considered the best entry in the series, was not developed by Bethesda Game Studios, the team behind Fallout 3 and eventually Fallout 4. Instead, it came from Obsidian Entertainment, and this fresh set of minds allowed New Vegas to experiment with several role-playing elements that BGS either didn't consider or decided not to implement in its first Fallout game, ultimately leading to a more distinct and original final product. Bethesda could do this again, and there's one beloved studio that would be the perfect candidate.\n\n1:36\n\nRelated\n\nFallout 5 Can Step Up Its Building Game By Following Starfield's Lead\n\nOne highly creative feature from Bethesda's sci-fi adventure Starfield has every reason to find its way into the developer's next Fallout game.\n\nBethesda Should Hand Larian Studios the Reins to Fallout\n\nClose\n\nLarian's RPG Chops Could Make for a Great Fallout Experience\n\nLarian Studios, the company behind the awards-dominating Baldur's Gate 3, has done more than enough to establish itself as a powerful force in the CRPG space. BG3 itself is seen by many as the pinnacle of the studio's prowess, as it provides a deep, dizzyingly complex role-playing adventure, characterized by countless layers of decision-making and multifaceted build variety. Indeed, Baldur's Gate 3 is a triumph within the RPG genre, and it's clear that Larian still has more gas in the tank.\n\nThough BG3 catapulted the studio into the mainstream, Larian had already found respect among CRPG fans with the Divinity: Original Sin games years prior.\n\nThough BG3 is a high-fantasy story set in the Dungeons and Dragons universe, there's no reason why Larian couldn't take a crack at a game in a more modern or post-apocalyptic setting like Fallout's. Interestingly enough, Larian Studios boss Swen Vincke went on record saying that the company was eyeing the Fallout license ahead of Baldur's Gate 3, which demonstrates, if not a commitment to the property, at least an openness to working on it. Larian bringing its talents, specifically its emphasis on narrative and player choice, to Fallout could lead to incredible results.\n\nLarian Studios Could Bring Fallout Back to Its Roots\n\nWhile modern gaming audiences may associate Fallout with the FPS gameplay established with Fallout 3, the franchise was once defined by a very different sort of formula. The first two Fallout games were turn-based CRPGs with a top-down perspective, not too unlike Baldur's Gate 3. Of course, BG3 is a more advanced, complex, and modernized version of this more rudimentary formula, but it maintains the genre's top priorities, which include narrative, character choice, exploration, and an abundance of dialog.\n\nThe modern, post-Bethesda-acquisition Fallout games, while they certainly have their own unique strengths, adopt more of an action-RPG framework, where combat and overwhelming scale reign supreme.\n\nThis can lead to an immersive and atmospheric experience, as activities like roaming the vast expanses of the Capital Wasteland are valuable in their own right, but it also means that the tabletop-derived RPG mechanics take a back seat. This stands in stark contrast to the older Fallout games and Baldur's Gate 3, which draw heavily from Dungeons and Dragons and other tabletop games to offer a tighter, more methodical, and more flexible role-playing experience.\n\nOf course, Larian is working on its own projects, so it may not be able to pick up a BG3-style Fallout spin-off, even if Bethesda was willing to share the license. Plus, it's hard to say if Larian even wants to stick to the BG3 formula for future games. But if the stars aligned, it's hard to think of a studio more suitable for a third-party Fallout game.\n\nFallout\n\nFallout is a franchise built around a series of RPGs set in a post-nuclear world, in which great vaults have been built to shelter parts of humankind. There are six main games, various spin-offs, tabletop games, and a TV series from Amazon Studios.\n\nVideo Game(s) Fallout , Fallout 2 , Fallout 3 , Fallout 4 , Fallout 76 , Fallout Shelter , Fallout:

The terrarium was 3D printed and hand-painted, with ongoing decorations to provide the spider with more hiding spots.\n\nA talented gamer online has created an impressive Fallout-themed terrarium to house their pet spider. This Fallout creation features a bunch of recognizable props that fans of the franchise are guaranteed to recognize.\n\nWhile Fallout has always been popular among gamers, it seems to have gone up a notch in the mainstream after the release of the TV adaptation a few months back. It brought Fallout to a brand-new audience that may have never been exposed to it before, resulting in a ton of attention for the franchise. Naturally, this has also resulted in a bunch of awesome fan creations, as fans look to pay tribute to the series in a bunch of different ways. There was even one Fallout fan who built Megaton using model planes, using their unique talent to bring one of the series' most iconic locations to life.\n\nRelated\n\nFallout 4 Player Builds Fortnite's Battle Bus in the Game\n\nA clever Fallout 4 player online recreates Fortnite's Battle Bus as an in-game settlement, bringing it to life above Spectacle Island.\n\nRedditor Kaskaden_916 shared their awesome Fallout fan creation, after creating a terrarium based on the games for their jumping spider. There is a full structure for the spider to hide inside, which is opened by a vault door at the top of the mountain. Looking closer at the details, there's also a deathclaw skull and mini nuke on the floor, giving fans of the franchise something cool to recognize. According to Kaskaden_916, the spider's name is Lucy - an apt name given Lucy MacLean's recent popularity, although it isn't clear if it was actually named after the TV show character.\n\nFallout-Themed Terrarium\n\nThe Fallout-themed terrarium was 3D printed by the user before being painted by hand. However, it isn't quite done yet. Kaskaden_916 also claimed that they're currently in the process of printing and painting even more decor, so the spider has even more places to hide. It's cool to see how the Fallout games continue to inspire players to bring the series into their real lives in such unique ways.\n\nClose\n\nDespite the series' popularity right now, it's hard to imagine when the next mainline Fallout game will be released. Bethesda's schedule is taken up by The Elder Scrolls 6 for the considerable future, but the studio doesn't seem to be in a rush to hand the IP out to a third party in the meantime. However, if Bethesda wants to capitalize on its popularity, this might be the route the studio needs to take. It was recently revealed that Baldur's Gate 3 Larian was once interested in making a Fallout game - perhaps this is an idea that could be revisited, as it would be a total match made in heaven, however unlikely it is right now.\n\nFallout\n\nFallout is a franchise built around a series of RPGs set in a post-nuclear world, in which great vaults have been built to shelter parts of humankind. There are six main games, various spin-offs, tabletop games, and a TV series from Amazon Studios.\n\nVideo Game(s) Fallout , Fallout 2 , Fallout 3 , Fallout 4 , Fallout 76 , Fallout Shelter , Fallout: New Vegas , Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel , Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel\n\nCreation Year 1997\n\nDeveloper(s) Interplay , Black Isle Studios , Bethesda , Obsidian Entertainment , Micro Fort\u00e9\n\nPublisher(s) Interplay , Bethesda Softworks", "source": {"uri": "gamerant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Game Rant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_morris@gamerant.com", "name": "Daniel Morris", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gamer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "3D computer graphics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Fort\u00e9", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Micro Fort\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotherhood_of_Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brotherhood of Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur's_Gate_III", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baldur's Gate III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_76", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 76"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_Shelter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fallout Shelter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_Tactics:_Brotherhood_of_Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Isle_Studios", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black Isle Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Obsidian Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larian_Studios", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larian Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplay_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interplay Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Elder Scrolls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Role-playing video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Softworks", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bethesda Softworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tabletop game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Studios", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_developer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game developer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Games", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/fallout-themed-spider-terrarium-fan-creation.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771431", "eventUri": "eng-9771431", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Over the course of its releases, Fallout has built and established one of the most engrossing worlds through its characters and locations, creating a foundational world that personifies what many imagine when invoking the image of a nuclear war that ravaged the Earth. Reaching back to the 1997 original, players usually start off as a Vault Dweller, one of the inhabitants of the underground bunkers constructed to withstand the bombs dropping on the surface.\n\nAfter the IP passed to Bethesda Game Studios, the tradition was rigidly adhered to. While this framework is effective for introducing and immersing fans at the beginning of each game, it's also becoming somewhat predictable. Even the recent popular Fallout Amazon TV series positioned its protagonist, Lucy MacLean, as a fresh-faced Vault resident thrust into the Wasteland. Though it's practical for the studio to utilize this device, as it caters to both longtime fans and newcomers, there are solid arguments to be made for Bethesda to look to Obsidian Entertainment's vision for Fallout: New Vegas' non-Vault Dweller protagonist for the fifth numbered entry in the franchise.\n\nFallout 76 will offer playable ghoul characters in an update set to arrive next year.\n\nRelated\n\nFallout: All Player Character Origins, Ranked\n\nEach protagonist in the Fallout series has an origin story that explains their motive for exploring the Wasteland, but which is the most iconic?\n\nFallout 5's Protagonist Should Channel New Vegas' Courier Over Bethesda's Vault Dwellers\n\nClose\n\nBethesda's Fallout Vault Dweller Protagonists May Be Getting a Little Stale\n\nBreaking down the origins of each protagonist from the mainline titles:\n\nGame\n\nProtagonist Role/Title\n\nPlace of Origin\n\nFallout 1\n\nVault Dweller\n\nVault 13\n\nFallout 2\n\nChosen One/Vault Descendant\n\nArroyo\n\nFallout 3\n\nLone Wanderer\n\nVault 101\n\nFallout: New Vegas\n\nMojave Express Courier Six\n\nUnknown (Mojave Wasteland)\n\nFallout 4\n\nSole Survivor\n\nVault 111\n\nFallout 76\n\nVarious\n\nVault 76\n\nNotably, in the Bethesda-produced titles (Fallout 3, 4, and 76), all hail from a Vault, and are rooted in the viewpoint that is attached. As Fallout 76 is an MMO, the specifics of the characters are looser to allow fans to role-play and decide their own place in the Wasteland. Nevertheless, lore states that they all originated in the titular vault, and thus every character falls under the same banner in this regard.\n\nThe major exceptions are the second title, where the main character is actually the grandchild of Fallout 1's Vault Dweller, and New Vegas. The latter's mysterious Courier, whose backstory remains largely undefined and unexplained, makes them one of the best and most unique Fallout protagonists featured so far.\n\nFallout: New Vegas' Courier was a Much-Needed Breath of Fresh Air, and Fallout 5 Should Take Note\n\nFallout: New Vegas is widely credited with being truer to the nature of the series in many ways, particularly its storytelling and RPG elements, and the Courier breaking from the tradition of Bethesda's titles also sets it apart. The Courier is central to the machinations of the major Mojave players, Mr. House, the New California Republic, and Caesar's Legion, and provides a much different window for fans to experience the plot.\n\nBethesda then could consider thinking outside the bounds of its previous protagonist conventions for Fallout 5, and look to emulate the intriguing possibilities allowed by no longer restricting its protagonist to starting off as a Vault Dweller, ala the Courier in New Vegas. This would free up avenues for the narrative and upend expectations in the process, making Fallout's Vaults alien and intimidating (even more so than usual) to a character who has not been born and raised in one.\n\nA bigger stretch might be to offer either option, though this would likely impact the plot to such a degree that it may not be reasonably feasible. Still, having a main character begin from the viewpoint of a native Wastelander or another outsider like the Courier versus a Vault resident could inject a lot of fresh perspective into the next game.\n\nFallout 4\n\nFallout 4 is an RPG in the Fallout series, being the fourth major installment.

Set between Fallout 1 and 2, this unofficial mod takes us out of the USA to explore a post-apocalyptic London for the first time in the series.\n\nThe mod offers a map as big as Fallout 4's main game plus the Far Harbor DLC combined. You can expect around 90 hours of gameplay spread across 15 different areas of London.\n\nIf you're still not convinced, let me tell you 10 reasons why you're making your biggest mistake by not installing it.\n\n1. Total Overhaul Mod: Fallout: London is a huge overhaul mod for Fallout 4, similar to how Enderal changed Skyrim. It brings a new setting, new gameplay mechanics, new enemies, new weapons, and more.\n\n2. New Setting: The mod is set in London, offering a fresh experience away from the US. The map is large, about the size of Boston and Far Harbor combined.\n\n3. Unique Groups:\n\n4. British Culture: Everything in the game has a British twist. Your Pip-Boy is now called the \"Attaboy,\" an old-school device with new animations. Computers are replaced with old-fashioned touring PCs, resembling the Omega.\n\n5. Improved Dialogue System: The dialogue system is like Fallout: New Vegas, with more options and a silent protagonist, focusing more on interactions.\n\n6. Fully Voiced Characters: All characters are fully voiced, including some real actors. A former Doctor Who actor narrates the famous \"War Never Changes\" opening.\n\n7. Harder Gameplay: The game is tougher than the original Fallout 4, with fewer resources, costly healing items, and powerful weapons. Players start with negative traits that can be removed by advancing the main quest.\n\n8. New Weapons and Enemies: The mod features new guns with unique reload animations and new melee weapons. Players will face various new enemies, including foxes, giant ladybugs, and weird lizard creatures.\n\n9. Detailed Mission Design: Missions have varied, unique goals with big set-piece moments and strong environmental storytelling. Some areas are dense and tricky to navigate, adding to the immersion.\n\n10. Settlement and Crafting Systems: The mod includes Fallout 4's settlement system.

In a quarterly call with investors on Tuesday, chief executive Satya Nadella cited internal metrics saying the whole series (spanning a wave of releases going back to 2008) has more than 500 million monthly active users across all devices and platforms.\n\nThat's impressive, but it does need a little context. Fallout 76, launched 2018, is the ongoing, live-service component of the post-apocalyptic role-playing game. Fallout 4 (released 2015) is the more traditional, boxed-goods video game that still gets a lot of replay thanks to its modding culture (officially supported by Bethesda Game Studios) as much as people either drawn to the series by the show, or returning to it by the reminder.\n\nFallout 4 got two updates after the TV series released to positive reviews, the latest update coming in mid-May. \"Fallout: London\" a \"total conversion mod\" of Fallout 4, years in the making, stumbled out of the gate of its launch due to technical issues but its developers promise fixes are coming.\n\nIn any case, the bigger message is pretty clear: official mod support (of community modifications) for the older games pays off, and the churn of new stuff for Fallout 76 is still working. The most recent big expansion for Fallout 76 was the Skyline Valley update in June.\n\nIt also helps that Fallout's games are on Xbox Games Pass (as most first-party Xbox titles are). Nonetheless, \"hours played on [Xbox] Game Pass for the Fallout franchise increased nearly five times, quarter over quarter.\" Taking that at face value, that's a remarkable spike for a game whose last completely new release came six years ago, and two years before Microsoft acquired its parent publisher, Bethesda Softworks.\n\nFallout was a no-question hit as a TV show, enough that Amazon has already renewed it for a second season.

However, there are also special variations of Eyebots that only spawn in certain locations and if you keep reading you will find a chart with all of them down below.\n\nFor more guides On Fallout 76 check out the following listed below:\n\nMoving on, Eyebots if it wasn't clear already, are a part of the robot class of entities in Fallout 76. They are seldom immediately hostile to the player, and some Eyebots will even reveal locations to the player as they fly by. In addition, Eyebots once destroyed tends to drop Steel and some lesser amounts of ammo as loot. Also, according to the lore, they were created by Robco for a variety of purposes. The primary of these purposes was to give consumers instant access to both radio and television on the go.\n\nThat's it for Eyebot locations, and we hope our little list for them proved useful for your all your Eyebot Hunting needs.

Sorry, I don't know what came over me there, other than the beating British heart of Fallout: London is beginning to take over my mind. This colossal mod which verges on being an entirely new game has hit the world recently and like any good Fallout it's got its fair share of problems. Those who can get past the technical issues are having the time of their lives but some are too big to ignore, and thankfully the mod's developer isn't overlooking them.\n\nDespite some stability problems it's really hard to understate just what a stunning achievement the release of Fallout: London is. This huge mod is more like an entirely new RPG in its own right, filled with plenty of British takes on the apocalypse done in traditional tongue-in-cheek Fallout style. There's Fesco branded horse meat, Ion brew, Dr Who references, and even a few nods to Wallace and Gromit. It's about as British as you can get and just like living on that sceptered isle there's a smattering of downsides too.\n\nJust installing the mod itself is a harsh barrier to overcome, as you'll need to learn how to downgrade Fallout 4 in order to get Fallout: London running in the first place. For those able to hop into the apocalypse the challenge doesn't stop there as there are some technical issues causing problems for players, such as repeated crashes and extremely long loading times. It doesn't seem to matter if fans are using the Steam or GOG versions of the game - both appear to be afflicted with game breaking interruptions.\n\nTeam FOLON, developer of the mod, is keenly aware of these issues and is promising to take swift action to help make sure the British apocalypse becomes far more stable. Taking to X, formerly Twitter, the developer has let the community know that it is busy working on a patch to smoothen out the experience and that it will launch soon. This also comes alongside a list of workarounds and known issues, which should help get players around some of the most common bugs in the mod.\n\nEven though the mod can be tough to get running perfectly right now, plenty of players are having a brilliant time in the game, with many fans considering it a canonical entry in the series. With the Fallout 5 release date still hiding like a Nightkin in the bushes, this may be the nearest we'll get to a new Fallout game for a long time.\n\nIf you'd like to check something else out while Team FOLON irons out the bugs, you can take a peek at our recommendations for the best Fallout 4 mods, as well as our picks for the best games like Fallout you can play right now.", "source": {"uri": "pcgamesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PCGamesN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_mchugh@pcgamesn.com", "name": "Alex McHugh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_modding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game modding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apocalypse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_and_Gromit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wallace and Gromit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Role-playing video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue-in-cheek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tongue-in-cheek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doctor Who"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steam (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canon (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software bug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOG.com", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GOG.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://www.pcgamesn.com/wp-content/sites/pcgamesn/2024/07/fallout-london-new-patch-technical-issues.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771431", "eventUri": "eng-9771431", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Many jumped back in and were pleasantly surprised by the attention to detail in the world, the gunplay, the secrets and the companions. However, there was still plenty of criticism for its story, the decision to go with a voiced protagonist, lackluster role-playing mechanics, the endings and much more. There was still that feeling, especially among some longtime fans of the franchise, that it just didn't feel like a Fallout game (which is saying something considering some players lobbied those same criticisms against Fallout 3).\n\nThe fervor may have died down, and each title has dropped back down to more conservative player numbers - though Fallout 4 continues to see enthusiasm following its Next-Gen Update - but there's a new Fallout experience in town. In development since 2019, Fallout: London is a mod for Fallout 4 that's more like a total conversion. Though it seemed like it wouldn't arrive on Steam due to the Next-Gen Update breaking several things, it's finally available for PC players.\n\nThere are some very mixed results with the installation (long story short: Use the GOG version), and performance leaves a lot to be desired. Nevertheless, it's an experience that's proven delightfully surprising to the extent that fans of the franchise owe it to themselves to play, if not try it out.\n\nThe name indicates the basic premise. What if players ventured out into the post-apocalyptic nuclear wasteland of London? The series has predominantly focused on the United States of America, allowing for pop culture references and commentary on consumerism. It's the first time players can see how another part of the world has been affected by the bombs dropping, unofficial as it is.\n\nThere's no Vault-Tec - no Super Mutants, Deathclaws or other elements that will be familiar to longtime fans because, well, the Forced Evolutionary Virus never made its way across the ocean. While that may sound disappointing, it also means you have to adapt to new threats. Furthermore, it unfolds in 2237 between Fallout 1 and 2. The vibe is also completely different from Fallout 4 - goodbye Sole Survivor seeking revenge for their partner and looking for Shaun. Hello silent, amnesiac protagonist who's the subject of an unknown experiment.\n\nYou awaken in a containment tube with two scientists commenting on your progress under the mysterious individual named Mr. Smythe. When the Vagabonds, one of the many factions roaming post-nuclear London, break in and start firing, you're set free. You have time to try and process what this strange facility is about, fighting off Ratshrews (a substitute for Molerats) and scrounging for supplies. As you escape, Mr. Smythe is seemingly pleased with your choice, encouraging you to venture forth. A hop, skip, and jump onto the Tube - which subsequently crashes, a fitting metaphor for this mod - and the world opens up.\n\nIt really can't be understated just how different London feels from the Commonwealth. Propaganda posts against the Brotherhood of Steel abound. Nameplates indicating where historical figures once resided are visible on the buildings. Nuka Cola is in short supply compared to tea. The Reliant Robin, or its remains, can be discovered alongside other vehicles. The attention to detail is on another level and goes a long way towards making the experience feel like more than a reskinned Fallout 4.\n\nThe fundamental gameplay is also very different. Guns aren't as commonplace, with the team focusing more on melee combat and getting up close and personal. A more dangerous approach and the base difficulty being higher than Fallout 4 means things hurt a lot more. Feral Ghouls may still seem like stumbling horrors, but a single clean hit can fracture your limbs.\n\nPicking your battles, knowing when to use firearms and backing off lest things get ugly isn't just essential in the early going - it's mandatory. This doesn't necessarily mean that you'll fight only with melee weapons throughout the entire experience. It emphasizes the despair of trying to survive with the bare essentials, slowly clawing your way up.\n\nPerhaps the biggest improvement over the base Fallout 4 experience is making decisions matter. You could join the Vagabonds and partake in different tasks, leading to multiple quests and choices (while obtaining a sweet Butterfly Knife). Alternatively, you could visit the Thamesfolk and learn more about the mysterious facility and potentially who the Gentry are.\n\nMaybe you want to forego both choices and explore the world unfettered. It's ultimately up to you, and while the impact of each decision has yet to be fully revealed, they feel significant. You have skill checks that range from getting some water from the Vagabonds and potentially saving someone's life (or making their condition worse) to heavier choices deciding whether to disrupt a supply line.\n\nWhile developer Team FOLON calls this a \"condensed\" version of London, covering 15 boroughs (roughly half of the real-world city), the map size is the equivalent of the Commonwealth and Far Harbor from Fallout 4. Also, while touting this as a DLC-sized mod, it has 200 quests and promises 90 hours of gameplay. It's like a whole new game - granted, one built on an existing game's foundation, but still offering boatloads of new content for players to experience.\n\nThe developer outlines various factions from the rebellious 5th Column to the militaristic Tommies and the Knights of the Round-inspired Camelot. You may even encounter Mr. Smythe's mysterious organization. They all seem to have dedicated questlines, but the kicker is that they're only a small percentage - TEAM FOLON lists 20 factions with varying story paths and endings. The fact that all of this is free is simply mind-boggling.\n\nSo it's a shame that it's not the most optimized mod out there. Players who install through GOG report crashes after roughly an hour of play. Some don't even get that far, suffering consecutive crashes in the process, even with officially recommended mods like Buffout 4. These will naturally be worked on, but many fixes may not roll out immediately, leading to frustration.\n\nThe installation experience on Steam is also much more challenging - at least GOG has heavily discounted Fallout 4: Game of the Year Edition to lower the barrier of entry. It's also worth noting that your mileage may vary with the quality of the voice acting, which can feel impressive at times and flat during others. However, the cameos, which we won't spoil, are excellent.\n\nDespite its optimization issues, one can't overstate enough just how incredible this mod is, especially from an independent team that's spread worldwide. Even if it's been in development for the past five years, the sheer quality of the experience, from its rendition of London and depiction of British culture, is still hard to believe. It once again speaks volumes of the modding community for Bethesda titles and what they're capable of achieving, be it much-needed fixes or fresh new experiences that can rival the base game in many ways.\n\nWhile it may not overhaul every element, Fallout: London is well worth looking into, whether you're seeking something far meatier beyond the current assortment of mods, are a fan of the series or just curious what the buzz is about.

A fan of the series recently proposed a vault with daily birthdays, 365 days a year, creating a debate as to how residents would cope with incessant celebrations.\n\nOne Fallout fan has come up with an idea for a vault so diabolical, it's impressive that the twisted minds at Vault-Tec didn't think of it first. Set in a world that barely survived a nuclear apocalypse, the Fallout franchise's vaults are one of its most recognizable features, but life isn't what the residents expected in most of them.\n\nPlayers took their first steps in the series in Fallout's Vault 13, the starting location of the original PC game, and other than a malfunctioning water chip with no backup to be found, life seemed pretty normal there. That is, until the release of Fallout 2, when players discovered a whole box of water chips in another vault, which was assumed to be a shipping error but could have been something much more sinister. As the series continues, players discover multiple vaults undergoing various social experiments, some of which turn out to be truly deadly.\n\nRelated\n\nGamer Makes Fallout-Themed Terrarium For Their Pet Spider\n\nA talented gamer online creates a Fallout-themed terrarium to house their pet spider, with tons of recognizable props from the game series.\n\nIn this case, one player has come up with their own social engineering experiment, and while it doesn't seem as maddening as the Gary cloning experiment in Vault 108, it could still easily make its dwellers lose their minds. Posted recently on Reddit, one user dug up an old social media post in which another Fallout fan had proposed a vault with 365 different residents, each of whom has a different birthday. Given that Fallout 3 shows how vault dwellers tend to throw birthday parties, that would mean a party every day, with residents only getting a break roughly once every four years. \"Just endless birthdays with everyone waiting to celebrate someone dying to have a day off,\" the post reads.\n\nThe Fallout Series Has Had Some Really Creepy Vaults\n\nThe idea has encouraged some discussion about just how a vault's population would cope with so many birthdays. Some have suggested that residents would simply stop celebrating birthdays or hold a monthly celebration for all residents born that month, but others insist that the vault overseer would follow protocol to a T, sticking with the mandates issued to them by Vault-Tec. Speculation on the mental strain this schedule would place on the vault is varied, with some suggesting a mandate that a resident be executed or exiled if a baby is born on their birthday, sort of like how Fallout: New Vegas' Vault 11 normalized human sacrifice for its population.\n\nClose\n\nEven without that fun thought experiment being real, the series already features plenty of terrible Fallout vaults to be trapped in. Ranging from a rehab vault filled with drugs to a virtual reality simulator where residents are forced to die nasty deaths over and over, the maniacal machinations of Vault-Tec are something that keep players coming back for more with each new release.\n\nFallout 4\n\nFallout 4 is an RPG in the Fallout series, being the fourth major installment.

We won't copy those guides here, but you will definitely want to read these key points.\n\nTeam FOLON had brought this up before, but their guide only covers Fallout 4 on Steam and GOG. It isn't possible to play Fallout: Londonwith the Epic Games Store version of Fallout 4, because Epic's platform doesn't allow players to roll back to earlier versions of games. But as it turned out, we didn't really know what that entailed until this guide.\n\nWhether you're on Steam or GOG, you have to uninstall your copy of Fallout 4, and any of the data that could come from your prior save. They provide detailed instructions on where to find all that data as well.\n\nAs you can imagine, it'll be easier to set this all up on the GOG version. You need to install Fallout 4, and then Team FOLON wants you to launch the game at least once. This will generate new files, including in the Windows registry, and you can go back to the main menu and quit when it's done. Afterwards, you can just add Fallout: London to your library and install it in the same folder you have Fallout 4.\n\nIf you're on Steam, you will need to install Fallout 4 with a specific set of DLCs, use Team FOLON's downgrader, and also install and use GOG Galaxy. We assume this isn't out of malice, but simply because Team FOLON really did have GOG manage everything for them. If you don't mind double dipping, you may be better off doing so on GOG for peace of mind. But of course, that's up to you.\n\nCongrats go out to Team FOLON for their launch, and hopefully we all don't have to wait that long for Fallout London to be playable in the latest version of Fallout 4, and possibly even on consoles.", "source": {"uri": "gameranx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gameranx"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_parreno@gameranx.com", "name": "Ryan Parreno", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_modding", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game modding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steam (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOG.com", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GOG.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Games_Store", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epic Games Store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Library (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Downloadable content"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://gameranx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Fallout-London.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771431", "eventUri": "eng-9771431", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

While iconic enemies like ghouls or deathclaws stand out as some of the best-designed enemies in the series, Fallout 76 has its own additions to the universe's monster compendium that rival the likes of these creatures. One of the most notable enemies added in Fallout 76 is the mole miner, whose disturbing origins should lay the foundation for future Fallout enemies to expand upon.\n\nFallout 76 has proven to be a goldmine of potential when it comes to expanding the universe of Fallout with more unique enemy types. While the game boasts several cryptids native to its Appalachian setting, such as the Mothman or the Flatwoods Monster, it also plays to its setting's strengths when it comes to more common enemies as well. The mole miners are the perfect depiction of West Virginia's mining industry gone wrong when a nuclear apocalypse hits, causing a dangerous profession to become the origin of some of Fallout's darkest lore.\n\nRelated\n\nUpcoming Fallout 76 Feature Shows How Far Fallout 4's Base Building Has Come\n\nA new feature scheduled to come to Fallout 76 in the Milepost Zero update is a testament to the growing appreciation for the game's base building.\n\nFallout 76's Mole Miners Suggests Future Enemies Could Share a Dark Trait\n\nClose\n\nAccording to the lore of Fallout 76, mole miners are mutated West Virginian miners who have become trapped within their mining suits due to the severity of their mutations. These beings are native to the Ash Heap region, where the bulk of Appalachia's mines can be found. While the mutations that have caused the mole miners to be imprisoned in their mining gear appear to be causing them a great deal of suffering, it's also allowed them to develop claws and a stout, hunched posture that allows them to wield heavy weapons ranging from shotguns to missile launchers.\n\nNot only is it a dark thought to consider that mole miners were once humans that have become trapped within their mining suits, but unlike feral ghouls, these mole miners still appear to retain a portion of their humanity. Mole miners still seem to retain the hierarchy of their former selves, with foremen and supervisors leading packs of the enemies, and an NPC like Purveyor Murmrgh showing that some are still capable of socializing with humans. These traits make it all the more tragic when realizing they are unable to breathe properly without a respirator, as well as when players are forced to kill them.\n\nFuture Fallout Enemies Should Take Notes from 76's Mole Miners\n\nIt's easy for players to mindlessly mow down feral ghouls or take out a camp of raiders since Fallout presents its world as one where it's kill or be killed. However, as the series evolves and expands its lore, injecting bits of humanity into certain enemy types adds a layer of complexity that might make players hesitate about killing them. Mole miners are a perfect example of this idea, since on the surface they appear to be a mindless, hostile force like any other feral ghoul or radroach.\n\nWhen players dig a little deeper into the lore of mole miners, they become much more tragic enemies that have clearly lost control of their actions yet still retain their humanity to some degree. Future Fallout games should try to develop more complex enemies like this, potentially using a similar design premise of a human who was so severely mutated by radiation that they are no longer in control of themselves yet still display characteristics of their former humanity. While this may be a dark route for the series to take, it could support future changes that allow players to approach the series' RPG mechanics from a pacifist playstyle.\n\nFallout

As our Ian discovered when he gave it a whirl last week, he couldn't explore very much of it because it kept hard crashing back to his desktop (he did get mauled to death by a fox, though, so still rates the whole experience very highly).\n\nYou can see Ian playing through some Fallout: London via the video below.\n\nThankfully for those like Ian who are eager to explore more of the mod - which despite its issues clearly holds a lot of promise - Team Folon is working on a fix.\n\nAddressing the \"reported technical issues\" in Fallout: London in a post on social media platform X, the team said it will release an update \"soon\". It then thanked everyone for their patience in the meantime.\n\nTeam Folon also shared an installation guide which it said should help make the process \"as hassle-free as it gets\". You can find it here.\n\nEurogamer has followed the development of Team Folon's mod for some time. Recently, it was announced former Speaker of the House John Bercow would be lending his voice to an AI robot. In addition to Bercow, Neil Newbon - voice of Astarion in Baldur's Gate 3 - is also in the cast.\n\nAs for Fallout more generally, it has had quite the renaissance this year, thanks to the popularity of Amazon's TV series. This Fallout adaptation was watched by 65 million people in its first two weeks and has just recently been nominated for 16 Emmy Awards.\n\nA second season was announced to be in the pipeline soon after the show made its debut in April. According to showrunners Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner, the Fallout team is \"going to be pedal to the metal to get season two out as fast as humanly possible\".

However, this negative trend could have possibly been broken with Prime Video's Fallout series, a faithful adaptation of the beloved video game franchise that has been celebrated worldwide by fans. Fallout's success is further proved by the fact that it was nominated for two major Emmy Awards.\n\nThe adaptation perfectly represents the franchise's satirical post-apocalyptic nature, alongside its intriguing story, dark humor, unique characters, and so forth. Furthermore, countless neat details from the games are found everywhere throughout the show's first season, ensuring seamless connections between each entry to the Fallout franchise, and respecting the lore of the games whilst expanding upon it. These details help to make this show such a great adaptation and make it worthy of appreciation by fans.\n\n10 Lucy's S.P.E.C.I.A.L. Stats\n\nRelated\n\nThis Underrated Action RPG is Perfect For Fallout Fans\n\nFallout fans wanting new content need look no further than Obsidian's 2019 open-world action game The Outer Worlds to scratch that Fallout itch.\n\nFallout's first episode introduces us to protagonist Lucy, a Vault Dweller from Vault 33 who is about to get married to Dweller Monty from Vault 32. As Lucy introduces herself to the viewer and interviews for her marriage application to the Vault 33 council, she lists her multiple different skills and how good she is in each one. The skills she mentions are strikingly similar to perks that players must choose from the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system, like speech and science skills.\n\nThis is the very first time viewers meet Lucy, which makes this detail even better, as it is at the beginning of each recent Fallout game that players must spend their starting skill points on the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system. This is a great callback to the Fallout games and already demonstrates the show's dedication to the lore and respect for the game mechanics, which make Fallout so unique and a fan-favorite franchise.\n\n9 Lucy Drinks Radiated Water\n\nEpisode 4 'The Ghoul' sees Lucy held hostage by Walter Goggin's the Ghoul, as they travel through the Wasteland's California ruins. Throughout the episode, Lucy fights the urge to drink radiated water despite her immense thirst and the Ghoul's purposeful waste of water. With every water source they encounter, Lucy's Pip Boy' Geiger counter warns of radiation -- but eventually, she gives in, and drinks the radiated water.\n\nThe Ghoul taunts her, warning she will mutate like him, and that she is finally learning the ways of the Wasteland. This is an interesting detail that hits too close to home for Fallout players, as every gamer who has ventured across the Wasteland will have had to have drank radiated water and other radiated drinks -- and become infected with rads. Once again this is a great detail that demonstrates how much love and respect the show has for the games.\n\n8 How Ghouls Work\n\nRelated\n\nThe Fallout Games and This Rockstar Franchise Share Some Key Similarities\n\nThese two franchises look completely different, yet both give players immense potential for freedom in exploring the most detailed worlds.\n\nFallout star Walton Goggins brought the Ghoul to life in the show, as he quickly became a fan-favorite character as a rival to Lucy. The Ghoul needs to inhale an unknown chem every so often to prevent his radiation from turning him feral like the ghouls imprisoned at the organ farm Lucy is given to. Viewers also see a ghoul turning feral in an abandoned building, demonstrating the horrifying transformation the Ghoul would go through without the chem.\n\nThe way ghouls mutate and transform into feral ghouls in the show is incredibly similar to how the series shows it, with ghouls eventually losing their minds and becoming feral. Furthermore, the genetic modifications to ghouls' bodies potentially lead to centuries-long life spans, also demonstrated in the show by the Ghoul's backstory, which revealed he had been around long before the bombs dropped. The consistency between the show and the games helps the franchise thrive, as game lore and logic are shared.\n\n7 The Show's Clothing And Weapons Are Taken Straight From The Games\n\nClose\n\nAccurate costumes in adaptations of any pop culture, such as comic-accurate costumes in Marvel movies, are a great thing, and the same is true for Fallout. The Vault Dweller outfit is a perfect example of source-accurate outfits, as they are strikingly similar to those worn throughout the games, and simply add to its immersion. Furthermore, game-accurate weapons, such as the 10mm pistol, long barrel assault rifle, and AER9 laser pistol simply further connect the show to the games.\n\nAlthough seemingly unimportant, weapons and clothing taken from the games that are present in the show help to keep consistency and the overall Fallout lore intact. Further examples of this are the game-accurate Power Armour that Maximus wears and the leather armor that Lucy wears, acting both as fan service and respect for the franchise. They are neat details that just add to the reasons why Fallout is such an incredible adaptation.\n\n6 The Broken Water Chip\n\nRelated\n\nWhy Fallout Fans Want this Terrifying Creature in Season 2\n\nDeathclaws are a much loved part of the Fallout franchise, but they have yet to make an appearance in the TV show.\n\nA fantastic detail that truly cements the adaptation as a worthy component of the Fallout franchise is a callback to the very first game in 1997, in which Vault 33's water chip is broken. In the original Fallout game, this is the beginning of the game's story, and the Vault Dweller is chosen by the Overseer to venture to the Wasteland and locate a new one.\n\nAlthough this is not the reason Lucy leaves the vault, it is a fun detail nonetheless. It demonstrates the show's respect for the franchise, even from the games developed before Bethesda took over. Furthermore, it keeps the overall narrative of the Fallout world flowing, ensuring no plotholes or overused plot points.\n\n5 Mr. Handy's Representation In The Show Is Perfect\n\nThroughout the Fallout games, Mr. Handy bots can be found programmed for different roles across the Wasteland, with the once-peaceful robots having been manipulated for more devious purposes post-war, or having malfunctioned. Not only do fans see a great version of Mr. Handy through Snip Snip, the Mr. Handy reprogrammed for organ harvesting, but they even see the origins of Fallout 4's infamous Codsworth Mr. Handy.\n\nThis is a great detail to include in the show, as it gives so much more depth to the character and hugely enhances world-building. By seeing Matt Berry's Sebastian Leslie, the character who, canonically, allowed his voice to be used in all Mr. Handy bots, interact with Howard Cooper, the series expands the franchise lore excitingly. Furthermore, the show did an incredible job at recreating the Mr. Handy bots in live action, with the game's designs being replicated perfectly, alongside their crude humor delivered in excited tones.\n\n4 Vault Boy Bobbleheads Are Absolutely Everywhere\n\nRelated\n\nEvery Fallout 4 Vault, Explained\n\nFallout 4 had some truly interesting Vaults and experiments to dive into and explore.\n\nFallout's biggest collectible by far is the Vault-Boy bobbleheads that can be found throughout the Wasteland in Fallout 3, 4, and 76, with each one granting players a single S.P.E.C.I.A.L. point. Hunting down collectibles is one of the most enjoyable components of any game, especially open-world ones like Fallout, giving gamers a reason to explore every inch of the map and rewarding them for doing so.\n\nJust like how collectibles are hidden throughout the recent Fallout games, countless Vault-Boy bobbleheads are hidden in the background of the show. This acts as a clear reference to the franchise's collectible bobbleheads and is a neat detail that further shows just how much care and respect went into the show's creation, and why it has earned its title as one of the best video game adaptations yet.\n\n3 Game-Accurate Pip-Boys\n\nAnother staple of the Fallout franchise is its trusty Pip-Boys, wearable devices that allow players to access their maps, inventories, health diagnostics, quests, S.P.E.C.I.A.L. skill tree, and numerous other functions. These Pip-Boys are essentially the post-apocalyptic version of smartphones, and without them, the average Vault Dweller would be lost and vulnerable in the Wasteland, and clueless in the Vault. Pip Boys are also great sources of entertainment, giving gamers the option to tune into 50s-era radio stations during their travels and play in-game video games when found in the Wasteland.\n\nIn the show, Lucy is equipped with her Pip-Boy along with the show's other Vault Dwellers, and these devices are game-accurate -- complete with all the same tabs from other Fallout games, like Stats (Statistics), Inv (Inventory), Data, Map, and Radio. Furthermore, the show offers fans a glimpse into Lucy's health statistics in Episode 3, which, just like in the recent games, shows the health of each individual limb with the classic Vault-Boy diagram. Just like the other aforementioned fantastic details, the game-accurate Pip-Boy increases immersion within the Fallout show and is great fan service.\n\n2 The Show Matches Fallout's Humor\n\nRelated\n\nWhere Every Fallout Entry Takes Place, Explained\n\nThe Fallout franchise takes place across the United States, showcasing how different groups adapted to the post-apocalyptic landscape.\n\nThe Fallout series is well-known for its satirical, sarcastic humor, and the show absolutely nails this, with fans praising the show's hilarious comedy aspects. Despite the world's tragic transformation into the Wasteland, and the dire situation most characters are in, the comedy truly works -- dark, monotone jokes are made in the bleakest of situations, a combination which rarely fails to get a laugh.\n\nElla Purnell (Lucy) and Aaron Moten (Maximus) effortlessly deliver some of the best lines in the show, really playing into Fallout's unique tone of comedy. As a Vault Dweller, Lucy's understanding of the world and social interactions is very limited, so her interactions with other characters are always funny and entertaining. This is once again another small detail that demonstrates the care and respect put into the show, all of which build a great adaptation.\n\n1 Vault-Tec's History Is Explored\n\nVault-Tec, the company behind the implementation of vaults across America in preparation for nuclear war, has appeared in every Fallout game, acting as the franchise's overarching antagonist. Much of their history has been a mystery, especially how they knew how and when to prepare for the bombs to drop. Furthermore, the evil corporation has been known to conduct disturbing experiments on humans in different vaults, adding to Fallout's dark lore.\n\nThe adaptation not only focuses on Vault-Tec as the primary antagonist but also reveals much more about their evil history, including a confirmation of something that many fans theorized about for years -- that the corporation was responsible for the destruction of Earth. The show heavily details how Vault-Tec brought about the end of the world and how they plan on controlling it, furthering the lore of the franchise. On top of this, fans discover the origins of Vault-Boy and the Vault-Tec colors. All of these details make this adaptation an important part of the Fallout franchise and prove why it is essential for fans of the games to invest in.\n\nFallout\n\nThe Fallout franchise, a hallmark of post-apocalyptic gaming, transports players to a retro-futuristic world devastated by nuclear war. Set in an alternate history where advanced technology and 1950s culture collide, the series begins in the year 2077, when nuclear bombs devastate the Earth. Survivors emerge from massive underground bunkers called Vaults to navigate the harsh wastelands, filled with mutants, raiders, and remnants of pre-war society.\n\nEach game in the series, from the original Fallout to the latest installment, presents a unique narrative centered around themes of survival, exploration, and moral ambiguity. Players often assume the role of a Vault Dweller or Wastelander, making crucial decisions that shape the fate of various factions and settlements. With its open-world design, intricate storytelling, and deep role-playing mechanics, Fallout has captivated audiences, offering a rich blend of action, strategy, and atmospheric storytelling that examines the enduring human spirit amidst desolation.\n\nCreated by Tim Cain , Leonard Boyarsky\n\nFirst TV Show Fallout\n\nFirst Episode Air Date April 10, 2024\n\nCast Ella Purnell , Aaron Moten , Kyle MacLachlan , Moises Arias , Xelia Mendes-Jones , Walton Goggins\n\nVideo Game(s) Fallout 2 , Fallout 3 , Fallout 4 , Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel , Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel , Fallout: New Vegas , Fallout Shelter\n\nGenre RPG , Action RPG , Tactical RPG , Management , Simulation , Survival\n\nExpand", "source": {"uri": "cbr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBR"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasteland_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wasteland (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghoul", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ghoul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Radiation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fallout_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Fallout (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_If...?_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "What If...?

Players can expand CAMP builds with furniture blueprints or Atomic Shop items for customization. Impala67x's massive airport CAMP showcases intricate details and creative use of limited item budget.\n\nA Fallout 76 player has created an incredible Brotherhood of Steel airport using the CAMP feature. Fallout 4 includes Settlements that can be built up, but the Fallout 76 CAMP feature has resulted in unique builds created in areas the player chooses.\n\nFallout 76 includes a CAMP base-building feature which is expanded on by collecting furniture blueprints or buying items from the Atomic Shop. Since the game was released, Fallout 76 players have shared incredible CAMPs that feature a variety of furniture and decorations. Among the CAMP builds shared by players are an impressive Barbie house, a Wasteland shop, and a lavish casino inspired by The Neapolitan. These bases highlight what can be done with the CAMP feature's item budget, with some getting the absolute most out of the limitation. One gamer has created a massive Brotherhood of Steel airport CAMP by mixing common items with imagery dedicated to the faction.\n\nRelated\n\nFallout 76's Mole Miners Hold Some Dark Implications for Future Series Enemies\n\nFallout is home to some pretty dark lore, but a feature of Fallout 76's mole miners could be used to make future enemy designs even darker.\n\nReddit user Impala67x recently shared seven images of their Fallout 76 Brotherhood of Steel CAMP airport. The screenshots capture the CAMP from every angle, showing three runways, seven buildings, two tents, two view towers, two satellites, and one large hangar, while finer details are highlighted with a close-up view. The base includes an Infantry Statue under Brotherhood of Steel and U.S. flags, with the latter costing 400 Fallout 76 Atoms in the Atomic Shop. The Statue was limited to a seasonal reward, just like the included Field Station, while the Satellite Dish periodically rotates into the shop. Two Vertibirds rest on nearby platforms, and spotlights illuminate the end of each runway, making the airport appear more lively.\n\nThis Fallout 76 Player Made a Brotherhood of Steel Airport\n\nSome materials required for this build are Aluminum, Concrete, Glass, Oil, Steel, and Wood. According to the gamer, their Fallout 76 base takes up about 90% of the CAMP budget, allowing them to make a few adjustments when needed. While the runway appears to be made of asphalt, it's actually Haunted House roofing which can be acquired from a bundle that shares its name. With the Fallout faction being prominent across each game, another Fallout 76 player also dedicated their CAMP to the Brotherhood of Steel. The key difference between these two CAMPs is one acts as an airport for the Fallout faction, while the other resembles a base that it may operate out of.\n\nClose\n\nAs Bethesda continues to update Fallout 76 with new CAMP items among other adjustments, this may not be the complete form of Impala67x's airport. With this airport mixing paid and free blueprints, some aspects of the build may be less replicable than others for players on a budget.\n\nFallout 76\n\nFallout 76 is a new horizon for the long-standing series, giving players an MMO world to explore, where they can meet other players and embark on quests with them.\n\nAction\n\nRPG\n\nSystems\n\nOpenCritic Reviews\n\nFranchise Fallout\n\nPlatform(s) PC , PS4 , Xbox One\n\nReleased November 14, 2018\n\nDeveloper(s) Bethesda\n\nPublisher(s) Bethesda\n\nMultiplayer Online Multiplayer\n\nEngine Creation\n\nESRB M for Mature: Blood and Gore, Drug Reference, Intense Violence, Strong Language, Use of Alcohol\n\nHow Long To Beat 34 Hours\n\nX|S Enhanced No\n\nPS Plus Availability Extra & Premium\n\nFile Size Xbox Series 97 GB (May 2024)\n\nExpand", "source": {"uri": "gamerant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Game Rant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "clayton_cyre@gamerant.com", "name": "Clayton Cyre", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotherhood_of_Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brotherhood of Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_76", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 76"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueprint", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Blueprint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gamer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasteland_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wasteland (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenshot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Screenshot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barbie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Casino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haunted_House_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haunted House (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quest (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCritic", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenCritic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Software Rating Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Role-playing video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Softworks", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bethesda Softworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massively multiplayer online game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multiplayer video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Action game"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North America", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Alumni", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Alumni", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Associations", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Sports", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/fallout-76-vertibird-feature.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771431", "eventUri": "eng-9771431", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-11-14", "textStart": 3590, "textEnd": 3607}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

While Bethesda's Todd Howard has warned the official Fallout games will likely never leave the USA, it's over to ambitious modders like Team FOLON to make it a reality.\n\nWe once feared that Fallout: London would never crawl out of the River Thames after the team admitted the new-gen Fallout 4 update \"screwed\" its release, but finally, we got to hoist the flag above Buckingham Palace on July 25. It's clear this is a very different game to the Americana of Bethesda's Fallout, and with it, some 'unique' differences have appeared.\n\nAs spotted on the Fallout: London subreddit, the item known as Jimmy Hats provides +20 Rad Resist. For those who haven't got the joke, Jimmy Hats are hats for your 'Jimmy', which is slang for a man's, erm, member. So, next time you're on the radiation-infected streets of London, think about sticking on a condom.\n\nSomeone else pointed out how Jimmy Hats aren't exclusive to Fallout: London, with the item appearing in Black Isle Studios' Fallout 2. They were used for a more traditional reason back then, with Fallout 2's Jimmy Hats stopping you from getting NPCs pregnant during intercourse. The red ones were even a cinnamon bun flavour.\n\nGiven that your standard Vault jumpsuit only provides +10 Radiation Resistance in the main Fallout 4, it seems Jimmy Hats are a useful bit of kit to carry around in case of emergency. When one gamer suggested you could use Jimmy Hats to get down and dirty with a Ghoul, someone else replied, \"New kink discovered, putting my jimmy in radiated stuff.\"\n\nAnother fan joked, \"Best to stock up now everyone. Just in case. If the girlfriend asks why you've got 200 stocked, you're just taking precautions haha,\" and a third said, \"I was not familiar with the term 'Jimmy hat'. Now that I think about it, I can see how one would come up with this name......but when I first saw them, I thought they were single round cookies in colored plastic wrapping \ud83d\udc80\"\n\nWe'd politely suggest you don't go around trying to eat Fallout: London's Jimmy Hats, but this clever joke shows just how invested in expanding the world's lore the team is. Fallout: London is already a fan-favourite overhaul, but with its middling review scores due to a slew of bugs and glitches, we might let it stew for a bit longer before putting on our Jimmy Hats and hitting the mean streets of Laaaaandan.", "source": {"uri": "ggrecon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ggrecon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_modding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game modding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Howard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Todd Howard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersion_(virtual_reality)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immersion (virtual reality)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Thames", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "River Thames"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Isle_Studios", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black Isle Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-player character"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slang", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cinnamon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghoul", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ghoul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software bug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gamer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://www.ggrecon.com/media/4zfdot0m/fallout-london-practices-safe-sex.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771431", "eventUri": "eng-9771431", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 540, "textEnd": 547}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Cain suggested 18 months, noting that he didn't think it'd be possible to do it in any faster than 12 months even with a \"death march crunch,\" but was then apparently told by the vice president of Interplay that any answer over six months would have resulted in the game's cancellation.\n\nIn a new thread on Twitter, where Sawyer discusses his \"useful skill\" of being able to tell when a game won't be completed \"with close to 100% accuracy,\" one Twitter user brings up this story of Cain's consultation on Van Buren. Sawyer responds, confirming that the RPG was never going to be completed in six months, and suggesting that Cain's 18-month estimate may not have been enough, either.\n\n\"Honestly his 18 month estimate was optimistic,\" Sawyer says. \"With the staff we had it would have been at least two years [in my opinion.]\n\n\"I don't think Tom French [Fallout 2 programmer] or I had ever suggested nine months was feasible.\"\n\nIt took another five years before a game called Fallout 3 was ever released, even if it was a different one made by different developers.

The weapon can theoretically solve the Commonwealth's water crisis and generate valuable purified water for trade. Introducing Thirst Zappers to settlers could revolutionize travel and trade in Fallout 4 , but water merchants may not be pleased with the competition.\n\nVeterans of Fallout 4's Nuka-World DLC will be more than familiar with one of the weapons it introduces, the Thirst Zapper. This weapon is a gift from Gage which allows the Sole Survivor to defeat the old Overboss despite being useless in terms of damage. However, its realpotential lies outside of combat.\n\nWhen the weapon is equipped or re-equipped, its ammo refills to maximum, giving it unlimited ammunition. Unlike most weapons, the Thirst Zapper does not shoot bullets or lasers, but water, which is highly desirable for every living thing, but especially for the residents of the Commonwealth. This means that giving every person a Thirst Zapper would ensure they never go thirsty again.\n\nFallout 4's Thirst Zapper Is A Strangely Useful Weapon\n\nAn Infinite Source Of Clean Water\n\nMost players will likely toss aside the Thirst Zapper after the \"Taken for a Ride\" quest due to its uselessness outside the Nuka-Cade. The branded squirt gun does, however, get much better if the Sole Survivor finds the Project Cobalt schematics, which were meant to turn any everyday item into a lethal weapon. After finding these schematics, the Thirst Zapper can become one of the most powerful weapons in Fallout 4, with a damage output which rivals the Fat Man mini-nuke launcher.\n\nShould the player avoid using these modifications, however, their weapon will be much more useful from a practical perspective. While the gameplay does not allow it to be used this way, realistically, people could fire the Zapper into bottles, watering cans, or directly onto withering crops. The animations do show a bottle of liquid being poured into the gun, but the 999 shots the player receives from a single bottle make it seem like the weapon is at least multiplying the water poured into it.\n\nProviding Infinite Water To Fallout 4's Thirsty Commonwealth\n\nThirst Zappers Could Solve The Wasteland's Water Crisis\n\nThere is great potential for a handheld, infinite water source to change the face of Fallout 4's Commonwealth. While the water crisis is not as dire as it was in Fallout 3's Capital Wasteland, many people still struggle to get water on a daily basis. Dialogue from Sturges during the \"Sanctuary\" side quest makes it clear that the fresh water running through the Commonwealth is still heavily irradiated. Water needs to be pumped from aquifers underground or highly purified to remove radiation and pathogens.\n\nThe value of water is further exemplified by its high value. Each can of purified water has a base value of 20 caps, and the player can exploit workshop mechanics to produce hundreds of cans. In fact, Fallout 4's best settlement locations can be set up to allow for potentially dozens of industrial water purifiers to be placed. Sheng Kowalski seems to be wise to the water-selling scheme, having monopolized Diamond City's sole reliable source of clean water, which the Sole Survivor can witness in a relatively hidden Fallout 4 quest, \"Pool Cleaning.\"\n\nThirst Zappers would all but remove the market demand for water from the Commonwealth's thirsty residents. Not only is it an infinite source of water, but it can be held in one hand, meaning it can be taken anywhere. Introducing Thirst Zappers could give settlers a greater ability to travel in Fallout 4, helping trade. However, water merchants like Sheng would certainly be displeased, having lost their captive audience.\n\nFallout 4\n\nBethesda's action RPG Fallout 4 puts players into the vault suit of the Lone Survivor, a pre-war soldier from an alternate future cryogenically frozen inside Vault 111. After their infant son is kidnapped, they venture out into the irradiated wasteland of the Commonwealth to scour the ruins of Boston for any sign of him. In doing so, they encounter various factions and companions and use an array of skills and abilities to navigate the apocalyptic remnants of society.\n\nRPG\n\nAction\n\nOpenCritic Top Critic Rating:87/100\n\nFranchise Fallout\n\nPlatform(s) PC , PS4 , PS5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X , Xbox Series S\n\nReleased November 10, 2015\n\nDeveloper(s) Bethesda\n\nPublisher(s) Bethesda\n\nEngine Creation\n\nESRB M FOR MATURE: BLOOD AND GORE, INTENSE VIOLENCE, STRONG LANGUAGE, USE OF DRUGS\n\nExpand", "source": {"uri": "screenrant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenRant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_o@screenrant.com", "name": "Jacob O", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4:_Nuka-World", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4: Nuka-World"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NES_Zapper", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NES Zapper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirst", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thirst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Downloadable content"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sole_Survivor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sole Survivor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasteland_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wasteland (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schematic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Schematic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_Man", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fat Man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handheld_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Handheld game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quest (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCritic", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenCritic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Software Rating Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Softworks", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bethesda Softworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Water_Polo", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Water Polo", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Sanitary_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Sanitary Engineering", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Water_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Water Parks", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fallout-4-next-gen-update-piggy-bank-gun.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771431", "eventUri": "eng-9771431", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-11-10", "textStart": 4510, "textEnd": 4527}], "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

However, assuming another Destiny sequel happens, one new feature for both Fallout 5 and Destiny 3 is already in high demand among fans of the two franchises.\n\nMore specifically, future Fallout and Destiny games should consider expanding their roster of playable characters. Even before introducing new characters, both franchises already have a wealth of familiar factions to choose from to offer distinct playable characters. Especially considering that this feature could be key to introducing several new gameplay and storytelling mechanics, these franchises should arguably bite the bullet with this feature in future games.\n\nThe demand for the Fallout franchise to offer multiple, distinct playable characters has always been a popular request among fans of the franchise. Ever since Fallout 76 announced a ghoul playable character feature would be coming to the game, the demand for this feature has only continued to grow. This means that ultimately, future Fallout games will be at an inevitable crossroads to keep this feature alive.\n\nIf this feature comes to future Fallout games, it shouldn't stop at just ghouls and Vault dwellers. By now, there are already tons of contemporary and fan-favorite factions in the Fallout games that could offer interesting perspectives for a playable character.\n\nDepending on the setting of the game and where it fits into the Fallout timeline, some of these familiar factions could end up appearing in Fallout 5 anyway, which would make them a seemingly perfect candidate to introduce new playable characters. Even though players can normally become honorary members of these factions throughout the franchise, playing through the entirety of the game as a member of these factions could provide a distinct gameplay experience from the traditional Vault dwellers that make up the majority of the Fallout franchise's protagonists.\n\nGiven the direction of recent expansions for Destiny 2, this franchise could also stand to benefit from experimenting with a wider variety of playable characters. For a long time now, Destiny 2 has been blurring the lines between the three existing character classes. This trend generally started with the Subclass 3.0 updates, which allow players to wield some of the abilities that were previously exclusive to the three-character classes respectively. Then more recently, the Prismatic Subclasses and Exotic Class items have taken this even further.\n\nAdditionally, Destiny 2's Vanguard has also developed newfound alliances with some of the Traveler's former enemies, such as the Cabal and Fallen. So, based on both of these two trends, the future of the Destiny franchise arguably has the perfect solution to solve its character-class identity crisis by offering a wider variety of playable character options, potentially including Cabal and Fallen among other races of Guardians. Such a change could be key to introducing RPG elements into the franchise, which could be a refreshing twist to Destiny 2's storytelling. Not to mention, new playable characters could also provide new gameplay opportunities such as a wider variety of abilities and weaponry.\n\nll in all, an expanded variety of playable characters arguably seems like a natural progression for both franchises just waiting to happen, putting Fallout 5 and Destiny 3 in the same boat. Despite Fallout 5 and Destiny 3 still being a long way away from release, now is a great time to get these conversations happening about what fans hope to see from these future games.", "source": {"uri": "sakeinsgaming.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sakein's Gaming"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Destiny (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_character", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Player character"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghoul", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ghoul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Destiny 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Game mechanics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_76", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 76"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanguard_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vanguard (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Character class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Role-playing video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transformers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Protagonist"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://sakeinsgaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/fallout-76-destiny-2-gamerant-cu-1.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771431", "eventUri": "eng-9771431", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

We've got a handy Fallout 76 Holiday Scorched 2024 event guide to help maximise the rewards you can collect, but it's not been all mistletoe and wine for players since the patch. Last week's update was almost immediately met with feedback that included map glitches (like quest markers not showing up) and instances of crashing - a lot of it on PS5, seemingly.\n\nHappily, the ghost of Christmas past has heard your complaints and Bethesda is pushing out a Fallout 76 hotfix today that should resolve the majority of the reported problems. Over in the game's subreddit, senior community manager, Richard 'Ghost Rich' Stanford told players that the dev team was aware of the \"ongoing map issues\" and was working on a fix. The game crashes have been happening for the past few weeks, and on that topic, he said that was was under investigation as well, adding players on PlayStation should use the console's crash reporter.\n\nToday's hotfix \"will bring fixes to the map and some stability improvements to all platforms\" according to a Reddit update yesterday, and Fallout 76 servers will be going down to roll this out. Meanwhile, players wondering where the heck the Santatron Collectron is will hopefully see it in the Atomic Shop update today, post this update. The Collectron is usually free in-store for Holiday Scorched but didn't appear last week. In a Reddit post last week about the robot's whereabouts, Stanford said he was touching base with the dev team. It hasn't been explicitly mentioned ahead of today's Fallout 76 hotfix, but we can keep our fingers crossed!\n\nIn the meantime, here's when Fallout 76 servers are going offline for today's hotfix.\n\nFallout 76 server maintenance times\n\nFallout 76 servers are going offline today, Tuesday, July 30 at 3pm BST / 10am EDT / 7am PDT, as confirmed by the @BethesdaSupport Twitter account.

But players haven't exactly had the perfect experience. If you have been facing crashing issues, you certainly aren't alone.\n\nWhile it's common for crashing issues to pop up right after a game launches, the London mod's current condition has left the Fallout 4 community impressed and annoyed. It's a great mod, thanks to the team of professional modders behind the idea and development, but many players have been unable to enjoy the experience because the mod frequently stops working after loading up.\n\nIf you are facing the same problem, don't worry -- we'll help you work around the Fallout London crashing issues.\n\nA game can crash due to multiple reasons, ranging from internal hiccups to interruptions on the player's side.\n\nIn the case of Fallout London, players have reported being unable to progress after the Train cutscene as the mod crashes to their desktop screen immediately after. One player reported the game sent them to the Windows setup screen, which sounds pretty concerning. Thankfully, there's a fix:\n\nAfter implementing this workaround in Fallout London, you should be able to progress beyond the train cutscene. But this isn't it -- players have also been facing a similar crash because of the Weapon Debris setting. We recommend downloading this mod to help fix that anomaly.\n\nIf you are still crashing out of Fallout London after trying the workarounds, we recommend restarting your system -- doing this has fixed residual hiccups for many players. Also, ensure you abide by all the requirements to run the mod as announced by the devs. If you have yet to download the mod, check out our detailed installation guide.", "source": {"uri": "dotesports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dot Esports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sharmila_ganguly@dotesports.com", "name": "Sharmila Ganguly", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_modding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game modding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Role-playing video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutscene", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cutscene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://dotesports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fallout-London-players-1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771431", "eventUri": "eng-9771431", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Taking place sometime between Fallout 1 and Fallout 2, this game hops across the pond to tell a tale of the apocalypse in Old Blighty. Waking up in a mysterious laboratory, we customize our character under the careful watch of two scientists, before circumstances lead to our escape into the ruined streets of London.\n\nFallout London overhauls many of Fallout 4's mechanics while introducing some new ones. One of these new mechanics is the option of selecting Starting Traits when you make your character. These function near-identically to the traits from Fallout: New Vegas, allowing you to modify your starting character with traits that each provide a benefit and a drawback. This guide will break down the available options and discuss which ones are the most useful for certain builds.\n\nRelated\n\nHow to Play Fallout London on Steam & GOG\n\nFallout London is an amazing mod for Fallout 4, but it can be tricky to get working. Here's how to install and play the mod.\n\nAcrobat\n\nThe Acrobat Trait allows you to trade carry weight for speed, granting +10% Movement Speed but reducing your Carrying Capacity by 50lbs. This can be helpful if you're using melee weapons, so you can get in close more easily, but the loss of Carrying Capacity is a pretty huge tradeoff due to having less access to storage in the early stages of the game. If you can push through the early-game then this trait can be quite useful for ranging across London.\n\nChem Head\n\nChem Head gives -1 to all SPECIAL Stats whenever you aren't under the influence of Chems, forcing you to regularly dose up if you want to be at full strength. Thankfully, it also quadruples the duration of all Chems to make this easier and help you get more out of all your Chems. This Trait can be incredible if you can handle the penalty, especially if you have a high Intelligence Stat and the right Perks to craft your own Chems.\n\nClaustrophobic\n\nThis one's a tough recommendation. It gives you +1 to all SPECIAL stats when you're outdoors, in exchange for turning that into a -1 to all SPECIAL stats whenever you're indoors. Since decent chunks of the game take place inside buildings and London's Tube Network is extensive, this is likely a bad choice despite the theoretically huge buff.\n\nFour Eyes\n\nSimple and straightforward, Four Eyes gives you +1 Perception while wearing glasses and -1 Perception if you aren't. Once you grab some glasses, this is just free Perception, making this is an excellent pick for builds that focus on gunplay.\n\nGifted\n\nGifted makes leveling up harder by reducing exp gain by 15%, but in exchange, it increases all SPECIAL stats by 1. This is a massive boost early on, though naturally, the slower leveling can be a problem later on. Since Intelligence increases EXP earned, you'll be able to offset some of, if not all of, this penalty eventually.\n\nHeavy Handed\n\nThis Trait is great for melee builds if you aren't a fan of Power Attacks. It increases all Melee and Unarmed Damage by 20% but makes Power Attacks meaningless. Since Power Attacks are quite slow and can be interrupted easily, this is worth considering if you want to hit fast and hard.\n\nHoarder\n\nThis one is pretty much always a good pick. It gives you an extra 75lbs of Carrying Weight in exchange for dropping your movement speed to zero when you're over-encumbered. Running around while over-encumbered is never a good idea anyway, and the extra Carrying Weight will make it harder to hit your weight limit in the first place.\n\nKamikaze\n\nThe Trait of Choice for a Glass Cannon Build, Kamikaze regenerates your Action Points 50% faster in exchange for taking 20% more weapon damage. This makes it easier to sprint around, reposition, and use VATS to cripple enemy limbs in combat. If you're building a Sniper or any kind of ranged build, it shouldn't be too hard to mitigate that extra incoming damage by taking cover and playing a little defensively.\n\nNight Owl\n\nNight Owl is a Trait that, with a little planning, can be easily taken advantage of. It grants +1 to Perception and Intelligence at night, in exchange for penalizing both during the day. If you plan carefully and rest through the daytime, you can easily have the bonus anytime it matters.\n\nNumbskull\n\nA potentially powerful Trait that comes with a steep penalty. Numbskull gives you a permanent +1 bonus to Strength, Endurance, and Luck. In exchange, your Intelligence can never be raised above 3, making certain builds impossible. If you don't care about the Intelligence Stat, then this can be a good pick for getting some free bonus stats.\n\nPuritan\n\nThe Puritan Trait grants you +1 Strength and Endurance, helping you to hit harder, carry more, and giving you more HP to work with. The trade-off, however, is that using Chems or drinking Alcohol will reverse this bonus. The exceptions to this are Stimpacks, Rad-X, and Radaway, so you can still manage your health and deal with radiation, but you won't be able to use powerful drugs like Hero or take advantage of the buffs granted by alcohol without losing 1 Strength and 1 Endurance. If you're up to the challenge, this could still be a very nice bonus on builds using melee weapons, or just if you want extra carrying capacity and health.\n\nSleepwalker\n\nThe Sleepwalker Trait is a fun one, causing you to occasionally wake up in random places after sleeping. This can be amazing if you enjoy exploring and want to stumble across all kinds of random locations, but can also be troublesome if you decide to take a nap and end up somewhere you aren't prepared for. It's a pretty safe choice and can lead to some very interesting discoveries, but it's entirely down to personal taste. Much like Wild Wasteland in New Vegas, this can lead to some entertaining encounters.\n\nFallout 4\n\nRPG\n\nAction\n\nSystems\n\nOpenCritic Reviews Top Critic Rating:87/100 Critics Recommend:89%\n\nFranchise Fallout\n\nPlatform(s) PC , PS4 , PS5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X , Xbox Series S\n\nReleased November 10, 2015\n\nDeveloper(s) Bethesda\n\nPublisher(s) Bethesda\n\nEngine Creation\n\nESRB M FOR MATURE: BLOOD AND GORE, INTENSE VIOLENCE, STRONG LANGUAGE, USE OF DRUGS\n\nHow Long To Beat 27 Hours\n\nX|S Enhanced No\n\nPS Plus Availability Extra & Premium\n\nFile Size Xbox Series 36 GB (May 2024)\n\nExpand", "source": {"uri": "gamerant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Game Rant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thomas_hawkins@gamerant.com", "name": "Thomas Hawkins", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_modding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game modding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Game mechanics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbskull_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Numbskull (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamikaze", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamikaze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleepwalker_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sleepwalker (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steam (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puritans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Puritans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apocalypse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Experience point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOG.com", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GOG.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_balance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Game balance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melee_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melee weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Underground", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London Underground"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCritic", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenCritic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Softworks", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bethesda Softworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Educational_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Educational Games", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Build_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Build Management", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/fallout-london_traits-feature-image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771431", "eventUri": "eng-9771431", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-11-10", "textStart": 6260, "textEnd": 6277}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Someone's even created a mod with the sole purpose of changing all references to association football to its American name, soccer.\n\n\"It's a soccer ball\" was uploaded to Nexus mods over the weekend, and as you may guess, most users aren't seeing the funny side. \"No, it's definitely a football,\" one player says.\"Only Americans incorrectly call it \"Soccer\" for some reason, what even is a \"Soccer\" lmao.\"\n\nA few do acknowledge that this mod is pretty harmless, as it really doesn't affect anyone who doesn't want to use it. The mod's creator, who goes by GrumpyOldNord, even confirms that this should be taken with a grain of salt: \"To be fair, I only tagged it as humor, joke, or just for fun.\" However, they do note that other users have since added unrealistic and horror tags.\n\nBut scrolling through the comments, it becomes painfully apparent that this is no laughing matter for many players. Arguments about whether or not people should respect the local phrases have since escalated to the typical name-calling you'd expect, as well as a number of strange arguments about how aluminium is spelled.\n\nComplaints about the lack of guns are also rolling in, as many feel that Team Folon has short-changed players with a minimal selection of weapons. But as the UK's gun laws are drastically different, it makes sense that players won't be able to find AR15s just lying around. \"Brother, you're in Britain, not Florida. The gun design also makes more sense in Britain. Have you seen London's 9mm pistol? You probably didn't since you probably didn't play the mod fully before complaining,\" someone else points out.\n\nBut the most concerning thing about this mod is how well your PC will be able to handle it alongside Fallout: London. There have already been plenty of reports on crashes and bugs, so much so that one of the developers had to post a solutions megathread to the Fallout: London Reddit. So, if you're experiencing crashes on launch, green UI, or an inability to select certain characters, you may want to browse this thread before thinking about downloading any new mods.", "source": {"uri": "pcgamer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "pcgamer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elie_gould@pcgamer.com", "name": "Elie Gould", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_modding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game modding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloquialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colloquialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horror fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9\u00d719mm_Parabellum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "9\u00d719mm Parabellum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software bug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pistol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pistol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "User interface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DnKkTbNKQMzEcYbFov6KjU-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771431", "eventUri": "eng-9771431", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

There's a lot laid out by Bethesda for players to find, but in many cases, they're are willing to carve out their own adventures and make their own objectives.\n\nThe sandbox of Fallout 76 is vast, and players of the series have always been keen to take themselves on little excursions to find the items they'd be proud to show off - and that's where Nuka-Cola Orange comes in. Introduced in the Fallout 4 Nuka-World DLC, the consumable offers some great benefits. Drinking Nuka-Cola Orange will give you 150HP, 50AP and a +25 buff to your Rad Resistance. Plus, if you're going hard on your survival roleplay, the drink will give you a 15% boost on your Water meter.\n\nWith that in mind, then, here's everywhere you can find the Fallout 76 Nuka-Cola Orange bottles you need to make your collection as impressive as it can be.\n\nFallout 76 Nuka-Cola Orange locations\n\nIf you're after some of the good stuff yourself, you're in luck. It might seem like Nuka-Cola Orange is pretty tough to come buy, but there are a couple of fairly consistent ways to get your hands on it.\n\nThe best of the Fallout 76 Nuka-Cola Orange locations has to be the Whitespring Resort in the Savage Divide area of Appalachia, which has been taken over by Responders. You can head upstairs when in the Refuge and speak to Bubbles, a Miss Nanny robot who has been turned into a promotional bot for Nuka-Cola. You can buy a bottle of Nuka-Cola Orange from her, as well as other hard-to-find variants of the soda like Nuka-Grape and Nuka-Cola Dark.\n\nSimilarly, Fallout 76 Nuka-Cola Orange bottles can be found in the Nuka-Cola vending machine at the newly-built Nuka-World on Tour.\n\nThere is a single one-time pickup of the refreshing bevvy in the game too, with the Eta Psi House in the Forest area of the map housing a Nuka-Cola shrine in its basement, with a single bottle hidden inside.\n\nThe Fallout 76 Nuka-Cola Orange locations might seem a little sparse, but the vendors you can buy the drink from are likely to refresh their wares not long after you've bought them out of it, meaning that after a few days, you can head back and buy another.

The Prototype UP77 'Limitless Potential' stands among one of the most unique firearms, and as powerful as it is, it is equally challenging and somewhat tedious to look for.\n\nLocated within University Credit Union in Fallout 4, obtaining the weapon requires an awful lot of lockpicking and Terminal-hacking, which can be difficult if players aren't adequately leveled. To find and unlock The University Credit Union, bring yourself a bunch of Bobby Pins and get ready to do heaps of exploring.\n\nRelated\n\n8 Best Weapons In Fallout 4 (& How To Get Them)\n\nFallout 4 offers plenty of firearms and melee weapons, that come with legendary effects and can be further enhanced with mods for better utility.\n\nUniversity Point Location In Fallout 4\n\nSouthern-Central Region Of Commonwealth\n\nTo find the Prototype UP77 'Limitless Potential,' players must venture to a faction of the Institute, University Point Student Union, as it is locked in the Credit Union bank vault. This can be found in the Southern-Central region of the Commonwealth, specifically between Andrew Station and Neponset Park. Take a look at your Pip-Boy in Fallout 4 to find the most convenient fast-travel spots nearby.\n\nThere are two entrances to the union, with the public entrance identifiable with a 'Bank' sign outside, which is where players need to go. This will give you access to a small lobby separated from the back employee area. This segment is locked by a Terminal that players of Novice-level must hack into.\n\nWhen you approach the building, beware of the hostile Synths patrolling the area outside. When you enter the area, ensure you're ready for a fight and packed with ammo and consumables for survival.\n\nUpon taking care of the enemies, you can head indoors and make an immediate right to find the Terminal in Fallout 4. Use it to unlock the steel door blocking your path, allowing you to enter the building. Once you get through, head downstairs to find yourself inside the Student Credit Union.\n\nYou will find useful items, including a Bobby Pin Box, on the bottom shelf beneath the cashier machines in the Credit Union. This Box is especially useful when clearing out this building for items.\n\nHow To Unlock The University Credit Union Vault\n\nRequires Master-level Lockpicking\n\nHeading down the next set of stairs, open the Security Gate to find another Novice-level Terminal. This must be used to hack open the Credit Union bank vault in Fallout 4. Alternatively, those who want to save their Bobby Pins can access the vault by using Gerald's Vault Password.\n\nGerald's Vault Password can be found in the employee area, kitchen, and break room. As there are quite a few vaults and terminals within this building, Streamer House on YouTube recommends leveling up your lockpicking skills and getting the locksmith perk to ensure you don't miss out on any key items.\n\nWhen you unlock and enter the vault, you will find several safes, some already open, while others are broken. Among them, you will see a locked safe in the second row of the right-hand wall that requires Master-level lockpicking in Fallout 4.\n\nWithin the open and locked safes, a plethora of extra items are worth taking, including an Ammo Box containing Plasma Cartridges, Caliber, and Rounds. You can also pick up Nuka Cola, Rad-X, and several crafting materials. Two more locked Advanced-level and Master-level safes also contain ammunition and valuable materials.\n\nMaster-level is the highest-ranking lock in Fallout 4 and, therefore, the hardest to open. If you haven't leveled up this skill yet, you won't be able to use your Bobby Pins to open the safe. To bypass this issue, look for Campbell's Safe Password, which can be found in the student records terminal in Sedgwick Hall.\n\nSedgwick Hall is another Institute faction close by, within University Point. You can find the key card to open the Master-lock safe by heading through a broken wall hole within the main first-floor entrance. Players must go through the student records terminal in the mainframe and navigate through the necessary files, reaching the following entry, listed in order:\n\n'Student Directory for 2077-2078' > 'Enrolled Graduates' > 'G-M'\n\nTo obtain Campbell's Safe Password in Fallout 4 within this Terminal, players are required to first view the entries of the professor's terminal on the third floor before accessing the student records terminal.\n\nWhether you went to acquire the password or lockpicked your way into the Master-level safe on the second row, you will find a red button on the right side of the safe's interior. Press it to open a wall panel within the vault, allowing access to the secret neighboring lab.\n\nPrototype UP77 'Limitless Potential' Location & Stats\n\nWeapon Features & Abilities\n\nUpon entering, you will find the Prototype UP77 'Limitless Potential' on a large table in the center of the room, available to pick up. You will also conveniently find Fusion Cells surrounding the weapon and a few workbenches around the room. The Weapons Workbench will allow you to immediately customize and mod your newly acquired firearm if you wish.\n\nWeapon Features\n\nStats\n\nType\n\nUnique Energy weapon\n\nEffect\n\nUnlimited ammo capacity\n\nAmmo\n\nFusion Cell\n\nMagazine Size\n\nUnlimited\n\nFire Rate\n\n90\n\nRange\n\n227\n\nAccuracy\n\n96\n\nSell Value\n\n306 Caps\n\nOne of the unique features of the Prototype UP77 'Limitless Potential' weapon in Fallout 4 is that it possesses the Never Ending effect, which grants unlimited ammo capacity. This shouldn't be confused with having unlimited ammo, as it utilizes Fusion Cells, like other laser weapons found in the wasteland. Instead, it has an unrestricted Magazine, eliminating the need to reload when firing.\n\nNot only does this make you faster when dealing damage in combat, but it also means that players will never have to stop shooting to reload. Due to this feature, the weapon aids in survivability, as those brief pauses from reloading are usually when players become vulnerable and prone to being attacked by enemies in Fallout 4.\n\nSource: Streamer House/YouTube\n\nFallout 4\n\nRPG\n\nAction\n\nSystems\n\nOpenCritic Reviews Top Critic Rating:87/100 Critics Recommend:89%\n\nFranchise Fallout\n\nPlatform(s) PC , PS4 , PS5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X , Xbox Series S\n\nReleased November 10, 2015\n\nDeveloper(s) Bethesda\n\nPublisher(s) Bethesda\n\nEngine Creation\n\nESRB M FOR MATURE: BLOOD AND GORE, INTENSE VIOLENCE, STRONG LANGUAGE, USE OF DRUGS\n\nHow Long To Beat 27 Hours\n\nX|S Enhanced No\n\nFile Size Xbox Series 51 GB (December 2023)\n\nMetascore 87\n\nPS Plus Availability Extra & Premium\n\nExpand", "source": {"uri": "screenrant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenRant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "samar_abedian@screenrant.com", "name": "Samar Abedian", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limitless_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Limitless (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_picking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lock picking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cena", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Cena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Password"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip-Boy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pip-Boy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_modding", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game modding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Security hacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melee_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melee weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasteland_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wasteland (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Experience point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Software Rating Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mainframe computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Softworks", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bethesda Softworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metacritic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Vaulting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Vaulting", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Pole_Vault", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Pole Vault", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/a-character-with-university-credit-union-in-fallout-4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771431", "eventUri": "eng-9771431", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-11-10", "textStart": 6441, "textEnd": 6458}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

You don't venture into the wasteland to find a family member (thank heck), but rather answers and connections. The post-apocalyptic playground may still feature all the tenets of Fallout 4, from junk collecting and armor and weapon crafting to settlement building, but wrapped in the remnants of a completely different culture. London has fallen, and you have no idea who you are.\n\nAn amnesiac protagonist isn't a new concept, yet it remains a solid enough mechanic to introduce players to the world while allowing them to shape their own story. The lack of a voiced protagonist furthers that goal - for all intents and purposes, you're one of the people from the labs. Nothing is known about you or the scientists seemingly conducting experiments in a facility beneath The Shard. When a gang known as the Vagabonds breach it on an alleged supply run, you break free.\n\n\"It's amazing and - to employ a clich\u00e9 - really makes you feel like you've awakened in a retrofuturistic London that's gone to hell and back.\"\n\nSome tea bags, Radshrews and terminal digging later, and the only relevant name throughout it all is Smythe (Mr. or Mrs., depending on your gender). They don't seem all that hung up on you leaving - in fact, they subsequently unlock the doors, allowing you to take The Tube and escape. The journey doesn't last long, as it crashes onto the street, leaving you with afflictions resulting in less damage dealt and more taken. After a brief conversation with the same Vagabonds, it's time to cut loose.\n\nJoin up with the Peaky Blinders rejects and help them with their tasks, perhaps get some sweet weapons and clothes, or venture to the canned goods factory to locate the Thamesfolk. You can also reject both choices and explore, weaving in and out of the main quest as you please.\n\nCompared to Fallout 4 or many other open-world titles, Fallout: London doesn't immediately douse you in random occurrences and side quests. The overcast skies, incessant rain and minimal music lend a darker mood to it all. The meticulously detailed environment further adds to the immersion. You'll walk down the street and see wrecks of double-decker buses, maybe venture into the Fesco (clearly based on Tesco) to see what's available and encounter some Bloatflies. The radio offers a mix of intriguing beats when the soundtrack isn't offering dour chords during the silent moments and heart-thumping beats during combat.\n\nThere are still terminals to investigate and NPCs to converse with, but the world-building relies almost as much, if not more, on the decrepit streets and skeletal remains. It's amazing and - to employ a clich\u00e9 - really makes you feel like you've awakened in a retrofuturistic London that's gone to hell and back. This may not vibe with every kind of player out there, especially if they need a constant stream of activities on the map, or random occurrences to keep themselves occupied.\n\n\"The fact that certain decisions have proper consequences is another feather in the mod's cap, to say nothing of all the speech checks for adding some extra flair to your dialogue exchanges.\"\n\nSticking to a quest path is beneficial for those who want more consistent narrative beats, and Fallout: London delivers in that department as well. I chose to head to the canned goods factory and got caught up with the owner wanting a rebellious worker taken care of. After robbing the former blind, I did the deed, received some Tickets (the de facto currency), and hightailed it alongside my new dog, Churchill. We ventured to a checkpoint leading to Thameshaven, told that the front was barricaded, and proceeded through a series of irradiated underground tunnels that wouldn't be out of place in a Metro game.\n\nHelping the mutated Thamesfolk was key towards locating Archie, a boy who knew about the underground laboratories, and where we may potentially find another. First, a former Tommy conscript turned mercenary seeks to destroy some Mittenlurk nests before allowing me entry into the crashed plane to speak with Archie. What ensues is a game of \"the floor is lava\", navigating rooftops and makeshift walkways to avoid mega-radiated water, find the nests and destroy them.\n\nThroughout all this, Fallout: London is opening up to you through its characters about the state of its world and the different factions. The Vagabonds' leader Sebastian Gaunt is an ally of the Thamesfolk but is considered a wanted man by the Tommies. The Thamesfolk are sheltered and seemingly pitiful but also wary and passive-aggressive to outsiders.\n\nOther factions exist, each with dedicated quest chains, and it's a joy to slowly unravel this brutal world while coming to care about those within it. The fact that certain decisions have proper consequences is another feather in the mod's cap, to say nothing of all the speech checks for adding some extra flair to your dialogue exchanges. Unfortunately, the voice-acting ranges from decent to forgettable - it gets the job done, but very few performances stand out.\n\n\"Even if you can deal with all that, optimization remains one of the biggest hurdles to enjoying Fallout: London.\"\n\nHowever, it bears remembering that this is still Fallout 4's gameplay. The shooting mechanics and crafting are still very serviceable, but melee combat remains somewhat clunky. In a game that pushes for more of the latter, whether it's reserving ammunition for the harder-hitting foes or relying on knives in relatively close-quarters scenarios, it's rough.\n\nNot enough to make the game unplayable or outright annoying, but I lost count of all the times I tried to swing my knife again while my character was seemingly trapped in molasses, finishing the first attack. On the bright side, the selection of quirks at the beginning, allowing for further build specialization or just wacky fun, helped feed more into the role-playing.\n\nThe Fallout 4 base also means that despite excellent attention to detail, well-realized environments, and much more, the visuals remain several years behind some of today's best (or second-best). Even if you can deal with all that, optimization remains one of the biggest hurdles to enjoying Fallout: London. GOG is the best way to go, but even with a relatively smooth installation process, there are crashes galore. It starts when emerging from the Tube crash and continues, seemingly at random, regardless of what you do.\n\nInstalling another mod, Buffout 4, alongside some dependencies and a High FPS Physics Fix, resulted in a much more stable performance. However, the busier areas, whether it was the Thameshaven market or nighttime with lots of shadows and rain, resulted in severe FPS drops. Note that your mileage may vary and not in a good way - there are plenty who followed all the steps and tried other fixes, but still face crashes. Furthermore, the experience isn't bug-free, whether it's hands clipping through models, Churchill floating in the air when he's not blocking my path, etc.\n\n\"I feel excited to explore buildings, streets and locked doors - not for the XP, the loot or the materials, but to immerse myself further in this world and learn more about it.\"\n\nAt the end of the day, Fallout: London is a free mod with a scale rivaling many full-priced games. It offers tons of content, a compelling narrative with interesting characters and factions, and a stunningly realized world rife with detail. If Team FOLON can fix the various crashes and deliver more consistent performance, it's a worthy experience for any Fallout 4 fan (even if it doesn't revolutionize the well-worn gameplay). How long that may take and what it could break in the process is unknown.\n\nNevertheless, the current product is an enjoyable, solidly built experience. I feel excited to explore buildings, streets and locked doors - not for the XP, the loot or the materials, but to immerse myself further in this world and learn more about it.", "source": {"uri": "gamingbolt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GamingBolt"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ravi_sinha@gamingbolt.com", "name": "Ravi Sinha", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shard", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Shard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Protagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrofuturism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Retrofuturism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clich\u00e9", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clich\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_modding", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game modding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky_Blinders_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peaky Blinders (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Open world"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tube_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Tube (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Game mechanics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Armour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playground", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playground"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaving", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weaving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voice acting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junk_(ship)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Junk (ship)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amnesia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesco", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winston Churchill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOG.com", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GOG.com"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://gamingbolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fallout-London_03-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771431", "eventUri": "eng-9771431", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

The good news is that the modders are very much on the case and have been busy prepping fixes, though it's taken an outside modder to help those whose characters can't stop munching on pet food.\n\nSince London came out last week, following an unavoidable delay caused by Fallout 4's next-gen update, it's been earning lots of thumbs up (we've enjoyed what we've played so far), but folks have been running into lots of crashes and other bugs.\n\nWhile there are some steps you can take to make the mod crash less often, Team FOLON knows this isn't ideal and has put out a statement outlining its plans to deal with these teething issues beyond the kind of helpful triage that's been going on in Fallout: London's Discord server.\n\n\"We're working hard to fix the reported issues and expect to release an update soon,\" the team wrote, thanking players for both their patience and all of the feedback the mod's been getting. They added that those who're experiencing issues should consult this installation guide in order to make sure they've followed the process correctly, just in case that's behind any of the problems.\n\nOne of the issues that'll be fixed in the first update is \"an error with how the player's health is handled after the train crash, which disproportionately lowers the max HP of characters with already high health or endurance level\". So, if you've been getting insta-killed by Radshrews, you'll either need to wait, or - I'm so sorry - do some maths.\n\nSeriously, check out the Discord post below from Callum, a lead writer on the mod, either whip out you calculator so you can use Fallout 4's health scaling calculation to work out what your max health value should be, or cheat by consulting this chart.\n\nBefore that though, you'll be glad to hear that one modder has already taken it upon themselves to solve a potential problem that awaits those who've managed to overcome the teething issues - crippling dog food addiction. Yep, for some reason, the mod treats pet food like a chem, and I've already had it get its hooks in deep on my character.\n\nWhile getting this addiction to Prilladog treated isn't too much hassle, it can be expensive, enter modder Misslune's 'Dog Food Addiction Remover', which allows you to down meaty chunks without fear of becoming a junkie. Just watch out, as they reccomend making sure you've dealt with any existing dog food addiction your character might have before you install, in order to avoid any issues that might cause.\n\nWhat do you think for Fallout: London so far?

Both Xbox's gaming revenue and its content and services revenue are up year-over-year by 44% and 61%, though it is worth noting a lot of that grow is due to the impact of the Activision Blizzard acquisition, which wasn't there to be influencing these numbers last year, since it only fully closed in October.\n\nIn fact, as Kotaku's Ethan Gach has pointed out, in the case of the gaming revenue specifically, the company would have actually been down by 4% without the 48 points of revenue attributed to Activision Blizzard. In terms of content and services, it'd still be up, but only by 3%. This is similar to last quarter, which would also have seen Xbox's gaming revenue be down 4% without ActiBlizz, while content and services would have been in the green by just 1%.\n\nMeanwhile, the recent trend of hardware sales generally dipping or plateauing - which isn't limited to just Xbox - has continued, with this earnings report noting it's down 42% year-over-year, an increase on last quarter's mark of a 31% year-over-year drop in console sales.", "source": {"uri": "vg247.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VG247"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Game_Pass", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Game Pass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IGN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_76", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 76"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ella_Purnell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ella Purnell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walton_Goggins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walton Goggins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision_Blizzard", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Activision Blizzard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xbox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotaku", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kotaku"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Puzzle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Puzzle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Economy_and_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Economy and Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/fallout-tv-show-fresh-trailer-date-change-01.jpg?width=1200&height=600&fit=crop&enable=upscale&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771431", "eventUri": "eng-9771431", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

He's the perfect dose of British charm to liven up the wasteland, and while players have reported a bug that traps Churchill after you dismiss him, you can avoid that fate by keeping Churchill at your side.\n\nRelated\n\nFallout London Finally Releases With New Story, Environments, & Characters\n\nAfter years of development and several major setbacks, the long-awaited Fallout: London mod is finally here and it's everything Team FOLON promised.\n\nWhere To Find & Recruit Churchill\n\nFind Him Near The Factory\n\nAfter installing Fallout London and some city exploration, you should make your way toward the Prilladog Food Factory. This factory can be found near the center of the city map, along the southern shore of the Thames. You should pass by the building while journeying to Thameshaven. When you arrive there, you will see Churchill fighting off a pack of stray dogs. It's time to jump to the rescue of your new furry friend and kill the strays.\n\nWith Churchill safe, head to the entrance of Prilladog Food Factory, where you can talk to a Factory Guard. Regardless of how you respond to him, he will offer to give you Churchill. By accepting his offer, you can speak to Churchill like any other companion and invite him to travel with you. With that, you have a lovable and loyal guard dog at your side.\n\nWhat Can Churchill Do As A Companion?\n\nHow To Protect Churchill\n\nOnce Churchill is at your side and ready to explore the wasteland in Fallout: London, he will behave like many other companions. When you ask him to follow you, he will stay by your side and join you wherever you go. If you're worried about bringing him somewhere dangerous, you can also ask him to stay put. When you need to offload some of your loot, you can trade with Churchill, allowing him to carry some of your items for a while.\n\nOne of the biggest let-downs of Fallout: London is that you cannot actually pet Churchill.\n\nAs a dog, Churchill is able to find loot and enemies, similar to Dogmeat in Fallout 4. The game will let you know when Churchill has found something of interest and may lead you to the goods. Finally, when you enter combat, Churchill will help you fight off enemies, but be careful! If he goes down, he will need a stimpak to get him up and at it again. Keep an eye on your bulldog, and Churchill will be with you through it all in Fallout 4's amazing Fallout: London mod.\n\nFallout 4\n\nRPG\n\nAction\n\nFranchise Fallout\n\nPlatform(s) PC , PS4 , PS5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X , Xbox Series S\n\nReleased November 10, 2015\n\nPublisher(s) Bethesda\n\nESRB M FOR MATURE: BLOOD AND GORE, INTENSE VIOLENCE, STRONG LANGUAGE, USE OF DRUGS", "source": {"uri": "screenrant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenRant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emmy_holthe@screenrant.com", "name": "Emmy Holthe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Winston Churchill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_modding", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Video game modding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulldog", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bulldog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software bug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Software Rating Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Role-playing video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Softworks", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bethesda Softworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Action game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Platform game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 4"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Mod", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Mod", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service_Animals", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service Animals", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Realism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Realism", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal_Assisted_Therapy", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal Assisted Therapy", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/churchill-the-bulldog-fallout-london.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771431", "eventUri": "eng-9771431", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-11-10", "textStart": 3050, "textEnd": 3067}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

Glowing, Rabid, and Suicide Mole Rats in the game can cause significant damage. Watch out for Suicide Mole Rats with explosives strapped to their back - they'll detonate on impact.\n\nWhen it comes to the horrors of the Wasteland, Fallout 4 boasts some fairly monstrous creatures but one player recently learned that even the most lowly enemy hides a disturbing secret. Fairly soon after leaving Vault 111, the Sole Survivor will be tasked with defending themselves against all manner of mutated creatures including Radroaches and Bloatflies, yet some of the most annoying are Mole rats. These fleshy abominations can deliver a terrifying chomp if they get too close and they have the added ability of tunnelling away from danger, making them difficult to pin down.\n\nYet as it turns out, Mole Rats are even more disturbing than many players may have expected as revealed in this Reddit post by MysteriousPudding175 wherein it's proved that the mutated mammals actually have two sets of teeth.\n\nWhile most will likely already be familiar with the massive set of incisors that it uses to attack its prey, behind them is a different set of what appear to be molars used to crunch and chomp particular tough food. It's a bizarre discovery, one that managed to impress the comments section based on the number of similarly surprised veterans.\n\nRelated\n\n10 Fun Fallout 4 Easter Eggs You Might Have Missed\n\nFallout 4 is jam-packed with references to movies, TV shows, literature, and other games for players to find with these being some of the best.\n\nMole Rats Can Be Surprisingly Dangerous\n\nA Strange Creature Of War\n\nDespite their reputation as one of Fallout 4's fodder enemies, players shouldn't underestimate Mole Rats, especially when they're encountered at higher levels. A Glowing Mole Rat can be annoying for those who don't want to deal with an increase in their rad level but arguably the most annoying variant is the Rabid Mole Rat. This critter comes equipped with a poison-like ability that can deal damage over time, meaning the Sole Survivor will want to put down these beasts from as far away as possible.\n\nYet the most dangerous form of Mole Rat in Fallout 4 is undoubtedly the \"Suicide\" variant which charges at the player with a set of fragmentation mines strapped to its back. When they get too close, the explosives detonate, destroying the carrier but also unleashing a severe amount of damage on anyone and anything in the vicinity. It's unclear who's setting up the Mole Rats for such a vicious demise but it's presumed that Raiders are responsible.\n\nWhatever form the Mole Rat may take in Fallout 4, the radioactive creatures are some of the most iconic enemies in the entire franchise. While they may not have the imposing power of a Radscorpion or a Death Claw, there's just something fun about gunning down a pack of them in quick succession. Especially the Rabid Mole Rats, the less of those around the Commonwealth the better.\n\nSource: MysteriousPudding175/Reddit\n\nFallout 4\n\nRPG\n\nAction\n\nFranchise Fallout\n\nPlatform(s) PC , PS4 , PS5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X , Xbox Series S\n\nReleased November 10, 2015\n\nDeveloper(s) Bethesda\n\nPublisher(s) Bethesda\n\nEngine Creation\n\nESRB M FOR MATURE: BLOOD AND GORE, INTENSE VIOLENCE, STRONG LANGUAGE, USE OF DRUGS\n\nExpand", "source": {"uri": "screenrant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenRant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brad_lang@screenrant.com", "name": "Brad Lang", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasteland_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wasteland (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(animal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mole (animal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Incisor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sole_Survivor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sole Survivor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Explosive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein's_monster", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frankenstein's monster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Software Rating Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Role-playing video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Softworks", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bethesda Softworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Action game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Platform game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/MUDs", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/MUDs", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Rodents", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Rodents", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/a-character-from-fallout-4-with-wasteland-imagery.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771431", "eventUri": "eng-9771431", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-11-10", "textStart": 3317, "textEnd": 3334}], "sentiment": -0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

One such sidequest is \"Catching Up\", a fairly short jaunt to a nearby library on behalf of \"Sabertooth\" Syd. Syd wants to learn how to read and tasks you with grabbing some kids books from the library, and if you can find his childhood favorite: Dove's Dilemma, then that would be perfect.\n\nFallout London does a surprisingly good job of hiding that particular book, however, stashing it under a box in an easy-to-miss part of the library. This guide will explain how to start Syd's quest, how to get into the section of the library where the children's books are kept, and how to find a copy of Dove's Dilemma.\n\nRelated\n\nHow to Play Fallout London on Steam & GOG\n\nFallout London is an amazing mod for Fallout 4, but it can be tricky to get working. Here's how to install and play the mod.\n\nHow to Start Catching Up\n\nThe Catching Up Quest can be accessed at any point after you protect the Swan and Mitre and take out the scout that escaped. Once you've done this, just speak to \"Sabertooth\" Syd in the Swan and Mitre to learn about his plan and start the quest. He'll point you towards the Churchill Library to hunt down the books, which is thankfully only a short walk away.\n\nHow to Get into the Library's Right Wing\n\nTo get into the part of the library where the Children's Books are kept, you'll need to head up to the top floor first. The Chief Librarian's Office is up here, with a key to the Book Room lying on their desk. Open the door to their office while standing to one side of the door, since it's rigged up to a shotgun trap. After you get inside, you can steal the shotgun for personal use, along with anything else that isn't nailed down.\n\nSnag the Key from the Director's Desk and check the terminal to learn a bit more about how the library has been operating. That secure room of banned books sounds interesting, but it's unlikely to contain Dove's Dilemma. With this key we can now open the door to Churchill Library Right Wing, which can be found on the same floor you entered on. This section of the Library is where we'll find the Kid's Books Syd wants.\n\nHow to Find Dove's Dilemma\n\nClose\n\nYou'll see a ramp ahead once you enter the Right Wing. Take out the incoming Ghouls and then use that ramp to get upstairs. Turn around at the top of the ramp and look for a cardboard box on top of a shelf. Pick up the cardboard box by holding down E while looking at it, then move it somewhere else to reveal Dove's Dilemma hidden underneath it. Grab this book, then pick up some more kid's books from this library section to round out the collection you're giving to Syd. Once you've got four books you can head back to Syd and complete the quest.\n\nFallout 4\n\nRPG\n\nAction\n\nSystems\n\nOpenCritic Reviews Top Critic Rating:87/100 Critics Recommend:89%\n\nFranchise Fallout\n\nPlatform(s) PC , PS4 , PS5 , Xbox One , Xbox Series X , Xbox Series S\n\nReleased November 10, 2015\n\nDeveloper(s) Bethesda\n\nPublisher(s) Bethesda\n\nEngine Creation\n\nESRB M FOR MATURE: BLOOD AND GORE, INTENSE VIOLENCE, STRONG LANGUAGE, USE OF DRUGS\n\nHow Long To Beat 27 Hours\n\nX|S Enhanced No\n\nPS Plus Availability Extra & Premium\n\nFile Size Xbox Series 36 GB (May 2024)\n\nExpand", "source": {"uri": "gamerant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Game Rant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thomas_hawkins@gamerant.com", "name": "Thomas Hawkins", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quest (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_modding", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Video game modding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winger (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winston Churchill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steam (service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOG.com", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GOG.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shotgun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X_and_Series_S", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Series X and Series S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCritic", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenCritic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Software Rating Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Role-playing video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Softworks", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bethesda Softworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Action game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Platform game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gigabyte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox One"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Books", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Books", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Services/Library_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Services/Library Services", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/fallout-london_sabertooth-syd_request.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771431", "eventUri": "eng-9771431", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-11-10", "textStart": 3018, "textEnd": 3035}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

Check out this week's best Atomic Shop items and bundles below.\n\nThe Atomic Shop is an in-game store in Fallout 76 offering cosmetics, C.A.M.P. objects and more in exchange for a special currency called Atoms. Most purchases are unlocked account-wide, and may be accessed by any character on the account.\n\nSome objects require an in-game plan to be learned in order to gain access, while other items are only unlocked for a single, specified character. All exclusive items are character-bound, and cannot be dropped or traded with other players. The Atomic Shop is accessible at any time from the main menu, as well as the pause screen after leaving Vault 76 for the first time.\n\nThat's it for this week's refresh. Is there anything in particular that interests you?\n\nIf not, there's always next week, which we'll have covered, so be sure to check again next Tuesday!", "source": {"uri": "mp1st.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MP1st"}, "authors": [{"uri": "salman_haider_zaidi@mp1st.com", "name": "Salman Haider Zaidi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_76", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout 76"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Massive_Multiplayer_Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Massive Multiplayer Online", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Mystery_Shopping", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Mystery Shopping", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Visual_Arts/Museum_Stores", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Visual Arts/Museum Stores", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Razors", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Razors", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Scout_Shops", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Scout Shops", "wgt": 12}], "image": "https://mp1st.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/fallout76-4.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9771431", "eventUri": "eng-9771431", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 238, "textEnd": 245}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

One special group who joined the pilgrims on the St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Route, the route that began in the Northeast, is made up of four religious sisters from the Daughters of Mary, Mother of Healing Love. The group of sisters joined EWTN News In Depth on May 24 to share how they became involved in the pilgrimage and their experience so far. When the Eucharistic Revival first began, the sisters were asked by their bishop to be the point people for the diocese. They went on to organize the diocesan Eucharistic Revival and during this past year have been giving parish retreats on the Eucharist every second Saturday of the month. Mother Mary Maximilian of the Daughters of Mary, Mother of Healing Love told EWTN News In Depth host and EWTN News President and COO Montse Alvarado that being a part of the Eucharistic Revival has been \u201csuch a blessing for our community.\u201d After the sisters heard about the National Eucharistic Pilgrimage, they immediately felt drawn to participate as \u201cPerpetual Pilgrims\u201d \u2014 individuals selected to walk the pilgrimage together for the entire route. However, after reaching out to the National Eucharistic Congress, they were told this was only for youth. \u201cWe accepted that,\u201d Sister Maximilian said. \u201cAs much as my heart is 18, my body is not.\u201d Then, Father Roger Landry \u2014 who is leading the Seton Route \u2014 gave a Lenten mission at the sisters\u2019 parish and had dinner with some of the sisters. Sister Maximilian explained that Father Landry brought up the pilgrimage and the sisters shared their desire to take part. He said he would welcome the community of sisters to join them but the following morning explained that they would need to have their own support vehicle. Two hours later, the sisters received a donation to help pay for walking shoes, and at 3 p.m. the same day, they received a truck, trailer and driver. The sisters are now sleeping in a 30-foot Airstream camper trailer as they travel the Seton Route through many states on their way to Indianapolis, the final destination where all four pilgrimage routes will converge at the Eucharistic Congress taking place July 17-21. \u201cCamper life is a very interesting experience,\u201d Sister Maximilian said jokingly. She shared that the entire experience has been \u201cextraordinary \u2014 the outpouring of love that every faith community that we went to had to welcome the Lord Jesus.\u201d The Haitian community is one that especially stood out to the sisters during their many stops on the pilgrimage so far. Sister Maximilian described that instead of making the Sign of the Cross during Benediction, the Haitians they met opened their arms \u201cto receive the blessing of the Lord.\u201d The religious sister also praised the Perpetual Pilgrims and how they\u2019ve come together as a team so quickly. \u201cThey\u2019ve come together so beautifully, and they all jump out of the van just before Jesus comes and they kneel down so everybody knows that the King is coming,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cAnd they\u2019re leading praise and worship during all the walks and carrying heavy speakers, and it\u2019s just beautiful to watch them.\u201d For Sister Maximilian, the experience thus far has been \u201can amazing opportunity to express gratitude for the love that the Lord wants to pour out.\u201d \u201cHe wants to walk through this nation. He wants to bless his people. He wants to heal his people. He says, \u2018When I am lifted up, I will draw all men to myself.\u2019 He wants to draw them to himself, and we\u2019re watching that happen.\u201d So far, the sisters have journeyed through Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Maryland. On June 8, they were in Washington, D.C.

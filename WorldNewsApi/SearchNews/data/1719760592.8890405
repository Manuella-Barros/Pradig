Speaking after receiving condolences for his mother\u2019s passing, Nasrallah asserted, \u201cWe are facing an enemy without values or morals, surpassing the Nazis.\u201d The Lebanese Hezbollah leader emphasised that the horrific events in Rafah should motivate the world to press for an end to the aggression on Gaza. He called the massacre a wake-up call for those who are oblivious and silent, and condemned US hypocrisy, which he said played a significant role. Addressing countries normalising relations with Tel Aviv, Nasrallah asked, \u201cWill you normalise with these treacherous betrayers whose brutality knows no bounds?\u201d He stressed that the massacres should serve as a lesson for those relying on international laws to protect Lebanon. \u201cI see no future for this Nazi regime in the region,\u201d Nasrallah added as he slammed Israel\u2019s brutal bombardment of refugee tents in Rafah, which killed 45 people, including many children. The Hezbollah leader highlighted the disfigured bodies of children as evidence of Israel\u2019s \u201csavage, treacherous, and ruthless\u201d nature. The attack came two days after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered Israel \u201cto immediately halt\u201d the Rafah offensive, amid the ongoing aggression on Gaza that has so far killed more than 36,000 people since it started in October last year.

An official with the French presidency confirmed the agreement Wednesday, saying most of the money would be flowing to Ukraine in the form of a loan from the U.S. government backed by the proceeds of the frozen Russian assets in the European Union. Two other people familiar with the matter confirmed the arrangement.\n\nFinal technical negotiations were underway ahead of the summit to finalize the legal terms of the deal.\n\nThe announcement of the agreement comes as Biden landed in Italy to attend the summit of the world's leading democracies with an urgency to get big things done, including turning frozen Russian assets into billions of dollars to help Ukraine fight Russian President Vladimir Putin's war machine.\n\nThe security arrangement was aimed to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv, the White House said as Biden was headed to Europe.\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan said the security agreement would not commit U.S. troops directly to Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion -- a red line drawn by Biden, who's fearful of being pulled into direct conflict between the nuclear-armed powers.\n\n\"We want to demonstrate that the U.S. supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them and that we'll continue to help address their security needs,\" Sullivan said, adding \"this agreement will show our resolve.\"\n\nSullivan said aboard Air Force One that the goal of the financing plan was to have a loan that would \"pull forward the windfall profits from the seized assets\" of Russia, giving Ukraine a \"substantial source of funding\" to meet its immediate needs.\n\nThe national security adviser said he had a specific sum of money in mind, but declined to say if that figure was $50 billion. He stressed the urgency of getting Ukraine financial resources as soon as possible and that multiple countries would back the agreement.\n\n\"It's to provide the necessary resources to Ukraine now for its economic energy and other needs, so that it's capable of having the resilience necessary to withstand Russia's continuing aggression,\" Sullivan said.\n\nThis year's meeting comes three years after Biden declared at his first such gathering that America was back as a global leader following the disruptions to Western alliances that occurred when Donald Trump was president. Now, there's a chance this gathering could be the final G7 for Biden and other G7 leaders, depending on the results of elections this year.\n\nBiden and his counterparts from Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan will use the summit to discuss challenges related to artificial intelligence, migration, the Russian military's resurgence and China's economic might, among other topics. Pope Francis, Zelenskyy and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are joining the gathering at the Borgo Egnazia resort in the Puglia region of southern Italy.\n\nThe summit, opening Thursday, will play out after far-right parties across the continent racked up gains of surprising scale in just-concluded European Union elections. Those victories -- coupled with upcoming elections in the United Kingdom, France and the United States -- have rattled the global political establishment and added weightiness to this year's summit.\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to U.S. and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center, an international affairs think tank. \"We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\"\n\nThe G7 is an informal bloc of industrialized democracies that meets annually to discuss shared issues and concerns. Biden will arrive in Italy on Wednesday night, his second trip outside the U.S. in as many weeks. The Democratic president was in France last week for a state visit in Paris and ceremonies in Normandy marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in World War II.\n\nWhile last week's visit had a celebratory feel, this one will be dominated by pressing global issues, including how to keep financial support flowing to Ukraine as it fights Russia's invasion. Biden's trip comes a day after his son Hunter was convicted on federal gun charges, a blow sure to weigh heavily on the president's mind.\n\nDespite pressing global challenges, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said there's still a sense of relief among world leaders in 2024 that \"America was back,\" referencing Biden's 2021 speech at the G7 in England.\n\n\"Biden's message then was that democracies need to step up and show they can deliver for their people,\" Kirby said. \"That's true now more than ever.\"\n\nKirby said the U.S. was prepared to work with democratically elected officials in the EU no matter who they are, though some of those being elevated have expressed far less support for Ukraine than current leaders.\n\n\"We have every confidence that regardless of who fills the seats in the European Parliament, we're going to continue to work closely with our EU partners on all the issues relative to our shared interests across the European continent,\" Kirby said. \"That includes supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden and Zelenskyy, who met last week in Paris, will meet again to discuss continued support for the Eastern European nation, which is trying to fend off an intense Russian offensive in eastern areas of the country. They're expected to hold a joint news conference. Biden is also expected to meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the pope and other leaders.\n\nBiden, who's been adamant \"we will not walk away\" from Ukraine, last week publicly apologized to Zelenskyy for a monthslong delay by Congress in authorizing additional American military assistance. The delay allowed Russia to make gains on the battlefield.\n\nSullivan called the security agreement a \"bridge\" to when Ukraine is invited to join the NATO alliance -- a long-term priority of Zelenskyy's that the allies have said will first require an end to the Russia-Ukraine war and that Putin has steadfastly opposed.\n\nBiden's back-to-back trips to France and Italy amount to a rare doubleheader of diplomacy in the midst of the presidential election. The president will skip a Ukraine peace conference in Switzerland this weekend to jet to Los Angeles for a campaign fundraiser with big names from Hollywood. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the U.S. at the conference.\n\nDespite the delays in military aid, the Biden administration on Tuesday announced it would send Ukraine another Patriot missile system to help fend off Russian strikes, two U.S. officials told The Associated Press. Biden approved the move, the officials told the AP, as Kyiv has desperately called for more air defenses in its battle against an intense Russian assault on the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the U.S. announced fresh sanctions targeting Chinese companies that help Russia pursue its war in Ukraine, as well as Russia's financial infrastructure. Sullivan said, \"These actions will ratchet up the risk that foreign financial institutions take by dealing with Russia's war economy.\"\n\nBiden is also expected to discuss economic concerns brought on by Chinese manufacturing overcapacity, how to use artificial intelligence in a way that maximizes benefits but still manages national security risks, and global migration.\n\nThe U.S. and other G7 nations are struggling to manage large influxes of migrants arriving for complicated reasons that include war, climate change and drought. Migration, and how nations cope with the growing numbers at their borders, has been a factor driving the far-right rise in some of Europe.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

An official with the French presidency confirmed the agreement Wednesday, saying most of the money would be flowing to Ukraine in the form of a loan from the U.S. government backed by the proceeds of the frozen Russian assets in the European Union. Two other people familiar with the matter confirmed the arrangement.\n\nFinal technical negotiations were underway ahead of the summit to finalize the legal terms of the deal.\n\nThe announcement of the agreement comes as Biden landed in Italy with an urgency to get big things done. Thursday's security arrangement was aimed to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv, the White House said.\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan said the security agreement would not commit U.S. troops directly to Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion -- a red line drawn by Biden, who's fearful of being pulled into direct conflict between the nuclear-armed powers.\n\n\"We want to demonstrate that the U.S. supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them and that we'll continue to help address their security needs,\" Sullivan said, adding \"this agreement will show our resolve.\"\n\nSullivan said aboard Air Force One that the goal of the financing plan was to have a loan that would \"pull forward the windfall profits from the seized assets\" of Russia, giving Ukraine a \"substantial source of funding\" to meet its immediate needs.\n\nThe national security adviser said he had a specific sum of money in mind, but declined to say if that figure was $50 billion. He stressed the urgency of getting Ukraine financial resources as soon as possible and that multiple countries would back the agreement.\n\n\"It's to provide the necessary resources to Ukraine now for its economic energy and other needs, so that it's capable of having the resilience necessary to withstand Russia's continuing aggression,\" Sullivan said.\n\nThis year's meeting comes three years after Biden declared at his first such gathering that America was back as a global leader following the disruptions to Western alliances that occurred when Donald Trump was president. Now, there's a chance this gathering could be the final summit for Biden and other G7 leaders, depending on the results of elections this year.\n\nBiden and his counterparts from Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan will use the summit to discuss challenges related to artificial intelligence, migration, the Russian military's resurgence and China's economic might, among other topics. Pope Francis, Zelenskyy and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are joining the gathering at the Borgo Egnazia resort in the Puglia region of southern Italy.\n\nThe summit, which opened Thursday, will play out after far-right parties across the continent racked up gains of surprising scale in just-concluded European Union elections. Those victories -- coupled with upcoming elections in the United Kingdom, France and the United States -- have rattled the global political establishment and added weightiness to this year's summit.\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to U.S. and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center, an international affairs think tank. \"We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\"\n\nThe G7 is an informal bloc of industrialized democracies that meets annually to discuss shared issues and concerns. This is Biden's second trip outside the U.S. in as many weeks; the Democratic president was in France last week for a state visit in Paris and ceremonies in Normandy marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in World War II.\n\nWhile last week's visit had a celebratory feel, this one will be dominated by pressing global issues, including how to keep financial support flowing to Ukraine as it fights Russia's invasion. Biden's trip comes days after his son Hunter was convicted on federal gun charges, a blow sure to weigh heavily on the president's mind.\n\nDespite pressing global challenges, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said there's still a sense of relief among world leaders in 2024 that \"America was back,\" referencing Biden's 2021 speech at the G7 in England.\n\n\"Biden's message then was that democracies need to step up and show they can deliver for their people,\" Kirby said. \"That's true now more than ever.\"\n\nKirby said the U.S. was prepared to work with democratically elected officials in the EU no matter who they are, though some of those being elevated have expressed far less support for Ukraine than current leaders.\n\n\"We have every confidence that regardless of who fills the seats in the European Parliament, we're going to continue to work closely with our EU partners on all the issues relative to our shared interests across the European continent,\" Kirby said. \"That includes supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden and Zelenskyy, who met last week in Paris, are expected to hold a joint news conference while meeting at the G7 summit. Biden is also expected to meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the pope and other leaders.\n\nBiden, who's been adamant \"we will not walk away\" from Ukraine, last week publicly apologized to Zelenskyy for a monthslong delay by Congress in authorizing additional American military assistance. The delay allowed Russia to make gains on the battlefield.\n\nSullivan called the security agreement a \"bridge\" to when Ukraine is invited to join the NATO alliance -- a long-term priority of Zelenskyy's that the allies have said will first require an end to the Russia-Ukraine war and that Putin has steadfastly opposed.\n\nBiden's back-to-back trips to France and Italy amount to a rare doubleheader of diplomacy in the midst of the presidential election. The president, however, will skip a Ukraine peace conference in Switzerland this weekend to jet to Los Angeles for a campaign fundraiser with big names from Hollywood. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the U.S. at the conference.\n\nDespite the delays in military aid, the Biden administration on Tuesday announced it would send Ukraine another Patriot missile system to help fend off Russian strikes, two U.S. officials told The Associated Press.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the U.S. also announced fresh sanctions targeting Chinese companies that help Russia pursue its war in Ukraine, as well as Russia's financial infrastructure. Sullivan said, \"These actions will ratchet up the risk that foreign financial institutions take by dealing with Russia's war economy.\"\n\nBiden is also expected to discuss economic concerns brought on by Chinese manufacturing overcapacity, how to use artificial intelligence in a way that maximizes benefits but still manages national security risks, and global migration.\n\nThe U.S. and other G7 nations are struggling to manage large influxes of migrants arriving for complicated reasons that include war, climate change and drought. Migration, and how nations cope with the growing numbers at their borders, has been a factor driving the far-right rise in some of Europe.", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news",

An official with the French presidency confirmed the agreement Wednesday, saying most of the money would be flowing to Ukraine in the form of a loan from the U.S. government backed by the proceeds of the frozen Russian assets in the European Union. Two other people familiar with the matter confirmed the arrangement.\n\nFinal technical negotiations were underway ahead of the summit to finalize the legal terms of the deal.\n\nThe announcement of the agreement comes as Biden landed in Italy to attend the summit of the world's leading democracies with an urgency to get big things done, including turning frozen Russian assets into billions of dollars to help Ukraine fight Russian President Vladimir Putin's war machine.\n\nThe security arrangement was aimed to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv, the White House said as Biden was headed to Europe.\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan said the security agreement would not commit U.S. troops directly to Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion -- a red line drawn by Biden, who's fearful of being pulled into direct conflict between the nuclear-armed powers.\n\n\"We want to demonstrate that the U.S. supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them and that we'll continue to help address their security needs,\" Sullivan said, adding \"this agreement will show our resolve.\"\n\nSullivan said aboard Air Force One that the goal of the financing plan was to have a loan that would \"pull forward the windfall profits from the seized assets\" of Russia, giving Ukraine a \"substantial source of funding\" to meet its immediate needs.\n\nThe national security adviser said he had a specific sum of money in mind, but declined to say if that figure was $50 billion. He stressed the urgency of getting Ukraine financial resources as soon as possible and that multiple countries would back the agreement.\n\n\"It's to provide the necessary resources to Ukraine now for its economic energy and other needs, so that it's capable of having the resilience necessary to withstand Russia's continuing aggression,\" Sullivan said.\n\nThis year's meeting comes three years after Biden declared at his first such gathering that America was back as a global leader following the disruptions to Western alliances that occurred when Donald Trump was president. Now, there's a chance this gathering could be the final G7 for Biden and other G7 leaders, depending on the results of elections this year.\n\nBiden and his counterparts from Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan will use the summit to discuss challenges related to artificial intelligence, migration, the Russian military's resurgence and China's economic might, among other topics. Pope Francis, Zelenskyy and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are joining the gathering at the Borgo Egnazia resort in the Puglia region of southern Italy.\n\nThe summit, opening Thursday, will play out after far-right parties across the continent racked up gains of surprising scale in just-concluded European Union elections. Those victories -- coupled with upcoming elections in the United Kingdom, France and the United States -- have rattled the global political establishment and added weightiness to this year's summit.\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to U.S. and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center, an international affairs think tank. \"We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\"\n\nThe G7 is an informal bloc of industrialized democracies that meets annually to discuss shared issues and concerns. Biden will arrive in Italy on Wednesday night, his second trip outside the U.S. in as many weeks. The Democratic president was in France last week for a state visit in Paris and ceremonies in Normandy marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in World War II.\n\nWhile last week's visit had a celebratory feel, this one will be dominated by pressing global issues, including how to keep financial support flowing to Ukraine as it fights Russia's invasion. Biden's trip comes a day after his son Hunter was convicted on federal gun charges, a blow sure to weigh heavily on the president's mind.\n\nDespite pressing global challenges, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said there's still a sense of relief among world leaders in 2024 that \"America was back,\" referencing Biden's 2021 speech at the G7 in England.\n\n\"Biden's message then was that democracies need to step up and show they can deliver for their people,\" Kirby said. \"That's true now more than ever.\"\n\nKirby said the U.S. was prepared to work with democratically elected officials in the EU no matter who they are, though some of those being elevated have expressed far less support for Ukraine than current leaders.\n\n\"We have every confidence that regardless of who fills the seats in the European Parliament, we're going to continue to work closely with our EU partners on all the issues relative to our shared interests across the European continent,\" Kirby said. \"That includes supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden and Zelenskyy, who met last week in Paris, will meet again to discuss continued support for the Eastern European nation, which is trying to fend off an intense Russian offensive in eastern areas of the country. They're expected to hold a joint news conference. Biden is also expected to meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the pope and other leaders.\n\nBiden, who's been adamant \"we will not walk away\" from Ukraine, last week publicly apologized to Zelenskyy for a monthslong delay by Congress in authorizing additional American military assistance. The delay allowed Russia to make gains on the battlefield.\n\nSullivan called the security agreement a \"bridge\" to when Ukraine is invited to join the NATO alliance -- a long-term priority of Zelenskyy's that the allies have said will first require an end to the Russia-Ukraine war and that Putin has steadfastly opposed.\n\nBiden's back-to-back trips to France and Italy amount to a rare doubleheader of diplomacy in the midst of the presidential election. The president will skip a Ukraine peace conference in Switzerland this weekend to jet to Los Angeles for a campaign fundraiser with big names from Hollywood. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the U.S. at the conference.\n\nDespite the delays in military aid, the Biden administration on Tuesday announced it would send Ukraine another Patriot missile system to help fend off Russian strikes, two U.S. officials told The Associated Press. Biden approved the move, the officials told the AP, as Kyiv has desperately called for more air defenses in its battle against an intense Russian assault on the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the U.S. announced fresh sanctions targeting Chinese companies that help Russia pursue its war in Ukraine, as well as Russia's financial infrastructure. Sullivan said, \"These actions will ratchet up the risk that foreign financial institutions take by dealing with Russia's war economy.\"\n\nBiden is also expected to discuss economic concerns brought on by Chinese manufacturing overcapacity, how to use artificial intelligence in a way that maximizes benefits but still manages national security risks, and global migration.\n\nThe U.S. and other G7 nations are struggling to manage large influxes of migrants arriving for complicated reasons that include war, climate change and drought. Migration, and how nations cope with the growing numbers at their borders, has been a factor driving the far-right rise in some of Europe.\n\n___\n\nSuperville reported from Bari, Italy.

The two people spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the agreement before it was formally announced.\n\nAn official with the French presidency confirmed the announcement Wednesday.\n\nThe announcement of the agreement comes as Biden heads to the summit of the world's leading democracies with an urgency to get big things done, including turning frozen Russian assets into billions of dollars to help Ukraine fight Russian President Vladimir Putin's war machine.\n\nThe security arrangement was aimed to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv, the White House said as Biden was headed to Europe.\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan said the security agreement would not commit U.S. troops directly to Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion -- a red line drawn by Biden, who's fearful of being pulled into direct conflict between the nuclear-armed powers.\n\n\"We want to demonstrate that the U.S. supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them and that we'll continue to help address their security needs,\" Sullivan said, adding \"this agreement will show our resolve.\"\n\nThis year's meeting comes three years after Biden declared at his first such gathering that America was back as a global leader following the disruptions to Western alliances that occurred when Donald Trump was president. Now, there's a chance this gathering could be the final G7 for Biden and other G7 leaders, depending on the results of elections this year.\n\nBiden and his counterparts from Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan will use the summit to discuss challenges related to artificial intelligence, migration, the Russian military's resurgence and China's economic might, among other topics. Pope Francis, Zelenskyy and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are joining the gathering at the Borgo Egnazia resort in the Puglia region of southern Italy.\n\nThe summit, opening Thursday, will play out after far-right parties across the continent racked up gains of surprising scale in just-concluded European Union elections. Those victories, coupled with upcoming elections in the United Kingdom, France and the United States, have rattled the global political establishment and added weightiness to this year's summit.\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to U.S. and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center, an international affairs think tank. \"We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\"\n\nThe G7 is an informal bloc of industrialized democracies that meets annually to discuss shared issues and concerns. Biden will arrive in Italy on Wednesday night, his second trip outside the U.S. in as many weeks. The Democratic president was in France last week for a state visit in Paris and ceremonies in Normandy marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in World War II.\n\nWhile last week's visit had a celebratory feel, this one will be dominated by pressing global issues, including how to keep financial support flowing to Ukraine as it fights Russia's invasion. Biden's trip comes a day after his son Hunter was convicted on federal gun charges, a blow sure to weigh heavily on the president's mind.\n\nDespite pressing global challenges, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said there's still a sense of relief among world leaders in 2024 that \"America was back,\" referencing Biden's 2021 speech at the G7 in England.\n\n\"Biden's message then was that democracies need to step up and show they can deliver for their people,\" Kirby said. \"That's true now more than ever.\"\n\nKirby said the U.S. was prepared to work with democratically elected officials in the EU no matter who they are, though some of those being elevated have expressed far less support for Ukraine than current leaders.\n\n\"We have every confidence that regardless of who fills the seats in the European Parliament, we're going to continue to work closely with our EU partners on all the issues relative to our shared interests across the European continent,\" Kirby said. \"That includes supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden and Zelenskyy, who met last week in Paris, will meet again to discuss continued support for the Eastern European nation, which is trying to fend off an intense Russian offensive in eastern areas of the country. They're expected to hold a joint news conference. Biden is also expected to meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the pope and other leaders.\n\nBiden, who's been adamant \"we will not walk away\" from Ukraine, last week publicly apologized to Zelenskyy for a monthslong delay by Congress in authorizing additional American military assistance. The delay allowed Russia to make gains on the battlefield.\n\nSullivan called the security agreement a \"bridge\" to when Ukraine is invited to join the NATO alliance -- a long-term priority of Zelenskyy's that the allies have said will first require an end to the Russia-Ukraine war and that Putin has steadfastly opposed.\n\nBiden's back-to-back trips to France and Italy amount to a rare doubleheader of diplomacy in the midst of the presidential election.

Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the U.S. at the conference.\n\nDespite the delays in military aid, the Biden administration on Tuesday announced it would send Ukraine another Patriot missile system to help fend off Russian strikes, two U.S. officials told The Associated Press. Biden approved the move, the officials told the AP, as Kyiv has desperately called for more air defenses in its battle against an intense Russian assault on the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the U.S. announced fresh sanctions targeting Chinese companies that help Russia pursue its war in Ukraine, as well as Russia's financial infrastructure. Sullivan said, \"These actions will ratchet up the risk that foreign financial institutions take by dealing with Russia's war economy.\"\n\nA European plan to specifically use the interest on the Russian funds would provide only a trickle of money every year -- about $2.5 billion to $3 billion at current interest rates, which would barely meet a month's financing needs for the Ukrainian government.\n\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said aboard Air Force One that the goal of the financing plan was to have a loan that would \"pull forward the windfall profits from the seized assets\" of Russia, giving Ukraine a \"substantial source of funding\" to meet its immediate needs.\n\nSullivan said he had a specific sum of money in mind, but declined to say if that figure was $50 billion. He stressed the urgency of getting Ukraine financial resources as soon as possible and that multiple countries would back the agreement.\n\n\"It's to provide the necessary resources to Ukraine now for its economic energy and other needs, so that it's capable of having the resilience necessary to withstand Russia's continuing aggression,\" Sullivan said.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said recently that G7 finance ministers have been discussing the possibility of extending a loan to Ukraine and using the windfall profits of assets seized in Europe to pay it off.\n\nKirby said the U.S. was optimistic the group could agree on the matter.\n\nBiden is also expected to discuss economic concerns brought on by Chinese manufacturing overcapacity, how to use artificial intelligence in a way that maximizes benefits but still manages national security risks, and global migration.\n\nThe U.S. and other G7 nations are struggling to manage large influxes of migrants arriving for complicated reasons that include war, climate change and drought.

Most of the frozen assets are located in Europe, but the plan would use interest earned on the assets to help Ukraine's war effort. A French presidency official confirmed the deal on Wednesday, saying most of the money would flow to Ukraine in the form of a US government loan backed by proceeds from frozen Russian assets in the bloc. European. Two other people familiar with the matter confirmed the deal.\n\nFinal technical negotiations were underway before the summit to finalize the legal terms of the agreement.\n\nDeal announcement comes as Biden lands in Italy to attend the summit of the world's main democracies with the urgency to accomplish great things, in particular to transform Russian assets frozen in billions of dollars to help Ukraine fight Russian President Vladimir Putin war machine.\n\nThe security deal was aimed at sending Russia a signal of US determination to support kyiv, the White House said as Biden headed to Europe.\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan said the security deal would not commit U.S. troops directly to defending Ukraine against Russian invasion, a red line drawn by Biden, who fears be drawn into direct conflict between nuclear powers.\n\nWe want to demonstrate that the United States supports the Ukrainian people, that we stand with them and continue to help meet their security needs, Sullivan said, adding that \"this agreement will show our resolve.\"\n\nSullivan said aboard Air Force One that the goal of the financing plan was to secure a loan that would recoup windfall profits from assets seized by Russia, giving Ukraine a substantial source of financing to meet their immediate needs.\n\nThe national security adviser said he had a specific amount of money in mind, but declined to say whether that figure was $50 billion. He stressed the urgency of obtaining financial resources for Ukraine as quickly as possible and that several countries would support the agreement.\n\nThis is about providing Ukraine with the resources needed now for its economic energy and other needs, so that it is able to have the resilience to resist Russia's continued aggression, Sullivan said .\n\nThis year's meeting comes three years after Biden declared in his first such meeting that America was back as a world leader following disruptions to Western alliances that occurred when Donald Trump was president. It is now possible that this gathering could be the last G7 for Biden and other G7 leaders, depending on the results of this year's elections.\n\nBiden and his counterparts from Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Japan will use the summit to discuss challenges related to artificial intelligence, migration, the resurgence of the Russian army and the economic power of China, among other subjects. Pope Francis, Zelensky and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan join the gathering at the seaside resort of Borgo Egnazia in southern Italy's Puglia region.\n\nThe summit, which opens on Thursday, will come after far-right parties across the continent racked up gains of surprising magnitude at the just-concluded summit. European Union elections. These victories, coupled with the upcoming elections to United Kingdom, France and the UNITED STATES have shaken the global political establishment and added weight to this year's summit.\n\nYou hear this a lot when talking to U.S. and European officials: If we can't get it done now, whether on China or on assets, we may not get another chance, said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Councils GeoEconomics Center, an international affairs think tank. We don't know what the world will look like in three months, six months, nine months. \"\n\nThe G7 is an informal bloc of industrialized democracies that meets annually to discuss common issues and concerns. Biden will arrive in Italy on Wednesday evening, his second trip outside the United States in as many weeks. The Democratic president was in France last week to a state visit in Paris and marking ceremonies in Normandy the 80th anniversary of the Landing during WWII.\n\nAlthough last week's visit was celebratory, it will be dominated by pressing global issues, including how to maintain financial support for Ukraine as it struggles. Invasion of Russia. Biden's trip comes a day after his son Hunter's departure convicted of federal gun chargesa hard blow that will certainly weigh heavily on the president's mind.\n\nDespite pressing global challenges, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said there is still a sense of relief among world leaders in 2024 because \"America was back\" SEO Biden's speech in 2021 at the G7 in England.\n\nBiden's message then was that democracies must step up and show they can meet the expectations of their people, Kirby said. This is more true than ever.\n\nKirby said the United States is willing to work with democratically elected officials in the EU, whoever they may be, even if some of those who have been promoted have expressed far less support for Ukraine than current leaders.\n\n\"We are confident that, whoever takes the seats in the European Parliament, we will continue to work closely with our EU partners on all issues relating to our common interests across the European continent,\" said Kirby. \"This includes support for Ukraine.\n\nBiden and Zelenskyy, who met last week in Pariswill meet again to discuss continued support for the Eastern European nation as it attempts to fend off an intense crisis. Russian offensive in the eastern regions of the country. They are expected to hold a joint press conference. Biden is also expected to meet Giorgia Meloni, Italian Prime Ministerthe pope and other leaders.\n\nBiden, who insisted we would not leave Ukraine, last week publicly apologized to Zelensky of Congress' months-long delay in authorizing additional U.S. military aid. This delay allowed Russia to battlefield gains.\n\nSullivan called the security deal a bridge to when Ukraine will be invited to join the NATO alliance, a long-term priority of Zelensky's that allies say will first require ending the Russian-Ukrainian war and that Putin strongly opposed.\n\nBiden's back-to-back trips to France and Italy constitute a rare diplomatic double bill in the middle of the presidential election. The president will jump a Ukraine Peace Conference in Switzerland this weekend to fly to Los Angeles for a fundraising campaign with big names from Hollywood. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the United States at the conference.\n\nDespite delays in providing military aid, the Biden administration announced Tuesday that it would do so. send Ukraine another Patriot missile system to help repel Russian strikes, two U.S. officials told The Associated Press. Biden approved the move, the officials told the AP, as kyiv has desperately called for more air defenses in its fight against an intense Russian attack on the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the U.S. announced new sanctions targeting Chinese companies that are helping Russia continue its war in Ukraine, as well as Russian financial infrastructure. Sullivan said: \"These actions will increase the risk foreign financial institutions take in dealing with the Russian war economy.\n\nBiden is also expected to discuss economic concerns caused by Chinese manufacturing overcapacity, how to use artificial intelligence in ways that maximize profits while managing national security risks, and global migration.\n\nThe United States and other G7 countries are struggling to manage massive influxes of migrants arriving for complex reasons such as war, climate change and drought. Migration and how countries deal with the growing number of people at their borders has been a factor in the rise of the far right in certain regions of Europe.\n\n___\n\nSuperville reported from Bari, Italy.

The two people spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the agreement before it was formally announced.\n\nAn official with the French presidency confirmed the announcement Wednesday.\n\nThe announcement of the agreement comes as Biden heads to the summit of the world's leading democracies with an urgency to get big things done, including turning frozen Russian assets into billions of dollars to help Ukraine fight Russian President Vladimir Putin's war machine.\n\nThe security arrangement was aimed to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv, the White House said as Biden was headed to Europe.\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan said the security agreement would not commit US troops directly to Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion -- a red line drawn by Biden, who's fearful of being pulled into direct conflict between the nuclear-armed powers.\n\n\"We want to demonstrate that the US supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them and that we'll continue to help address their security needs,\" Sullivan said, adding \"this agreement will show our resolve.\" This year's meeting comes three years after Biden declared at his first such gathering that America was back as a global leader following the disruptions to Western alliances that occurred when Donald Trump was president. Now, there's a chance this gathering could be the final G7 for Biden and other G7 leaders, depending on the results of elections this year.\n\nBiden and his counterparts from Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan will use the summit to discuss challenges related to artificial intelligence, migration, the Russian military's resurgence and China's economic might, among other topics. Pope Francis, Zelenskyy and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are joining the gathering at the Borgo Egnazia resort in the Puglia region of southern Italy.\n\nThe summit, opening Thursday, will play out after far-right parties across the continent racked up gains of surprising scale in just-concluded European Union elections. Those victories, coupled with upcoming elections in the United Kingdom, France and the United States, have rattled the global political establishment and added weightiness to this year's summit.\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to US and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center, an international affairs think tank. \"We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\" The G7 is an informal bloc of industrialized democracies that meets annually to discuss shared issues and concerns. Biden will arrive in Italy on Wednesday night, his second trip outside the U.S. in as many weeks. The Democratic president was in France last week for a state visit in Paris and ceremonies in Normandy marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in World War II.\n\nWhile last week's visit had a celebratory feel, this one will be dominated by pressing global issues, including how to keep financial support flowing to Ukraine as it fights Russia's invasion. Biden's trip comes a day after his son Hunter was convicted on federal gun charges, a blow sure to weigh heavily on the president's mind.\n\nDespite pressing global challenges, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said there's still a sense of relief among world leaders in 2024 that \"America was back,\" referencing Biden's 2021 speech at the G7 in England.\n\n\"Biden's message then was that democracies need to step up and show they can deliver for their people,\" Kirby said. \"That's true now more than ever.\" Kirby said the U.S. was prepared to work with democratically elected officials in the EU no matter who they are, though some of those being elevated have expressed far less support for Ukraine than current leaders.\n\n\"We have every confidence that regardless of who fills the seats in the European Parliament, we're going to continue to work closely with our EU partners on all the issues relative to our shared interests across the European continent,\" Kirby said. \"That includes supporting Ukraine.\" Biden and Zelenskyy, who met last week in Paris, will meet again to discuss continued support for the Eastern European nation, which is trying to fend off an intense Russian offensive in eastern areas of the country. They're expected to hold a joint news conference. Biden is also expected to meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the pope and other leaders.\n\nBiden, who's been adamant \"we will not walk away\" from Ukraine, last week publicly apologized to Zelenskyy for a month-long delay by Congress in authorizing additional American military assistance. The delay allowed Russia to make gains on the battlefield.\n\nSullivan called the security agreement a \"bridge\" to when Ukraine is invited to join the NATO alliance -- a long-term priority of Zelenskyy's that the allies have said will first require an end to the Russia-Ukraine war and that Putin has steadfastly opposed.\n\nBiden's back-to-back trips to France and Italy amount to a rare doubleheader of diplomacy in the midst of the presidential election. The president will skip a Ukraine peace conference in Switzerland this weekend to jet to Los Angeles for a campaign fundraiser with big names from Hollywood. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the US at the conference.\n\nDespite the delays in military aid, the Biden administration on Tuesday announced it would send Ukraine another Patriot missile system to help fend off Russian strikes, two US officials told The Associated Press. Biden approved the move, the officials told the AP, as Kyiv has desperately called for more air defences in its battle against an intense Russian assault on the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the US announced fresh sanctions targeting Chinese companies that help Russia pursue its war in Ukraine, as well as Russia's financial infrastructure. Sullivan said, \"These actions will ratchet up the risk that foreign financial institutions take by dealing with Russia's war economy.\" A European plan to specifically use the interest on the Russian funds would provide only a trickle of money every year -- about USD 2.5 billion to USD 3 billion at current interest rates, which would barely meet a month's financing needs for the Ukrainian government.\n\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said aboard Air Force One that the goal of the financing plan was to have a loan that would \"pull forward the windfall profits from the seized assets\" of Russia, giving Ukraine a \"substantial source of funding\" to meet its immediate needs.\n\nSullivan said he had a specific sum of money in mind, but declined to say if that figure was USD 50 billion. He stressed the urgency of getting Ukraine financial resources as soon as possible and that multiple countries would back the agreement.\n\n\"It's to provide the necessary resources to Ukraine now for its economic energy and other needs, so that it's capable of having the resilience necessary to withstand Russia's continuing aggression,\" Sullivan said.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said recently that G7 finance ministers have been discussing the possibility of extending a loan to Ukraine and using the windfall profits of assets seized in Europe to pay it off.\n\nKirby said the USD was optimistic the group could agree on the matter.\n\nBiden is also expected to discuss economic concerns brought on by Chinese manufacturing overcapacity, how to use artificial intelligence in a way that maximizes benefits but still manages national security risks, and global migration.\n\nThe U.S. and other G7 nations are struggling to manage large influxes of migrants arriving for complicated reasons that include war, climate change and drought. Migration, and how nations cope with the growing numbers at their borders, has been a factor driving the far-right rise in some of Europe.", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news",

An official with the French presidency confirmed the agreement Wednesday, saying most of the money would be flowing to Ukraine in the form of a loan from the U.S. government backed by the proceeds of the frozen Russian assets in the European Union. Two other people familiar with the matter confirmed the arrangement.\n\nFinal technical negotiations were underway ahead of the summit to finalize the legal terms of the deal.\n\nThe announcement of the agreement comes as Biden landed in Italy with an urgency to get big things done. Thursday's security arrangement was aimed to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv, the White House said.\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan said the security agreement would not commit U.S. troops directly to Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion - a red line drawn by Biden, who's fearful of being pulled into direct conflict between the nuclear-armed powers.\n\n\"We want to demonstrate that the U.S. supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them and that we'll continue to help address their security needs,\" Sullivan said, adding \"this agreement will show our resolve.\" Sullivan said aboard Air Force One that the goal of the financing plan was to have a loan that would \"pull forward the windfall profits from the seized assets\" of Russia, giving Ukraine a \"substantial source of funding\" to meet its immediate needs.\n\nThe national security adviser said he had a specific sum of money in mind, but declined to say if that figure was $50 billion. He stressed the urgency of getting Ukraine financial resources as soon as possible and that multiple countries would back the agreement.\n\n\"It's to provide the necessary resources to Ukraine now for its economic energy and other needs, so that it's capable of having the resilience necessary to withstand Russia's continuing aggression,\" Sullivan said.\n\nThis year's meeting comes three years after Biden declared at his first such gathering that America was back as a global leader following the disruptions to Western alliances that occurred when Donald Trump was president. Now, there's a chance this gathering could be the final summit for Biden and other G7 leaders, depending on the results of elections this year.\n\nBiden and his counterparts from Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan will use the summit to discuss challenges related to artificial intelligence, migration, the Russian military's resurgence and China's economic might, among other topics. Pope Francis, Zelenskyy and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are joining the gathering at the Borgo Egnazia resort in the Puglia region of southern Italy.\n\nThe summit, which opened Thursday, will play out after far-right parties across the continent racked up gains of surprising scale in just-concluded European Union elections. Those victories - coupled with upcoming elections in the United Kingdom, France and the United States - have rattled the global political establishment and added weightiness to this year's summit.\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to U.S. and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center, an international affairs think tank. \"We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\" The G7 is an informal bloc of industrialized democracies that meets annually to discuss shared issues and concerns. This is Biden's second trip outside the U.S. in as many weeks; the Democratic president was in France last week for a state visit in Paris and ceremonies in Normandy marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in World War II.\n\nWhile last week's visit had a celebratory feel, this one will be dominated by pressing global issues, including how to keep financial support flowing to Ukraine as it fights Russia's invasion. Biden's trip comes days after his son Hunter was convicted on federal gun charges, a blow sure to weigh heavily on the president's mind.\n\nDespite pressing global challenges, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said there's still a sense of relief among world leaders in 2024 that \"America was back,\" referencing Biden's 2021 speech at the G7 in England.\n\n\"Biden's message then was that democracies need to step up and show they can deliver for their people,\" Kirby said. \"That's true now more than ever.\" Kirby said the U.S. was prepared to work with democratically elected officials in the EU no matter who they are, though some of those being elevated have expressed far less support for Ukraine than current leaders.", "source": {"uri":

An official with the French presidency confirmed the announcement Wednesday.\n\nThe announcement of the agreement comes as Biden heads to the summit of the world's leading democracies with an urgency to get big things done, including turning frozen Russian assets into billions of dollars to help Ukraine fight Russian President Vladimir Putin's war machine.\n\nThe security arrangement was aimed to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv, the White House said as Biden was headed to Europe.\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan said the security agreement would not commit US troops directly to Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion a red line drawn by Biden, who's fearful of being pulled into direct conflict between the nuclear-armed powers.\n\n\"We want to demonstrate that the US supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them and that we'll continue to help address their security needs,\" Sullivan said, adding \"this agreement will show our resolve.\"\n\nThis year's meeting comes three years after Biden declared at his first such gathering that America was back as a global leader following the disruptions to Western alliances that occurred when Donald Trump was president.\n\nNow, there's a chance this gathering could be the final G7 for Biden and other G7 leaders, depending on the results of elections this year.\n\nBiden and his counterparts from Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan will use the summit to discuss challenges related to artificial intelligence, migration, the Russian military's resurgence and China's economic might, among other topics.\n\nPope Francis, Zelenskyy and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are joining the gathering at the Borgo Egnazia resort in the Puglia region of southern Italy.\n\nThe summit, opening Thursday, will play out after far-right parties across the continent racked up gains of surprising scale in just-concluded European Union elections.\n\nThose victories, coupled with upcoming elections in the United Kingdom, France and the United States, have rattled the global political establishment and added weightiness to this year's summit.\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to US and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's Geo Economics Center, an international affairs think tank. \"We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\n\n\"The G7 is an informal bloc of industrialized democracies that meets annually to discuss shared issues and concerns. Biden will arrive in Italy on Wednesday night, his second trip outside the US in as many weeks.\n\nThe Democratic president was in France last week for a state visit in Paris and ceremonies in Normandy marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in World War II.\n\nWhile last week's visit had a celebratory feel, this one will be dominated by pressing global issues, including how to keep financial support flowing to Ukraine as it fights Russia's invasion.\n\nBiden's trip comes a day after his son Hunter was convicted on federal gun charges, a blow sure to weigh heavily on the president's mind.\n\nDespite pressing global challenges, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said there's still a sense of relief among world leaders in 2024 that \"America was back,\" referencing Biden's 2021 speech at the G7 in England.\n\n\"Biden's message then was that democracies need to step up and show they can deliver for their people,\" Kirby said. \"That's true now more than ever.\"\n\nKirby said the US was prepared to work with democratically elected officials in the EU no matter who they are, though some of those being elevated have expressed far less support for Ukraine than current leaders.\n\n\"We have every confidence that regardless of who fills the seats in the European Parliament, we're going to continue to work closely with our EU partners on all the issues relative to our shared interests across the European continent,\" Kirby said.\n\n\"That includes supporting Ukraine.\" Biden and Zelenskyy, who met last week in Paris, will meet again to discuss continued support for the Eastern European nation, which is trying to fend off an intense Russian offensive in eastern areas of the country.\n\nThey're expected to hold a joint news conference. Biden is also expected to meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the pope and other leaders.\n\nBiden, who's been adamant \"we will not walk away\" from Ukraine, last week publicly apologised to Zelenskyy for a monthslong delay by Congress in authorizing additional American military assistance.\n\nThe delay allowed Russia to make gains on the battlefield. Sullivan called the security agreement a \"bridge\" to when Ukraine is invited to join the NATO alliance a long-term priority of Zelenskyy's that the allies have said will first require an end to the Russia-Ukraine war and that Putin has steadfastly opposed.\n\nBiden's back-to-back trips to France and Italy amount to a rare doubleheader of diplomacy in the midst of the presidential election.\n\nThe president will skip a Ukraine peace conference in Switzerland this weekend to jet to Los Angeles for a campaign fundraiser with big names from Hollywood. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the US at the conference.\n\nDespite the delays in military aid, the Biden administration on Tuesday announced it would send Ukraine another Patriot missile system to help fend off Russian strikes, two US officials told The Associated Press.\n\nBiden approved the move, the officials told the AP, as Kyiv has desperately called for more air defenses in its battle against an intense Russian assault on the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the US announced fresh sanctions targeting Chinese companies that help Russia pursue its war in Ukraine, as well as Russia's financial infrastructure. Sullivan said, \"These actions will ratchet up the risk that foreign financial institutions take by dealing with Russia's war economy.\"\n\nA European plan to specifically use the interest on the Russian funds would provide only a trickle of money every year about $2.5 billion to $3 billion at current interest rates, which would barely meet a month's financing needs for the Ukrainian government.\n\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said aboard Air Force One that the goal of the financing plan was to have a loan that would \"pull forward the windfall profits from the seized assets\" of Russia, giving Ukraine a \"substantial source of funding\" to meet its immediate needs.\n\nSullivan said he had a specific sum of money in mind, but declined to say if that figure was $50 billion. He stressed the urgency of getting Ukraine financial resources as soon as possible and that multiple countries would back the agreement.\n\n\"It's to provide the necessary resources to Ukraine now for its economic energy and other needs, so that it's capable of having the resilience necessary to withstand Russia's continuing aggression,\" Sullivan said.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said recently that G7 finance ministers have been discussing the possibility of extending a loan to Ukraine and using the windfall profits of assets seized in Europe to pay it off. Kirby said the US was optimistic the group could agree on the matter.\n\nBiden is also expected to discuss economic concerns brought on by Chinese manufacturing overcapacity, how to use artificial intelligence in a way that maximizes benefits but still manages national security risks, and global migration.\n\nThe US and other G7 nations are struggling to manage large influxes of migrants arriving for complicated reasons that include war, climate change and drought. Migration, and how nations cope with the growing numbers at their borders, has been a factor driving the far-right rise in some of Europe.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news",

Now, there's a chance this gathering could be the final G7 for Biden and other G7 leaders, depending on the results of elections this year.\n\nBiden and his counterparts from Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan will use the summit to discuss challenges related to the spread of artificial intelligence, migration, the Russian military's resurgence and China's economic might, among other topics. Pope Francis, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are joining the gathering at the Borgo Egnazia resort in the Puglia, a region of southern Italy.\n\nThe summit, which opens Thursday, will play out after far-right parties across the continent racked up gains of surprising scale in just-concluded European Union elections. Those victories -- coupled with upcoming elections in the United Kingdom, France and the United States -- have rattled the global political establishment and added weightiness to this year's summit.\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to U.S. and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center, an international affairs think tank. \"We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\"\n\nThe G7 is an informal bloc of industrialized democracies that meets annually to discuss shared issues and concerns.

Now, there's a chance this gathering could be the final G7 for Biden and other G7 leaders, depending on the results of elections this year.\n\nBiden and his counterparts from Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan will use the summit to discuss challenges related to the spread of artificial intelligence, migration, the Russian military's resurgence and China's economic might, among other topics. Pope Francis, Zelenskyy and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are joining the gathering at the Borgo Egnazia resort in the Puglia region of southern Italy.\n\nThe summit, which opens Thursday, will play out after far-right parties across the continent racked up gains of surprising scale in just-concluded European Union elections. Those victories, coupled with upcoming elections in the United Kingdom, France and the United States, have rattled the global political establishment and added weightiness to this year's summit.\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to U.S. and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center, an international affairs think tank. \"We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\"\n\nThe G7 is an informal bloc of industrialized democracies that meets annually to discuss shared issues and concerns. Biden is set to arrive in Italy on Wednesday night, his second trip outside the U.S. in as many weeks. The Democratic president was in France last week for a state visit in Paris and ceremonies in Normandy marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in World War II.\n\nWhile last week's visit had a celebratory feel, this one will be dominated by pressing global issues, including how to keep financial support flowing to Ukraine as it fights Russia's invasion. Biden's trip also comes one day after his son Hunter was convicted on federal gun charges, a blow sure to weigh heavily on the president's mind.\n\nDespite pressing global challenges, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said there is still a sense of relief among world leaders in 2024 that \"America was back,\" referencing Biden's 2021 speech at the G7 in Cornwall, England.\n\n\"Biden's message then was that democracies need to step up and show they can deliver for their people,\" Kirby said. \"That's true now more than ever.\"\n\nKirby said the U.S. was prepared to work with democratically elected officials in the EU no matter who they are, though some of those being elevated have expressed far less support for Ukraine than current leaders.\n\n\"We have every confidence that regardless of who fills the seats in the European Parliament, we're going to continue to work closely with our EU partners on all the issues relative to our shared interests across the European continent,\" Kirby said. \"That includes supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden and Zelenskyy, who met last week in Paris, will meet again Thursday on the sidelines of the summit to discuss continued support for the Eastern European nation, which is trying to fend off an intense Russian offensive in eastern areas of the country. They are expected to hold a joint news conference. Biden is also expected to meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the pope and other leaders.\n\nBiden, who has been adamant that \"we will not walk away\" from Ukraine, last week publicly apologized to Zelenskyy for a monthslong delay by Congress in authorizing additional American military assistance. The delay allowed Russia to make gains on the battlefield.\n\nBiden's back-to-back trips to France and Italy amount to a rare doubleheader of diplomacy in the midst of the presidential election. The president will skip a Ukraine peace conference in Switzerland this weekend to jet to Los Angeles for a campaign fundraiser with big names from Hollywood. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the U.S. at the conference.\n\nDespite the delays in military aid, the Biden administration on Tuesday announced it would send Ukraine another Patriot missile system to help fend off Russian strikes, two U.S. officials told The Associated Press. Biden approved the move, the officials told the AP, as Kyiv has desperately called for more air defenses in its battle against an intense Russian assault on the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nKirby said the U.S. would use the G7 summit to announce fresh sanctions and export control actions targeting those who have helped Russia procure what it needs for the war. He said the new measures would make it harder for financiers to support Russia's defense mechanism.\n\nUkraine and many of its supporters have called for the confiscation of $260 billion in Russian assets frozen outside the country after the Feb. 24, 2022, invasion. But European officials have resisted, citing legal and financial stability concerns. Most of the frozen assets are located in Europe.\n\nA European plan to just use the interest on the Russian funds would provide only a trickle of money every year -- about $2.5 billion to $3 billion at current interest rates, which would barely meet a month's financing needs for the Ukrainian government.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said recently that G7 finance ministers have been discussing the possibility of extending a loan to Ukraine and using the windfall profits of assets seized in Europe to pay it off.\n\nKirby said the U.S. was optimistic the group could agree on the matter.\n\nBiden is also expected to discuss economic concerns brought on by Chinese manufacturing overcapacity, how to use artificial intelligence in a way that maximizes benefits but still manages national security risks, and global migration.\n\nThe U.S. and other G7 nations are struggling to manage large influxes of migrants arriving for complicated reasons that include war, climate change and drought. Migration, and how nations cope with the growing numbers at their borders, has been a factor driving the far-right rise in some of Europe.", "source": {"uri": "mynorthwest.com", "dataType": "news",

Biden's trip also comes one day after his son Hunter was convicted on federal gun charges, a blow sure to weigh heavily on the president's mind.\n\nDespite pressing global challenges, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said there is still a sense of relief among world leaders in 2024 that \"America was back,\" referencing Biden's 2021 speech at the G7 in Cornwall, England.\n\n\"Biden's message then was that democracies need to step up and show they can deliver for their people,\" Kirby said. \"That's true now more than ever.\"\n\nKirby said the U.S. was prepared to work with democratically elected officials in the EU no matter who they are, though some of those being elevated have expressed far less support for Ukraine than current leaders.\n\n\"We have every confidence that regardless of who fills the seats in the European Parliament, we're going to continue to work closely with our EU partners on all the issues relative to our shared interests across the European continent,\" Kirby said. \"That includes supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden and Zelenskyy, who met last week in Paris, will meet again Thursday on the sidelines of the summit to discuss continued support for the Eastern European nation, which is trying to fend off an intense Russian offensive in eastern areas of the country. They are expected to hold a joint news conference. Biden is also expected to meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the pope and other leaders.\n\nBiden, who has been adamant that \"we will not walk away\" from Ukraine, last week publicly apologized to Zelenskyy for a monthslong delay by Congress in authorizing additional American military assistance. The delay allowed Russia to make gains on the battlefield.\n\nBiden's back-to-back trips to France and Italy amount to a rare doubleheader of diplomacy in the midst of the presidential election. The president will skip a Ukraine peace conference in Switzerland this weekend to jet to Los Angeles for a campaign fundraiser with big names from Hollywood. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the U.S. at the conference.\n\nDespite the delays in military aid, the Biden administration on Tuesday announced it would send Ukraine another Patriot missile system to help fend off Russian strikes, two U.S. officials told The Associated Press. Biden approved the move, the officials told the AP, as Kyiv has desperately called for more air defenses in its battle against an intense Russian assault on the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nKirby said the U.S. would use the G7 summit to announce fresh sanctions and export control actions targeting those who have helped Russia procure what it needs for the war. He said the new measures would make it harder for financiers to support Russia's defense mechanism.\n\nUkraine and many of its supporters have called for the confiscation of $260 billion in Russian assets frozen outside the country after the Feb. 24, 2022, invasion. But European officials have resisted, citing legal and financial stability concerns. Most of the frozen assets are located in Europe.\n\nA European plan to just use the interest on the Russian funds would provide only a trickle of money every year -- about $2.5 billion to $3 billion at current interest rates, which would barely meet a month's financing needs for the Ukrainian government.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said recently that G7 finance ministers have been discussing the possibility of extending a loan to Ukraine and using the windfall profits of assets seized in Europe to pay it off.\n\nKirby said the U.S. was optimistic the group could agree on the matter.\n\nBiden is also expected to discuss economic concerns brought on by Chinese manufacturing overcapacity, how to use artificial intelligence in a way that maximizes benefits but still manages national security risks, and global migration.\n\nThe U.S. and other G7 nations are struggling to manage large influxes of migrants arriving for complicated reasons that include war, climate change and drought. Migration, and how nations cope with the growing numbers at their borders, has been a factor driving the far-right rise in some of Europe.\n\nDarlene Superville And Colleen Long, The Associated

Announcement of the agreement comes as Biden heads to the summit of the world's leading democracies with an urgency to get big things done, including turning frozen Russian assets into billions of dollars to help Ukraine fight Russian President Vladimir Putin's war machine.\n\n\"We want to demonstrate that the U.S. supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them and that we'll continue to help address their security needs,\" Sullivan said, adding \"this agreement will show our resolve.\"\n\nThis year's meeting comes three years after Biden declared at his first such gathering that America was back as a global leader following the disruptions to Western alliances that occurred when Donald Trump was president. Now, there's a chance this gathering could be the final G7 for Biden and other G7 leaders, depending on the results of elections this year.\n\nBiden and his counterparts from Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan will use the summit to discuss challenges related artificial intelligence, migration, the Russian military's resurgence and China's economic might, among other topics. Pope Francis, Zelenskyy and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are joining the gathering at the Borgo Egnazia resort in the Puglia region of southern Italy.\n\nThe summit, opening Thursday, will play out after far-right parties across the continent racked up gains of surprising scale in just-concluded European Union elections. Those victories, coupled with upcoming elections in the United Kingdom, France and the United States, have rattled the global political establishment and added weightiness to this year's summit.\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to U.S. and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center, an international affairs think tank. \"We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\"\n\nThe G7 is an informal bloc of industrialized democracies that meets annually to discuss shared issues and concerns. Biden will arrive in Italy on Wednesday night, his second trip outside the U.S. in as many weeks.

The delay allowed Russia to make gains on the battlefield.\n\nSullivan called the security agreement a \"bridge\" to when Ukraine is invited to join the NATO alliance -- a long-term priority of Zelenskyy's that the allies have said will first require an end to the Russia-Ukraine war and that Putin has steadfastly opposed.\n\nBiden's back-to-back trips to France and Italy amount to a rare doubleheader of diplomacy in the midst of the presidential election.

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nEuropean officials have resisted confiscating the assets, citing legal and financial stability concerns -- most of the frozen assets are located in Europe -- but the plan would use the interest earned on the assets to help Ukraine's war effort. The two people spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the agreement before it was formally announced.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAn official with the French presidency confirmed the announcement Wednesday.\n\nThe announcement of the agreement comes as Biden heads to the summit of the world's leading democracies with an urgency to get big things done, including turning frozen Russian assets into billions of dollars to help Ukraine fight Russian President Vladimir Putin's war machine.\n\nThe security arrangement was aimed to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv, the White House said as Biden was headed to Europe.\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan said the security agreement would not commit U.S. troops directly to Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion -- a red line drawn by Biden, who's fearful of being pulled into direct conflict between the nuclear-armed powers.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"We want to demonstrate that the U.S. supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them and that we'll continue to help address their security needs,\" Sullivan said, adding \"this agreement will show our resolve.\"\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThis year's meeting comes three years after Biden declared at his first such gathering that America was back as a global leader following the disruptions to Western alliances that occurred when Donald Trump was president. Now, there's a chance this gathering could be the final G7 for Biden and other G7 leaders, depending on the results of elections this year.\n\nBiden and his counterparts from Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan will use the summit to discuss challenges related to artificial intelligence, migration, the Russian military's resurgence and China's economic might, among other topics. Pope Francis, Zelenskyy and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are joining the gathering at the Borgo Egnazia resort in the Puglia region of southern Italy.\n\nThe summit, opening Thursday, will play out after far-right parties across the continent racked up gains of surprising scale in just-concluded European Union elections. Those victories, coupled with upcoming elections in the United Kingdom, France and the United States, have rattled the global political establishment and added weightiness to this year's summit.\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to U.S. and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center, an international affairs think tank. \"We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\"\n\nThe G7 is an informal bloc of industrialized democracies that meets annually to discuss shared issues and concerns. Biden will arrive in Italy on Wednesday night, his second trip outside the U.S. in as many weeks. The Democratic president was in France last week for a state visit in Paris and ceremonies in Normandy marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in World War II.\n\nWhile last week's visit had a celebratory feel, this one will be dominated by pressing global issues, including how to keep financial support flowing to Ukraine as it fights Russia's invasion. Biden's trip comes a day after his son Hunter was convicted on federal gun charges, a blow sure to weigh heavily on the president's mind.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDespite pressing global challenges, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said there's still a sense of relief among world leaders in 2024 that \"America was back,\" referencing Biden's 2021 speech at the G7 in England.\n\n\"Biden's message then was that democracies need to step up and show they can deliver for their people,\" Kirby said. \"That's true now more than ever.\"\n\nKirby said the U.S. was prepared to work with democratically elected officials in the EU no matter who they are, though some of those being elevated have expressed far less support for Ukraine than current leaders.\n\n\"We have every confidence that regardless of who fills the seats in the European Parliament, we're going to continue to work closely with our EU partners on all the issues relative to our shared interests across the European continent,\" Kirby said. \"That includes supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden and Zelenskyy, who met last week in Paris, will meet again to discuss continued support for the Eastern European nation, which is trying to fend off an intense Russian offensive in eastern areas of the country. They're expected to hold a joint news conference. Biden is also expected to meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the pope and other leaders.\n\nBiden, who's been adamant \"we will not walk away\" from Ukraine, last week publicly apologized to Zelenskyy for a monthslong delay by Congress in authorizing additional American military assistance. The delay allowed Russia to make gains on the battlefield.\n\nSullivan called the security agreement a \"bridge\" to when Ukraine is invited to join the NATO alliance -- a long-term priority of Zelenskyy's that the allies have said will first require an end to the Russia-Ukraine war and that Putin has steadfastly opposed.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBiden's back-to-back trips to France and Italy amount to a rare doubleheader of diplomacy in the midst of the presidential election. The president will skip a Ukraine peace conference in Switzerland this weekend to jet to Los Angeles for a campaign fundraiser with big names from Hollywood. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the U.S. at the conference.\n\nDespite the delays in military aid, the Biden administration on Tuesday announced it would send Ukraine another Patriot missile system to help fend off Russian strikes, two U.S. officials told The Associated Press. Biden approved the move, the officials told the AP, as Kyiv has desperately called for more air defenses in its battle against an intense Russian assault on the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the U.S. announced fresh sanctions targeting Chinese companies that help Russia pursue its war in Ukraine, as well as Russia's financial infrastructure. Sullivan said, \"These actions will ratchet up the risk that foreign financial institutions take by dealing with Russia's war economy.\"\n\nA European plan to specifically use the interest on the Russian funds would provide only a trickle of money every year -- about $2.5 billion to $3 billion at current interest rates, which would barely meet a month's financing needs for the Ukrainian government.\n\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said aboard Air Force One that the goal of the financing plan was to have a loan that would \"pull forward the windfall profits from the seized assets\" of Russia, giving Ukraine a \"substantial source of funding\" to meet its immediate needs.\n\nSullivan said he had a specific sum of money in mind, but declined to say if that figure was $50 billion. He stressed the urgency of getting Ukraine financial resources as soon as possible and that multiple countries would back the agreement.\n\n\"It's to provide the necessary resources to Ukraine now for its economic energy and other needs, so that it's capable of having the resilience necessary to withstand Russia's continuing aggression,\" Sullivan said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said recently that G7 finance ministers have been discussing the possibility of extending a loan to Ukraine and using the windfall profits of assets seized in Europe to pay it off.\n\nKirby said the U.S. was optimistic the group could agree on the matter.\n\nBiden is also expected to discuss economic concerns brought on by Chinese manufacturing overcapacity, how to use artificial intelligence in a way that maximizes benefits but still manages national security risks, and global migration.\n\nThe U.S. and other G7 nations are struggling to manage large influxes of migrants arriving for complicated reasons that include war, climate change and drought. Migration, and how nations cope with the growing numbers at their borders, has been a factor driving the far-right rise in some of Europe.\n\n___\n\nSuperville reported from Bari, Italy.

they meet on the sidelines of the G7 summit.\n\nThe announcement came as negotiators for the group reached an agreement on how to provide Ukraine with up to 50 billion dollars backed by frozen Russian assets, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe international group of wealthy democracies has been discussing ways of using the more than 260 billion dollars in Russian assets frozen outside the country after the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine to help Kyiv.\n\nEuropean officials have resisted confiscating the assets, citing legal and financial stability concerns - most of the frozen assets are located in Europe - but the plan would use the interest earned on the assets to help Ukraine's war effort.\n\nAn official with the French presidency confirmed the announcement on Wednesday.\n\nThe announcement of the agreement comes as Mr Biden heads to the G7 summit with an urgency to get big things done, including turning frozen Russian assets into billions of dollars to help Ukraine fight Russian President Vladimir Putin's war machine.\n\nThe security arrangement was aimed at sending a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv, the White House said as Mr Biden was headed to Europe.\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters that the agreement would not commit US troops directly to Ukraine's defence against Russia's invasion - a red line drawn by Mr Biden, who is fearful of being drawn into direct conflict between the nuclear-armed powers.\n\n\"We want to demonstrate that the US supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them and that we'll continue to help address their security needs,\" Mr Sullivan said, adding \"this agreement will show our resolve\".\n\nMr Sullivan called the agreement a \"bridge\" to when Ukraine is invited to join the Nato alliance - a long-term priority of Mr Zelensky's that the allies have said will first require an end to the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nMr Biden heads to the summit of the world's leading democracies with an urgency to get big things done, including turning frozen Russian assets into billions of dollars to help Ukraine as it fights off Russian President Vladimir Putin's war machine.\n\nThis year's G7 summit comes three years after Mr Biden declared at his first such gathering that America was back as a global leader following the disruptions to western alliances that occurred when Donald Trump was president.\n\nNow, there is a chance this gathering could be the final G7 for Mr Biden and other G7 leaders, depending on the results of elections this year.\n\nMr Biden and his counterparts from Canada, the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Japan will use the summit to discuss challenges related to the spread of artificial intelligence, migration, the Russian military's resurgence and China's economic might, among other topics.\n\nPope Francis, Mr Zelensky and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are joining the gathering at the Borgo Egnazia resort in the Puglia region of southern Italy.\n\nThe summit, which opens on Thursday, will play out after far-right parties across the continent secured gains of surprising scale in just-concluded European Union

Biden's granddaughter, Finnegan Biden, walks right.\n\nABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (AP) -- President Joe Biden and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will sign a bilateral security agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine on Thursday when they meet on the sidelines of the Group of Seven summit, aiming to send signal to Russia of American resolve to supporting Kyiv, the White House said as Biden was headed to Italy.\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters that the agreement would not commit U.S. troops directly to Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion -- a red line drawn by Biden, who is fearful of being drawn into direct conflict between the nuclear-armed powers.\n\n\"We want to demonstrate that the U.S. supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them and that we'll continue to help address their security needs,\" Sullivan said, adding \"this agreement will show our resolve.\"\n\nSullivan called the agreement a \"bridge\" to when Ukraine is invited to join the NATO alliance -- a long-term priority of Zelenskyy's that the allies have said will first require an end to the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nBiden heads to the summit of the world's leading democracies with an urgency to get big things done, including turning frozen Russian assets into billions of dollars to help Ukraine as it fights off Russian President Vladimir Putin's war machine.\n\nThis year's Group of Seven summit comes three years after Biden declared at his first such gathering that America was back as a global leader following the disruptions to Western alliances that occurred when Donald Trump was president. Now, there's a chance this gathering could be the final G7 for Biden and other G7 leaders, depending on the results of elections this year.\n\nBiden and his counterparts from Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan will use the summit to discuss challenges related to the spread of artificial intelligence, migration, the Russian military's resurgence and China's economic might, among other topics. Pope Francis, Zelenskyy and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are joining the gathering at the Borgo Egnazia resort in the Puglia region of southern Italy.\n\nThe summit, which opens Thursday, will play out after far-right parties across the continent racked up gains of surprising scale in just-concluded European Union elections. Those victories, coupled with upcoming elections in the United Kingdom, France and the United States, have rattled the global political establishment and added weightiness to this year's summit.\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to U.S. and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center, an international affairs think tank. \"We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\"\n\nThe G7 is an informal bloc of industrialized democracies that meets annually to discuss shared issues and concerns. Biden is set to arrive in Italy on Wednesday night, his second trip outside the U.S. in as many weeks. The Democratic president was in France last week for a state visit in Paris and ceremonies in Normandy marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in World War II.\n\nWhile last week's visit had a celebratory feel, this one will be dominated by pressing global issues, including how to keep financial support flowing to Ukraine as it fights Russia's invasion. Biden's trip also comes one day after his son Hunter was convicted on federal gun charges, a blow sure to weigh heavily on the president's mind.\n\nDespite pressing global challenges, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said there is still a sense of relief among world leaders in 2024 that \"America was back,\" referencing Biden's 2021 speech at the G7 in Cornwall, England.\n\n\"Biden's message then was that democracies need to step up and show they can deliver for their people,\" Kirby said. \"That's true now more than ever.\"\n\nKirby said the U.S. was prepared to work with democratically elected officials in the EU no matter who they are, though some of those being elevated have expressed far less support for Ukraine than current leaders.\n\n\"We have every confidence that regardless of who fills the seats in the European Parliament, we're going to continue to work closely with our EU partners on all the issues relative to our shared interests across the European continent,\" Kirby said. \"That includes supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden and Zelenskyy, who met last week in Paris, will meet again Thursday on the sidelines of the summit to discuss continued support for the Eastern European nation, which is trying to fend off an intense Russian offensive in eastern areas of the country. They are expected to hold a joint news conference. Biden is also expected to meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the pope and other leaders.\n\nBiden, who has been adamant that \"we will not walk away\" from Ukraine, last week publicly apologized to Zelenskyy for a monthslong delay by Congress in authorizing additional American military assistance. The delay allowed Russia to make gains on the battlefield.\n\nBiden's back-to-back trips to France and Italy amount to a rare doubleheader of diplomacy in the midst of the presidential election. The president will skip a Ukraine peace conference in Switzerland this weekend to jet to Los Angeles for a campaign fundraiser with big names from Hollywood. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the U.S. at the conference.\n\nDespite the delays in military aid, the Biden administration on Tuesday announced it would send Ukraine another Patriot missile system to help fend off Russian strikes, two U.S. officials told The Associated Press. Biden approved the move, the officials told the AP, as Kyiv has desperately called for more air defenses in its battle against an intense Russian assault on the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nKirby said the U.S. would use the G7 summit to announce fresh sanctions and export control actions targeting those who have helped Russia procure what it needs for the war. He said the new measures would make it harder for financiers to support Russia's defense mechanism.\n\nUkraine and many of its supporters have called for the confiscation of $260 billion in Russian assets frozen outside the country after the Feb. 24, 2022, invasion. But European officials have resisted, citing legal and financial stability concerns. Most of the frozen assets are located in Europe.\n\nA European plan to just use the interest on the Russian funds would provide only a trickle of money every year -- about $2.5 billion to $3 billion at current interest rates, which would barely meet a month's financing needs for the Ukrainian government.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said recently that G7 finance ministers have been discussing the possibility of extending a loan to Ukraine and using the windfall profits of assets seized in Europe to pay it off.\n\nKirby said the U.S. was optimistic the group could agree on the matter.\n\nBiden is also expected to discuss economic concerns brought on by Chinese manufacturing overcapacity, how to use artificial intelligence in a way that maximizes benefits but still manages national security risks, and global migration.\n\nThe U.S. and other G7 nations are struggling to manage large influxes of migrants arriving for complicated reasons that include war, climate change and drought. Migration, and how nations cope with the growing numbers at their borders, has been a factor driving the far-right rise in some of Europe.\n\nSuperville reported from Bari, Italy.", "source": {"uri":

Angela Ochoa, Commander, 89th Airlift Wing, as he arrives at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., Wednesday, June 12, 2024. Biden is headed to Italy for the G7 summit. Biden's granddaughter, Finnegan Biden, walks left.\n\nABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (AP) -- President Joe Biden and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will sign a bilateral security agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine on Thursday when they meet on the sidelines of the Group of Seven summit in Italy, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv, the White House said as Biden was headed to Europe.\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan said the agreement would not commit U.S. troops directly to Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion -- a red line drawn by Biden, who's fearful of being pulled into direct conflict between the nuclear-armed powers. Announcement of the agreement comes as Biden heads to the summit of the world's leading democracies with an urgency to get big things done, including turning frozen Russian assets into billions of dollars to help Ukraine fight Russian President Vladimir Putin's war machine.\n\n\"We want to demonstrate that the U.S. supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them and that we'll continue to help address their security needs,\" Sullivan said, adding \"this agreement will show our resolve.\"\n\nThis year's meeting comes three years after Biden declared at his first such gathering that America was back as a global leader following the disruptions to Western alliances that occurred when Donald Trump was president. Now, there's a chance this gathering could be the final G7 for Biden and other G7 leaders, depending on the results of elections this year.\n\nBiden and his counterparts from Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan will use the summit to discuss challenges related artificial intelligence, migration, the Russian military's resurgence and China's economic might, among other topics. Pope Francis, Zelenskyy and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are joining the gathering at the Borgo Egnazia resort in the Puglia region of southern Italy.\n\nThe summit, opening Thursday, will play out after far-right parties across the continent racked up gains of surprising scale in just-concluded European Union elections. Those victories, coupled with upcoming elections in the United Kingdom, France and the United States, have rattled the global political establishment and added weightiness to this year's summit.\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to U.S. and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center, an international affairs think tank. \"We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\"\n\nThe G7 is an informal bloc of industrialized democracies that meets annually to discuss shared issues and concerns. Biden will arrive in Italy on Wednesday night, his second trip outside the U.S. in as many weeks. The Democratic president was in France last week for a state visit in Paris and ceremonies in Normandy marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in World War II.\n\nWhile last week's visit had a celebratory feel, this one will be dominated by pressing global issues, including how to keep financial support flowing to Ukraine as it fights Russia's invasion. Biden's trip comes a day after his son Hunter was convicted on federal gun charges, a blow sure to weigh heavily on the president's mind.\n\nDespite pressing global challenges, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said there's still a sense of relief among world leaders in 2024 that \"America was back,\" referencing Biden's 2021 speech at the G7 in England.\n\n\"Biden's message then was that democracies need to step up and show they can deliver for their people,\" Kirby said. \"That's true now more than ever.\"\n\nKirby said the U.S. was prepared to work with democratically elected officials in the EU no matter who they are, though some of those being elevated have expressed far less support for Ukraine than current leaders.\n\n\"We have every confidence that regardless of who fills the seats in the European Parliament, we're going to continue to work closely with our EU partners on all the issues relative to our shared interests across the European continent,\" Kirby said. \"That includes supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden and Zelenskyy, who met last week in Paris, will meet again discuss continued support for the Eastern European nation, which is trying to fend off an intense Russian offensive in eastern areas of the country. They're expected to hold a joint news conference. Biden is also expected to meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the pope and other leaders.\n\nBiden, who's been adamant \"we will not walk away\" from Ukraine, last week publicly apologized to Zelenskyy for a monthslong delay by Congress in authorizing additional American military assistance. The delay allowed Russia to make gains on the battlefield.\n\nSullivan called the security agreement a \"bridge\" to when Ukraine is invited to join the NATO alliance -- a long-term priority of Zelenskyy's that the allies have said will first require an end to the Russia-Ukraine war and that Putin has steadfastly opposed.\n\nBiden's back-to-back trips to France and Italy amount to a rare doubleheader of diplomacy in the midst of the presidential election. The president will skip a Ukraine peace conference in Switzerland this weekend to jet to Los Angeles for a campaign fundraiser with big names from Hollywood. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the U.S. at the conference.\n\nDespite the delays in military aid, the Biden administration on Tuesday announced it would send Ukraine another Patriot missile system to help fend off Russian strikes, two U.S. officials told The Associated Press. Biden approved the move, the officials told the AP, as Kyiv has desperately called for more air defenses in its battle against an intense Russian assault on the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nKirby said the U.S. would use the G7 summit to announce fresh sanctions and export control actions targeting those who have helped Russia procure what it needs for the war. He said the new measures would make it harder for financiers to support Russia's defense mechanism.\n\nUkraine and many of its supporters have called for the confiscation of $260 billion in Russian assets frozen outside the country after the Feb. 24, 2022, invasion. But European officials have resisted, citing legal and financial stability concerns. Most of the frozen assets are located in Europe.\n\nA European plan to just use the interest on the Russian funds would provide only a trickle of money every year -- about $2.5 billion to $3 billion at current interest rates, which would barely meet a month's financing needs for the Ukrainian government.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said recently that G7 finance ministers have been discussing the possibility of extending a loan to Ukraine and using the windfall profits of assets seized in Europe to pay it off.\n\nKirby said the U.S. was optimistic the group could agree on the matter.\n\nBiden is also expected to discuss economic concerns brought on by Chinese manufacturing overcapacity, how to use artificial intelligence in a way that maximizes benefits but still manages national security risks, and global migration.\n\nThe U.S. and other G7 nations are struggling to manage large influxes of migrants arriving for complicated reasons that include war, climate change and drought. Migration, and how nations cope with the growing numbers at their borders, has been a factor driving the far-right rise in some of Europe.\n\nSuperville reported from Bari, Italy.", "source": {"uri":

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden headed to Italy on Wednesday for a summit of the world's leading democracies with an urgency to get big things done, including turning frozen Russian assets into billions of dollars to help Ukraine as it fights off Russian President Vladimir Putin's war machine.\n\nThis year's Group of Seven summit comes three years after Biden declared at his first such gathering that America was back as a global leader following the disruptions to Western alliances that occurred when Donald Trump was president. Now, there's a chance this gathering could be the final G7 for Biden and other G7 leaders, depending on the results of elections this year.\n\nBiden and his counterparts from Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan will use the summit to discuss challenges related to the spread of artificial intelligence, migration, the Russian military's resurgence and China's economic might, among other topics. Pope Francis, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are joining the gathering at the Borgo Egnazia resort in the Puglia region of southern Italy.\n\nThe summit, which opens Thursday, will play out after far-right parties across the continent racked up gains of surprising scale in just-concluded European Union elections. Those victories, coupled with upcoming elections in the United Kingdom, France and the United States, have rattled the global political establishment and added weightiness to this year's summit.\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to U.S. and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center, an international affairs think tank. \"We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\"\n\nThe G7 is an informal bloc of industrialized democracies that meets annually to discuss shared issues and concerns. Biden is set to arrive in Italy on Wednesday night, his second trip outside the U.S. in as many weeks. The Democratic president was in France last week for a state visit in Paris and ceremonies in Normandy marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in World War II.\n\nWhile last week's visit had a celebratory feel, this one will be dominated by pressing global issues, including how to keep financial support flowing to Ukraine as it fights Russia's invasion. Biden's trip also comes one day after his son Hunter was convicted on federal gun charges, a blow sure to weigh heavily on the president's mind.\n\nDespite pressing global challenges, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said there is still a sense of relief among world leaders in 2024 that \"America was back,\" referencing Biden's 2021 speech at the G7 in Cornwall, England.\n\n\"Biden's message then was that democracies need to step up and show they can deliver for their people,\" Kirby said. \"That's true now more than ever.\"\n\nKirby said the U.S. was prepared to work with democratically elected officials in the EU no matter who they are, though some of those being elevated have expressed far less support for Ukraine than current leaders.\n\n\"We have every confidence that regardless of who fills the seats in the European Parliament, we're going to continue to work closely with our EU partners on all the issues relative to our shared interests across the European continent,\" Kirby said. \"That includes supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden and Zelenskyy, who met last week in Paris, will meet again Thursday on the sidelines of the summit to discuss continued support for the Eastern European nation, which is trying to fend off an intense Russian offensive in eastern areas of the country. They are expected to hold a joint news conference. Biden is also expected to meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the pope and other leaders.\n\nBiden, who has been adamant that \"we will not walk away\" from Ukraine, last week publicly apologized to Zelenskyy for a monthslong delay by Congress in authorizing additional American military assistance. The delay allowed Russia to make gains on the battlefield.\n\nBiden's back-to-back trips to France and Italy amount to a rare doubleheader of diplomacy in the midst of the presidential election. The president will skip a Ukraine peace conference in Switzerland this weekend to jet to Los Angeles for a campaign fundraiser with big names from Hollywood. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the U.S. at the conference.\n\nDespite the delays in military aid, the Biden administration on Tuesday announced it would send Ukraine another Patriot missile system to help fend off Russian strikes, two U.S. officials told The Associated Press. Biden approved the move, the officials told the AP, as Kyiv has desperately called for more air defenses in its battle against an intense Russian assault on the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nKirby said the U.S. would use the G7 summit to announce fresh sanctions and export control actions targeting those who have helped Russia procure what it needs for the war. He said the new measures would make it harder for financiers to support Russia's defense mechanism.\n\nUkraine and many of its supporters have called for the confiscation of $260 billion in Russian assets frozen outside the country after the Feb. 24, 2022, invasion. But European officials have resisted, citing legal and financial stability concerns. Most of the frozen assets are located in Europe.\n\nA European plan to just use the interest on the Russian funds would provide only a trickle of money every year -- about $2.5 billion to $3 billion at current interest rates, which would barely meet a month's financing needs for the Ukrainian government.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said recently that G7 finance ministers have been discussing the possibility of extending a loan to Ukraine and using the windfall profits of assets seized in Europe to pay it off.\n\nKirby said the U.S. was optimistic the group could agree on the matter.\n\nBiden is also expected to discuss economic concerns brought on by Chinese manufacturing overcapacity, how to use artificial intelligence in a way that maximizes benefits but still manages national security risks, and global migration.\n\nThe U.S. and other G7 nations are struggling to manage large influxes of migrants arriving for complicated reasons that include war, climate change and drought. Migration, and how nations cope with the growing numbers at their borders, has been a factor driving the far-right rise in some of Europe.", "source": {"uri": "brandonsun.com", "dataType": "news",

The delay allowed Russia to make gains on the battlefield.\n\nBiden's back-to-back trips to France and Italy amount to a rare doubleheader of diplomacy in the midst of the presidential election. The president will skip a Ukraine peace conference in Switzerland this weekend to jet to Los Angeles for a campaign fundraiser with big names from Hollywood. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the U.S. at the conference.\n\nDespite the delays in military aid, the Biden administration on Tuesday announced it would send Ukraine another Patriot missile system to help fend off Russian strikes, two U.S. officials told The Associated Press. Biden approved the move, the officials told the AP, as Kyiv has desperately called for more air defenses in its battle against an intense Russian assault on the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nKirby said the U.S. would use the G7 summit to announce fresh sanctions and export control actions targeting those who have helped Russia procure what it needs for the war. He said the new measures would make it harder for financiers to support Russia's defense mechanism.\n\nUkraine and many of its supporters have called for the confiscation of $260 billion in Russian assets frozen outside the country after the Feb. 24, 2022, invasion. But European officials have resisted, citing legal and financial stability concerns. Most of the frozen assets are located in Europe.\n\nA European plan to just use the interest on the Russian funds would provide only a trickle of money every year -- about $2.5 billion to $3 billion at current interest rates, which would barely meet a month's financing needs for the Ukrainian government.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said recently that G7 finance ministers have been discussing the possibility of extending a loan to Ukraine and using the windfall profits of assets seized in Europe to pay it off.\n\nVideo above: Why are war crimes hard to prosecute?\n\nKirby said the U.S. was optimistic the group could agree on the matter.\n\nBiden is also expected to discuss economic concerns brought on by Chinese manufacturing overcapacity, how to use artificial intelligence in a way that maximizes benefits but still manages national security risks, and global migration.\n\nThe U.S. and other G7 nations are struggling to manage large influxes of migrants arriving for complicated reasons that include war, climate change and drought. Migration, and how nations cope with the growing numbers at their borders, has been a factor driving the far-right rise in some of Europe.", "source": {"uri": "wapt.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Now, there's a chance this gathering could be the final G7 for Biden and other G7 leaders, depending on the results of elections this year.\n\nBiden and his counterparts from Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan will use the summit to discuss challenges related to the spread of artificial intelligence, migration, the Russian military\u00b4s resurgence and China's economic might, among other topics. Pope Francis, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are joining the gathering at the Borgo Egnazia resort in the Puglia, a region of southern Italy.\n\nThe summit, which opens Thursday, will play out after far-right parties across the continent racked up gains of surprising scale in just-concluded European Union elections. Those victories - coupled with upcoming elections in the United Kingdom, France and the United States - have rattled the global political establishment and added weightiness to this year's summit.\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to U.S. and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council\u00b4s GeoEconomics Center, an international affairs think tank. \"We don\u00b4t know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\"\n\nThe G7 is an informal bloc of industrialized democracies that meets annually to discuss shared issues and concerns. Biden is set to arrive in Italy on Wednesday night, his second trip outside the U.S. in as many weeks. The Democratic president was in France last week for a state visit in Paris and ceremonies in Normandy marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in World War II.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is escorted by Air Force Col.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nWhile last week\u00b4s visit had a celebratory feel, this one will be dominated by pressing global issues, including how to keep financial support flowing to Ukraine as it fights Russia\u00b4s invasion. Biden's trip also comes one day after his son Hunter was convicted on federal gun charges, a blow sure to weigh heavily on the president's mind.\n\nDespite pressing global challenges, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said there is still a sense of relief among world leaders in 2024 that \"America was back,\" referencing Biden's 2021 speech at the G7 in Cornwall, England.\n\n\"Biden\u00b4s message then was that democracies need to step up and show they can deliver for their people,\" Kirby said. \"That's true now more than ever.\"\n\nKirby said the U.S. was prepared to work with democratically elected officials in the EU no matter who they are, though some of those being elevated have expressed far less support for Ukraine than current leaders.\n\n\"We have every confidence that regardless of who fills the seats in the European Parliament, we\u00b4re going to continue to work closely with our EU partners on all the issues relative to our shared interests across the European continent,\" Kirby said. \"That includes supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden and Zelenskyy, who met last week in Paris, will meet again Thursday on the sidelines of the summit to discuss continued support for the Eastern European nation, which is trying to fend off an intense Russian offensive in eastern areas of the country. They are expected to hold a joint news conference. Biden is also expected to meet one-on-one with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the pope and other leaders.\n\nBiden, who has been adamant that \"we will not walk away\" from Ukraine, last week publicly apologized to Zelenskyy for a monthslong delay by Congress in authorizing additional American military assistance. The delay allowed Russia to make gains on the battlefield.\n\nBiden\u00b4s back-to-back trips to France and Italy amount to a rare doubleheader of international diplomacy in the midst of the presidential election. The president will skip a Ukraine peace conference in Switzerland this weekend to jet to Los Angeles for a campaign fundraiser with big names from Hollywood. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the U.S. at the Swiss conference.\n\nDespite the delays in military aid, the Biden administration on Tuesday announced it would send Ukraine another Patriot missile system to help fend off Russian strikes, two U.S. officials told The Associated Press.

It is now possible that this gathering could be the last G7 for Biden and other G7 leaders, depending on the results of this year's elections.\n\nBiden and his counterparts from Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Japan will use the summit to discuss challenges related to the diffusion of artificial intelligence, migration, the resurgence of the Russian military and China's economic power, among other topics. Pope Francis, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan join the gathering at the resort town of Borgo Egnazia in Puglia, a region in southern Italy.\n\nThe summit, which opens on Thursday, will come after far-right parties across the continent racked up gains of surprising magnitude at the just-concluded summit. European Union elections. These victories, coupled with upcoming elections in the United Kingdom, France and the United States, have shaken the global political establishment and added weight to this year's summit.\n\nYou hear this a lot when talking to U.S. and European officials: If we can't get it done now, whether on China or on assets, we may not get another chance, said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Councils GeoEconomics Center, an international affairs think tank. We don't know what the world will look like in three months, six months, nine months. \"\n\nThe G7 is an informal bloc of industrialized democracies that meets annually to discuss common issues and concerns. Biden is expected to arrive in Italy on Wednesday evening, his second trip outside the United States in as many weeks. The Democratic president was in France last week for a state visit in Paris and the ceremonies in Normandy marking the 80th anniversary of the Landing during WWII.\n\nAlthough last week's visit was celebratory, it will be dominated by pressing global issues, including how to maintain financial support for Ukraine as it struggles. Invasion of Russia. Biden's trip also comes a day after his son Hunter was convicted of federal gun chargesa hard blow that will certainly weigh heavily on the president's mind.\n\nDespite pressing global challenges, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said there is still a sense of relief among world leaders in 2024 because \"America was back\" referencing Biden's 2021 speech at the G7 in Cornwall, England.\n\nBiden's message then was that democracies must step up and show they can meet the expectations of their people, Kirby said. This is more true than ever.\n\nKirby said the United States is willing to work with democratically elected officials in the EU, whoever they may be, even if some of those who have been promoted have expressed far less support for Ukraine than current leaders.\n\nWe are confident that, whoever takes the seats in the European Parliament, we will continue to work closely with our EU partners on all issues relating to our common interests across the European continent,\" Kirby said . \"This includes support for Ukraine. .\n\nBiden and Zelenskyy, who met last week in Pariswill meet again on the sidelines of the summit on Thursday to discuss continued support for the Eastern European nation as it attempts to fend off an intense crisis. Russian offensive in the eastern regions of the country. They are expected to hold a joint press conference. Biden is also expected to meet face-to-face Giorgia Meloni, Italian Prime Ministerthe pope and other leaders.\n\nBiden, who insisted we would not leave Ukraine, last week publicly apologized to Zelensky of Congress' months-long delay in authorizing additional U.S. military aid. This delay allowed Russia to battlefield gains.\n\nBiden's back-to-back trips to France and Italy constitute a rare double bill of international diplomacy in the middle of the presidential election. The president will jump a peace conference in Ukraine in Switzerland this weekend to fly to Los Angeles for a fundraising campaign with big names from Hollywood. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the United States at the Swiss conference.\n\nDespite delays in providing military aid, the Biden administration announced Tuesday that it would do so. send Ukraine another Patriot missile system to help repel Russian strikes, two U.S. officials told The Associated Press. Biden approved the move, the officials told the AP, as kyiv has desperately called for more air defenses in its fight against an intense Russian attack on the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nKirby said the United States would use the G7 summit to announce new sanctions and export control measures targeting those who helped Russia procure what it needs for the war. He said the new measures would make it harder for financiers to support Russia's defense mechanism.\n\nUkraine and many of its supporters have called for the confiscation of $260 billion in Russian assets frozen outside the country after the Feb. 24, 2022, invasion. But European officials have resisted, citing stability concerns legal and financial. Most of the frozen assets are in Europe.\n\nA European plan to use only interest from Russian funds would provide only a trickle of money each year, about $2.5-3 billion at current interest rates, barely enough to meet the needs of one-month funding from the Ukrainian government.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said recently that G7 finance ministers were discussing the possibility of providing a loan to Ukraine and using windfall profits from assets seized in Europe to repay it.\n\nKirby said the United States was optimistic the group would be able to agree on the issue.\n\nBiden is also expected to discuss economic concerns caused by Chinese manufacturing overcapacity, how to use artificial intelligence in ways that maximize profits while managing national security risks, and global migration.\n\nThe United States and other G7 countries are struggling to manage massive influxes of migrants arriving for complex reasons such as war, climate change and drought. Migration and how countries deal with the growing number of people at their borders has been a factor in the rise of the far right in certain regions of Europe.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com",

AFP\n\n\"Tomorrow, President Biden and President Zelensky will sit down to discuss our strong support for Ukraine now and into the future,\" National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters traveling with Biden to Italy.\n\n\"Following that meeting, the leaders will sign a bilateral security agreement, making clear our support will last long into the future.\"\n\nThe deal would not include any commitment to use US forces but would involve weapons and assistance for Ukraine, which Washington has backed since the 2022 invasion, said Sullivan.\n\nIt was similar to other deals signed between Ukraine and 15 other allies, he added.\n\n\"Any lasting peace in Ukraine has to be under its own ability to defend itself,\" Sullivan said.\n\n\"By signing this, we'll also be sending Russia a signal of our resolve to Vladimir Putin. He thinks that he can help mask the coalition supporting Ukraine. He's wrong.\"\n\nKyiv swiftly welcomed news of the deal.\n\n\"We have come a long way in our cooperation with the United States, and the entire team has done a great job to make this future agreement possible,\" said Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's office.\n\nBiden headed to Italy on Wednesday for a summit of the world's leading democracies with an urgency to get big things done, including turning frozen Russian assets into billions of dollars to help Ukraine as it fights off Russian President Vladimir Putin's war machine.\n\nThis year's Group of Seven summit comes three years after Biden declared at his first such gathering that America was back as a global leader following the disruptions to Western alliances that occurred when Donald Trump was president. Now, there's a chance this gathering could be the final G7 for Biden and other G7 leaders, depending on the results of elections this year.\n\nBiden and his counterparts from Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan will use the summit to discuss challenges related to the spread of artificial intelligence, migration, the Russian military's resurgence and China's economic might, among other topics. Pope Francis, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are joining the gathering at the Borgo Egnazia resort in the Puglia region of southern Italy.\n\nThe summit, which opens Thursday, will play out after far-right parties across the continent racked up gains of surprising scale in just-concluded European Union elections. Those victories, coupled with upcoming elections in the United Kingdom, France and the United States, have rattled the global political establishment and added weightiness to this year's summit.\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to US and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center, an international affairs think tank. \"We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\"\n\nThe G7 is an informal bloc of industrialized democracies that meets annually to discuss shared issues and concerns. Biden is set to arrive in Italy on Wednesday night, his second trip outside the US in as many weeks. The Democratic president was in France last week for a state visit in Paris and ceremonies in Normandy marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in World War II.\n\nWhile last week's visit had a celebratory feel, this one will be dominated by pressing global issues, including how to keep financial support flowing to Ukraine as it fights Russia's invasion. Biden's trip also comes one day after his son Hunter was convicted on federal gun charges, a blow sure to weigh heavily on the president's mind.\n\nDespite pressing global challenges, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said there is still a sense of relief among world leaders in 2024 that \"America was back,\" referencing Biden's 2021 speech at the G7 in Cornwall, England.\n\n\"Biden's message then was that democracies need to step up and show they can deliver for their people,\" Kirby said. \"That's true now more than ever.\"\n\nKirby said the US was prepared to work with democratically elected officials in the EU no matter who they are, though some of those being elevated have expressed far less support for Ukraine than current leaders.\n\n\"We have every confidence that regardless of who fills the seats in the European Parliament, we're going to continue to work closely with our EU partners on all the issues relative to our shared interests across the European continent,\" Kirby said. \"That includes supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden and Zelenskyy, who met last week in Paris, will meet again Thursday on the sidelines of the summit to discuss continued support for the Eastern European nation, which is trying to fend off an intense Russian offensive in eastern areas of the country. They are expected to hold a joint news conference. Biden is also expected to meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the pope and other leaders.\n\nBiden, who has been adamant that \"we will not walk away\" from Ukraine, last week publicly apologized to Zelenskyy for a monthslong delay by Congress in authorizing additional American military assistance. The delay allowed Russia to make gains on the battlefield.\n\nBiden's back-to-back trips to France and Italy amount to a rare doubleheader of diplomacy in the midst of the presidential election. The president will skip a Ukraine peace conference in Switzerland this weekend to jet to Los Angeles for a campaign fundraiser with big names from Hollywood. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the US at the conference.\n\nDespite the delays in military aid, the Biden administration on Tuesday announced it would send Ukraine another Patriot missile system to help fend off Russian strikes, two US officials told The Associated Press. Biden approved the move, the officials told the AP, as Kyiv has desperately called for more air defenses in its battle against an intense Russian assault on the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nKirby said the US would use the G7 summit to announce fresh sanctions and export control actions targeting those who have helped Russia procure what it needs for the war. He said the new measures would make it harder for financiers to support Russia's defense mechanism.\n\nUkraine and many of its supporters have called for the confiscation of $260 billion in Russian assets frozen outside the country after the Feb. 24, 2022, invasion. But European officials have resisted, citing legal and financial stability concerns. Most of the frozen assets are located in Europe.\n\nA European plan to just use the interest on the Russian funds would provide only a trickle of money every year -- about $2.5 billion to $3 billion at current interest rates, which would barely meet a month's financing needs for the Ukrainian government.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said recently that G7 finance ministers have been discussing the possibility of extending a loan to Ukraine and using the windfall profits of assets seized in Europe to pay it off.\n\nKirby said the US was optimistic the group could agree on the matter.\n\nBiden is also expected to discuss economic concerns brought on by Chinese manufacturing overcapacity, how to use artificial intelligence in a way that maximizes benefits but still manages national security risks, and global migration.\n\nThe US and other G7 nations are struggling to manage large influxes of migrants arriving for complicated reasons that include war, climate change and drought. Migration, and how nations cope with the growing numbers at their borders, has been a factor driving the far-right rise in some of Europe.", "source": {"uri": "english.ahram.org.eg", "dataType":

Image courtesy White House\n\nBiden and Zelenskyy will sign a security agreement between the US and Ukraine when they meet at G7\n\nBy DARLENE SUPERVILLE and COLLEEN LONG Associated Press\n\nABOARD AIR FORCE ONE: President Joe Biden and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will sign a bilateral security agreement between the US and Ukraine on Thursday when they meet on the sidelines of the Group of Seven summit in Italy, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv, the White House said as Biden was headed to Europe.\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan said the agreement would not commit US troops directly to Ukraine's defence against Russia's invasion -- a red line drawn by Biden, who's fearful of being pulled into direct conflict between the nuclear-armed powers. Announcement of the agreement comes as Biden heads to the summit of the world's leading democracies with an urgency to get big things done, including turning frozen Russian assets into billions of dollars to help Ukraine fight Russian President Vladimir Putin's war machine.\n\n\"We want to demonstrate that the U.S. supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them and that we'll continue to help address their security needs,\" Sullivan said, adding \"this agreement will show our resolve.\"\n\nThis year's meeting comes three years after Biden declared at his first such gathering that America was back as a global leader following the disruptions to Western alliances that occurred when Donald Trump was president. Now, there's a chance this gathering could be the final G7 for Biden and other G7 leaders, depending on the results of elections this year.\n\nBiden and his counterparts from Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan will use the summit to discuss challenges related artificial intelligence, migration, the Russian military's resurgence and China's economic might, among other topics. Pope Francis, Zelenskyy and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are joining the gathering at the Borgo Egnazia resort in the Puglia region of southern Italy.\n\nThe summit, opening Thursday, will play out after far-right parties across the continent racked up gains of surprising scale in just-concluded European Union elections. Those victories, coupled with upcoming elections in the United Kingdom, France and the United States, have rattled the global political establishment and added weightiness to this year's summit.\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to US and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center, an international affairs think tank. \"We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\"\n\nThe G7 is an informal bloc of industrialised democracies that meets annually to discuss shared issues and concerns. Biden will arrive in Italy on Wednesday night, his second trip outside the U.S. in as many weeks. The Democratic president was in France last week for a state visit in Paris and ceremonies in Normandy marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in World War II.\n\nWhile last week's visit had a celebratory feel, this one will be dominated by pressing global issues, including how to keep financial support flowing to Ukraine as it fights Russia's invasion. Biden's trip comes a day after his son Hunter was convicted on federal gun charges, a blow sure to weigh heavily on the president's mind.\n\nDespite pressing global challenges, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said there's still a sense of relief among world leaders in 2024 that \"America was back,\" referencing Biden's 2021 speech at the G7 in England.\n\n\"Biden's message then was that democracies need to step up and show they can deliver for their people,\" Kirby said. \"That's true now more than ever.\"\n\nKirby said the US was prepared to work with democratically elected officials in the EU no matter who they are, though some of those being elevated have expressed far less support for Ukraine than current leaders.\n\n\"We have every confidence that regardless of who fills the seats in the European Parliament, we're going to continue to work closely with our EU partners on all the issues relative to our shared interests across the European continent,\" Kirby said. \"That includes supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden and Zelenskyy, who met last week in Paris, will meet again discuss continued support for the Eastern European nation, which is trying to fend off an intense Russian offensive in eastern areas of the country. They're expected to hold a joint news conference. Biden is also expected to meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the pope and other leaders.\n\nBiden, who's been adamant \"we will not walk away\" from Ukraine, last week publicly apologized to Zelenskyy for a monthslong delay by Congress in authorizing additional American military assistance. The delay allowed Russia to make gains on the battlefield.\n\nSullivan called the security agreement a \"bridge\" to when Ukraine is invited to join the NATO alliance -- a long-term priority of Zelenskyy's that the allies have said will first require an end to the Russia-Ukraine war and that Putin has steadfastly opposed.\n\nBiden's back-to-back trips to France and Italy amount to a rare doubleheader of diplomacy in the midst of the presidential election. The president will skip a Ukraine peace conference in Switzerland this weekend to jet to Los Angeles for a campaign fundraiser with big names from Hollywood. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the U.S. at the conference.\n\nDespite the delays in military aid, the Biden administration on Tuesday announced it would send Ukraine another Patriot missile system to help fend off Russian strikes, two US officials told The Associated Press. Biden approved the move, the officials told the AP, as Kyiv has desperately called for more air defenses in its battle against an intense Russian assault on the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nKirby said the U.S. would use the G7 summit to announce fresh sanctions and export control actions targeting those who have helped Russia procure what it needs for the war. He said the new measures would make it harder for financiers to support Russia's defense mechanism.\n\nUkraine and many of its supporters have called for the confiscation of $260 billion in Russian assets frozen outside the country after the Feb. 24, 2022, invasion. But European officials have resisted, citing legal and financial stability concerns. Most of the frozen assets are located in Europe.\n\nA European plan to just use the interest on the Russian funds would provide only a trickle of money every year -- about $2.5 billion to $3 billion at current interest rates, which would barely meet a month's financing needs for the Ukrainian government.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said recently that G7 finance ministers have been discussing the possibility of extending a loan to Ukraine and using the windfall profits of assets seized in Europe to pay it off.\n\nKirby said the U.S. was optimistic the group could agree on the matter.\n\nBiden is also expected to discuss economic concerns brought on by Chinese manufacturing overcapacity, how to use artificial intelligence in a way that maximizes benefits but still manages national security risks, and global migration.\n\nThe US and other G7 nations are struggling to manage large influxes of migrants arriving for complicated reasons that include war, climate change and drought. Migration, and how nations cope with the growing numbers at their borders, has been a factor driving the far-right rise in some of Europe.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news",

National security adviser Jake Sullivan said the agreement would not commit U.S. troops directly to Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion - a red line drawn by Biden, who's fearful of being pulled into direct conflict between the nuclear-armed powers. Announcement of the agreement comes as Biden heads to the summit of the world's leading democracies with an urgency to get big things done, including turning frozen Russian assets into billions of dollars to help Ukraine fight Russian President Vladimir Putin's war machine. \"We want to demonstrate that the U.S. supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them and that we'll continue to help address their security needs,\"\u009d Sullivan said, adding \"this agreement will show our resolve.\"\u009d This year's meeting comes three years after Biden declared at his first such gathering that America was back as a global leader following the disruptions to Western alliances that occurred when Donald Trump was president. Now, there's a chance this gathering could be the final G7 for Biden and other G7 leaders, depending on the results of elections this year. Biden and his counterparts from Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan will use the summit to discuss challenges related artificial intelligence, migration, the Russian military's resurgence and China's economic might, among other topics. Pope Francis, Zelenskyy and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are joining the gathering at the Borgo Egnazia resort in the Puglia region of southern Italy. The summit, opening Thursday, will play out after far-right parties across the continent racked up gains of surprising scale in just-concluded European Union elections. Those victories, coupled with upcoming elections in the United Kingdom, France and the United States, have rattled the global political establishment and added weightiness to this year's summit. \"You hear this a lot when you talk to U.S. and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\"\u009d said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center, an international affairs think tank. \"We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\" The G7 is an informal bloc of industrialized democracies that meets annually to discuss shared issues and concerns. Biden will arrive in Italy on Wednesday night, his second trip outside the U.S. in as many weeks. The Democratic president was in France last week for a state visit in Paris and ceremonies in Normandy marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in World War II. While last week's visit had a celebratory feel, this one will be dominated by pressing global issues, including how to keep financial support flowing to Ukraine as it fights Russia's invasion. Biden's trip comes a day after his son Hunter was convicted on federal gun charges, a blow sure to weigh heavily on the president's mind. Despite pressing global challenges, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said there's still a sense of relief among world leaders in 2024 that \"America was back,\" referencing Biden's 2021 speech at the G7 in England. \"Biden's message then was that democracies need to step up and show they can deliver for their people,\"\u009d Kirby said. \"That's true now more than ever.\"\u009d Kirby said the U.S. was prepared to work with democratically elected officials in the EU no matter who they are, though some of those being elevated have expressed far less support for Ukraine than current leaders. \"We have every confidence that regardless of who fills the seats in the European Parliament, we're going to continue to work closely with our EU partners on all the issues relative to our shared interests across the European continent,\" Kirby said. \"That includes supporting Ukraine.\"\u009d Biden and Zelenskyy, who met last week in Paris, will meet again discuss continued support for the Eastern European nation, which is trying to fend off an intense Russian offensive in eastern areas of the country. They're expected to hold a joint news conference. Biden is also expected to meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the pope and other leaders. Biden, who's been adamant \"we will not walk away\"\u009d from Ukraine, last week publicly apologized to Zelenskyy for a monthslong delay by Congress in authorizing additional American military assistance. The delay allowed Russia to make gains on the battlefield. Sullivan called the security agreement a \"bridge\"\u009d to when Ukraine is invited to join the NATO alliance - a long-term priority of Zelenskyy's that the allies have said will first require an end to the Russia-Ukraine war and that Putin has steadfastly opposed. Biden's back-to-back trips to France and Italy amount to a rare doubleheader of diplomacy in the midst of the presidential election. The president will skip a Ukraine peace conference in Switzerland this weekend to jet to Los Angeles for a campaign fundraiser with big names from Hollywood. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the U.S. at the conference. Despite the delays in military aid, the Biden administration on Tuesday announced it would send Ukraine another Patriot missile system to help fend off Russian strikes, two U.S. officials told The Associated Press. Biden approved the move, the officials told the AP, as Kyiv has desperately called for more air defenses in its battle against an intense Russian assault on the northeastern Kharkiv region. Kirby said the U.S. would use the G7 summit to announce fresh sanctions and export control actions targeting those who have helped Russia procure what it needs for the war. He said the new measures would make it harder for financiers to support Russia's defense mechanism. Ukraine and many of its supporters have called for the confiscation of $260 billion in Russian assets frozen outside the country after the Feb. 24, 2022, invasion. But European officials have resisted, citing legal and financial stability concerns. Most of the frozen assets are located in Europe. A European plan to just use the interest on the Russian funds would provide only a trickle of money every year - about $2.5 billion to $3 billion at current interest rates, which would barely meet a month's financing needs for the Ukrainian government. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said recently that G7 finance ministers have been discussing the possibility of extending a loan to Ukraine and using the windfall profits of assets seized in Europe to pay it off. Kirby said the U.S. was optimistic the group could agree on the matter. Biden is also expected to discuss economic concerns brought on by Chinese manufacturing overcapacity, how to use artificial intelligence in a way that maximizes benefits but still manages national security risks, and global migration. The U.S. and other G7 nations are struggling to manage large influxes of migrants arriving for complicated reasons that include war, climate change and drought. Migration, and how nations cope with the growing numbers at their borders, has been a factor driving the far-right rise in some of Europe. ___ Superville reported from Bari, Italy.", "source": {"uri":

Those victories, coupled with upcoming elections in the United Kingdom, France and the United States, have rattled the global political establishment and added weightiness to this year's summit.\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to US and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Centre, an international affairs think tank. \"We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\"\n\nThe G7 is an informal bloc of industrialised democracies that meets annually to discuss shared issues and concerns. Biden will arrive in Italy on Wednesday night, his second trip outside the US in as many weeks. The Democratic president was in France last week for a state visit in Paris and ceremonies in Normandy marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in World War II.\n\nWhile last week's visit had a celebratory feel, this one will be dominated by pressing global issues, including how to keep financial support flowing to Ukraine as it fights Russia's invasion. Biden's trip comes a day after his son Hunter was convicted on federal gun charges, a blow sure to weigh heavily on the president's mind.\n\nDespite pressing global challenges, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said there's still a sense of relief among world leaders in 2024 that \"America was back\", referencing Biden's 2021 speech at the G7 in England.\n\n\"Biden's message then was that democracies need to step up and show they can deliver for their people,\" Kirby said. \"That's true now more than ever.\"\n\nKirby said the US was prepared to work with democratically elected officials in the EU no matter who they are, though some of those being elevated have expressed far less support for Ukraine than current leaders.\n\n\"We have every confidence that regardless of who fills the seats in the European Parliament, we're going to continue to work closely with our EU partners on all the issues relative to our shared interests across the European continent,\" Kirby said. \"That includes supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden and Zelenskyy, who met last week in Paris, will meet again discuss continued support for the Eastern European nation, which is trying to fend off an intense Russian offensive in eastern areas of the country. They're expected to hold a joint news conference. Biden is also expected to meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the pope and other leaders.\n\nBiden, who's been adamant \"we will not walk away\" from Ukraine, last week publicly apologised to Zelenskyy for a monthslong delay by Congress in authorising additional American military assistance. The delay allowed Russia to make gains on the battlefield.\n\nSullivan called the security agreement a \"bridge\" to when Ukraine is invited to join the NATO alliance -- a long-term priority of Zelenskyy's that the allies have said will first require an end to the Russia-Ukraine war and that Putin has steadfastly opposed.\n\nBiden's back-to-back trips to France and Italy amount to a rare doubleheader of diplomacy in the midst of the presidential election. The president will skip a Ukraine peace conference in Switzerland this weekend to jet to Los Angeles for a campaign fundraiser with big names from Hollywood. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the US at the conference.\n\nDespite the delays in military aid, the Biden administration on Tuesday announced it would send Ukraine another Patriot missile system to help fend off Russian strikes, two US officials told The Associated Press. Biden approved the move, the officials told the AP, as Kyiv has desperately called for more air defences in its battle against an intense Russian assault on the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nKirby said the US would use the G7 summit to announce fresh sanctions and export control actions targeting those who have helped Russia procure what it needs for the war. He said the new measures would make it harder for financiers to support Russia's defence mechanism.\n\nUkraine and many of its supporters have called for the confiscation of USD 260 billion in Russian assets frozen outside the country after the February 24, 2022, invasion. But European officials have resisted, citing legal and financial stability concerns. Most of the frozen assets are located in Europe.\n\nA European plan to just use the interest on the Russian funds would provide only a trickle of money every year -- about USD 2.5 billion to USD 3 billion at current interest rates, which would barely meet a month's financing needs for the Ukrainian government.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said recently that G7 finance ministers have been discussing the possibility of extending a loan to Ukraine and using the windfall profits of assets seized in Europe to pay it off.\n\nKirby said the US was optimistic the group could agree on the matter.\n\nBiden is also expected to discuss economic concerns brought on by Chinese manufacturing overcapacity, how to use artificial intelligence in a way that maximises benefits but still manages national security risks, and global migration.\n\nThe US and other G7 nations are struggling to manage large influxes of migrants arriving for complicated reasons that include war, climate change and drought. Migration, and how nations cope with the growing numbers at their borders, has been a factor driving the far-right rise in some of Europe.

Announcement of the agreement comes as Biden heads to the summit of the world's leading democracies with an urgency to get big things done, including turning frozen Russian assets into billions of dollars to help Ukraine fight Russian President Vladimir Putin's war machine.\n\n\"We want to demonstrate that the U.S. supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them and that we'll continue to help address their security needs,\" Sullivan said, adding \"this agreement will show our resolve.\"\n\nREAD MORE: At D-Day 80th anniversary, Biden pledges not to walk away from defending Ukraine\n\nThis year's meeting comes three years after Biden declared at his first such gathering that America was back as a global leader following the disruptions to Western alliances that occurred when Donald Trump was president.

Now, there's a chance this gathering could be the final G7 for Biden and other G7 leaders, depending on the results of elections this year.\n\nBiden and his counterparts from Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan will use the summit to discuss challenges related to the spread of artificial intelligence, migration, the Russian military's resurgence and China's economic might, among other topics. Pope Francis, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are joining the gathering at the Borgo Egnazia resort in the Puglia region of southern Italy.\n\nThe summit, which opens Thursday, will play out after far-right parties across the continent racked up gains of surprising scale in just-concluded European Union elections. Those victories, coupled with upcoming elections in the United Kingdom, France and the United States, have rattled the global political establishment and added weightiness to this year's summit.\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to U.S. and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center, an international affairs think tank. \"We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\"\n\nThe G7 is an informal bloc of industrialized democracies that meets annually to discuss shared issues and concerns. Biden is set to arrive in Italy on Wednesday night, his second trip outside the U.S. in as many weeks. The Democratic president was in France last week for a state visit in Paris and ceremonies in Normandy marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in World War II.\n\nWhile last week's visit had a celebratory feel, this one will be dominated by pressing global issues, including how to keep financial support flowing to Ukraine as it fights Russia's invasion. Biden's trip also comes one day after his son Hunter was convicted on federal gun charges, a blow sure to weigh heavily on the president's mind.\n\nDespite pressing global challenges, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said there is still a sense of relief among world leaders in 2024 that \"America was back,\" referencing Biden's 2021 speech at the G7 in Cornwall, England.\n\n\"Biden's message then was that democracies need to step up and show they can deliver for their people,\" Kirby said. \"That's true now more than ever.\"\n\nKirby said the U.S. was prepared to work with democratically elected officials in the EU no matter who they are, though some of those being elevated have expressed far less support for Ukraine than current leaders.\n\n\"We have every confidence that regardless of who fills the seats in the European Parliament, we're going to continue to work closely with our EU partners on all the issues relative to our shared interests across the European continent,\" Kirby said. \"That includes supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden and Zelenskyy, who met last week in Paris, will meet again Thursday on the sidelines of the summit to discuss continued support for the Eastern European nation, which is trying to fend off an intense Russian offensive in eastern areas of the country. They are expected to hold a joint news conference. Biden is also expected to meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the pope and other leaders.\n\nBiden, who has been adamant that \"we will not walk away\" from Ukraine, last week publicly apologized to Zelenskyy for a monthslong delay by Congress in authorizing additional American military assistance. The delay allowed Russia to make gains on the battlefield.\n\nBiden's back-to-back trips to France and Italy amount to a rare doubleheader of diplomacy in the midst of the presidential election. The president will skip a Ukraine peace conference in Switzerland this weekend to jet to Los Angeles for a campaign fundraiser with big names from Hollywood. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the U.S. at the conference.\n\nDespite the delays in military aid, the Biden administration on Tuesday announced it would send Ukraine another Patriot missile system to help fend off Russian strikes, two U.S. officials told The Associated Press. Biden approved the move, the officials told the AP, as Kyiv has desperately called for more air defenses in its battle against an intense Russian assault on the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nKirby said the U.S. would use the G7 summit to announce fresh sanctions and export control actions targeting those who have helped Russia procure what it needs for the war. He said the new measures would make it harder for financiers to support Russia's defense mechanism.\n\nUkraine and many of its supporters have called for the confiscation of $260 billion in Russian assets frozen outside the country after the Feb. 24, 2022, invasion. But European officials have resisted, citing legal and financial stability concerns. Most of the frozen assets are located in Europe.\n\nA European plan to just use the interest on the Russian funds would provide only a trickle of money every year -- about $2.5 billion to $3 billion at current interest rates, which would barely meet a month's financing needs for the Ukrainian government.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said recently that G7 finance ministers have been discussing the possibility of extending a loan to Ukraine and using the windfall profits of assets seized in Europe to pay it off.\n\nKirby said the U.S. was optimistic the group could agree on the matter.\n\nBiden is also expected to discuss economic concerns brought on by Chinese manufacturing overcapacity, how to use artificial intelligence in a way that maximizes benefits but still manages national security risks, and global migration.\n\nThe U.S. and other G7 nations are struggling to manage large influxes of migrants arriving for complicated reasons that include war, climate change and drought. Migration, and how nations cope with the growing numbers at their borders, has been a factor driving the far-right rise in some of Europe.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news",

Those victories -- coupled with upcoming elections in the United Kingdom, France and the United States -- have rattled the global political establishment and added weightiness to this year's summit.\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to US and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center, an international affairs think tank.\n\n\"We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\"\n\nThe G7 is an informal bloc of industrialised democracies that meets annually to discuss shared issues and concerns. Biden is set to arrive in Italy on Wednesday night, his second trip outside the US in as many weeks. The Democratic president was in France last week for a state visit in Paris and ceremonies in Normandy marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in World War II.\n\nWhile last week's visit had a celebratory feel, this one will be dominated by pressing global issues, including how to keep financial support flowing to Ukraine as it fights Russia's invasion. Biden's trip also comes one day after his son Hunter was convicted on federal gun charges, a blow sure to weigh heavily on the president's mind.\n\nDespite pressing global challenges, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said there is still a sense of relief among world leaders in 2024 that \"America was back,\" referencing Biden's 2021 speech at the G7 in Cornwall, England.\n\n\"Biden's message then was that democracies need to step up and show they can deliver for their people,\" Kirby said. \"That's true now more than ever.\"\n\nKirby said the US was prepared to work with democratically elected officials in the EU no matter who they are, though some of those being elevated have expressed far less support for Ukraine than current leaders.\n\n\"We have every confidence that regardless of who fills the seats in the European Parliament, we're going to continue to work closely with our EU partners on all the issues relative to our shared interests across the European continent,\" Kirby said. \"That includes supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden and Zelenskyy, who met last week in Paris, will meet again on Thursday on the sidelines of the summit to discuss continued support for the Eastern European nation, which is trying to fend off an intense Russian offensive in eastern areas of the country. They are expected to hold a joint news conference.\n\nBiden is also expected to meet one-on-one with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the pope and other leaders.\n\nBiden, who has been adamant that \"we will not walk away\" from Ukraine, last week publicly apologised to Zelenskyy for a months-long delay by Congress in authorising additional American military assistance. The delay allowed Russia to make gains on the battlefield.\n\nBiden's back-to-back trips to France and Italy amount to a rare doubleheader of international diplomacy in the midst of the presidential election.\n\nThe president will skip a Ukraine peace conference in Switzerland this weekend to jet to Los Angeles for a campaign fundraiser with big names from Hollywood. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the US at the Swiss conference.\n\nDespite the delays in military aid, the Biden administration on Tuesday announced it would send Ukraine another Patriot missile system to help fend off Russian strikes, two US officials told The Associated Press.\n\nBiden approved the move, the officials told the AP, as Kyiv has desperately called for more air defences in its battle against an intense Russian assault on the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nKirby said the US would use the G7 summit to announce fresh sanctions and export control actions targeting those who have helped Russia procure what it needs for the war. He said the new measures would make it harder for financiers to support Russia's defense mechanism.\n\nUkraine and many of its supporters have called for the confiscation of USD 260 billion in Russian assets frozen outside the country after the February 24, 2022, invasion. But European officials have resisted, citing legal and financial stability concerns. Most of the frozen assets are located in Europe.\n\nA European plan to just use the interest on the Russian funds would provide only a trickle of money every year -- about USD 2.5 billion to USD 3 billion at current interest rates, which would barely meet a month's financing needs for the Ukrainian government.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said recently that G7 finance ministers have been discussing the possibility of extending a loan to Ukraine and using the windfall profits of assets seized in Europe to pay it off.\n\nKirby said the US was optimistic the group could agree on the matter.\n\nBiden is also expected to discuss economic concerns brought on by Chinese manufacturing overcapacity, how to use artificial intelligence in a way that maximizes benefits but still manages national security risks, and global migration.\n\nThe US and other G7 nations are struggling to manage large influxes of migrants arriving for complicated reasons that include war, climate change and drought. Migration, and how nations cope with the growing numbers at their borders, has been a factor driving the far-right rise in some of Europe.

between the US and Ukraine on Thursday when they meet on the sidelines of the G7 summit.\n\nThe announcement came as negotiators for the group reached an agreement on how to provide Ukraine with up to $50 billion backed by frozen Russian assets, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe international group of wealthy democracies has been discussing ways of using the more than $260 billion in Russian assets frozen outside the country after the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine to help Kyiv.\n\nEuropean officials have resisted confiscating the assets, citing legal and financial stability concerns - most of the frozen assets are located in Europe - but the plan would use the interest earned on the assets to help Ukraine's war effort.\n\nAn official with the French presidency confirmed the announcement on Wednesday.\n\nThe announcement of the agreement comes as Mr Biden heads to the G7 summit with an urgency to get big things done, including turning frozen Russian assets into billions of dollars to help Ukraine fight Russian president Vladimir Putin's war machine.\n\nThe security arrangement was aimed at sending a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv, the White House said as Mr Biden was headed to Europe.\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters that the agreement would not commit US troops directly to Ukraine's defence against Russia's invasion - a red line drawn by Mr Biden, who is fearful of being drawn into direct conflict between the nuclear-armed powers.\n\n\"We want to demonstrate that the US supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them and that we'll continue to help address their security needs,\" Mr Sullivan said, adding \"this agreement will show our resolve\".\n\nMr Sullivan called the agreement a \"bridge\" to when Ukraine is invited to join the Nato alliance - a long-term priority of Mr Zelenskiy's that the allies have said will first require an end to the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nMr Biden heads to the summit of the world's leading democracies with an urgency to get big things done, including turning frozen Russian assets into billions of dollars to help Ukraine as it fights off Mr Putin's war machine.\n\nThis year's G7 summit comes three years after Mr Biden declared at his first such gathering that America was back as a global leader following the disruptions to

Angela Ochoa, commander of the 89th Airlift Wing, as he arrives at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., on Wednesday. Biden is headed to Italy for the G7 summit. Biden's granddaughter Finnegan Biden walks at right. Alex Brandon/Associated Press\n\nABOARD AIR FORCE ONE -- President Biden and President Volodymyr Zelensky will sign a bilateral security agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine on Thursday when they meet on the sidelines of the Group of Seven summit in Italy, aiming to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv, the White House said as Biden was headed to Europe.\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan said the agreement would not commit U.S. troops directly to Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion -- a red line drawn by Biden, who's fearful of being pulled into direct conflict between the nuclear-armed powers. Announcement of the agreement comes as Biden heads to the summit of the world's leading democracies with an urgency to get big things done, including turning frozen Russian assets into billions of dollars to help Ukraine fight Russian President Vladimir Putin's war machine.\n\n\"We want to demonstrate that the U.S. supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them and that we'll continue to help address their security needs,\" Sullivan said, adding \"this agreement will show our resolve.\"\n\nThis year's meeting comes three years after Biden declared at his first such gathering that America was back as a global leader following the disruptions to Western alliances that occurred when Donald Trump was president. Now, there's a chance this gathering could be the final G7 for Biden and other G7 leaders, depending on the results of elections this year.\n\nBiden and his counterparts from Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan will use the summit to discuss challenges related to artificial intelligence, migration, the Russian military's resurgence and China's economic might, among other topics. Pope Francis, Zelensky and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are joining the gathering at the Borgo Egnazia resort in the Puglia region of southern Italy.\n\nThe summit, opening Thursday, will play out after far-right parties across the continent racked up gains of surprising scale in just-concluded European Union elections. Those victories, coupled with upcoming elections in the United Kingdom, France and the United States, have rattled the global political establishment and added weightiness to this year's summit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to U.S. and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center, an international affairs think tank. \"We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\"\n\nThe G7 is an informal bloc of industrialized democracies that meets annually to discuss shared issues and concerns. Biden will arrive in Italy on Wednesday night, his second trip outside the U.S. in as many weeks. The Democratic president was in France last week for a state visit in Paris and ceremonies in Normandy marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in World War II.\n\nRelated Biden apologizes to Zelensky for monthslong holdup in approving weapons\n\nWhile last week's visit had a celebratory feel, this one will be dominated by pressing global issues, including how to keep financial support flowing to Ukraine as it fights Russia's invasion. Biden's trip comes a day after his son Hunter was convicted on federal gun charges, a blow sure to weigh heavily on the president's mind.\n\nDespite pressing global challenges, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said there's still a sense of relief among world leaders in 2024 that \"America was back,\" referencing Biden's 2021 speech at the G7 in England.\n\n\"Biden's message then was that democracies need to step up and show they can deliver for their people,\" Kirby said. \"That's true now more than ever.\"\n\nKirby said the U.S. was prepared to work with democratically elected officials in the EU no matter who they are, though some of those being elevated have expressed far less support for Ukraine than current leaders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We have every confidence that regardless of who fills the seats in the European Parliament, we're going to continue to work closely with our EU partners on all the issues relative to our shared interests across the European continent,\" Kirby said. \"That includes supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden and Zelensky, who met last week in Paris, will meet again discuss continued support for the Eastern European nation, which is trying to fend off an intense Russian offensive in eastern areas of the country. They're expected to hold a joint news conference. Biden is also expected to meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the pope and other leaders.\n\nBiden, who's been adamant \"we will not walk away\" from Ukraine, last week publicly apologized to Zelensky for a monthslong delay by Congress in authorizing additional American military assistance. The delay allowed Russia to make gains on the battlefield.\n\nSullivan called the security agreement a \"bridge\" to when Ukraine is invited to join the NATO alliance -- a long-term priority of Zelensky's that the allies have said will first require an end to the Russia-Ukraine war and that Putin has steadfastly opposed.\n\nBiden's back-to-back trips to France and Italy amount to a rare doubleheader of diplomacy in the midst of the presidential election. The president will skip a Ukraine peace conference in Switzerland this weekend to jet to Los Angeles for a campaign fundraiser with big names from Hollywood. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the U.S. at the conference.\n\nDespite the delays in military aid, the Biden administration on Tuesday announced it would send Ukraine another Patriot missile system to help fend off Russian strikes, two U.S. officials told The Associated Press. Biden approved the move, the officials told the AP, as Kyiv has desperately called for more air defenses in its battle against an intense Russian assault on the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd earlier Wednesday, the U.S. announced fresh sanctions targeting Chinese companies that help Russia pursue its war in Ukraine, as well as Russia's financial infrastructure. Sullivan said \"these actions will rachet up the risk that foreign financial institutions take by dealing with Russia's war economy.\"\n\nUkraine and many of its supporters have called for the confiscation of $260 billion in Russian assets frozen outside the country after the Feb. 24, 2022, invasion. But European officials have resisted, citing legal and financial stability concerns. Most of the frozen assets are located in Europe.\n\nA European plan to just use the interest on the Russian funds would provide only a trickle of money every year -- about $2.5 billion to $3 billion at current interest rates, which would barely meet a month's financing needs for the Ukrainian government.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said recently that G7 finance ministers have been discussing the possibility of extending a loan to Ukraine and using the windfall profits of assets seized in Europe to pay it off.\n\nKirby said the U.S. was optimistic the group could agree on the matter.\n\nBiden is also expected to discuss economic concerns brought on by Chinese manufacturing overcapacity, how to use artificial intelligence in a way that maximizes benefits but still manages national security risks, and global migration.\n\nThe U.S. and other G7 nations are struggling to manage large influxes of migrants arriving for complicated reasons that include war, climate change and drought. Migration, and how nations cope with the growing numbers at their borders, has been a factor driving the far-right rise in some of Europe.\n\nCopy the Story Link Related Headlines 90 countries to attend Ukraine peace summit that Russia is snubbing Biden apologizes to Zelensky for monthslong holdup in approving weapons\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

Pope Francis, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are joining the gathering at the Borgo Egnazia resort in the Puglia region of southern Italy.\n\nThe summit, which opens Thursday, will play out after far-right parties across the continent racked up gains of surprising scale in just-concluded European Union elections. Those victories, coupled with upcoming elections in the United Kingdom, France and the United States, have rattled the global political establishment and added weightiness to this year's summit.\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to US and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Centre, an international affairs think tank. \"We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\"\n\nThe G7 is an informal bloc of industrialized democracies that meets annually to discuss shared issues and concerns. Biden is set to arrive in Italy on Wednesday night, his second trip outside the US in as many weeks. The Democratic president was in France last week for a state visit in Paris and ceremonies in Normandy marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in World War II.\n\nWhile last week's visit had a celebratory feel, this one will be dominated by pressing global issues, including how to keep financial support flowing to Ukraine as it fights Russia's invasion. Biden's trip also comes one day after his son Hunter was convicted on federal gun charges, a blow sure to weigh heavily on the president's mind.\n\nDespite pressing global challenges, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said there is still a sense of relief among world leaders in 2024 that \"America was back,\" referencing Biden's 2021 speech at the G7 in Cornwall, England.\n\n\"Biden's message then was that democracies need to step up and show they can deliver for their people,\" Kirby said. \"That's true now more than ever.\"\n\nKirby said the US was prepared to work with democratically elected officials in the EU no matter who they are, though some of those being elevated have expressed far less support for Ukraine than current leaders.\n\n\"We have every confidence that regardless of who fills the seats in the European Parliament, we're going to continue to work closely with our EU partners on all the issues relative to our shared interests across the European continent,\" Kirby said. \"That includes supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden and Zelenskyy, who met last week in Paris, will meet again Thursday on the sidelines of the summit to discuss continued support for the Eastern European nation, which is trying to fend off an intense Russian offensive in eastern areas of the country. They are expected to hold a joint news conference. Biden is also expected to meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the pope and other leaders.\n\nBiden, who has been adamant that \"we will not walk away\" from Ukraine, last week publicly apologized to Zelenskyy for a monthslong delay by Congress in authorizing additional American military assistance. The delay allowed Russia to make gains on the battlefield.\n\nBiden's back-to-back trips to France and Italy amount to a rare doubleheader of diplomacy in the midst of the presidential election. The president will skip a Ukraine peace conference in Switzerland this weekend to jet to Los Angeles for a campaign fundraiser with big names from Hollywood. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the US at the conference.\n\nDespite the delays in military aid, the Biden administration on Tuesday announced it would send Ukraine another Patriot missile system to help fend off Russian strikes, two US officials told The Associated Press. Biden approved the move, the officials told the AP, as Kyiv has desperately called for more air defences in its battle against an intense Russian assault on the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nKirby said the US would use the G7 summit to announce fresh sanctions and export control actions targeting those who have helped Russia procure what it needs for the war. He said the new measures would make it harder for financiers to support Russia's defence mechanism.\n\nUkraine and many of its supporters have called for the confiscation of USD 260 billion in Russian assets frozen outside the country after the February 24, 2022, invasion.

Migration, and how nations cope with the growing numbers at their borders, has been a factor driving the far-right rise in some of Europe.

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nEuropean officials have resisted confiscating the assets, citing legal and financial stability concerns -- most of the frozen assets are located in Europe -- but the plan would use the interest earned on the assets to help Ukraine's war effort. An official with the French presidency confirmed the agreement Wednesday, saying most of the money would be flowing to Ukraine in the form of a loan from the U.S. government backed by the proceeds of the frozen Russian assets in the European Union. Two other people familiar with the matter confirmed the arrangement.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nFinal technical negotiations were underway ahead of the summit to finalize the legal terms of the deal.\n\nThe announcement of the agreement comes as Biden landed in Italy to attend the summit of the world's leading democracies with an urgency to get big things done, including turning frozen Russian assets into billions of dollars to help Ukraine fight Russian President Vladimir Putin's war machine.\n\nThe security arrangement was aimed to send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv, the White House said as Biden was headed to Europe.\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan said the security agreement would not commit U.S. troops directly to Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion -- a red line drawn by Biden, who's fearful of being pulled into direct conflict between the nuclear-armed powers.\n\n\"We want to demonstrate that the U.S. supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them and that we'll continue to help address their security needs,\" Sullivan said, adding \"this agreement will show our resolve.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSullivan said aboard Air Force One that the goal of the financing plan was to have a loan that would \"pull forward the windfall profits from the seized assets\" of Russia, giving Ukraine a \"substantial source of funding\" to meet its immediate needs.\n\nThe national security adviser said he had a specific sum of money in mind, but declined to say if that figure was $50 billion. He stressed the urgency of getting Ukraine financial resources as soon as possible and that multiple countries would back the agreement.\n\n\"It's to provide the necessary resources to Ukraine now for its economic energy and other needs, so that it's capable of having the resilience necessary to withstand Russia's continuing aggression,\" Sullivan said.\n\nThis year's meeting comes three years after Biden declared at his first such gathering that America was back as a global leader following the disruptions to Western alliances that occurred when Donald Trump was president. Now, there's a chance this gathering could be the final G7 for Biden and other G7 leaders, depending on the results of elections this year.\n\nBiden and his counterparts from Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan will use the summit to discuss challenges related to artificial intelligence, migration, the Russian military's resurgence and China's economic might, among other topics. Pope Francis, Zelenskyy and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are joining the gathering at the Borgo Egnazia resort in the Puglia region of southern Italy.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe summit, opening Thursday, will play out after far-right parties across the continent racked up gains of surprising scale in just-concluded European Union elections. Those victories -- coupled with upcoming elections in the United Kingdom, France and the United States -- have rattled the global political establishment and added weightiness to this year's summit.\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to U.S. and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center, an international affairs think tank. \"We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\"\n\nThe G7 is an informal bloc of industrialized democracies that meets annually to discuss shared issues and concerns. Biden will arrive in Italy on Wednesday night, his second trip outside the U.S. in as many weeks. The Democratic president was in France last week for a state visit in Paris and ceremonies in Normandy marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in World War II.\n\nWhile last week's visit had a celebratory feel, this one will be dominated by pressing global issues, including how to keep financial support flowing to Ukraine as it fights Russia's invasion. Biden's trip comes a day after his son Hunter was convicted on federal gun charges, a blow sure to weigh heavily on the president's mind.\n\nDespite pressing global challenges, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said there's still a sense of relief among world leaders in 2024 that \"America was back,\" referencing Biden's 2021 speech at the G7 in England.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Biden's message then was that democracies need to step up and show they can deliver for their people,\" Kirby said. \"That's true now more than ever.\"\n\nKirby said the U.S. was prepared to work with democratically elected officials in the EU no matter who they are, though some of those being elevated have expressed far less support for Ukraine than current leaders.\n\n\"We have every confidence that regardless of who fills the seats in the European Parliament, we're going to continue to work closely with our EU partners on all the issues relative to our shared interests across the European continent,\" Kirby said. \"That includes supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden and Zelenskyy, who met last week in Paris, will meet again to discuss continued support for the Eastern European nation, which is trying to fend off an intense Russian offensive in eastern areas of the country. They're expected to hold a joint news conference. Biden is also expected to meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the pope and other leaders.\n\nBiden, who's been adamant \"we will not walk away\" from Ukraine, last week publicly apologized to Zelenskyy for a monthslong delay by Congress in authorizing additional American military assistance. The delay allowed Russia to make gains on the battlefield.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSullivan called the security agreement a \"bridge\" to when Ukraine is invited to join the NATO alliance -- a long-term priority of Zelenskyy's that the allies have said will first require an end to the Russia-Ukraine war and that Putin has steadfastly opposed.\n\nBiden's back-to-back trips to France and Italy amount to a rare doubleheader of diplomacy in the midst of the presidential election. The president will skip a Ukraine peace conference in Switzerland this weekend to jet to Los Angeles for a campaign fundraiser with big names from Hollywood. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the U.S. at the conference.\n\nDespite the delays in military aid, the Biden administration on Tuesday announced it would send Ukraine another Patriot missile system to help fend off Russian strikes, two U.S. officials told The Associated Press. Biden approved the move, the officials told the AP, as Kyiv has desperately called for more air defenses in its battle against an intense Russian assault on the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the U.S. announced fresh sanctions targeting Chinese companies that help Russia pursue its war in Ukraine, as well as Russia's financial infrastructure. Sullivan said, \"These actions will ratchet up the risk that foreign financial institutions take by dealing with Russia's war economy.\"\n\nBiden is also expected to discuss economic concerns brought on by Chinese manufacturing overcapacity, how to use artificial intelligence in a way that maximizes benefits but still manages national security risks, and global migration.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe U.S. and other G7 nations are struggling to manage large influxes of migrants arriving for complicated reasons that include war, climate change and drought. Migration, and how nations cope with the growing numbers at their borders, has been a factor driving the far-right rise in some of Europe.\n\n___\n\nSuperville reported from Bari, Italy.

Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the U.S. at the conference.\n\nDespite the delays in military aid, the Biden administration on Tuesday announced it would send Ukraine another Patriot missile system to help fend off Russian strikes, two U.S. officials told The Associated Press. Biden approved the move, the officials told the AP, as Kyiv has desperately called for more air defenses in its battle against an intense Russian assault on the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nKirby said the U.S. would use the G7 summit to announce fresh sanctions and export control actions targeting those who have helped Russia procure what it needs for the war. He said the new measures would make it harder for financiers to support Russia's defense mechanism.\n\nUkraine and many of its supporters have called for the confiscation of $260 billion in Russian assets frozen outside the country after the Feb. 24, 2022, invasion. But European officials have resisted, citing legal and financial stability concerns. Most of the frozen assets are located in Europe.\n\nA European plan to just use the interest on the Russian funds would provide only a trickle of money every year -- about $2.5 billion to $3 billion at current interest rates, which would barely meet a month's financing needs for the Ukrainian government.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said recently that G7 finance ministers have been discussing the possibility of extending a loan to Ukraine and using the windfall profits of assets seized in Europe to pay it off.\n\nKirby said the U.S. was optimistic the group could agree on the matter.\n\nBiden is also expected to discuss economic concerns brought on by Chinese manufacturing overcapacity, how to use artificial intelligence in a way that maximizes benefits but still manages national security risks, and global migration.\n\nThe U.S. and other G7 nations are struggling to manage large influxes of migrants arriving for complicated reasons that include war, climate change and drought. Migration, and how nations cope with the growing numbers at their borders, has been a factor driving the far-right rise in some of Europe.\n\n___\n\nSuperville reported from Bari, Italy.", "source":

The move aims to pressure Russia and China while strengthening Ukraine's defense capabilities. The G7 leaders will discuss numerous global challenges and sanctions against Russia.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden will sign a new security agreement with Ukraine on Thursday to pledge America's long-term support to the country, during his trip to Italy to meet with the Group of Seven leaders, a top U.S. official said.\n\nBiden departed for Italy on Wednesday to increase pressure on Russia over its war against Ukraine and on China for its support of Moscow and excess industrial capacity. The agreement will make clear \"our support will last long into the future... particularly in the defense and security space,\" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One.\n\n\"By signing this we'll also be sending Russia a signal of our resolve. If Vladimir Putin thinks he can outlast the coalition supporting Ukraine, he's wrong,\" Sullivan said. Fifteen countries have signed the security agreement, which will strengthen Ukraine's \"defensive deterrence capability,\" he added.\n\nThe White House had said earlier Biden will meet again with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the summit, followed by a joint press conference. The G7 leaders arrive at the summit confronting myriad woes at home even as they seek solutions for many of the world's most pressing problems.\n\nBiden, 81, spent Tuesday evening at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, after a 12-member jury convicted his son Hunter Biden of lying about his drug use to illegally buy a gun in 2018, making him the first child of a sitting U.S. president to be convicted of a crime. The trial followed the May 30 criminal conviction of Republican former President Donald Trump, the first former U.S. president to be found guilty of a felony. Biden and Trump are running against each other in the November presidential election and are neck-and-neck in the polls.\n\nThe heads of the world's most developed democracies will address multiple challenges during the June 13-15 meeting, including wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, trade imbalances with China, threats posed by artificial intelligence and development challenges in Africa. The leaders will also announce new sanctions and export controls against Russia that target entities and networks helping Putin's forces fight the war in Ukraine, White House spokesperson John Kirby said on Tuesday.\n\n\"We're going to continue to drive up costs for the Russian war machine,\" Kirby said. Washington plans to widen sanctions on the sale of semiconductor chips and other goods to Russia, with the goal of targeting third-party sellers in China, sources familiar with the plans said late on Tuesday.\n\nThe administration will announce it is broadening existing export controls to include U.S.-branded goods, not just those made in the United States, the sources said. It will identify certain Hong Kong entities it says are shipping goods to Moscow. Shoring up funding for Ukraine will be a top priority at the G7 meeting, with U.S. and European officials eager to lock in solutions, ahead of a possible Trump re-election and the uncertainty it would raise over future U.S. support for Kyiv.\n\nThe Group of Seven nations and the European Union are considering how to use profits generated by Russian assets immobilized in the West to provide Ukraine with a large up-front loan to secure Kyiv's financing for 2025. \"We will announce new steps to unlock the value of the immobilized Russian sovereign assets to benefit Ukraine and to help them recover from the destruction that Mr. Putin's army has caused,\" Kirby said.\n\nBiden will press other G7 leaders to agree to an innovative plan to use future interest on some $281 billion of Russian central bank funds to back up a $50 billion loan to Ukraine. G7 leaders also face electoral challenges, with polls indicating British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will likely lose power in a national vote next month, and the leaders of France and Germany reeling from heavy defeats in recent European elections.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com",

Alvarez/AP)\n\nMr Biden and his counterparts from Canada, the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Japan will use the summit to discuss challenges related to the spread of artificial intelligence, migration, the Russian military's resurgence and China's economic might, among other topics.\n\nPope Francis, Mr Zelensky and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are joining the gathering at the Borgo Egnazia resort in the Puglia region of southern Italy.\n\nThe summit, which opens on Thursday, will play out after far-right parties across the continent secured gains of surprising scale in just-concluded European Union elections.\n\nThose victories, coupled with upcoming elections in the UK, France and the US, have rattled the global political establishment and added weightiness to this year's summit.\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to US and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Centre, an international affairs think tank.\n\n\"We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Sullivan", "type":

The European Union also takes part.\n\nKyiv can expect to receive a huge new aid package from the G7 for its defence against Russia. The leaders are set to agree to finance a loan of $50 billion for Ukraine with interest from frozen Russian state assets.\n\nThe lion's share of the frozen assets - around 210 billion euros- is within the European Union. The Russian money generates billions in interest income every year.\n\nAfter months of negotiations, Biden and Zelensky will also sign a bilateral security agreement between the United States and Ukraine on the sidelines of the G7, the White House said.\n\nWashington also announced on the eve of the summit it was imposing sanctions on more than 300 individuals and entities connected to Russia's war economy, including financial institutions, the Moscow Stock Exchange and Chinese companies.\n\nUkraine is in the spotlight at back-to-back international gatherings in Europe. Berlin hosted the Ukraine Recovery Conference On Tuesday and Wednesday. After the G7 wraps up on Saturday, many of the same leaders are due to head to Switzerland for a Ukraine peace summit at which Russia will be absent.\n\nBesides Zelensky, the leaders of Turkey, Brazil and India will also be attending the Italy talks. Pope Francis will be the first pontiff to take part in a G7 summit; He was invited to address the risks posed by artificial intelligence.\n\nOther topics include relations with Africa and migration.",

The pact aims to bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities and signal resolve to Russia. The summit will also address global challenges including AI threats and war conflicts.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden will sign a new security agreement with Ukraine on Thursday to pledge America's long-term support to the country, during his meeting with leaders of the Group of Seven democracies in Italy, a top U.S. official said. Biden departed for Italy on Wednesday to increase pressure on Russia over its war against Ukraine and on China for its support of Moscow and excess industrial capacity.\n\nThe agreement will make clear \"our support will last long into the future... particularly in the defense and security space,\" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One. \"By signing this we'll also be sending Russia a signal of our resolve. If Vladimir Putin thinks he can outlast the coalition supporting Ukraine, he's wrong,\" Sullivan said.\n\nFifteen countries have signed the security agreement, which will strengthen Ukraine's \"defensive deterrence capability,\" he said. The agreement will include a commitment to working with the U.S. Congress on funding Ukraine going forward but will not commit to using U.S. forces on the ground, Sullivan added. The White House had said earlier that Biden will meet again with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the summit, followed by a joint press conference. The U.S. also expects Biden to meet India's Narendra Modi, who was sworn in as India's prime minister for a third term, and is waiting for India to formally confirm Modi's attendance at the summit.\n\nThe G7 leaders arrive at the summit confronting myriad woes at home even as they seek solutions for many of the world's most pressing problems. Biden, 81, spent Tuesday evening at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, after a 12-member jury convicted his son Hunter Biden of lying about his drug use to illegally buy a gun in 2018, making him the first child of a sitting U.S. president to be convicted of a crime.\n\nThe trial followed the May 30 criminal conviction of Republican former President Donald Trump, the first former U.S. president to be found guilty of a felony. Biden and Trump are running against each other in the November presidential election and are neck-and-neck in the polls. The heads of the world's most developed democracies will address multiple challenges during the June 13-15 meeting, including wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, trade imbalances with China, threats posed by artificial intelligence and development challenges in Africa.\n\nThe leaders will also announce new sanctions and export controls against Russia that target entities and networks helping Putin's forces fight the war in Ukraine. Efforts to curb Russia's growing war economy will be a major discussion topic, administration officials have said. The U.S. on Wednesday dramatically broadened sanctions on Russia, including by targeting China-based companies selling semiconductors to Moscow, as part of its effort to undercut the Russian military machine waging war on Ukraine.\n\nSeparately, the Commerce Department said it was targeting shell companies in Hong Kong for diverting semiconductors to Russia, taking steps that would affect nearly $100 million of high-priority items for Moscow including such chips. \"These actions heighten the risk for financial institutions dealing with Russia's war economy, slows down avenues for evasion while diminishes Russia's ability to benefit from access to foreign technology, equipment, software and IT services,\" Sullivan said.\n\nShoring up funding for Ukraine will be a top priority at the G7 meeting, with U.S. and European officials eager to lock in solutions, ahead of a possible Trump re-election and the uncertainty it would raise over future U.S. support for Kyiv. The Group of Seven nations and the European Union are considering how to use profits generated by Russian assets immobilized in the West to provide Ukraine with a large up-front loan to secure Kyiv's financing for 2025.\n\nThe White House's Sullivan said the U.S. is \"making good progress in generating an outcome in which those proceeds from those frozen assets can be put to good use.\" Biden will press other G7 leaders to agree to an innovative plan to use future interest on some $281 billion of Russian central bank funds to back up a $50 billion loan to Ukraine.\n\nG7 leaders also face electoral challenges, with polls indicating British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will likely lose power in a national vote next month, and the leaders of France and Germany reeling from heavy defeats in recent European elections.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Perennial issues such as climate change and China also will be discussed.\n\nThe G7 is an informal forum with an annual summit to discuss economic policy and security issues.

But the plan would use the interest earned on the assets to help Ukraine's war effort.\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves using profits from the roughly $260 billion in frozen Russian central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, to help Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. would issue Ukraine the $50 billion loan using windfall profits from the immobilized funds as collateral.\n\nUnited Kingdom pledges $310 million in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine\n\nLONDON -- U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is announcing up to 242 million pounds (286 million euros or $310 million) in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine as Group of Seven leaders gather for a summit overshadowed by war.\n\nSunak is taking time out from the U.K. election campaign to attend Thursday's gathering in southern Italy.\n\nThe U.K. government says the money will go towards \"immediate humanitarian, energy and stabilization needs\" in Ukraine. Sunak has also thrown his support behind a plan to use interest from seized Russian assets to help Ukraine rebuild.\n\nSunak said the war is at a \"critical moment\" and Ukraine's allies \"must move from 'as long as it takes' to 'whatever it takes' if we are to end this illegal war.\"\n\nThe U.K. has pledged 12.5 billion pounds to Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. That includes 7.6 billion pounds worth of military assistance.\n\nSunak is battling to keep his job after the U.K. election on July 4, with opinion polls putting his Conservatives far behind the opposition Labour Party. Labour leader Keir Starmer says he will keep up the United Kingdom's strong support for Ukraine if he becomes prime minister.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Now, there's a chance this gathering could be the final G7 for Biden and other G7 leaders, depending on the results of elections this year.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nBiden and his counterparts from Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan will use the summit to discuss challenges related to the spread of artificial intelligence, migration, the Russian military's resurgence and China's economic might, among other topics. Pope Francis, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are joining the gathering at the Borgo Egnazia resort in the Puglia, a region of southern Italy.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe summit, which opens Thursday, will play out after far-right parties across the continent racked up gains of surprising scale in just-concluded European Union elections. Those victories -- coupled with upcoming elections in the United Kingdom, France and the United States -- have rattled the global political establishment and added weightiness to this year's summit.\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to U.S. and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center, an international affairs think tank. \"We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\"\n\nThe G7 is an informal bloc of industrialized democracies that meets annually to discuss shared issues and concerns. Biden is set to arrive in Italy on Wednesday night, his second trip outside the U.S. in as many weeks. The Democratic president was in France last week for a state visit in Paris and ceremonies in Normandy marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in World War II.\n\nWhile last week's visit had a celebratory feel, this one will be dominated by pressing global issues, including how to keep financial support flowing to Ukraine as it fights Russia's invasion. Biden's trip also comes one day after his son Hunter was convicted on federal gun charges, a blow sure to weigh heavily on the president's mind.\n\nDespite pressing global challenges, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said there is still a sense of relief among world leaders in 2024 that \"America was back,\" referencing Biden's 2021 speech at the G7 in Cornwall, England.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Biden's message then was that democracies need to step up and show they can deliver for their people,\" Kirby said. \"That's true now more than ever.\"\n\nKirby said the U.S. was prepared to work with democratically elected officials in the EU no matter who they are, though some of those being elevated have expressed far less support for Ukraine than current leaders.\n\n\"We have every confidence that regardless of who fills the seats in the European Parliament, we're going to continue to work closely with our EU partners on all the issues relative to our shared interests across the European continent,\" Kirby said. \"That includes supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden and Zelenskyy, who met last week in Paris, will meet again Thursday on the sidelines of the summit to discuss continued support for the Eastern European nation, which is trying to fend off an intense Russian offensive in eastern areas of the country. They are expected to hold a joint news conference. Biden is also expected to meet one-on-one with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the pope and other leaders.\n\nBiden, who has been adamant that \"we will not walk away\" from Ukraine, last week publicly apologized to Zelenskyy for a monthslong delay by Congress in authorizing additional American military assistance. The delay allowed Russia to make gains on the battlefield.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBiden's back-to-back trips to France and Italy amount to a rare doubleheader of international diplomacy in the midst of the presidential election. The president will skip a Ukraine peace conference in Switzerland this weekend to jet to Los Angeles for a campaign fundraiser with big names from Hollywood. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the U.S. at the Swiss conference.\n\nDespite the delays in military aid, the Biden administration on Tuesday announced it would send Ukraine another Patriot missile system to help fend off Russian strikes, two U.S. officials told The Associated Press. Biden approved the move, the officials told the AP, as Kyiv has desperately called for more air defenses in its battle against an intense Russian assault on the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nKirby said the U.S. would use the G7 summit to announce fresh sanctions and export control actions targeting those who have helped Russia procure what it needs for the war. He said the new measures would make it harder for financiers to support Russia's defense mechanism.\n\nUkraine and many of its supporters have called for the confiscation of $260 billion in Russian assets frozen outside the country after the Feb. 24, 2022, invasion. But European officials have resisted, citing legal and financial stability concerns. Most of the frozen assets are located in Europe.\n\nA European plan to just use the interest on the Russian funds would provide only a trickle of money every year -- about $2.5 billion to $3 billion at current interest rates, which would barely meet a month's financing needs for the Ukrainian government.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said recently that G7 finance ministers have been discussing the possibility of extending a loan to Ukraine and using the windfall profits of assets seized in Europe to pay it off.\n\nKirby said the U.S. was optimistic the group could agree on the matter.\n\nBiden is also expected to discuss economic concerns brought on by Chinese manufacturing overcapacity, how to use artificial intelligence in a way that maximizes benefits but still manages national security risks, and global migration.\n\nThe U.S. and other G7 nations are struggling to manage large influxes of migrants arriving for complicated reasons that include war, climate change and drought. Migration, and how nations cope with the growing numbers at their borders, has been a factor driving the far-right rise in some of Europe.\n\n___\n\nSuperville reported from Bari, Italy.", "source":

As with his recent trip to France, he is expected to use the occasion to stress the importance of alliances and oppose isolationism, a stance he often uses to critique his predecessor, former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Vatican confirmed in April that Pope Francis will join the leaders' summit, participating in a special session on artificial intelligence (AI).\n\n\"This is the first time in history that a pontiff will participate in the work of a G7,\" Ms. Meloni said on April 26.\n\nIt is unclear whether President Biden will meet with the Pope on the sidelines of the summit.\n\nWorld leaders expect to discuss a wide range of issues during the group's 50th summit, including the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, Russian assets, economic security, artificial intelligence, migration, climate change, and food security.\n\nThe G7 leaders are likely to announce a plan for unlocking the frozen Russian sovereign assets to assist Ukraine, an initiative that the United States has championed for a while.\n\nIn the run-up to the crucial summit, the G7 finance ministers held discussions about the legality of using some $250 billion worth of frozen assets kept in European accounts as collateral for providing a loan to Ukraine for reconstruction. France was believed to be the main holdout on the plan.\n\nPresident Biden mentioned before leaving France last week that he had reached an agreement with Mr. Macron on a plan to use the frozen Russian assets.\n\nThe proposal under discussion involves using the profits from these assets, specifically the interest earned, as collateral to provide Ukraine with a loan through a sovereign lender. Italy will capture the spotlight this week if the G7 leaders can agree on the details of this proposal.\n\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on Air Force One en route to Italy that the discussions about how to unlock Russian assets are still underway.\n\n\"We consider those discussions constructive, productive, and driving forward. I don't have anything to announce to you today. But I believe that we are making good progress,\" he said.\n\nAnother significant event on the G7 sidelines will be the meeting between President Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Following their meeting, the leaders plan to sign a bilateral security agreement.\n\nThis agreement does not include any commitment to using U.S. forces to defend Ukraine, Mr. Sullivan explained. But it aims to guarantee that Ukraine has the necessary physical capacity, as well as intelligence and other capabilities, to effectively defend itself, he added.\n\nBoth leaders have scheduled a press conference for Thursday to address the media after their meeting.\n\nThis follows the bilateral discussion between President Biden and Mr. Zelenskyy last week in Paris, France, which took place during the D-Day commemorations.\n\nDuring the June 7 meeting, President Biden apologized to Ukraine's president for the delays in passing a foreign aid measure that included $61 billion in support for Ukraine.\n\n\"We're not going to walk away from you,\" President Biden told Mr. Zelenskyy, announcing $225 million in new assistance for the war-torn country.\n\nLast year, President Zelenskyy stole the show with his unexpected visit to the G7 in Japan.\n\nThis year, he is expected to call on G7 countries to commit to more funding. Hence, the announcement regarding Russian assets will be vital for the Ukrainian president.\n\nFrom 1998 through 2014, Russia was a member of the forum known as the Group of Eight (G8). However, the country was suspended after it annexed Ukraine's Crimea region.\n\nDeveloping and using AI ethically is a key priority for the Italian leader at this year's summit. There will be a special session on AI, during which the Pope will deliver a speech.\n\nThe Vatican has an initiative known as the \"Rome Call for AI Ethics,\" which was launched several years ago and is already supported by some well-known companies, such as Microsoft, IBM, and Cisco.\n\nMs. Meloni has been vocal about the dangers of AI. She has expressed concerns about the impact of AI on the labor market, claiming that it will eliminate the need for people, widening the income gap.\n\n\"AI is a means; it can be a good or a bad one. It depends on our capacity to govern it, to tackle the risks and the impact it can have, for example, on the labor market,\" Ms. Meloni said at the White House during her meeting with President Biden on March 1.\n\n\"We want to develop AI, but also we want to be certain that it remains human-centered.\"\n\nTackling AI risks is crucial at this year's summit as it's contributing to the spread of disinformation, foreign interference, and election interference, according to Greg Allen, director of the CSIS Wadhwani Center for AI and Advanced Technologies.\n\n\"Recently, Open AI -- one of the leading AI companies worldwide -- announced that Chinese and Russian propaganda services were using Open AI's ChatGPT service to mass produce propaganda messaging at really low cost,\" he said during a CSIS press briefing to preview the summit.\n\nHe also mentioned the growing use of AI in global political election campaigns to produce synthetic media (images, videos, and sounds) to disseminate high-quality disinformation.\n\nLast year, China's economic coercion was a primary focus at the G7 summit held in Hiroshima, Japan.\n\nThe G7 leaders stated publicly in 2023 that they saw China as an economic bully and that the international community would not put up with Beijing's \"economic coercion.\" They warned for the first time that there would be \"consequences.\"\n\nChina's harmful tactics that undermine international rules and norms, particularly the recent industrial overcapacity problem, are expected to be discussed at this year's summit.\n\nChinese companies are rapidly seizing market share in strategic industries such as solar panels, wind turbines, steel, and EVs. The U.S. and European governments have expressed alarm about China's excess capacity, which is largely attributed to massive government subsidies. One major concern is the impact of the overcapacity problem on the development and innovation of industries in other countries.\n\n\"For the United States, the primary motivation continues to be China,\" according to Emily Benson, director of the project on trade and technology at the CSIS.\n\n\"The United States believes that this incoming flow of goods from China will be more acute and broader than the previous China shock, and so they're doing everything that they can to convince allies and partners to join a more protective U.S. approach,\" Ms. Benson said during the CSIS press briefing.\n\nIt remains to be seen if tariff rates on inbound goods from China into the G7 bloc will be more closely aligned, she said.\n\nThe European Commission announced on June 12 that it will impose additional tariffs of up to 38.1 percent on imported Chinese electric cars starting in July.\n\nAccording to Mr. Sullivan, the G7 countries agree that they must work together to address the challenges posed by China's policies and practices.\n\n\"I do think you can expect to see a common framework around some of these issues emerging as part of the final text of the communique,\" he said.\n\nThe summit follows last Sunday's European Parliament elections, which shook the continent's political climate.\n\nRight-wing parties made significant gains in the election, especially in France, which in turn, compelled President Macron to announce the dissolution of the French parliament and call for a snap election.\n\nThe White House is confident that this new development will have no impact on President Biden's relationship with the European leaders.\n\n\"The President will work with the democratically elected leaders of France no matter who they are,\" White House national security communications advisor John Kirby told reporters on June 11.\n\n\"We have every confidence that regardless of who fills what seats in the EU parliament, we're going to continue to work closely with President von der Leyen and our EU partners on all the issues relative to our shared interest across the European continent, and that includes supporting Ukraine.\"", "source": {"uri":

Announcement of the agreement comes as Biden heads to the summit of the world's leading democracies with an urgency to get big things done, including turning frozen Russian assets into billions of dollars to help Ukraine fight Russian President Vladimir Putin's war machine.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\n\"We want to demonstrate that the U.S. supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them and that we'll continue to help address their security needs,\" Sullivan said, adding \"this agreement will show our resolve.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThis year's meeting comes three years after Biden declared at his first such gathering that America was back as a global leader following the disruptions to Western alliances that occurred when Donald Trump was president. Now, there's a chance this gathering could be the final G7 for Biden and other G7 leaders, depending on the results of elections this year.\n\nBiden and his counterparts from Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan will use the summit to discuss challenges related artificial intelligence, migration, the Russian military's resurgence and China's economic might, among other topics. Pope Francis, Zelenskyy and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are joining the gathering at the Borgo Egnazia resort in the Puglia region of southern Italy.\n\nThe summit, opening Thursday, will play out after far-right parties across the continent racked up gains of surprising scale in just-concluded European Union elections. Those victories, coupled with upcoming elections in the United Kingdom, France and the United States, have rattled the global political establishment and added weightiness to this year's summit.\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to U.S. and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center, an international affairs think tank. \"We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\"\n\nThe G7 is an informal bloc of industrialized democracies that meets annually to discuss shared issues and concerns. Biden will arrive in Italy on Wednesday night, his second trip outside the U.S. in as many weeks. The Democratic president was in France last week for a state visit in Paris and ceremonies in Normandy marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in World War II.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWhile last week's visit had a celebratory feel, this one will be dominated by pressing global issues, including how to keep financial support flowing to Ukraine as it fights Russia's invasion. Biden's trip comes a day after his son Hunter was convicted on federal gun charges, a blow sure to weigh heavily on the president's mind.\n\nDespite pressing global challenges, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said there's still a sense of relief among world leaders in 2024 that \"America was back,\" referencing Biden's 2021 speech at the G7 in England.\n\n\"Biden's message then was that democracies need to step up and show they can deliver for their people,\" Kirby said. \"That's true now more than ever.\"\n\nKirby said the U.S. was prepared to work with democratically elected officials in the EU no matter who they are, though some of those being elevated have expressed far less support for Ukraine than current leaders.\n\n\"We have every confidence that regardless of who fills the seats in the European Parliament, we're going to continue to work closely with our EU partners on all the issues relative to our shared interests across the European continent,\" Kirby said. \"That includes supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBiden and Zelenskyy, who met last week in Paris, will meet again discuss continued support for the Eastern European nation, which is trying to fend off an intense Russian offensive in eastern areas of the country. They're expected to hold a joint news conference. Biden is also expected to meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the pope and other leaders.\n\nBiden, who's been adamant \"we will not walk away\" from Ukraine, last week publicly apologized to Zelenskyy for a monthslong delay by Congress in authorizing additional American military assistance. The delay allowed Russia to make gains on the battlefield.\n\nSullivan called the security agreement a \"bridge\" to when Ukraine is invited to join the NATO alliance -- a long-term priority of Zelenskyy's that the allies have said will first require an end to the Russia-Ukraine war and that Putin has steadfastly opposed.\n\nBiden's back-to-back trips to France and Italy amount to a rare doubleheader of diplomacy in the midst of the presidential election. The president will skip a Ukraine peace conference in Switzerland this weekend to jet to Los Angeles for a campaign fundraiser with big names from Hollywood. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the U.S. at the conference.\n\nDespite the delays in military aid, the Biden administration on Tuesday announced it would send Ukraine another Patriot missile system to help fend off Russian strikes, two U.S. officials told The Associated Press. Biden approved the move, the officials told the AP, as Kyiv has desperately called for more air defenses in its battle against an intense Russian assault on the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nKirby said the U.S. would use the G7 summit to announce fresh sanctions and export control actions targeting those who have helped Russia procure what it needs for the war. He said the new measures would make it harder for financiers to support Russia's defense mechanism.\n\nUkraine and many of its supporters have called for the confiscation of $260 billion in Russian assets frozen outside the country after the Feb. 24, 2022, invasion. But European officials have resisted, citing legal and financial stability concerns. Most of the frozen assets are located in Europe.\n\nA European plan to just use the interest on the Russian funds would provide only a trickle of money every year -- about $2.5 billion to $3 billion at current interest rates, which would barely meet a month's financing needs for the Ukrainian government.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said recently that G7 finance ministers have been discussing the possibility of extending a loan to Ukraine and using the windfall profits of assets seized in Europe to pay it off.\n\nKirby said the U.S. was optimistic the group could agree on the matter.\n\nBiden is also expected to discuss economic concerns brought on by Chinese manufacturing overcapacity, how to use artificial intelligence in a way that maximizes benefits but still manages national security risks, and global migration.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe U.S. and other G7 nations are struggling to manage large influxes of migrants arriving for complicated reasons that include war, climate change and drought. Migration, and how nations cope with the growing numbers at their borders, has been a factor driving the far-right rise in some of Europe.\n\n___\n\nSuperville reported from Bari, Italy.", "source":

REUTERS\n\nUS President Joe Biden will sign a new security agreement with Ukraine on Thursday to pledge America's long-term support to the country, during his meeting with leaders of the Group of Seven democracies in Italy, a top US official said.\n\nBiden departed for Italy on Wednesday to increase pressure on Russia over its war against Ukraine and on China for its support of Moscow and excess industrial capacity.\n\nThe agreement will make clear \"our support will last long into the future... particularly in the defense and security space,\" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One.\n\n\"By signing this we'll also be sending Russia a signal of our resolve. If Vladimir Putin thinks he can outlast the coalition supporting Ukraine, he's wrong,\" Sullivan said.\n\nFifteen countries have signed their own security agreements, which will strengthen Ukraine's \"defensive deterrence capability,\" he said. The US agreement will include a commitment to working with the US Congress on funding Ukraine going forward but will not commit to using US forces on the ground, Sullivan added.\n\nThe White House had said earlier that Biden will meet again with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the summit, followed by a joint press conference. The US also expects Biden to meet India's Narendra Modi, who was sworn in as prime minister for a third term, and is waiting for India to formally confirm Modi's attendance at the summit.\n\nThe G7 leaders arrive at the summit confronting myriad woes at home even as they seek solutions for many of the world's most pressing problems.\n\nBiden, 81, spent Tuesday evening at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, after a 12-member jury convicted his son Hunter Biden of lying about his drug use to illegally buy a gun in 2018, making him the first child of a sitting US president to be convicted of a crime.\n\nThe trial followed the May 30 criminal conviction of Republican former President Donald Trump, the first former US president to be found guilty of a felony. Biden and Trump are running against each other in the November presidential election and are neck-and-neck in the polls.\n\nThe heads of the world's most developed democracies will address multiple challenges during the June 13-15 meeting, including wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, trade imbalances with China, threats posed by artificial intelligence and development challenges in Africa.\n\nThe leaders will also announce new sanctions and export controls against Russia that target entities and networks helping Putin's forces fight the war in Ukraine. Efforts to curb Russia's growing war economy will be a major discussion topic, administration officials have said.\n\nThe US on Wednesday dramatically broadened sanctions on Russia, including by targeting China-based companies selling semiconductors to Moscow, as part of its effort to undercut the Russian military machine waging war on Ukraine.\n\nSeparately, the Commerce Department said it was targeting shell companies in Hong Kong for diverting semiconductors to Russia, taking steps that would affect nearly $100 million of high-priority items for Moscow including such chips.\n\n\"These actions heighten the risk for financial institutions dealing with Russia's war economy, slows down avenues for evasion while diminishes Russia's ability to benefit from access to foreign technology, equipment, software and IT services,\" Sullivan said.\n\nShoring up funding for Ukraine will be a top priority at the G7 meeting, with US and European officials eager to lock in solutions, ahead of a possible Trump re-election and the uncertainty it would raise over future US support for Kyiv.\n\nThe Group of Seven nations and the European Union are considering how to use profits generated by Russian assets immobilized in the West to provide Ukraine with a large up-front loan to secure Kyiv's financing for 2025.\n\nThe White House's Sullivan said the US is \"making good progress in generating an outcome in which those proceeds from those frozen assets can be put to good use.\"\n\nBiden will press other G7 leaders to agree to an innovative plan to use future interest on some $281 billion of Russian central bank funds to back up a $50 billion loan to Ukraine.\n\nG7 leaders also face electoral challenges, with polls indicating British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will likely lose power in a national vote next month, and the leaders of France and Germany reeling from heavy defeats in recent European elections.", "source": {"uri": "bdnews24.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Everyone in Puglia is aware this could be Biden's last G7 summit if he loses to Donald Trump in November US elections.\n\nBritain's Rishi Sunak is tipped to be ousted in July 4 elections, while France's Macron and Germany's Olaf Scholz are both under pressure after gains by the far right in EU elections last weekend.\n\nBy contrast, meeting host Giorgia Meloni, Italy's prime minister, is riding high after her far-right party topped European Parliament elections last weekend.\n\nMeloni laughed and joked with her G7 counterparts as she welcomed them among the olive trees of the Borgo Egnazia resort on Thursday morning -- but had a serious message.\n\n\"The Group of Seven in recent decades has assumed an irreplaceable role in the management of global crises, especially those that jeopardise our freedom and our democracy,\" she told an opening session.\n\nThe talks began with short session on Africa, development and climate change, before turning to the Middle East.\n\nThe G7 leaders have already announced their support for a Gaza truce deal outlined by Biden, which would also see the release of hostages taken in Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel.\n\nAnother key issue in Puglia, to be discussed Friday, will be concerns about China's so-called \"industrial overcapacity\", particularly in green energy and technology sectors such as solar panels and electric vehicles.\n\nAround a dozen of non-G7 leaders have also been invited to Puglia for talks on Friday, including Jordan's King Abdullah II, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, UAE president Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed and India's Narendra Modi.", "source": {"uri": "digitaljournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@digitaljournal.com",

office on Wednesday said a deal had been agreed on providing US$50 billion for Ukraine before the end of the year, but said that technical details still needed to be finalised.\n\nBritain, meanwhile, said it would announce up to US$310 million in new bilateral assistance to Kyiv at the summit, adding leaders would \"explore all lawful avenues by which immobilised Russian assets can be used to support Ukraine\".\n\nThe White House also said it expected to announce at the summit \"new steps to unlock the value\" of the Russian assets.\n\nBut US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan was on Wednesday more guarded about what this may entail, saying only that the G7 was working towards announcing \"a framework\", including a timeframe.\n\nZelenskyy is attending as part of a week of diplomatic efforts to rally support as his country's outmanned and outgunned forces struggle against Russia.\n\nIt will culminate in an international conference on Ukraine in Switzerland this

Perennial issues such as climate change and China also will be discussed.\n\nThe G7 is an informal forum with an annual summit to discuss economic policy and security issues. The members are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Italy's Meloni will welcome the G7 summit fortified by an EU vote that shook French, German leaders\n\n-- In Italy's Puglia region, women take the lead in challenging the local mafia at great personal risk\n\n-- US pushes for Ukraine aid, united front against China's trade practices at G7 finance meeting\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nBARI, Italy -- Officials say the world's seven wealthiest democracies have agreed on lending Ukraine up to $50 billion using frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nDiplomats confirmed the agreement, which was struck before Thursday's start of the three-day G7 summit that brings together Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will also sign a bilateral security agreement during the summit.\n\nEuropean officials have resisted confiscating the assets, citing legal and financial stability concerns. But the plan would use the interest earned on the assets to help Ukraine's war effort.\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves using profits from the roughly $260 billion in frozen Russian central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, to help Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. would issue Ukraine the $50 billion loan using windfall profits from the immobilized funds as collateral.\n\nLONDON -- U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is announcing up to 242 million pounds (286 million euros or $310 million) in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine as Group of Seven leaders gather for a summit overshadowed by war.\n\nSunak is taking time out from the U.K. election campaign to attend Thursday's gathering in southern Italy.\n\nThe U.K. government says the money will go towards \"immediate humanitarian, energy and stabilization needs\" in Ukraine. Sunak has also thrown his support behind a plan to use interest from seized Russian assets to help Ukraine rebuild.\n\nSunak said the war is at a \"critical moment\" and Ukraine's allies \"must move from 'as long as it takes' to 'whatever it takes' if we are to end this illegal war.\"\n\nThe U.K. has pledged 12.5 billion pounds to Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. That includes 7.6 billion pounds worth of military assistance.\n\nSunak is battling to keep his job after the U.K. election on July 4, with opinion polls putting his Conservatives far behind the opposition Labour Party. Labour leader Keir Starmer says he will keep up the United Kingdom's strong support for Ukraine if he becomes prime minister.", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

If Vladimir Putin thinks he can outlast the coalition supporting Ukraine, he's wrong,\" Sullivan said.\n\nFifteen countries have signed the security agreement, which will strengthen Ukraine's \"defensive deterrence capability,\" he added.\n\nThe White House had said earlier Biden will meet again with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the summit, followed by a joint press conference.\n\nThe G7 leaders arrive at the summit confronting myriad woes at home even as they seek solutions for many of the world's most pressing problems.\n\nBiden, 81, spent Tuesday evening at his home in Wilmington, Del., after a 12-member jury convicted his son Hunter Biden of lying about his drug use to illegally buy a gun in 2018, making him the first child of a sitting U.S. president to be convicted of a crime.\n\nThe trial followed the May 30 criminal conviction of Republican former president Donald Trump, the first former U.S. president to be found guilty of a felony. Biden and Trump are running against each other in the November presidential election and are neck-and-neck in the polls.\n\nThe heads of the world's most developed democracies will address multiple challenges during the June 13-15 meeting, including wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, trade imbalances with China, threats posed by artificial intelligence and development challenges in Africa.\n\nThe leaders will also announce new sanctions and export controls against Russia that target entities and networks helping Putin's forces fight the war in Ukraine, White House spokesperson John Kirby said on Tuesday.\n\n\"We're going to continue to drive up costs for the Russian war machine,\" Kirby said.\n\nWashington plans to widen sanctions on the sale of semiconductor chips and other goods to Russia, with the goal of targeting third-party sellers in China, sources familiar with the plans said late on Tuesday.\n\nThe administration will announce it is broadening existing export controls to include U.S.-branded goods, not just those made in the United States, the sources said. It will identify certain Hong Kong entities it says are shipping goods to Moscow.\n\nShoring up funding for Ukraine will be a top priority at the G7 meeting, with U.S. and European officials eager to lock in solutions, ahead of a possible Trump re-election and the uncertainty it would raise over future U.S. support for Kyiv.\n\nThe Group of Seven nations and the European Union are considering how to use profits generated by Russian assets immobilized in the West to provide Ukraine with a large up-front loan to secure Kyiv's financing for 2025.\n\n\"We will announce new steps to unlock the value of the immobilized Russian sovereign assets to benefit Ukraine and to help them recover from the destruction that Mr. Putin's army has caused,\" Kirby said.\n\nBiden will press other G7 leaders to agree to an innovative plan to use future interest on some US$281 billion of Russian central bank funds to back up a US$50-billion loan to Ukraine.\n\nG7 leaders also face electoral challenges, with polls indicating British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will likely lose power in a national vote next month, and the leaders of France and Germany reeling from heavy defeats in recent European elections.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5,

security agreement between US and Ukraine at summit | BreakingNews.ie", "body": "President Joe Biden and President Volodymyr Zelensky will sign a bilateral security agreement between the US and Ukraine on Thursday when they meet on the sidelines of the G7 summit.\n\nThe aim is to send a signal to Russia of American resolve over support for Kyiv, the White House said as Mr Biden headed to Italy.\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters that the agreement would not commit US troops directly to Ukraine's defence against Russia's invasion - a red line drawn by Mr Biden, who is fearful of being drawn into direct conflict between the nuclear-armed powers.\n\n\"We want to demonstrate that the US supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them and that we'll continue to help address their security needs,\" Mr Sullivan said, adding \"this agreement will show our resolve\".\n\nMr Sullivan called the agreement a \"bridge\" to when Ukraine is invited to join the Nato alliance - a long-term priority of Mr Zelensky's that the allies have said will first require an end to the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nMr Biden heads to the summit of the world's leading democracies with an urgency to get big things done, including turning frozen Russian assets into billions of dollars to help Ukraine as it fights off Russian President Vladimir Putin's war machine.\n\nThis year's G7 summit comes three years after Mr Biden declared at his first such gathering that America was back as a global leader following the disruptions to western alliances that occurred when Donald Trump was president.\n\nNow, there is a chance this gathering could be the final G7 for Mr Biden and other G7 leaders, depending on the results of elections this year.\n\nMr Biden and his counterparts from Canada, the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Japan will use the summit to discuss challenges related to the spread of artificial intelligence, migration, the Russian military's resurgence and China's economic might, among other topics.\n\nPope Francis, Mr Zelensky and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are joining the gathering at the Borgo Egnazia resort in the Puglia region of southern Italy.\n\nThe summit, which opens on Thursday, will play out after far-right parties across the continent secured gains of surprising scale in just-concluded European Union elections.\n\nThose victories, coupled with upcoming elections in the UK, France and the US, have rattled the global political establishment and added weightiness to this year's summit.\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to US and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Centre, an international affairs think tank.\n\n\"We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\"",

If Vladimir Putin thinks he can outlast the coalition supporting Ukraine, he's wrong,\" Sullivan said. Fifteen countries have signed the security agreement, which will strengthen Ukraine's \"defensive deterrence capability,\" he added.\n\nThe White House had said earlier that Biden would meet again with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the summit, followed by a joint press conference.\n\nThe G7 leaders arrive at the summit confronting myriad woes at home even as they seek solutions for many of the world's most pressing problems.\n\nBiden spent Tuesday evening at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, after a 12-member jury convicted his son Hunter Biden of lying about his drug use to illegally buy a gun in 2018, making him the first child of a sitting US president to be convicted of a crime.\n\nThe trial followed the May 30 criminal conviction of Republican former President Donald Trump, the first former US president to be found guilty of a felony. Biden and Trump are running against each other in the November presidential election and are neck-and-neck in the polls.\n\nThe heads of the world's most developed democracies will address multiple challenges during the June 13-15 meeting, including wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, trade imbalances with China, threats posed by artificial intelligence, and development challenges in Africa.\n\nThe leaders will also announce new sanctions and export controls against Russia that target entities and networks helping Putin's forces fight the war in Ukraine, White House spokesperson John Kirby said on Tuesday.\n\n\"We're going to continue to drive up costs for the Russian war machine,\" Kirby said.\n\nWashington plans to widen sanctions on the sale of semiconductor chips and other goods to Russia, to target third-party sellers in China, sources familiar with the plans said late on Tuesday.\n\nThe administration will announce it is broadening existing export controls to include US-branded goods, not just those made in the United States, the sources said. It will identify certain Hong Kong entities that ship goods to Moscow.\n\nShoring up funding for Ukraine will be a top priority at the G7 meeting, with US and European officials eager to lock in solutions, ahead of a possible Trump re-election and the uncertainty it would raise over future US support for Kyiv.\n\nThe Group of Seven nations and the European Union are considering how to use profits generated by Russian assets immobilized in the West to provide Ukraine with a large up-front loan to secure Kyiv's financing for 2025.\n\n\"We will announce new steps to unlock the value of the immobilized Russian sovereign assets to benefit Ukraine and to help them recover from the destruction that Mr. Putin's army has caused,\" Kirby said.\n\nBiden will press other G7 leaders to agree to an innovative plan to use future interest on some $281 billion of Russian central bank funds to back up a $50 billion loan to Ukraine.\n\nG7 leaders also face electoral challenges, with polls indicating British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will likely lose power in a national vote next month, and the leaders of France and Germany reeling from heavy defeats in recent European elections.",

But the plan would use the interest earned on the assets to help Ukraine\u00b4s war effort.\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves using profits from the roughly $260 billion in frozen Russian central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, to help Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. would issue Ukraine the $50 billion loan using windfall profits from the immobilized funds as collateral.\n\nLONDON - U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is announcing up to 242 million pounds (286 million euros or $310 million) in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine as Group of Seven leaders gather for a summit overshadowed by war.\n\nSunak is taking time out from the U.K. election campaign to attend Thursday's gathering in southern Italy.\n\nThe U.K. government says the money will go towards \"immediate humanitarian, energy and stabilization needs\" in Ukraine. Sunak has also thrown his support behind a plan to use interest from seized Russian assets to help Ukraine rebuild.\n\nSunak said the war is at a \"critical moment\" and Ukraine\u00b4s allies \"must move from 'as long as it takes\u00b4 to 'whatever it takes\u00b4 if we are to end this illegal war.\"\n\nThe U.K. has pledged 12.5 billion pounds to Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. That includes 7.6 billion pounds worth of military assistance.\n\nSunak is battling to keep his job after the U.K. election on July 4, with opinion polls putting his Conservatives far behind the opposition Labour Party. Labour leader Keir Starmer says he will keep up the United Kingdom's strong support for Ukraine if he becomes prime minister.\n\nWorkers give the last touch to the illumination set for the Patron Saint feast in Fasano, near Borgo Egnazia, southern Italy, Wednesday, June 12, 2024.

Choose the best entertainer in 15 categories for FREE.\n\nG7 leaders were set to agree on a new $50-billion loan for Ukraine as they gathered Thursday for a summit in southern Italy, using the profits from frozen Russian assets.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will join US President Joe Biden and leaders from Italy, Britain, France, Germany, Canada and Japan for the talks at the luxury Borgo Egnazia resort in Puglia.\n\nTop of the agenda is a plan for an urgent $50-billion loan to help Kyiv with defence, budgetary support and reconstruction after more than two years of war with Russia.\n\nThe loan would be secured against the future profits from interest on 300 billion euros ($325 billion) of Russian central bank assets frozen by Western allies.\n\n\"Good news from the G7: another $50 billion for Ukraine,\" German Finance Minister Christian Lindner wrote on X.\n\n\"We are using interest from frozen assets for this -- a smart instrument that shows (Russian President Vladimir) Putin our unity, greatly helps Ukraine and relieves the burden on budgets.\n\n\"Now we are working on the details.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron's office had on Wednesday said there was a deal on providing the money by the end of this year.\n\n\"We are on the verge of a good outcome here,\" US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Thursday, adding that the details still needed to be thrashed out.\n\nAhead of his arrival later in the day, Zelensky said he was expecting \"important decisions\" at the summit.\n\nHe also said he would sign two more security agreements with Japan and the United States in Puglia.\n\nThe G7 countries have been Ukraine's key military and financial backers since Russia invaded in February 2022.\n\nZelensky, who was due to hold a joint press conference with Biden later Thursday, has been engaged in a flurry of diplomacy aimed at boosting international support.\n\nHe spoke earlier this week in Berlin at a reconstruction conference and is set to join more than 90 countries and organisations this weekend for a peace summit in Switzerland.\n\nSullivan said the G7 leaders were aiming for a \"common vision\" on using the frozen assets.\n\n\"We have the major tentpoles of this decided but some of the specifics will be left to be worked through by experts on a defined timetable,\" he told reporters.\n\nThe European Union agreed earlier this year to use the profits from the frozen Russian assets for Ukraine, worth up to three billion euros a year.\n\nBut the idea at the G7 is to use this to provide more and faster help through a massive upfront loan.\n\nThe US this week also announced a raft of new sanctions aimed at constraining Moscow's war machine, while raising the stakes for foreign banks that still deal with Russia.\n\nThe summit comes at a time of extraordinary global turmoil.\n\nApart from the conflict in Ukraine, the Hamas-Israel conflict is raging and economic tensions are rising between China and Western countries.\n\nMany G7 countries are also in political flux. Everyone in Puglia is aware this could be Biden's last G7 summit if he loses to Donald Trump in November US elections.\n\nBritain's Rishi Sunak is tipped to be ousted in July 4 elections, while France's Macron and Germany's Olaf Scholz are both under pressure after gains by the far right in EU elections last weekend.\n\nBy contrast, meeting host Giorgia Meloni, Italy's prime minister, is riding high after her far-right party topped European Parliament elections last weekend.\n\nMeloni laughed and joked with her G7 counterparts as she welcomed them among the olive trees of the Borgo Egnazia resort on Thursday morning -- but had a serious message.\n\n\"The Group of Seven in recent decades has assumed an irreplaceable role in the management of global crises, especially those that jeopardise our freedom and our democracy,\" she told an opening session.\n\nThe talks began with short session on Africa, development and climate change, before turning to the Middle East.\n\nThe G7 leaders have already announced their support for a Gaza truce deal outlined by Biden, which would also see the release of hostages taken in Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel.\n\nAnother key issue in Puglia, to be discussed Friday, will be concerns about China's so-called \"industrial overcapacity\", particularly in green energy and technology sectors such as solar panels and electric vehicles.\n\nAround a dozen of non-G7 leaders have also been invited to Puglia for talks on Friday, including Jordan's King Abdullah II, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, UAE president Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed and India's Narendra Modi.", "source": {"uri": "legit.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Legit.ng - Nigeria news."}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@legit.ng", "name":

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nItaly is hosting the summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations in the wake of the European Parliament election, which saw a surge in support for the far right in places like G7 members France and Germany.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni also leads a far-right party but continues to hew to the center, particularly on foreign policy, which has made her a reassuring transatlantic partner amid Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe G7 summit through Saturday is focusing on global conflicts, the spread of artificial intelligence and on Africa issues, with a view in particular to Italy's longstanding concern about uncontrolled migration to Europe and human traffickers. Perennial issues such as climate change and China also will be discussed.\n\nThe G7 is an informal forum with an annual summit to discuss economic policy and security issues. The members are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Italy's Meloni will welcome the G7 summit fortified by an EU vote that shook French, German leaders\n\n-- In Italy's Puglia region, women take the lead in challenging the local mafia at great personal risk\n\n-- US pushes for Ukraine aid, united front against China's trade practices at G7 finance meeting\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nG7 leaders agree to lend Ukraine $50 billion using frozen Russian assets as collateral\n\nBARI, Italy -- Officials say the world's seven wealthiest democracies have agreed on lending Ukraine up to $50 billion using frozen Russian assets as collateral.\n\nDiplomats confirmed the agreement, which was struck before Thursday's start of the three-day G7 summit that brings together Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will also sign a bilateral security agreement during the summit.\n\nEuropean officials have resisted confiscating the assets, citing legal and financial stability concerns. But the plan would use the interest earned on the assets to help Ukraine's war effort.\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves using profits from the roughly $260 billion in frozen Russian central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, to help Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. would issue Ukraine the $50 billion loan using windfall profits from the immobilized funds as collateral.\n\nUnited Kingdom pledges $310 million in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine\n\nLONDON -- U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is announcing up to 242 million pounds (286 million euros or $310 million) in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine as Group of Seven leaders gather for a summit overshadowed by war.\n\nSunak is taking time out from the U.K. election campaign to attend Thursday's gathering in southern Italy.\n\nThe U.K. government says the money will go towards \"immediate humanitarian, energy and stabilization needs\" in Ukraine. Sunak has also thrown his support behind a plan to use interest from seized Russian assets to help Ukraine rebuild.\n\nSunak said the war is at a \"critical moment\" and Ukraine's allies \"must move from 'as long as it takes' to 'whatever it takes' if we are to end this illegal war.\"\n\nThe U.K. has pledged 12.5 billion pounds to Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. That includes 7.6 billion pounds worth of military assistance.\n\nSunak is battling to keep his job after the U.K. election on July 4, with opinion polls putting his Conservatives far behind the opposition Labour Party. Labour leader Keir Starmer says he will keep up the United Kingdom's strong support for Ukraine if he becomes prime minister.\n\nTown hosting G7 summit also a faux medieval venue for Hollywood elite\n\nBORGO EGNAZIA, Italy -- Madonna and the Beckhams have reportedly stayed there, and Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake got married there.\n\nBorgo Egnazia in Italy's southern Puglia region has certainly had its share of star power and on Thursday hosts another set of VIP guests: the leaders of the world's industrialized democracies.\n\nBut the venue for the Group of Seven summit is also something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors":

Biden departed for Italy on Wednesday to increase pressure on Russia over its war against Ukraine and on China for its support of Moscow and excess industrial capacity.\n\nThe agreement will make clear \"our support will last long into the future... particularly in the defense and security space,\" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One. \"By signing this we'll also be sending Russia a signal of our resolve. If Vladimir Putin thinks he can outlast the coalition supporting Ukraine, he's wrong,\" Sullivan said.\n\nFifteen countries have signed their own security agreements, which will strengthen Ukraine's \"defensive deterrence capability,\" he said. The U.S. agreement will include a commitment to working with the U.S. Congress on funding Ukraine going forward but will not commit to using U.S. forces on the ground, Sullivan added. The White House had said earlier that Biden will meet again with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the summit, followed by a joint press conference. The U.S. also expects Biden to meet India's Narendra Modi, who was sworn in as prime minister for a third term, and is waiting for India to formally confirm Modi's attendance at the summit.\n\nThe G7 leaders arrive at the summit confronting myriad woes at home even as they seek solutions for many of the world's most pressing problems. Biden, 81, spent Tuesday evening at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, after a 12-member jury convicted his son Hunter Biden of lying about his drug use to illegally buy a gun in 2018, making him the first child of a sitting U.S. president to be convicted of a crime.\n\nThe trial followed the May 30 criminal conviction of Republican former President Donald Trump, the first former U.S. president to be found guilty of a felony. Biden and Trump are running against each other in the November presidential election and are neck-and-neck in the polls. The heads of the world's most developed democracies will address multiple challenges during the June 13-15 meeting, including wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, trade imbalances with China, threats posed by artificial intelligence and development challenges in Africa.\n\nThe leaders will also announce new sanctions and export controls against Russia that target entities and networks helping Putin's forces fight the war in Ukraine. Efforts to curb Russia's growing war economy will be a major discussion topic, administration officials have said. The U.S. on Wednesday dramatically broadened sanctions on Russia, including by targeting China-based companies selling semiconductors to Moscow, as part of its effort to undercut the Russian military machine waging war on Ukraine.\n\nSeparately, the Commerce Department said it was targeting shell companies in Hong Kong for diverting semiconductors to Russia, taking steps that would affect nearly $100 million of high-priority items for Moscow including such chips. \"These actions heighten the risk for financial institutions dealing with Russia's war economy, slows down avenues for evasion while diminishes Russia's ability to benefit from access to foreign technology, equipment, software and IT services,\" Sullivan said.\n\nShoring up funding for Ukraine will be a top priority at the G7 meeting, with U.S. and European officials eager to lock in solutions, ahead of a possible Trump re-election and the uncertainty it would raise over future U.S. support for Kyiv. The Group of Seven nations and the European Union are considering how to use profits generated by Russian assets immobilized in the West to provide Ukraine with a large up-front loan to secure Kyiv's financing for 2025.\n\nThe White House's Sullivan said the U.S. is \"making good progress in generating an outcome in which those proceeds from those frozen assets can be put to good use.\" Biden will press other G7 leaders to agree to an innovative plan to use future interest on some $281 billion of Russian central bank funds to back up a $50 billion loan to Ukraine.\n\nG7 leaders also face electoral challenges, with polls indicating British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will likely lose power in a national vote next month, and the leaders of France and Germany reeling from heavy defeats in recent European elections.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

If Vladimir Putin thinks he can outlast the coalition supporting Ukraine, he's wrong,\" Sullivan said.\n\nFifteen countries have signed their own security agreements, which will strengthen Ukraine's \"defencive deterrence capability,\" he said. The US agreement will include a commitment to working with the US Congress on funding Ukraine going forward but will not commit to using US forces on the ground, Sullivan added.\n\nThe White House had said earlier that Biden will meet again with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the summit, followed by a joint press conference. The US also expects Biden to meet India's Narendra Modi, who was sworn in as prime minister for a third term, and is waiting for India to formally confirm Modi's attendance at the summit.\n\nThe G7 leaders arrive at the summit confronting myriad woes at home even as they seek solutions for many of the world's most pressing problems.\n\nBiden, 81, spent Tuesday evening at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, after a 12-member jury convicted his son Hunter Biden of lying about his drug use to illegally buy a gun in 2018, making him the first child of a sitting US president to be convicted of a crime.\n\nThe trial followed the May 30 criminal conviction of Republican former President Donald Trump, the first former US president to be found guilty of a felony. Biden and Trump are running against each other in the November presidential election and are neck-and-neck in the polls.\n\nThe heads of the world's most developed democracies will address multiple challenges during the June 13-15 meeting, including wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, trade imbalances with China, threats posed by artificial intelligence and development challenges in Africa.\n\nThe leaders will also announce new sanctions and export controls against Russia that target entities and networks helping Putin's forces fight the war in Ukraine. Efforts to curb Russia's growing war economy will be a major discussion topic, administration officials have said.\n\nThe US on Wednesday dramatically broadened sanctions on Russia, including by targeting China-based companies selling semiconductors to Moscow, as part of its effort to undercut the Russian military machine waging war on Ukraine.\n\nSeparately, the Commerce Department said it was targeting shell companies in Hong Kong for diverting semiconductors to Russia, taking steps that would affect nearly US$100 million (S$134 million) of high-priority items for Moscow including such chips.\n\n\"These actions heighten the risk for financial institutions dealing with Russia's war economy, slows down avenues for evasion while diminishes Russia's ability to benefit from access to foreign technology, equipment, software and IT services,\" Sullivan said.\n\nShoring up funding for Ukraine will be a top priority at the G7 meeting, with US and European officials eager to lock in solutions, ahead of a possible Trump re-election and the uncertainty it would raise over future US support for Kyiv.\n\nThe Group of Seven nations and the European Union are considering how to use profits generated by Russian assets immobilised in the West to provide Ukraine with a large up-front loan to secure Kyiv's financing for 2025.\n\nThe White House's Sullivan said the US is \"making good progress in generating an outcome in which those proceeds from those frozen assets can be put to good use.\"\n\nBiden will press other G7 leaders to agree to an innovative plan to use future interest on some US$281 billion of Russian central bank funds to back up a US$50 billion loan to Ukraine.\n\nG7 leaders also face electoral challenges, with polls indicating British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will likely lose power in a national vote next month, and the leaders of France and Germany reeling from heavy defeats in recent European elections.", "source": {"uri": "asiaone.com",

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be on hand and is expected to sign a separate bilateral security agreement with U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nBeyond the Ukraine war, Pope Francis will become the first pope to address a G7 summit, adding a dash of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering that is being held this year in Italy's sun-drenched Puglia region. He'll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Host Italy has invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Italy's Africa initiatives. Other guests include Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nFrozen Russian assets to support Ukraine\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves using profits from the roughly $260 billion in frozen Russian central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, to help Ukraine, and issuing a $50 billion loan from the U.S. government to Kyiv, using windfall profits from the immobilized funds as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen -- say if the war ends -- then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nOn the eve of the summit, Washington also sent strong signals of support for Ukraine, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nEurope's new political chessboard\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in weekend European Parliament elections than the 2022 elections that made her Italy's first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw the far-right Alternative for Germany beat out his Social Democrats.", "source": {"uri": "newindianexpress.com", "dataType": "news",

"body": "G7 leaders gather on Thursday (Jun 13) for the first day of an Italy summit, hoping to seal a deal on providing US$50 billion for Ukraine using frozen Russian assets.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will join US President Joe Biden and leaders from Italy, Britain, France, Germany, Canada and Japan at the luxury Borgo Egnazia resort in Puglia.\n\nThe G7 leaders hope to agree on an urgent US$50 billion loan to help Kyiv with defence, budgetary support and help for reconstruction after more than two years of war with Russia.\n\nThe loan would be secured against the future profits from interest on \u20ac300 billion (US$325 billion) of Russian central bank assets frozen by Western allies.\n\n\"We are on the verge of a good outcome here,\" US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said.\n\n\"Hopefully by the time that leaders meet today, we will have a common vision on the way forward,\" he told reporters ahead of the formal opening of the summit.\n\nBut he said delegations were still thrashing out the details, including how many countries would \"step up\" and the kind of financial vehicle involved.\n\n\"We have the major tentpoles of this decided but some of the specifics will be left to be worked through by experts on a defined timetable,\" he told reporters.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron's office on Wednesday said a deal had been agreed on providing US$50 billion for Ukraine before the end of the year, but said that technical details still needed to be finalised.\n\nThe European Union agreed earlier this year to use the profits from the frozen Russian assets for Ukraine, worth up to \u20ac3 billion a year.\n\nBut the idea at the G7 is to use this to provide more and faster help through a massive upfront loan.\n\nZelenskyy is attending the Puglia summit as part of a week of diplomatic efforts to rally support, which will culminate in an international conference on Ukraine in Switzerland this weekend.\n\nG7 nations are also expected to announce further bilateral support, with Biden and Zelenskyy due to sign a US-Ukraine security deal, and Britain announcing up to US$310 million for Kyiv.\n\nThe US this week announced a raft of new sanctions aimed at constraining Moscow's war machine while raising the stakes for foreign banks that still deal with Russia.", "source": {"uri": "channelnewsasia.com", "dataType": "news",

If Vladimir Putin thinks he can outlast the coalition supporting Ukraine, he's wrong,\" Sullivan said.\n\nFifteen countries have signed their own security agreements, which will strengthen Ukraine's \"defensive deterrence capability,\" he said. The U.S. agreement will include a commitment to working with the U.S. Congress on funding Ukraine going forward but will not commit to using U.S. forces on the ground, Sullivan added.\n\nThe White House had said earlier that Biden will meet again with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the summit, followed by a joint press conference. The U.S. also expects Biden to meet India's Narendra Modi, who was sworn in as prime minister for a third term and is waiting for India to formally confirm Modi's attendance at the summit.\n\nThe G7 leaders arrive at the summit confronting myriad problems at home even as they seek solutions for many of the world's most pressing problems.\n\nBiden, 81, spent Tuesday evening at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, after a 12-member jury convicted his son Hunter Biden of lying about his drug use to illegally buy a gun in 2018, making him the first child of a sitting U.S. president to be convicted of a crime.\n\nThe trial followed the May 30 criminal conviction of Republican former President Donald Trump, the first former U.S. president to be found guilty of a felony. Biden and Trump are running against each other in the November presidential election and are neck-and-neck in the polls.\n\nThe heads of the world's most developed democracies will address multiple challenges during the June 13-15 meeting, including wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, trade imbalances with China, threats posed by artificial intelligence and development challenges in Africa.\n\nThe leaders will also announce new sanctions and export controls against Russia that target entities and networks helping Putin's forces fight the war in Ukraine. Efforts to curb Russia's growing war economy will be a major discussion topic, administration officials have said.\n\nThe U.S. on Wednesday dramatically broadened sanctions on Russia, including by targeting China-based companies selling semiconductors to Moscow, as part of its effort to undercut the Russian military machine waging war on Ukraine.\n\nSeparately, the Commerce Department said it was targeting shell companies in Hong Kong for diverting semiconductors to Russia, taking steps that would affect nearly $100 million of high-priority items for Moscow including such chips.\n\n\"These actions heighten the risk for financial institutions dealing with Russia's war economy, slows down avenues for evasion while diminishes Russia's ability to benefit from access to foreign technology, equipment, software, and IT services,\" Sullivan said.\n\nShoring up funding for Ukraine will be a top priority at the G7 meeting, with U.S. and European officials eager to lock in solutions, ahead of a possible Trump re-election and the uncertainty it would raise over future U.S. support for Kyiv.\n\nThe Group of Seven nations and the European Union are considering how to use profits generated by Russian assets immobilized in the West to provide Ukraine with a large up-front loan to secure Kyiv's financing for 2025.\n\nThe White House's Sullivan said the U.S. is \"making good progress in generating an outcome in which those proceeds from those frozen assets can be put to good use.\"\n\nBiden will press other G7 leaders to agree to an innovative plan to use future interest on some $281 billion of Russian central bank funds to back up a $50 billion loan to Ukraine.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nG7 leaders also face electoral challenges, with polls indicating British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will likely lose power in a national vote next month, and the leaders of France and Germany reeling from heavy defeats in recent European elections.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "ndtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTV"},

Everyone in Puglia is aware this could be Mr Biden's last G7 summit if he loses to Donald Trump in November US elections.\n\nThe UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is tipped to be ousted on 4 July elections, while France's Mr Macron and Germany's Olaf Scholz are both under pressure after gains by the far right in EU elections last weekend.\n\nThe G7 summit opens with a short session on Africa, development and climate change, before turning to the Middle East.\n\nThe leaders have already announced their support for a Gaza truce deal outlined by Mr Biden, which would also see the release of hostages taken in Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel.\n\nJordan's King Abdullah II - a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause whose country signed a peace treaty with Israel 30 years ago - is among around a dozen non-G7 guests also attending who are not, however, participating in the working sessions.\n\nThey include Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, UAE president Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed and India's Narendra Modi.\n\nBrazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva - whose country holds the rotating G20 presidency this year - as well as Argentina's Javier Milei and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres also plan to attend.\n\nAll the guests are invited to a dinner on Friday night at the Borgo Egnazia luxury hotel complex, built in the style of a traditional village.\n\nWith security extremely tight, the venue is far away from protesters and journalists, with the media centre located some 60km away in Bari.\n\nAnother key issue in Puglia, to be discussed Friday, will be concerns about China's so-called \"industrial overcapacity\", particularly in green energy and technology sectors such as solar panels and electric vehicles.\n\nThe US, EU and Japan have all voiced concern that generous subsidies from Beijing are resulting in a flood of cheap goods hitting the global market, threatening Western firms.", "source": {"uri": "rte.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTE.ie"},

Zelensky to sign security agreement between US and Ukraine at summit", "body": "President Joe Biden and President Volodymyr Zelensky will sign a bilateral security agreement between the US and Ukraine on Thursday when they meet on the sidelines of the G7 summit.\n\nThe aim is to send a signal to Russia of American resolve over support for Kyiv, the White House said as Mr Biden headed to Italy.\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters that the agreement would not commit US troops directly to Ukraine's defence against Russia's invasion - a red line drawn by Mr Biden, who is fearful of being drawn into direct conflict between the nuclear-armed powers.\n\nMr Sullivan called the agreement a \"bridge\" to when Ukraine is invited to join the Nato alliance - a long-term priority of Mr Zelensky's that the allies have said will first require an end to the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nMr Biden heads to the summit of the world's leading democracies with an urgency to get big things done, including turning frozen Russian assets into billions of dollars to help Ukraine as it fights off Russian President Vladimir Putin's war machine.\n\nThis year's G7 summit comes three years after Mr Biden declared at his first such gathering that America was back as a global leader following the disruptions to western alliances that occurred when Donald Trump was president.\n\nNow, there is a chance this gathering could be the final G7 for Mr Biden and other G7 leaders, depending on the results of elections this year.\n\nPope Francis, Mr Zelensky and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are joining the gathering at the Borgo Egnazia resort in the Puglia region of southern Italy.\n\nThe summit, which opens on Thursday, will play out after far-right parties across the continent secured gains of surprising scale in just-concluded European Union elections.\n\nThose victories, coupled with upcoming elections in the UK, France and the US, have rattled the global political establishment and added weightiness to this year's summit.\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to US and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Centre, an international affairs think tank.\n\n\"We don't know what the

Everyone in Puglia is aware this could be Biden's last G7 summit if he loses to Donald Trump in November US elections.\n\nBritain's Rishi Sunak is tipped to be ousted in July 4 elections, while France's Macron and Germany's Olaf Scholz are both under pressure after gains by the far right in EU elections last weekend.\n\nThe G7 summit opens Thursday morning with a short session on Africa, development and climate change, before turning to the Middle East.\n\nThe leaders have already announced their support for a Gaza truce deal outlined by Biden, which would also see the release of hostages taken in Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel.\n\nJordan's King Abdullah II - a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause whose country signed a peace treaty with Israel 30 years ago - is among around a dozen non-G7 guests also attending who are not, however, participating in the working sessions.\n\nThey include Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, UAE president Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed

Antonio Guterres also plan to attend.\n\nREAD MORE | China wants BRICS to do more as Western sanctions mount\n\nAll the guests are invited to a dinner Friday night at the Borgo Egnazia luxury hotel

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\n\"We want to demonstrate that the U.S. supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them and that we'll continue to help address their security needs,\" Sullivan said, adding \"this agreement will show our resolve.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSullivan called the agreement a \"bridge\" to when Ukraine is invited to join the NATO alliance -- a long-term priority of Zelenskyy's that the allies have said will first require an end to the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden headed to Italy on Wednesday for a summit of the world's leading democracies with an urgency to get big things done, including turning frozen Russian assets into billions of dollars to help Ukraine as it fights off Russian President Vladimir Putin's war machine.\n\nThis year's Group of Seven summit comes three years after Biden declared at his first such gathering that America was back as a global leader following the disruptions to Western alliances that occurred when Donald Trump was president. Now, there's a chance this gathering could be the final G7 for Biden and other G7 leaders, depending on the results of elections this year.\n\nBiden and his counterparts from Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan will use the summit to discuss challenges related to the spread of artificial intelligence, migration, the Russian military's resurgence and China's economic might, among other topics. Pope Francis, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are joining the gathering at the Borgo Egnazia resort in the Puglia region of southern Italy.\n\nThe summit, which opens Thursday, will play out after far-right parties across the continent racked up gains of surprising scale in just-concluded European Union elections. Those victories, coupled with upcoming elections in the United Kingdom, France and the United States, have rattled the global political establishment and added weightiness to this year's summit.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to U.S. and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center, an international affairs think tank. \"We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\"\n\nThe G7 is an informal bloc of industrialized democracies that meets annually to discuss shared issues and concerns. Biden is set to arrive in Italy on Wednesday night, his second trip outside the U.S. in as many weeks. The Democratic president was in France last week for a state visit in Paris and ceremonies in Normandy marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in World War II.\n\nWhile last week's visit had a celebratory feel, this one will be dominated by pressing global issues, including how to keep financial support flowing to Ukraine as it fights Russia's invasion. Biden's trip also comes one day after his son Hunter was convicted on federal gun charges, a blow sure to weigh heavily on the president's mind.\n\nDespite pressing global challenges, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said there is still a sense of relief among world leaders in 2024 that \"America was back,\" referencing Biden's 2021 speech at the G7 in Cornwall, England.\n\n\"Biden's message then was that democracies need to step up and show they can deliver for their people,\" Kirby said. \"That's true now more than ever.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nKirby said the U.S. was prepared to work with democratically elected officials in the EU no matter who they are, though some of those being elevated have expressed far less support for Ukraine than current leaders.\n\n\"We have every confidence that regardless of who fills the seats in the European Parliament, we're going to continue to work closely with our EU partners on all the issues relative to our shared interests across the European continent,\" Kirby said. \"That includes supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden and Zelenskyy, who met last week in Paris, will meet again Thursday on the sidelines of the summit to discuss continued support for the Eastern European nation, which is trying to fend off an intense Russian offensive in eastern areas of the country. They are expected to hold a joint news conference. Biden is also expected to meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the pope and other leaders.\n\nBiden, who has been adamant that \"we will not walk away\" from Ukraine, last week publicly apologized to Zelenskyy for a monthslong delay by Congress in authorizing additional American military assistance. The delay allowed Russia to make gains on the battlefield.\n\nBiden's back-to-back trips to France and Italy amount to a rare doubleheader of diplomacy in the midst of the presidential election. The president will skip a Ukraine peace conference in Switzerland this weekend to jet to Los Angeles for a campaign fundraiser with big names from Hollywood. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the U.S. at the conference.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDespite the delays in military aid, the Biden administration on Tuesday announced it would send Ukraine another Patriot missile system to help fend off Russian strikes, two U.S. officials told The Associated Press. Biden approved the move, the officials told the AP, as Kyiv has desperately called for more air defenses in its battle against an intense Russian assault on the northeastern Kharkiv region.\n\nKirby said the U.S. would use the G7 summit to announce fresh sanctions and export control actions targeting those who have helped Russia procure what it needs for the war. He said the new measures would make it harder for financiers to support Russia's defense mechanism.\n\nUkraine and many of its supporters have called for the confiscation of $260 billion in Russian assets frozen outside the country after the Feb. 24, 2022, invasion. But European officials have resisted, citing legal and financial stability concerns. Most of the frozen assets are located in Europe.\n\nA European plan to just use the interest on the Russian funds would provide only a trickle of money every year -- about $2.5 billion to $3 billion at current interest rates, which would barely meet a month's financing needs for the Ukrainian government.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said recently that G7 finance ministers have been discussing the possibility of extending a loan to Ukraine and using the windfall profits of assets seized in Europe to pay it off.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nKirby said the U.S. was optimistic the group could agree on the matter.\n\nBiden is also expected to discuss economic concerns brought on by Chinese manufacturing overcapacity, how to use artificial intelligence in a way that maximizes benefits but still manages national security risks, and global migration.\n\nThe U.S. and other G7 nations are struggling to manage large influxes of migrants arriving for complicated reasons that include war, climate change and drought. Migration, and how nations cope with the growing numbers at their borders, has been a factor driving the far-right rise in some of Europe.\n\n___\n\nSuperville reported from Bari, Italy.", "source":

Amid his son Hunter's recent legal troubles, Biden aims to solidify international sanctions and support for Ukraine, amidst electoral challenges in key G7 nations.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden departed for Italy on Wednesday to meet with Group of Seven leaders in an effort to increase pressure on Russia over its war against Ukraine and on China for its support of Moscow and excess industrial capacity. The G7 leaders arrive at the summit confronting myriad woes at home even as they seek solutions for many of the world's most pressing problems.\n\nBiden, 81, spent Tuesday evening at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, after a 12-member jury convicted his son Hunter Biden of lying about his drug use to illegally buy a gun in 2018, making him the first child of a sitting U.S. president to be convicted of a crime. The trial followed the May 30 criminal conviction of Republican former President Donald Trump, the first former U.S. president to be found guilty of a felony. Biden and Trump are running against each other in the November presidential election and are neck-and-neck in the polls.\n\nThe heads of the world's most developed democracies will address multiple challenges during the June 13-15 meeting, including wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, trade imbalances with China, threats posed by artificial intelligence and development challenges in Africa. The leaders will announce new sanctions and export controls against Russia that target entities and networks helping President Vladimir Putin's forces fight the war in Ukraine, White House spokesperson John Kirby said on Tuesday.\n\n\"We're going to continue to drive up costs for the Russian war machine,\" Kirby said. Washington plans to widen sanctions on the sale of semiconductor chips and other goods to Russia, with the goal of targeting third-party sellers in China, sources familiar with the plans said late on Tuesday.\n\nThe administration will announce it is broadening existing export controls to include U.S.-branded goods, not just those made in the United States, the sources said. It will identify certain Hong Kong entities it says are shipping goods to Moscow. Shoring up funding for Ukraine will be a top priority at the G7 meeting, with U.S. and European officials eager to lock in solutions, ahead of a possible Trump re-election and the uncertainty it would raise over future U.S. support for Kyiv.\n\nThe Group of Seven nations and the European Union are considering how to use profits generated by Russian assets immobilized in the West to provide Ukraine with a large up-front loan to secure Kyiv's financing for 2025. \"We will announce new steps to unlock the value of the immobilized Russian sovereign assets to benefit Ukraine and to help them recover from the destruction that Mr. Putin's army has caused,\" Kirby said.\n\nBiden will press other G7 leaders to agree to an innovative plan to use future interest on some $281 billion of Russian central bank funds to back up a $50 billion loan to Ukraine. G7 leaders also face electoral challenges, with polls indicating British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will likely to lose power in a national vote next month, and the leaders of France and Germany reeling from heavy defeats in recent European elections.\n\nBiden will meet again with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, followed by a joint press conference, Kirby said.\n\n(This story has not

He'll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Italy, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Italy's development and migration initiatives on the continent.\n\nOther guests include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nFrozen Russian assets to support Ukraine\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves engineering a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia that would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen -- say if the war ends -- then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nIn addition to the deal, Sunak announced up to 242 million pounds (286 million euros or $310 million) in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine for humanitarian, energy and stabilization needs. Washington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nEurope's new political chessboard\n\nMeloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy's first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nAs a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\nA French official, speaking anonymously in line with Macron's office customary practices, said there were diverging views with Italian negotiators on some topics, including on sexual and reproductive health and vaccines.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed abortion was being discussed, but said discussions were continuing.\n\n\"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 Summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit,\" said Nick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a nonexploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nThe pope and artificial intelligence\n\nPope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasizing the grave and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector, which has been a frequent focus of the Jesuit pope who has called even traditional weapons makers \"merchants of death.\"\n\nBut Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.\n\nIt's happening where?\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it will be sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and Carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nAs with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. One group is staging a \"dinner for the poor\" on Friday night calling for \"peace, the rights of peoples and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.\"\n\n___\n\nNicole Winfield reported from Bari.

Several other heads of state at the summit also face uncertain political futures.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called an election for July 4 that polls show he is likely to lose. French President Emmanuel Macron called for a snap election in the French Parliament after his party was badly defeated by Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally party early this month in the European Parliament elections.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition also lost to a far-right party in the EU elections. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's party is mired in a political fundraising scandal, and Kishida is down in the polls ahead of his bid for reelection in September.\n\n\"This is not a normal G7\" summit, said Josh Lipsky, the senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center. \"Several of the leaders are facing election, so it will look very different the next time this group gets together.\"\n\nUkraine will be at the center of the discussion at the summit, which will take place at a luxury resort on the Adriatic Sea in southern Italy.\n\nBiden's case for staying the course will be bolstered by the recent passage in Congress of a large security package for Ukraine, and a decision by the administration to allow Kyiv to use some U.S. weapons to strike limited targets inside Russia.\n\n\"He can take credit for that, but given where the situation is in Ukraine it's a bit too soon to say mission accomplished or to claim victory,\" said Thomas Graham, a former senior Russia adviser on the National Security Council.\n\nBiden and his G7 allies are expected to make new pronouncements of international support for Ukraine. The Biden administration is planning to announce plans to unlock frozen Russian assets that would help pay for Ukraine's reconstruction, according to White House officials. Biden and President Volodymyr Zelensky are also scheduled to hold a press conference Thursday at the summit.\n\n\"Our commitment to Ukraine will continue to be right up front and clear,\" at the summit, National Security communications adviser John Kirby told reporters on a call previewing the summit. \"We will take bold steps to show Mr. Putin that time is not on his side and that he cannot outlast us.\"\n\nStill, it's unlikely that the summit will result in any concrete agreements that would swiftly change the contours of the war, Graham and others said.\n\n\"[Biden's] policy seems pretty clear that he doesn't want Ukraine to lose, but also increasingly clear he doesn't want to do what it takes to allow Ukraine to win,\" John Bolton, a former national security adviser in the Trump administration, told Newsweek.\n\nUkraine has started to receive the military aid that U.S. lawmakers approved earlier this year following a months-long debate in Congress. Kyiv is preparing to defend against a potential new Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine.\n\nBut Biden said last week that the funding delay weakened Ukraine on the battlefield. The remarks, during a trip to France to commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-Day, represented an acknowledgment by the president that electoral politics in the U.S. were impacting his ability to conduct foreign policy.\n\nThe aid to Ukraine was held up by a small group of conservative Trump allies in Congress who share the former president's vision of America's role in the world.\n\nAs a 2024 candidate, Trump has said he would encourage Russia to \"do whatever the hell they want\" to NATO members that don't meet their defense spending obligations. Trump also vowed to end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours without providing any details.\n\nTrump and Biden's foreign policy differences on other issues beyond Ukraine will also form part of the political backdrop to the G7 summit.\n\nTrump took an aggressive stance on trade with China, imposing steep tariffs on steel and other Chinese imports. Biden has kept some of those measures in place, while also calling at times for a less combative approach to dealing with China on matters of trade and economic policy.\n\nThe G7 leaders issued a joint statement at the 2023 summit in Japan expressing concern over China's use of economic coercion to wield influence in developing countries. But Biden and his allies were careful not to criticize China directly, in a sign of the tense relations between the West and Beijing.\n\nTension with China may be unavoidable at the summit this year, even though China won't be represented at the summit despite having one of the world's largest economies.\n\nThe leaders of Brazil, India and Turkey have been invited to attend as observer nations, a move widely interpreted as an effort by the G7 nations to isolate China on the world stage.\n\n\"If you're China it's pretty hard to look at these meetings as anything other than an anti-China block,\" said Rachel Rizzo, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas conflict will also be on the G7 agenda. The summit takes place as the U.S. and others urge both sides to reach a ceasefire agreement to end the fighting in Gaza.\n\nHamas on Tuesday said it submitted a response seeking some \"amendments\" to the latest ceasefire proposal. The U.S. said it was evaluating the group's response.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_bush@newsweek.com", "name": "Daniel

Now, there's a chance this gathering could be the final G7 for Biden and other G7 leaders, depending on the results of elections this year.\n\nBiden and his counterparts from Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan will use the summit to discuss challenges related to the spread of artificial intelligence, migration, the Russian military's resurgence and China's economic might, among other topics. Pope Francis, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan are joining the gathering at the Borgo Egnazia resort in the Puglia region of southern Italy.\n\nThe summit, which opens Thursday, will play out after far-right parties across the continent racked up gains of surprising scale in just-concluded European Union elections. Those victories, coupled with upcoming elections in the United Kingdom, France and the United States, have rattled the global political establishment and added weightiness to this year's summit.\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to U.S. and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center, an international affairs think tank. \"We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\"\n\nThe G7 is an informal bloc of industrialized democracies that meets annually to discuss shared issues and concerns. Biden is set to arrive in Italy on Wednesday night, his second trip outside the U.S. in as many weeks. The Democratic president was in France last week for a state visit in Paris and ceremonies in Normandy marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in World War II.", "source": {"uri":

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is on hand and is expected to sign a separate bilateral security agreement with U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nBeyond the the war in Ukraine, Pope Francis will become the first pope to address a G7 summit, adding a dash of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering that is being held this year in Italy's sun-drenched Puglia region. He'll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Italy, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Italy's development and migration initiatives on the continent.\n\nOther guests include Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nFrozen Russian assets to support Ukraine\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves engineering a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia that would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen -- say if the war ends -- then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nIn addition to the deal, Sunak announced up to $310 million in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine for humanitarian, energy and stabilization needs. Washington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nEurope's new political chessboard\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy's first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nAs a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\nA French official, speaking anonymously in line with Macron's office customary practices, said there were diverging views with Italian negotiators on some topics, including on sexual and reproductive health and vaccines.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed abortion was being discussed, but said discussions were continuing.\n\n\"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 Summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit,\" said Nick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a nonexploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nThe pope and artificial intelligence\n\nPope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasizing the grave and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector, which has been a frequent focus of the Jesuit pope who has called even traditional weapons makers \"merchants of death.\"\n\nBut Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.\n\nIt's happening where?\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it will be sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and Carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nAs with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. One group is staging a \"dinner for the poor\" on Friday night calling for \"peace, the rights of peoples and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.\"",

If Vladimir Putin thinks he can outlast the coalition supporting Ukraine, he's wrong,\" Sullivan said.\n\nFifteen countries have signed their own security agreements, which will strengthen Ukraine's \"defensive deterrence capability,\" he said. The U.S. agreement will include a commitment to working with the U.S. Congress on funding Ukraine going forward but will not commit to using U.S. forces on the ground, Sullivan added.\n\nThe White House had said earlier that Biden will meet again with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the summit, followed by a joint press conference. The U.S. also expects Biden to meet India's Narendra Modi, who was sworn in as prime minister for a third term, and is waiting for India to formally confirm Modi's attendance at the summit.\n\nThe G7 leaders arrive at the summit confronting myriad woes at home even as they seek solutions for many of the world's most pressing problems.\n\nBiden, 81, spent Tuesday evening at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, after a 12-member jury convicted his son Hunter Biden of lying about his drug use to illegally buy a gun in 2018, making him the first child of a sitting U.S. president to be convicted of a crime.\n\nThe trial followed the May 30 criminal conviction of Republican former President Donald Trump, the first former U.S. president to be found guilty of a felony. Biden and Trump are running against each other in the November presidential election and are neck-and-neck in the polls.\n\nThe heads of the world's most developed democracies will address multiple challenges during the June 13-15 meeting, including wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, trade imbalances with China, threats posed by artificial intelligence and development challenges in Africa.\n\nThe leaders will also announce new sanctions and export controls against Russia that target entities and networks helping Putin's forces fight the war in Ukraine. Efforts to curb Russia's growing war economy will be a major discussion topic, administration officials have said.\n\nThe U.S. on Wednesday dramatically broadened sanctions on Russia, including by targeting China-based companies selling semiconductors to Moscow, as part of its effort to undercut the Russian military machine waging war on Ukraine.\n\nSeparately, the Commerce Department said it was targeting shell companies in Hong Kong for diverting semiconductors to Russia, taking steps that would affect nearly $100 million of high-priority items for Moscow including such chips.\n\n\"These actions heighten the risk for financial institutions dealing with Russia's war economy, slows down avenues for evasion while diminishes Russia's ability to benefit from access to foreign technology, equipment, software and IT services,\" Sullivan said.\n\nShoring up funding for Ukraine will be a top priority at the G7 meeting, with U.S. and European officials eager to lock in solutions, ahead of a possible Trump re-election and the uncertainty it would raise over future U.S. support for Kyiv.\n\nThe Group of Seven nations and the European Union are considering how to use profits generated by Russian assets immobilized in the West to provide Ukraine with a large up-front loan to secure Kyiv's financing for 2025.\n\nThe White House's Sullivan said the U.S. is \"making good progress in generating an outcome in which those proceeds from those frozen assets can be put to good use.\"\n\nBiden will press other G7 leaders to agree to an innovative plan to use future interest on some $281 billion of Russian central bank funds to back up a $50 billion loan to Ukraine.\n\nG7 leaders also face electoral challenges, with polls indicating British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will likely lose power in a national vote next month, and the leaders of France and Germany reeling from heavy defeats in recent European elections.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news",

If Vladimir Putin thinks he can outlast the coalition supporting Ukraine, he's wrong,\" Sullivan said.\n\nFifteen countries have signed the security agreement, which will strengthen Ukraine's \"defensive deterrence capability,\" he added.\n\nThe White House had said earlier Biden will meet again with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at the summit, followed by a joint press conference.\n\nThe G7 leaders arrive at the summit confronting myriad woes at home even as they seek solutions for many of the world's most pressing problems.\n\nBiden, 81, spent Tuesday evening at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, after a 12-member jury convicted his son Hunter Biden of lying about his drug use to illegally buy a gun in 2018, making him the first child of a sitting U.S. president to be convicted of a crime.\n\nThe trial followed the May 30 criminal conviction of Republican former President Donald Trump, the first former U.S. president to be found guilty of a felony. Biden and Trump are running against each other in the November presidential election and are neck-and-neck in the polls.\n\nThe heads of the world's most developed democracies will address multiple challenges during the June 13-15 meeting, including wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, trade imbalances with China, threats posed by artificial intelligence and development challenges in Africa.\n\nThe leaders will also announce new sanctions and export controls against Russia that target entities and networks helping Putin's forces fight the war in Ukraine, White House spokesperson John Kirby said on Tuesday.\n\n\"We're going to continue to drive up costs for the Russian war machine,\" Kirby said.\n\nWashington plans to widen sanctions on the sale of semiconductor chips and other goods to Russia, with the goal of targeting third-party sellers in China, sources familiar with the plans said late on Tuesday.\n\nThe administration will announce it is broadening existing export controls to include U.S.-branded goods, not just those made in the United States, the sources said. It will identify certain Hong Kong entities it says are shipping goods to Moscow.\n\nShoring up funding for Ukraine will be a top priority at the G7 meeting, with U.S. and European officials eager to lock in solutions, ahead of a possible Trump re-election and the uncertainty it would raise over future U.S. support for Kyiv.\n\nThe Group of Seven nations and the European Union are considering how to use profits generated by Russian assets immobilized in the West to provide Ukraine with a large up-front loan to secure Kyiv's financing for 2025.\n\n\"We will announce new steps to unlock the value of the immobilized Russian sovereign assets to benefit Ukraine and to help them recover from the destruction that Mr. Putin's army has caused,\" Kirby said.\n\nBiden will press other G7 leaders to agree to an innovative plan to use future interest on some $281 billion of Russian central bank funds to back up a $50 billion loan to Ukraine.\n\nG7 leaders also face electoral challenges, with polls indicating British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will likely lose power in a national vote next month, and the leaders of France and Germany reeling from heavy defeats in recent European elections.\n\n(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Additional reporting by Jarrett Renshaw; Editing by Leslie Adler, Christopher Cushing and Chizu Nomiyama)", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType":

A Group of Seven summit aiming to consolidate support for Ukraine opens Thursday under a vastly different political landscape than even a few days ago, after European Parliament elections jolted the leaders [...]\n\nBARI, Italy (AP) -- A Group of Seven summit is opening Thursday with agreement on a U.S. proposal to back a $50 billion loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral, giving Kyiv a strong show of support even as Europe's political chessboard shifts to the right.\n\nDiplomats confirmed that an agreement had been reached on the deal before the leaders even landed in southern Italy for the three-day summit. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be on hand and is expected to sign a separate bilateral security agreement with U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nBeyond the Ukraine war, Pope Francis will become the first pope to address a G7 summit, adding a dash of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering that is being held this year in Italy's sun-drenched Puglia region. He'll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Host Italy has invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Italy's Africa initiatives. Other guests include Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nFrozen Russian assets to support Ukraine\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves using profits from the roughly $260 billion in frozen Russian central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, to help Ukraine, and issuing a $50 billion loan from the U.S. government to Kyiv, using windfall profits from the immobilized funds as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen -- say if the war ends -- then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nOn the eve of the summit, Washington also sent strong signals of support for Ukraine, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nEurope's new political chessboard\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in weekend European Parliament elections than the 2022 elections that made her Italy's first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw the far-right Alternative for Germany beat out his Social Democrats.\n\nAs a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One reported sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\n\"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 Summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit,\" said Nick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a non-exploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nItaly, which for decades has been ground zero in Europe's migration debate, has been promoting its Mattei Plan as a way to create jobs and opportunity in Africa and discourage its young people from making dangerous trips across the Mediterranean Sea. The plan involves pilot projects in areas such as education, health care, water, sanitation, agriculture and energy infrastructure.\n\nThe pope and artificial intelligence\n\nPope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasizing the grave and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector, which has been a frequent focus of the Jesuit pope who has called even traditional weapons makers \"merchants of death.\"\n\nBut Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.\n\nThe 87-year-old pope has said he would also repeat his calls for peace while holding a half-dozen bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the summit.\n\nIt's happening where?\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it will be sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nAs with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. One group is staging a \"dinner for the poor\" on Friday night calling for \"peace, the rights of peoples and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Angela Charlton and Sylvie Corbet in Paris contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"},

Russian assets for Ukraine", "body": "The G7 summit in Italy opened on Thursday with agreement reached on a US proposal to back a 50 billion dollar (\u00a339 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral, giving Kyiv a strong show of support even as Europe's political chessboard shifts to the right.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni welcomed the G7 heads of state to the summit at a luxury resort in Borgo Egnazia in southern Italy, saying she wanted the message of the meeting to be one of dialogue with the global south and unity.\n\nShe likened the G7 to the ancient olive trees that are a symbol of the Puglia region, \"with their solid roots, and branches projected toward the future\".\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to sign a separate bilateral security agreement with US President Joe Biden.\n\nBeyond the the war in Ukraine, Pope Francis will become the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, adding a dash of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering.\n\nHe will be speaking on Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe G7 comprises Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nItaly, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders - Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied - to press Italy's development and migration initiatives on the continent.\n\nOther guests include Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Mr Biden, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure is on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nThe US proposal involves engineering a 50 billion dollar (\u00a339 billion) loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia which would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters on Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders has been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still have to be worked out.\n\nThe issue is complicated because if the Russian assets are eventually unfrozen - for example, if the war ends - then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nIn addition to the deal, Mr Sunak announced up to \u00a3242 million (310 million dollars) in non-military aid to Ukraine for humanitarian, energy and stabilization needs.\n\nWashington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy's first female premier.\n\nKnown for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, did not fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote.\n\nMr Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nAs a result, Ms Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said.\n\nIn one sign of her flexed far-right muscles, Ms Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy is trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\nA French official said there are diverging views with Italian negotiators on some topics, including on sexual and reproductive health and vaccines.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed abortion is being discussed, but said talks are continuing.\n\nNick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council, said: \"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit.\"\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as she seeks to leverage her programme for a non-exploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.", "source": {"uri": "newsandstar.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

The US presidential election is looming in November, with Biden locked in a tough race against former president Donald Trump.\n\nUK elections are set for July 4, with Rishi Sunak expected to be unseated as prime minister and his Conservative party likely to lose to Labour for the first time in 14 years.\n\nMeanwhile, last week's EU elections delivered a surge in far-right parties in France and Germany that dealt heavy blows to German chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron, who called for snap parliamentary elections starting later this month.\n\nAn agreement on delivering additional support for Ukraine using the frozen assets would be a sign that G7 leaders remained united in their defence of Kyiv as well as their broader foreign policy priorities, western officials said.\n\nG7 countries have been struggling to get Israel and Hamas to agree on a ceasefire deal that would pave the way for an end to the conflict in the Middle East, which will also be a focus of discussions in Puglia.\n\nBut the talks on Ukraine and Russia -- including on the frozen assets -- will dominate the summit. It comes amid persistent pleas from the Ukrainian leadership for western allies to provide more military support to Kyiv as it fights a renewed Russian bid to capture territory in the east of the country.\n\nSullivan said a deal on the frozen assets would involve a framework that is \"quite specific in terms of what it would entail\". But he added that \"experts\" would have to settle on \"the core operational details of anything that is agreed in Italy\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009on a defined timeframe\".\n\n\"We're still arguing over the technicalities, and mainly for it to work along our lines,\" said a senior EU official. \"At some point the residual risk needs to be covered by someone.\"\n\nEU member state diplomats in Brussels said that the bloc, which holds the overwhelming majority of the Russian sovereign assets frozen by western countries in the days following Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, would not agree to take on financial risks for other countries.\n\nBrussels could not give a cast-iron guarantee to the US that its sanctions -- which collect profits on the Russian assets worth about \u20ac3bn a year and must be rolled over each six months -- would remain in place indefinitely, and thus each country would need to assume a slice of the risk.\n\nWhile there is broad agreement on the total $50bn package, there is no agreement on how the individual slices would be calculated, with some officials arguing that it should be based on GDP, while others suggest a division based on the relative amount of immobilised assets each G7 member holds on its territory.\n\nThe World Bank is expected to play a role in the disbursement of the US slice of the loan package, said two people familiar with the talks.\n\nDespite their differences, leaders were determined to strike a deal in Puglia, where Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be participating.\n\n\"We have to front-load this because Ukraine needs the money now, not in 10 years or 20 years,\" said the senior EU official, who added this would be \"focusing on defence, filling financial [budget] gaps and funding reconstruction\".\n\nBiden is expected to meet Zelenskyy separately at the summit to sign a bilateral US-Ukraine security agreement designed to deepen the defence co-operation between the two countries.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 5,

deal to use frozen Russian assets for Ukraine", "body": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to sign a separate bilateral security agreement with US President Joe Biden.\n\nThe G7 summit in Italy was opening on Thursday with an agreement on a US proposal to back a 50 billion dollar (\u00a339 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral, giving Kyiv a strong show of support even as Europe's political chessboard shifts to the right.\n\nDiplomats confirmed an agreement had been reached on the deal before the leaders even landed for the three-day gathering.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to sign a separate bilateral security agreement with US President Joe Biden.\n\nBeyond the the war in Ukraine, Pope Francis will become the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, adding a dash of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering that is being held this year in Borgo Egnazia in southern Italy's sun-drenched Puglia region.\n\nHe will be speaking on Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe G7 comprises Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nItaly, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders - Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied - to press Italy's development and migration initiatives on the continent.\n\nOther guests include Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Mr Biden, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure is on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nThe US proposal involves engineering a 50 billion dollar (\u00a339 billion) loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia which would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters on Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders has been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still have to be worked out.\n\nThe issue is complicated because if the Russian assets are eventually unfrozen - for example, if the war ends - then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nIn addition to the deal, Mr Sunak announced up to \u00a3242 million (310 million dollars) in non-military aid to Ukraine for humanitarian, energy and stabilization needs.\n\nWashington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy's first female premier.\n\nKnown for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, did not fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote.\n\nMr Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nAs a result, Ms Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said.\n\nIn one sign of her flexed far-right muscles, Ms Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy is trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\nA French official said there are diverging views with Italian negotiators on some topics, including on sexual and reproductive health and vaccines.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed abortion is being discussed, but said talks are continuing.\n\nNick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council, said: \"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit.\"\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as she seeks to leverage her programme for a non-exploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish News"},

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be on hand and is expected to sign a separate bilateral security agreement with U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nBeyond the Ukraine war, Pope Francis will become the first pope to address a G7 summit, adding a dash of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering that is being held this year in Italy's sun-drenched Puglia region. He'll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Host Italy has invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Italy's Africa initiatives. Other guests include Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nFrozen Russian assets to support Ukraine\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves using profits from the roughly $260 billion in frozen Russian central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, to help Ukraine, and issuing a $50 billion loan from the U.S. government to Kyiv, using windfall profits from the immobilized funds as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen -- say if the war ends -- then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nOn the eve of the summit, Washington also sent strong signals of support for Ukraine, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nEurope's new political chessboard\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in weekend European Parliament elections than the 2022 elections that made her Italy's first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw the far-right Alternative for Germany beat out his Social Democrats.\n\nAs a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One reported sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\n\"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 Summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit,\" said Nick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a non-exploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nItaly, which for decades has been ground zero in Europe's migration debate, has been promoting its Mattei Plan as a way to create jobs and opportunity in Africa and discourage its young people from making dangerous trips across the Mediterranean Sea. The plan involves pilot projects in areas such as education, health care, water, sanitation, agriculture and energy infrastructure.\n\nThe pope and artificial intelligence\n\nPope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasizing the grave and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector, which has been a frequent focus of the Jesuit pope who has called even traditional weapons makers \"merchants of death.\"\n\nBut Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.\n\nThe 87-year-old pope has said he would also repeat his calls for peace while holding a half-dozen bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the summit.\n\nIt's happening where?\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it will be sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nAs with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. One group is staging a \"dinner for the poor\" on Friday night calling for \"peace, the rights of peoples and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.\"",

Once that was passed, negotiations were accelerated.\n\nThe agreement states that the U.S. intends to work with Congress over the coming months to find a path to sustainable resources for Ukraine.\n\nMORE: Exclusive: Biden tells Muir US weapons will not be used to strike Moscow, Kremlin\n\nThe agreement does not include any commitment to use U.S. forces to defend Ukraine. It will outline a vision of how the U.S. and its allies will work with Ukraine to strengthen its defenses and deter future aggression from Russia.\n\nThe pledge will be similar to bilateral agreements that Ukraine has already signed with more than a dozen other countries.\n\n\"If Vladimir Putin thinks he can outlast the coalition supporting Ukraine, he's wrong,\" Sullivan added. \"He cannot just wait us out.\"\n\nZelenskyy and Biden will meet Thursday on the sidelines of the G7 and will hold a joint news conference.\n\nBiden, Zelenskyy to sign US-Ukraine security agreement at G7 summit originally appeared on abcnews.go.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(meeting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summit (meeting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Sullivan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake Sullivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bari", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bari"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bari"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Signs_and_Signals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Signs and Signals", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Advisories_and_Patches", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Advisories and Patches", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/FAQs,_Help,_and_Tutorials", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/FAQs, Help, and Tutorials", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lVcZBXGucjigOv14_Y7n6Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_abc_news_articles_665/2a82c5d298e3b2c77238facab59dc144", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644722", "eventUri": "eng-9644722", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-06-", "textStart": 82, "textEnd": 89}], "sentiment": 0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

frozen Russian assets for Ukraine | BreakingNews.ie", "body": "The G7 summit in Italy opened on Thursday with agreement reached on a US proposal to back a $50 billion loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral, giving Kyiv a strong show of support even as Europe's political chessboard shifts to the right.\n\nItalian prime minister Giorgia Meloni welcomed the G7 heads of state to the summit at a luxury resort in Borgo Egnazia in southern Italy, saying she wanted the message of the meeting to be one of dialogue with the global south and unity.\n\nShe likened the G7 to the ancient olive trees that are a symbol of the Puglia region, \"with their solid roots, and branches projected toward the future\".\n\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy is expected to sign a separate bilateral security agreement with US president Joe Biden.\n\nBeyond the war in Ukraine, Pope Francis will become the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, adding a dash of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering.\n\nHe will be speaking on Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe G7 comprises Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nItaly, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders - Algerian president Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan president William Ruto and Tunisian president Kais Saied - to press Italy's development and migration initiatives on the continent.\n\nOther guests include Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Mr Biden, UK prime minister Rishi Sunak and now French president Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure is on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nThe US proposal involves engineering a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia, which would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters on Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders has been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still have to be worked out.\n\nThe issue is complicated because if the Russian assets are eventually unfrozen - for example, if the war ends - then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nIn addition to the deal, Mr Sunak announced up to $310 million in non-military aid to Ukraine for humanitarian, energy and stabilisation needs.\n\nWashington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nMs Meloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy's first female premier.\n\nKnown for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, did not fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote.\n\nMr Macron called a snap election and German chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nAs a result, Ms Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said.\n\nIn one sign of her flexed far-right muscles, Ms Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy is trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communiqu\u00e9.\n\nA French official said there are diverging views with Italian negotiators on some topics, including on sexual and reproductive health and vaccines.\n\nItalian foreign minister Antonio Tajani confirmed abortion is being discussed, but said talks are continuing.\n\nNick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council, said: \"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit.\"\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as she seeks to leverage her programme for a non-exploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.", "source": {"uri": "breakingnews.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breaking News.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Everyone in Puglia is aware this could be Biden's last G7 summit if he loses to Donald Trump in November U.S. elections.\n\nBritain's Rishi Sunak is tipped to be ousted in July 4 elections, while France's Macron and Germany's Olaf Scholz are both under pressure after gains by the far right in EU elections last weekend.\n\nThe G7 summit opens Thursday morning with a short session on Africa, development and climate change, before turning to the Middle East.\n\nThe leaders have already announced their support for a Gaza truce deal outlined by Biden, which would also see the release of hostages taken in Hamas's Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan -- a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause -- is among around a dozen non-G7 guests also attending who are not, however, participating in the working sessions.\n\nThey include Jordan's King Abdullah II, UAE president Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed and India's Narendra Modi.\n\nBrazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva -- whose country holds the rotating G20 presidency this year -- as well as Argentina's Javier Milei and U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres also plan to attend.\n\nAll the guests are invited to a dinner Friday night at the Borgo Egnazia luxury hotel complex, built in the style of a traditional village.\n\nWith security extremely tight, the venue is far away from protesters and journalists, with the media centre located some 60 kilometres away in Bari.\n\nAnother key issue in Puglia, to be discussed Friday, will be concerns about China's so-called \"industrial overcapacity\", particularly in green energy and technology sectors such as solar panels and electric vehicles.\n\nThe U.S., EU and Japan have all voiced concern that generous subsidies from Beijing are resulting in a flood of cheap goods hitting the global market, threatening Western firms.", "source": {"uri":

is to send a signal to Russia of American resolve over support for Kyiv, the White House said as Mr Biden headed to Italy.\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters that the agreement would not commit US troops directly to Ukraine's defence against Russia's invasion - a red line drawn by Mr Biden, who is fearful of being drawn into direct conflict between the nuclear-armed powers.\n\nWe want to demonstrate that the US supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them and that we'll continue to help address their security needs\n\n\"We want to demonstrate that the US supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them and that we'll continue to help address their security needs,\" Mr Sullivan said, adding \"this agreement will show our resolve\".\n\nMr Sullivan called the agreement a \"bridge\" to when Ukraine is invited to join the Nato alliance - a long-term priority of Mr Zelenskyy's that the allies have said will first require an end to the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nMr Biden heads to the summit of the world's leading democracies with an urgency to get big things done, including turning frozen Russian assets into billions of dollars to help Ukraine as it fights off Russian President Vladimir Putin's war machine.\n\nThis year's G7 summit comes three years after Mr Biden declared at his first such gathering that America was back as a global leader following the disruptions to western alliances that occurred when Donald Trump was president.\n\nNow, there is a chance this gathering could be the final G7 for Mr Biden and other G7 leaders, depending on the results of elections this year.\n\nMr Biden and his counterparts from Canada, the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Japan will use the summit to discuss challenges related to the spread of artificial intelligence, migration, the Russian military's resurgence and China's economic might, among other topics.\n\nPope Francis, Mr Zelenskyy and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are joining the gathering at the Borgo Egnazia resort in the Puglia region of southern Italy.\n\nThe summit, which opens on Thursday, will play out after far-right parties across the continent secured gains of surprising scale in just-concluded European Union elections.\n\nThose victories, coupled with upcoming elections in the UK, France and the US, have rattled the global political establishment and added weightiness to this year's summit.\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to US and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Centre, an international affairs think tank.\n\n\"We don't know what the world

A Group of Seven summit aiming to consolidate support for Ukraine opens Thursday under a vastly different political landscape than even a few days ago, after European Parliament elections jolted the leaders of France and Germany and emboldened Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni.\n\nBARI, Italy (AP) -- A Group of Seven summit is opening Thursday with agreement on a U.S. proposal to back a $50 billion loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral, giving Kyiv a strong show of support even as Europe's political chessboard shifts to the right.\n\nDiplomats confirmed that an agreement had been reached on the deal before the leaders even landed in southern Italy for the three-day summit. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is on hand and is expected to sign a separate bilateral security agreement with U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nBeyond the the war in Ukraine, Pope Francis will become the first pope to address a G7 summit, adding a dash of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering that is being held this year in Italy's sun-drenched Puglia region. He'll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Italy, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Italy's development and migration initiatives on the continent.\n\nOther guests include Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nFrozen Russian assets to support Ukraine\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves engineering a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia that would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen -- say if the war ends -- then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nIn addition to the deal, Sunak announced up to 242 million pounds (286 million euros or $310 million) in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine for humanitarian, energy and stabilization needs. Washington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nEurope's new political chessboard\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy's first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nAs a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\nA French official, speaking anonymously in line with Macron's office customary practices, said there were diverging views with Italian negotiators on some topics, including on sexual and reproductive health and vaccines.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed abortion was being discussed, but said discussions were continuing.\n\n\"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 Summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit,\" said Nick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a nonexploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nThe pope and artificial intelligence\n\nPope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasizing the grave and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector, which has been a frequent focus of the Jesuit pope who has called even traditional weapons makers \"merchants of death.\"\n\nBut Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.\n\nIt's happening where?\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it will be sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and Carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nAs with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. One group is staging a \"dinner for the poor\" on Friday night calling for \"peace, the rights of peoples and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.\"\n\nAngela

He'll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Italy, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Italy's development and migration initiatives on the continent.\n\nOther guests include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nFrozen Russian assets to support Ukraine\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves engineering a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia that would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen -- say if the war ends -- then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nIn addition to the deal, Sunak announced up to 242 million pounds (286 million euros or $310 million) in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine for humanitarian, energy and stabilization needs. Washington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nEurope's new political chessboard\n\nMeloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy's first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nAs a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\nA French official, speaking anonymously in line with Macron's office customary practices, said there were diverging views with Italian negotiators on some topics, including on sexual and reproductive health and vaccines.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed abortion was being discussed, but said discussions were continuing.\n\n\"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 Summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit,\" said Nick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a nonexploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nThe pope and artificial intelligence\n\nPope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasizing the grave and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector, which has been a frequent focus of the Jesuit pope who has called even traditional weapons makers \"merchants of death.\"\n\nBut Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.\n\nIt's happening where?\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it will be sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and Carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nAs with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. One group is staging a \"dinner for the poor\" on Friday night calling for \"peace, the rights of peoples and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.\"\n\n___\n\nNicole Winfield reported from Bari.

As with his recent trip to France, he is expected to use the occasion to stress the importance of alliances and oppose isolationism, a stance he often uses to critique his predecessor, former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Vatican confirmed in April that Pope Francis will join the leaders' summit, participating in a special session on artificial intelligence (AI).\n\n\"This is the first time in history that a pontiff will participate in the work of a G7,\" Ms. Meloni said on April 26.\n\nIt is unclear whether President Biden will meet with the Pope on the sidelines of the summit.\n\nIn the run-up to the crucial summit, the G7 finance ministers held discussions about the legality of using some $250 billion worth of frozen assets kept in European accounts as collateral for providing a loan to Ukraine for reconstruction. France was believed to be the main holdout on the plan.\n\nPresident Biden mentioned before leaving France last week that he had reached an agreement with Mr. Macron on a plan to use the frozen Russian assets.\n\nThe proposal under discussion involves using the profits from these assets, specifically the interest earned, as collateral to provide Ukraine with a loan through a sovereign lender. Italy will capture the spotlight this week if the G7 leaders can agree on the details of this proposal.\n\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on Air Force One en route to Italy that the discussions about how to unlock Russian assets are still underway.\n\nThis agreement does not include any commitment to using U.S. forces to defend Ukraine, Mr. Sullivan explained. But it aims to guarantee that Ukraine has the necessary physical capacity, as well as intelligence and other capabilities, to effectively defend itself, he added.\n\nBoth leaders have scheduled a press conference for Thursday to address the media after their meeting.\n\nThis follows the bilateral discussion between President Biden and Mr. Zelenskyy last week in Paris, France, which took place during the D-Day commemorations.\n\nDuring the June 7 meeting, President Biden apologized to Ukraine's president for the delays in passing a foreign aid measure that included $61 billion in support for Ukraine.\n\n\"We're not going to walk away from you,\" President Biden told Mr. Zelenskyy, announcing $225 million in new assistance for the war-torn country.\n\nLast year, President Zelenskyy stole the show with his unexpected visit to the G7 in Japan.\n\nThis year, he is expected to call on G7 countries to commit to more funding. Hence, the announcement regarding Russian assets will be vital for the Ukrainian president.\n\nThe Vatican has an initiative known as the \"Rome Call for AI Ethics,\" which was launched several years ago and is already supported by some well-known companies, such as Microsoft, IBM, and Cisco.\n\nMs. Meloni has been vocal about the dangers of AI. She has expressed concerns about the impact of AI on the labor market, claiming that it will eliminate the need for people, widening the income gap.\n\n\"We want to develop AI, but also we want to be certain that it remains human-centered.\"\n\nTackling AI risks is crucial at this year's summit as it's contributing to the spread of disinformation, foreign interference, and election interference, according to Greg Allen, director of the CSIS Wadhwani Center for AI and Advanced Technologies.\n\n\"Recently, Open AI -- one of the leading AI companies worldwide -- announced that Chinese and Russian propaganda services were using Open AI's ChatGPT service to mass produce propaganda messaging at really low cost,\" he said during a CSIS press briefing to preview the summit.\n\nThe G7 leaders stated publicly in 2023 that they saw China as an economic bully and that the international community would not put up with Beijing's \"economic coercion.\" They warned for the first time that there would be \"consequences.\"\n\nChina's harmful tactics that undermine international rules and norms, particularly the recent industrial overcapacity problem, are expected to be discussed at this year's summit.\n\nChinese companies are rapidly seizing market share in strategic industries such as solar panels, wind turbines, steel, and EVs. The U.S. and European governments have expressed alarm about China's excess capacity, which is largely attributed to massive government subsidies. One major concern is the impact of the overcapacity problem on the development and innovation of industries in other countries.\n\n\"For the United States, the primary motivation continues to be China,\" according to Emily Benson, director of the project on trade and technology at the CSIS.\n\n\"The United States believes that this incoming flow of goods from China will be more acute and broader than the previous China shock, and so they're doing everything that they can to convince allies and partners to join a more protective U.S. approach,\" Ms. Benson said during the CSIS press briefing.\n\nIt remains to be seen if tariff rates on inbound goods from China into the G7 bloc will be more closely aligned, she said.\n\nThe European Commission announced on June 12 that it will impose additional tariffs of up to 38.1 percent on imported Chinese electric cars starting in July.\n\nAccording to Mr. Sullivan, the G7 countries agree that they must work together to address the challenges posed by China's policies and practices.\n\n\"I do think you can expect to see a common framework around some of these issues emerging as part of the final text of the communique,\" he said.\n\nThe summit follows last Sunday's European Parliament elections, which shook the continent's political climate.\n\nThe White House is confident that this new development will have no impact on President Biden's relationship with the European leaders.\n\n\"The President will work with the democratically elected leaders of France no matter who they are,\" White House national security communications advisor John Kirby told reporters on June 11.\n\n\"We have every confidence that regardless of who fills what seats in the EU parliament, we're going to continue to work closely with President von der Leyen and our EU partners on all the issues relative to our shared interest across the European continent, and that includes supporting Ukraine.\"", "source": {"uri":

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will attend and is expected to sign a separate bilateral security agreement with US President Joe Biden.\n\nBeyond the war in Ukraine, Pope Francis will become the first pope to address a G7 summit, adding a touch of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering being held this year in sunny Puglia in Italy. He will speak on Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is also expected to renew his call for a peaceful end to the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Host Italy invited several African leaders - Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied - to lobby Italy's African initiatives. Other guests include Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, newly elected Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, the pressure was on the G7 to do what it can while the status quo lasts. what.\n\nRussian assets frozen to support Ukraine The US proposal involves using profits from the Russian central bank's roughly $260 billion in frozen assets, most held in the European Union, to help Ukraine, and providing a $50 billion loan from the US government to Kiev, using windfall profits from funds tied up as collateral.\n\nA French official, speaking to reporters on Wednesday, said a political decision by leaders had been made but the technical and legal details of the mechanism to exploit the assets still needed to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if Russian assets are ever thawed - for example if the war ends - then the windfall profits can no longer be used to repay the loan, requiring a burden-sharing agreement with other countries. .\n\nOn the eve of the summit, Washington also sent strong signals of support to Ukraine, expanding sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that support its war machine.\n\nEurope's new political chessboard Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni enters the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party performed even stronger in the weekend's elections to the European Parliament than in the 2022 elections which made her Italy's first female Prime Minister. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy now finds itself in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the EU's two other G7 members, Germany and France, are not faring as well, shaken by the strong showings of far-right parties in the vote. Macron called early elections and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz watched as the far-right Alternative for Germany defeated his Social Democrats.\n\nAs a result, Meloni will likely be able to steer the three-day meeting toward its main priority points while strengthening its role on the world stage, analysts say. In a signal sign of his far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language on abortion access in the final communiqu\u00e9.\n\n\"While recent results are unlikely to radically change the direction of the next G7 summit, this election victory provides Prime Minister Meloni with additional leverage to make it a 'quintessentially Mediterranean summit',\" said Nick O' Connell, Deputy Director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThis includes promoting his migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage his agenda for a non-exploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nItaly, which for decades has been at ground zero of Europe's migration debate, is promoting its Mattei plan as a way to create jobs and opportunities in Africa and discourage its young people from undertaking dangerous journeys across the Mediterranean Sea . The plan includes pilot projects in areas such as education, healthcare, water, sanitation, agriculture and energy infrastructure.\n\nThe Pope and artificial intelligence Pope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure that AI is developed and used ethically, recognizing the promise it offers but highlighting the serious and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe will carry this campaign to the industrialized countries of the world while wars rage on several fronts. One of his biggest concerns is the use of AI in the arms sector, which is an ongoing concern of the Jesuit pope who has called even traditional weapons makers \"dealers of death.\"\n\nBut Francis also worries about what AI means for the poorest and weakest: technology that could determine the trustworthiness of a mortgage applicant, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the risk of recidivism of a person previously convicted of a crime.\n\nThe 87-year-old pope said he would also reiterate his calls for peace when holding half a dozen bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the summit.\n\nWhere is this happening? The G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that looks like a theater set, a fake town designed to look like one of Puglia's whitewashed medieval hamlets, but which actually only dates from 2010 .\n\nLocated next to a real archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a square with a clock tower. A favorite of celebrities, it will be closed to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodation awaits the more than 2,000 police and carabinieri deployed to provide security. Authorities sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship sheltering them in the port of Brindisi on Wednesday after the police union complained about unacceptable hygiene conditions on board.\n\nAs throughout the G7, a range of anti-globalization, anti-war and climate activists are organizing protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. A group is organizing a \"dinner for the poor\" on Friday evening calling for \"peace, the rights of people and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.\"",

If (Russian President) Vladimir Putin thinks he can outlast the coalition supporting Ukraine, he's wrong,\" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters.\n\nCONFRONTING CHINA\n\nUnderscoring US determination to punish Moscow for its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Washington on Wednesday dramatically broadened sanctions on Moscow, including by targeting China-based companies selling semiconductors to Moscow.\n\nBy announcing new restrictions on Chinese firms on the eve of the G7 meeting, Biden is no doubt hoping to persuade Western allies to show greater resolve in confronting Beijing over its support for Russia and its industrial over-capacity.\n\nThe European Commission told automakers on Wednesday it would impose extra duties of up to 38.1 percent on imported Chinese electric cars from July, less than a month after Washington quadrupled duties for Chinese EVs to 100 percent.\n\nWhile G7 leaders are expected to express concern over high Chinese production levels, which they say disrupt global supply chains and market stability, EU diplomats warn that Europe is anxious to avoid a full-blown trade war with Beijing.\n\nEager not to appear like an elitist fortress, the G7 has thrown open its doors to a large number of outsiders this year, including Pope Francis, who is expected to give a keynote speech on Friday on both the risks and potential of AI.\n\nAmong those who have also been invited to Puglia are the leaders of some of the biggest regional powers across the globe such as India, Brazil, Argentina, Turkiye, Algeria and Kenya.\n\nAlthough the summit is scheduled to run until Saturday, many G7 chiefs will leave on Friday night, including Biden, meaning the final day has been earmarked for bilateral meetings for those staying on and a final news conference from Meloni.", "source": {"uri": "arab.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Everyone in Puglia is aware this could be Biden's last G7 summit if he loses to Donald Trump in November US elections.\n\nBritain's Rishi Sunak is tipped to be ousted in July 4 elections, while France's Macron and Germany's Olaf Scholz are both under pressure after gains by the far right in EU elections last weekend.\n\nThe G7 summit opens Thursday morning with a short session on Africa, development and climate change, before turning to the Middle East.\n\nThe leaders have already announced their support for a Gaza truce deal outlined by Biden, which would also see the release of hostages taken in Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel.\n\nJordan's King Abdullah II -- a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause whose country signed a peace treaty with Israel 30 years ago -- is among around a dozen non-G7 guests also attending who are not, however, participating in the working sessions.\n\nThey include Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, UAE president Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed and India's Narendra Modi.\n\nBrazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva -- whose country holds the rotating G20 presidency this year -- as well as Argentina's Javier Milei and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres also plan to attend.\n\nAll the guests are invited to a dinner Friday night at the Borgo Egnazia luxury hotel complex, built in the style of a traditional village.\n\nWith security extremely tight, the venue is far away from protesters and journalists, with the media centre located some 60 kilometres away in Bari.\n\nAnother key issue in Puglia, to be discussed Friday, will be concerns about China's so-called \"industrial overcapacity\", particularly in green energy and technology sectors such as solar panels and electric vehicles.\n\nThe US, EU and Japan have all voiced concern that generous subsidies from Beijing are resulting in a flood of cheap goods hitting the global market, threatening Western firms.\n\nbur-ar/ide/yad/smw", "source": {"uri":

(Scripps News)\n\nA Group of Seven summit is opening Thursday with agreement on a U.S. proposal to back a $50 billion loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral, giving Kyiv a strong show of support even as Europe's political chessboard shifts to the right.\n\nDiplomats confirmed that an agreement had been reached on the deal before the leaders even landed in southern Italy for the three-day summit. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is on hand and is expected to sign a separate bilateral security agreement with U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nBeyond the the war in Ukraine, Pope Francis will become the first pope to address a G7 summit, adding a dash of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering that is being held this year in Italy's sun-drenched Puglia region. He'll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Italy, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Italy's development and migration initiatives on the continent.\n\nOther guests include Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nFrozen Russian assets to support Ukraine\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves engineering a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia that would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen -- say if the war ends -- then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nIn addition to the deal, Sunak announced up to $310 million in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine for humanitarian, energy and stabilization needs. Washington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nEurope's new political chessboard\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy's first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nAs a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\nA French official, speaking anonymously in line with Macron's office customary practices, said there were diverging views with Italian negotiators on some topics, including on sexual and reproductive health and vaccines.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed abortion was being discussed, but said discussions were continuing.\n\n\"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 Summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit,\" said Nick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a nonexploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nThe pope and artificial intelligence\n\nPope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasizing the grave and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector, which has been a frequent focus of the Jesuit pope who has called even traditional weapons makers \"merchants of death.\"\n\nBut Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.\n\nIt's happening where?\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it will be sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and Carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nAs with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. One group is staging a \"dinner for the poor\" on Friday night calling for \"peace, the rights of peoples and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.\"",

Russian assets for Ukraine | BreakingNews.ie", "body": "The G7 summit in Italy was opening on Thursday with an agreement on a US proposal to back a 50 billion dollar (\u00a339 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral, giving Kyiv a strong show of support even as Europe's political chessboard shifts to the right.\n\nDiplomats confirmed an agreement had been reached on the deal before the leaders even landed for the three-day gathering.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to sign a separate bilateral security agreement with US President Joe Biden.\n\nBeyond the the war in Ukraine, Pope Francis will become the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, adding a dash of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering that is being held this year in Borgo Egnazia in southern Italy's sun-drenched Puglia region.\n\nHe will be speaking on Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe G7 comprises Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nItaly, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders - Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied - to press Italy's development and migration initiatives on the continent.\n\nOther guests include Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Mr Biden, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure is on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nThe US proposal involves engineering a 50 billion dollar (\u00a339 billion) loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia which would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters on Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders has been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still have to be worked out.\n\nThe issue is complicated because if the Russian assets are eventually unfrozen - for example, if the war ends - then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nIn addition to the deal, Mr Sunak announced up to \u00a3242 million (310 million dollars) in non-military aid to Ukraine for humanitarian, energy and stabilization needs.\n\nWashington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy's first female premier.\n\nKnown for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, did not fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote.\n\nMr Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nAs a result, Ms Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said.\n\nIn one sign of her flexed far-right muscles, Ms Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy is trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\nA French official said there are diverging views with Italian negotiators on some topics, including on sexual and reproductive health and vaccines.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed abortion is being discussed, but said talks are continuing.\n\nNick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council, said: \"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit.\"\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as she seeks to leverage her programme for a non-exploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.", "source": {"uri": "breakingnews.ie",

Host Italy has invited several African leaders - Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied - to press Italy's Africa initiatives. Other guests include Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves using profits from the roughly $260 billion in frozen Russian central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, to help Ukraine, and issuing a $50 billion loan from the U.S. government to Kyiv, using windfall profits from the immobilized funds as collateral.\n\nItalian Carabinieri, paramilitary policemen, patrol at a roadblock near Borgo Egnazia, venue of the G7 summit in southern Italy, Wednesday, June 12, 2024.

(AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia)\n\nA French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen - say if the war ends - then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nOn the eve of the summit, Washington also sent strong signals of support for Ukraine, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in weekend European Parliament elections than the 2022 elections that made her Italy\u00b4s first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7\u00b4s two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw the far-right Alternative for Germany beat out his Social Democrats.\n\nAs a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One reported sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\n\"While it\u00b4s unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 Summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit,\" said Nick O\u00b4Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a non-exploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nItaly, which for decades has been ground zero in Europe\u00b4s migration debate, has been promoting its Mattei Plan as a way to create jobs and opportunity in Africa and discourage its young people from making dangerous trips across the Mediterranean Sea. The plan involves pilot projects in areas such as education, health care, water, sanitation, agriculture and energy infrastructure.\n\nPope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasizing the grave and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector, which has been a frequent focus of the Jesuit pope who has called even traditional weapons makers \"merchants of death.\"\n\nBut Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.\n\nThe 87-year-old pope has said he would also repeat his calls for peace while holding a half-dozen bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the summit.\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that\u00b4s something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia\u00b4s medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it will be sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi\u00b4s port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nAs with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. One group is staging a \"dinner for the poor\" on Friday night calling for \"peace, the rights of peoples and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.\"\n\nAssociated Press journalists Angela Charlton and Sylvie Corbet in Paris contributed to this report.\n\nWorkers give the last touch to the illumination set for the Patron Saint feast in Fasano, near Borgo Egnazia, southern Italy, Wednesday, June 12, 2024.

announced during this week's G7 summit in Italy, as well as new sanctions and export controls over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"We will announce new steps to unlock the value of the immobilized Russian sovereign assets to benefit Ukraine,\" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told journalists.\n\nG7 leaders hope to agree a deal on using the profits from the interest on 300 billion euros ($325 billion) of frozen Russian central bank assets to help Kyiv.\n\nThe idea is to use the profits as collateral for a loan of up to $50 billion, but there is still debate over who would issue the debt as well as a raft of technical issues -- including what would happen if the assets were unfrozen in the event of peace.\n\nKirby also said that \"an impactful set of new sanctions and export control actions\" will be announced, without providing specifics.\n\nThe G7 summit comes against the backdrop of global and political turmoil, and boosting support for Ukraine is at the top of the agenda.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will attend a discussion Thursday on Russia's war on his country, now into its third year, where he will again press for more help from Western

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will attend and is expected to sign a separate bilateral security agreement with US President Joe Biden.\n\nBeyond the war in Ukraine, Pope Francis will become the first pope to address a G7 summit, adding a touch of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering being held this year in Italy's sunny Puglia region. I will speak on Friday promises and perils of artificial intelligencebut he should also renew his call for a peaceful end to the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Host Italy invited several Algerian African leaders President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied to promote Italian initiatives in favor of Africa. Other guests include Brazilian President Luiz Incio Lula da Silvathe newly elected Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, the pressure was on the G7 to do what it can while the status quo lasts. what.\n\nRussian assets frozen to support Ukraine\n\nThe American proposal involves using the profits from the approx. 260 billion dollars in frozen assets of the Russian central bank, most of them are held in the European Union, to help Ukraine, and the provision of a $50 billion loan from the US government to kyiv, using windfall profits from the immobilized funds as collateral.\n\nA French official, speaking to reporters Wednesday, said a political decision had been made by leaders, but that technical and legal details The mechanism for exploiting these assets remains to be developed. The issue is complicated because if Russian assets are ever thawed, for example if the war ends, the windfall profits can no longer be used to repay the loan, requiring a burden-sharing agreement with other countries.\n\nOn the eve of the summit, Washington also sent strong signals of support to Ukraine, with expanded sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that help its war machine.\n\nEurope's new political spectrum\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni enters the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party performed even stronger in the weekend's European Parliament elections than in the 2022 elections which made her the first female Italian Prime Minister. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy now finds itself in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the other two EU members, Germany and France, are not faring as well, shaken by the strong showings of far-right parties in the vote. Macron called early elections and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw the far-right Alternative for Germany defeat its social democrats.\n\nAs a result, Meloni will likely be able to steer the three-day meeting toward its main priority points while strengthening its role on the world stage, analysts say. In a signal sign of his far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language on abortion access in the final communiqu\u00e9.\n\nAlthough the recent results are unlikely to radically change the direction of the next G7 summit, this election victory gives Prime Minister Meloni additional leverage to make it a predominantly Mediterranean summit, said Nick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThis includes promoting his migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage his agenda for a non-exploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nItaly, which has been at ground zero in the European debate on migration for decades, is promoting its Mat\u00e9i map as a way to create jobs and opportunities in Africa and discourage its young people from making dangerous journeys across the Mediterranean Sea. The plan includes pilot projects in areas such as education, healthcare, water, sanitation, agriculture and energy infrastructure.\n\nThe Pope and artificial intelligence\n\nPope Francis has called for a international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethicallyrecognizing the promise it offers but emphasizing the serious and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe will carry this campaign to the industrialized countries of the world while wars rage on several fronts. One of his biggest concerns is the use of AI in the arms sector, which has been a frequent concern of the Jesuit Pope who has called even manufacturers of traditional weapons merchants of death.\n\nBut Francis also worries about what AI means for the poorest and weakest: technology that could determine the trustworthiness of a mortgage applicant, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the risk of recidivism of a person previously convicted of a crime.\n\nThe 87-year-old pope said he would also reiterate his calls for peace when holding half a dozen bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the summit.\n\nWhere is it happening ?\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that resembles a theater set, a fake town designed to look like one of Puglia's whitewashed medieval hamlets, but which actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to a real archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a square with a clock tower. A favorite of celebrities, it will be closed to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodation awaits the more than 2,000 police and carabinieri deployed to provide security. Authorities sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship sheltering them in the port of Brindisis on Wednesday after the police union complained about unacceptable hygiene conditions on board.\n\nAs throughout the G7, a range of anti-globalization, anti-war and climate activists are organizing protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. A group is organizing a dinner for the poor on Friday evening calling for peace, people's rights and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.\n\n___\n\nAssociated

and Zelensky to sign security agreement between US and Ukraine at summit", "body": "The aim is to send a signal to Russia of American resolve over support for Kyiv, the White House said as Mr Biden headed to Italy.\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters that the agreement would not commit US troops directly to Ukraine's defence against Russia's invasion - a red line drawn by Mr Biden, who is fearful of being drawn into direct conflict between the nuclear-armed powers.\n\n\"We want to demonstrate that the US supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them and that we'll continue to help address their security needs,\" Mr Sullivan said, adding \"this agreement will show our resolve\".\n\nMr Sullivan called the agreement a \"bridge\" to when Ukraine is invited to join the Nato alliance - a long-term priority of Mr Zelensky's that the allies have said will first require an end to the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nMr Biden heads to the summit of the world's leading democracies with an urgency to get big things done, including turning frozen Russian assets into billions of dollars to help Ukraine as it fights off Russian President Vladimir Putin's war machine.\n\nThis year's G7 summit comes three years after Mr Biden declared at his first such gathering that America was back as a global leader following the disruptions to western alliances that occurred when Donald Trump was president.\n\nNow, there is a chance this gathering could be the final G7 for Mr Biden and other G7 leaders, depending on the results of elections this year.\n\nMr Biden and his counterparts from Canada, the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Japan will use the summit to discuss challenges related to the spread of artificial intelligence, migration, the Russian military's resurgence and China's economic might, among other topics.\n\nPope Francis, Mr Zelensky and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are joining the gathering at the Borgo Egnazia resort in the Puglia region of southern Italy.\n\nThe summit, which opens on Thursday, will play out after far-right parties across the continent secured gains of surprising scale in just-concluded European Union elections.\n\nThose victories, coupled with upcoming elections in the UK, France and the US, have rattled the global political establishment and added weightiness to this year's summit.\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to US and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Centre, an international affairs think tank.\n\n\"We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\"",

The White House has said it will announce measures to use frozen Russian assets, as well as new sanctions and export controls as a result of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nG7 leaders hope to agree on the use of interest proceeds on the 300 billion euros worth of frozen Russian central bank assets to help Kyiv. The G7 would provide Ukraine with a loan of around 50 billion US dollars (46 billion euros) from the profits from the Russian assets G7 summit worldwide. However, there are many remaining unclear technical issues.\n\nThe ultimate objective must be to fully confiscate all Russian assets and transfer them to Ukraine, ensuring that this process adheres to international law, the committee chairs say.\n\n\"At least \u20ac3 billion a month in outside financial assistance is required just to prevent a collapse of Ukraine's economy. Against numbers like these, confiscating \u20ac3 billion in annual windfall profits on Russia's frozen assets simply is not a sufficient response to the challenge Russia has issued to Ukraine and its friends in the democratic world,\" their letter reads.\n\nThe G7 Summit will take place at a politically turbulent time when increased support for Ukraine is high on the agenda.\n\nOn Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will take part in a G7 discussion on Russia's war against his country and will once again ask for more help from Western countries.\n\nThe letter also states that full confiscation's market impact has already been assessed, adding that \"seizure in response to aggression would be too rare an occurrence to have major currency impacts\".\n\n\"The leaders of some of the major NATO countries are still unable to reach a final decision on Ukraine's NATO membership, despite the support of the parliaments of the NATO countries whose representatives on the parliamentary foreign affairs committees have today addressed the leaders of the G7, demanding that all the aggressor's frozen assets be used for Ukraine's reconstruction and defense,\" Pavilionis

AP\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will join US President Joe Biden and leaders from Italy, Britain, France, Germany, Canada and Japan at the luxury Borgo Egnazia resort in Puglia.\n\nThe G7 leaders are hoping to agree on a $50 billion loan for Kyiv, secured against the future profits from interest on 300 billion euros ($325 billion) of Russian central bank assets frozen after the February 2022 invasion.\n\nThe European Union -- where most of the funds are being held -- agreed earlier this year to use the profits for Ukraine, worth up to three billion euros a year.\n\nBut the idea at the G7 is to use this to provide more, faster help in the form of a massive upfront loan -- although key questions such as who issues the debt and who shares the risk are still being hammered out.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron's office on Wednesday said a deal had been agreed on providing $50 billion for Ukraine before the end of the year, but said that technical details still needed to be finalised.\n\nBritain, meanwhile, said it would announce up to $310 million in new bilateral assistance to Kyiv at the summit, adding leaders would \"explore all lawful avenues by which immobilised Russian assets can be used to support Ukraine\".\n\nThe White House also said it expected to announce at the summit \"new steps to unlock the value\" of the Russian assets.\n\nBut US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan was on Wednesday more guarded about what this may entail, saying only that the G7 was working towards announcing \"a framework\", including a timeframe.\n\nZelensky is attending as part of a week of diplomatic efforts to rally support as his country's outmanned and outgunned forces struggle against Russia.\n\nIt will culminate in an international conference on Ukraine in Switzerland this weekend.\n\nThe summit comes at a time of extraordinary global turmoil.\n\nAs well as the conflict in Ukraine -- now in its third year -- the Hamas-Israel conflict is raging and economic tensions are rising between China and Western countries.\n\nMany G7 countries are also in political flux. Everyone in Puglia is aware this could be Biden's last G7 summit if he loses to Donald Trump in November US elections.\n\nBritain's Rishi Sunak is tipped to be ousted in July 4 elections, while France's Macron and Germany's Olaf Scholz are both under pressure after gains by the far right in EU elections last weekend.\n\nThe G7 summit opens Thursday morning with a short session on Africa, development and climate change, before turning to the Middle East.\n\nThe leaders have already announced their support for a Gaza truce deal outlined by Biden.\n\nJordan's King Abdullah II is among around a dozen non-G7 guests also attending who are not, however, participating in the working sessions.\n\nThey include Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, UAE president Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed and India's Narendra Modi.\n\nBrazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva -- whose country holds the rotating G20 presidency this year -- as well as Argentina's Javier Milei and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres also plan to attend.\n\nAll the guests are invited to a dinner Friday night at the Borgo Egnazia luxury hotel complex, built in the style of a traditional village.\n\nWith security extremely tight, the venue is far away from protesters and journalists, with the media centre located some 60 kilometres away in Bari.\n\nAnother key issue in Puglia, to be discussed Friday, will be concerns about China's so-called \"industrial overcapacity\", particularly in green energy and technology sectors such as solar panels and electric vehicles.\n\nThe US, EU and Japan have all voiced concern that generous subsidies from Beijing are resulting in a flood of cheap goods hitting the global market, threatening Western firms.", "source": {"uri": "english.ahram.org.eg", "dataType":

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be on hand and is expected to sign a separate bilateral security agreement with U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nBeyond the Ukraine war, Pope Francis will become the first pope to address a G7 summit, adding a dash of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering that is being held this year in Italy's sun-drenched Puglia region. He'll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Host Italy has invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Italy's Africa initiatives. Other guests include Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nFrozen Russian assets to support Ukraine\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves using profits from the roughly $260 billion in frozen Russian central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, to help Ukraine, and issuing a $50 billion loan from the U.S. government to Kyiv, using windfall profits from the immobilized funds as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen -- say if the war ends -- then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nOn the eve of the summit, Washington also sent strong signals of support for Ukraine, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nEurope's new political chessboard\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in weekend European Parliament elections than the 2022 elections that made her Italy's first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw the far-right Alternative for Germany beat out his Social Democrats.\n\nAs a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One reported sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\n\"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 Summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit,\" said Nick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a non-exploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nItaly, which for decades has been ground zero in Europe's migration debate, has been promoting its Mattei Plan as a way to create jobs and opportunity in Africa and discourage its young people from making dangerous trips across the Mediterranean Sea. The plan involves pilot projects in areas such as education, health care, water, sanitation, agriculture and energy infrastructure.\n\nThe pope and artificial intelligence\n\nPope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasizing the grave and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector, which has been a frequent focus of the Jesuit pope who has called even traditional weapons makers \"merchants of death.\"\n\nBut Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.\n\nThe 87-year-old pope has said he would also repeat his calls for peace while holding a half-dozen bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the summit.\n\nIt's happening where?\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it will be sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nAs with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. One group is staging a \"dinner for the poor\" on Friday night calling for \"peace, the rights of peoples and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Angela Charlton and Sylvie Corbet in Paris contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "keyt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsChannel

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be on hand and is expected to sign a separate bilateral security agreement with U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nBeyond the Ukraine war, Pope Francis will become the first pope to address a G7 summit, adding a dash of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering that is being held this year in Italy's sun-drenched Puglia region. He'll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Host Italy has invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Italy's Africa initiatives. Other guests include Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nFrozen Russian assets to support Ukraine\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves using profits from the roughly $260 billion in frozen Russian central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, to help Ukraine, and issuing a $50 billion loan from the U.S. government to Kyiv, using windfall profits from the immobilized funds as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen -- say if the war ends -- then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nOn the eve of the summit, Washington also sent strong signals of support for Ukraine, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nEurope's new political chessboard\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in weekend European Parliament elections than the 2022 elections that made her Italy's first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw the far-right Alternative for Germany beat out his Social Democrats.\n\nAs a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One reported sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\n\"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 Summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit,\" said Nick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a non-exploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nItaly, which for decades has been ground zero in Europe's migration debate, has been promoting its Mattei Plan as a way to create jobs and opportunity in Africa and discourage its young people from making dangerous trips across the Mediterranean Sea. The plan involves pilot projects in areas such as education, health care, water, sanitation, agriculture and energy infrastructure.\n\nThe pope and artificial intelligence\n\nPope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasizing the grave and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector, which has been a frequent focus of the Jesuit pope who has called even traditional weapons makers \"merchants of death.\"\n\nBut Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.\n\nThe 87-year-old pope has said he would also repeat his calls for peace while holding a half-dozen bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the summit.\n\nIt's happening where?\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it will be sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nAs with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. One group is staging a \"dinner for the poor\" on Friday night calling for \"peace, the rights of peoples and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Angela Charlton and Sylvie Corbet in Paris contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Biden and Trump are running against each other in the November presidential election and are neck-and-neck in the polls.\n\nThe heads of the world's most developed democracies will address multiple challenges during the June 13-15 meeting, including wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, trade imbalances with China, threats posed by artificial intelligence and development challenges in Africa.\n\nThe leaders will announce new sanctions and export controls against Russia that target entities and networks helping President Vladimir Putin's forces fight the war in Ukraine, White House spokesperson John Kirby said on Tuesday. \"We're going to continue to drive up costs for the Russian war machine,\" Kirby said.\n\nWashington plans to widen sanctions on the sale of semiconductor chips and other goods to Russia, with the goal of targeting third-party sellers in China, sources familiar with the plans said late on Tuesday.\n\nThe administration will announce it is broadening existing export controls to include US-branded goods, not just those made in the United States, the sources said. It will identify certain Hong Kong entities it says are shipping goods to Moscow.\n\nShoring up funding for Ukraine will be a top priority at the G7 meeting, with US and European officials eager to lock in solutions, ahead of a possible Trump re-election and the uncertainty it would raise over future US support for Kyiv.\n\nThe Group of Seven nations and the European Union are considering how to use profits generated by Russian assets immobilized in the West to provide Ukraine with a large up-front loan to secure Kyiv's financing for 2025.\n\n\"We will announce new steps to unlock the value of the immobilized Russian sovereign assets to benefit Ukraine and to help them recover from the destruction that Mr. Putin's army has caused,\" Kirby said.\n\nBiden will press other G7 leaders to agree to an innovative plan to use future interest on some $281 billion of Russian central bank funds to back up a $50 billion loan to Ukraine.\n\nG7 leaders also face electoral challenges, with polls indicating British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will likely to lose power in a national vote next month, and the leaders of France and Germany reeling from heavy defeats in recent European elections.\n\nBiden will meet again with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, followed by a joint press conference, Kirby said.", "source": {"uri": "arab.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab

Biden and Trump are running against each other in the November presidential election and are neck-and-neck in the polls.\n\nThe heads of the world's most developed democracies will address multiple challenges during the June 13-15 meeting, including wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, trade imbalances with China, threats posed by artificial intelligence and development challenges in Africa.\n\nThe leaders will announce new sanctions and export controls against Russia that target entities and networks helping President Vladimir Putin's forces fight the war in Ukraine, White House spokesperson John Kirby said on Tuesday. \"We're going to continue to drive up costs for the Russian war machine,\" Kirby said.\n\nWashington plans to widen sanctions on the sale of semiconductor chips and other goods to Russia, with the goal of targeting third-party sellers in China, sources familiar with the plans said late on Tuesday.\n\nThe administration will announce it is broadening existing export controls to include U.S.-branded goods, not just those made in the United States, the sources said. It will identify certain Hong Kong entities it says are shipping goods to Moscow.\n\nShoring up funding for Ukraine will be a top priority at the G7 meeting, with U.S. and European officials eager to lock in solutions, ahead of a possible Trump re-election and the uncertainty it would raise over future U.S. support for Kyiv.\n\nThe Group of Seven nations and the European Union are considering how to use profits generated by Russian assets immobilized in the West to provide Ukraine with a large up-front loan to secure Kyiv's financing for 2025.\n\n\"We will announce new steps to unlock the value of the immobilized Russian sovereign assets to benefit Ukraine and to help them recover from the destruction that Mr. Putin's army has caused,\" Kirby said.\n\nBiden will press other G7 leaders to agree to an innovative plan to use future interest on some $281 billion of Russian central bank funds to back up a $50 billion loan to Ukraine.\n\nG7 leaders also face electoral challenges, with polls indicating British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will likely to lose power in a national vote next month, and the leaders of France and Germany reeling from heavy defeats in recent European elections.\n\nBiden will meet again with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, followed by a joint press conference, Kirby said.", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

He said he thought this move is just the beginning of Russia's seized assets being sent to Ukraine.\n\nG7 leaders are also planning to use the summit to address several other challenges, including the war in the Middle East, trade imbalances with China, artificial intelligence and migration.\n\nThis year's summit, to be held June 13-15, could be the last for G7 leaders facing political challenges at home. Biden, a Democrat, is in a tight race against former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, while several far-right European parties enjoyed political gains in recent European Union elections.\n\nSome political analysts fear what could happen if the G7 leaders fail to come to a consensus now on shared issues.\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to U.S. and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center, an international affairs think tank. \"We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\"\n\nKirby, however, struck a more optimistic note.\n\n\"We have every confidence that regardless of who fills the seats in the European Parliament, we're going to continue to work closely with our EU partners on all the issues relative to our shared interests across the European continent,\" he said. \"That includes supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden, who plans to hold a joint press conference after his Thursday meeting with Zelenskyy, is scheduled to arrive in Italy late Wednesday. His trip comes after his son, Hunter, was convicted of lying in 2018 about his drug use to purchase a gun illegally, making the president's son the first child of a sitting president convicted of a crime.\n\nIn May, former U.S. President Donald Trump was also convicted on felony charges.", "source": {"uri": "globalsecurity.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "GlobalSecurity.org"}, "authors":

Only the host, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, is riding high after triumphing in Italy's European election last weekend, but achieving meaningful results in the luxury Borgo Egnazia hotel resort will be a tall order.\n\nDetermined to claim the initiative, the G7 leaders look likely to announce they have agreed on plans to issue $50 billion of loans for Ukraine using interest from frozen Russian assets to back the multi-year debt package. However officials acknowledge the plan is complex, meaning any deal will only be in principle, with legal experts still having to thrash out the details that will need the backing of European nations, particularly Belgium, which is not in the G7.\n\nFor a second year running, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will attend the summit and is due to sign a new, long-term security accord with Biden. \"By signing this we'll also be sending Russia a signal of our resolve. If (Russian President) Vladimir Putin thinks he can outlast the coalition supporting Ukraine, he's wrong,\" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters.\n\nCONFRONTING CHINA Underscoring U.S. determination to punish Moscow for its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Washington on Wednesday dramatically broadened sanctions on Moscow, including by targeting China-based companies selling semiconductors to Moscow.\n\nBy announcing new restrictions on Chinese firms on the eve of the G7 meeting, Biden is no doubt hoping to persuade Western allies to show greater resolve in confronting Beijing over its support for Russia and its industrial over-capacity. The European Commission told automakers on Wednesday it would impose extra duties of up to 38.1% on imported Chinese electric cars from July, less than a month after Washington quadrupled duties for Chinese EVs to 100%.\n\nWhile G7 leaders are expected to express concern over high Chinese production levels, which they say disrupt global supply chains and market stability, EU diplomats warn that Europe is anxious to avoid a full-blown trade war with Beijing. Eager not to appear like an elitist fortress, the G7 has thrown open its doors to a large number of outsiders this year, including Pope Francis, who is expected to give a keynote speech on Friday on both the risks and potential of AI.\n\nAmong those who have also been invited to Puglia are the leaders of some of the biggest regional powers across the globe such as India, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Algeria and Kenya. Although the summit is scheduled to run until Saturday, many G7 chiefs will leave on Friday night, including Biden, meaning the final day has been earmarked for bilateral meetings for those staying on and a final news conference from Meloni.

He'll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Italy, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Italy's development and migration initiatives on the continent.\n\nOther guests include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves engineering a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia that would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen -- say if the war ends -- then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nIn addition to the deal, Sunak announced up to 242 million pounds ($310 million) in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine for humanitarian, energy and stabilization needs. Washington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nMeloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy's first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nAs a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\nA French official, speaking anonymously in line with Macron's office customary practices, said there were diverging views with Italian negotiators on some topics, including on sexual and reproductive health and vaccines.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed abortion was being discussed, but said discussions were continuing.\n\n\"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 Summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit,'\" said Nick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a nonexploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nPope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasizing the grave and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector, which has been a frequent focus of the Jesuit pope who has called even traditional weapons makers \"merchants of death.\"\n\nBut Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it will be sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and Carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nAs with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. One group is staging a \"dinner for the poor\" on Friday night calling for \"peace, the rights of peoples and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.\"",

Another discussion is expected to take place on Friday (14 June).\n\nWith Ukraine and Gaza likely to dominate the agenda, Meloni has also invited around a dozen non-G7 leaders to attend an \"outreach session\" on Friday afternoon.\n\nInvitees include the leaders of India, South Africa, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Algeria, Kenya and Mauritania.\n\nBrazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who holds the G20 presidency, Argentina's President Javier Milei, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, and representatives from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank have also been invited.\n\n\"[The summit] will be an opportunity to broaden and deepen friendships and alliances with some important medium-sized powers that the West would like to disengage from the Chinese or Russian sphere,\" Arturo Varvelli, head of ECFR Rome think tank, told Euractiv.\n\nThe presence of non-G7 leaders, especially from the Global South, \"could be symbolic of how the G7 could be progressively transformed into a control room in relations with these powers\", Varvelli said.\n\nThe sessions will end on Friday, with Zelenskyy and some other leaders heading to the Ukraine Peace Summit in Switzerland (15-16 June).\n\nAt the same time, Biden is expected to brief his G7 counterparts on Washington's diplomacy efforts in the past months to broker a potential ceasefire in the Gaza-Israel war, now in its ninth month.\n\nG7 leaders said in a statement last week they \"fully endorse and will stand behind the comprehensive\" ceasefire and hostage release deal for the Gaza war outlined by Biden, and called on Hamas to accept it.\n\nHamas formally responded to the proposal on Tuesday. Israel said the response was tantamount to a rejection while a Hamas official said the Palestinian group had merely reiterated longstanding demands not met by the current plan.\n\n\"If a truce agreement between Israel and Hamas could actually be closed in the next few days, the G7 would represent a particularly successful moment,\" Varvelli told Euractiv.\n\nA unanimous G7 statement on the need for Israel's military action to end as soon as possible, and for a new commitment to a security architecture to guarantee Israel itself and the existence and reconstruction of a Palestinian state to emerge at the same time, would make the G7 \"more courageous than the recent past\".\n\nAs migration and relations with Africa are two summit priorities for Meloni - who has made African development a central theme of Rome's year-long G7 presidency through the so-called Mattei Plan - invitees also include leaders from Kenya, Algeria, and the African Union.\n\nMeloni is expected to get the broader G7 group on board with the plan, which aims to position Italy as a major energy hub between Europe and the African continent.\n\nHowever, Italian efforts in Africa have been impacted by a series of coups d'etat there, as European influence slowly wanes in favour of increased Russian presence.\n\nWhile the G7 club of wealthy nations is widely seen as a political forum of largely like-minded democracies, their economic weight has stuttered in recent years. Without China at the table, some question the format's relevance.\n\nThe US expected to strongly push its Western partners to include in the final statement the group's concern over China's industrial overcapacity.\n\nThe EU announced on Wednesday extra tariffs of up to 38% on Chinese electric car imports from next month, unless Brussels and Beijing can resolve the issue.\n\nG7 leaders are also expected to call on China to stop enabling and sustaining Russia's war against Ukraine, according to an early draft statement, which is still under negotiation.\n\n\"China's ongoing support for Russia's defense industrial base has significant and broad-based security implications,\" the draft statement said.", "source": {"uri": "euractiv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EurActiv.com"},

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is on hand and is expected to sign a separate bilateral security agreement with U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nBeyond the the war in Ukraine, Pope Francis will become the first pope to address a G7 summit, adding a dash of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering that is being held this year in Italy's sun-drenched Puglia region. He'll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Italy, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Italy's development and migration initiatives on the continent.\n\nOther guests include Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nFrozen Russian assets to support Ukraine\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves engineering a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia that would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen -- say if the war ends -- then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nIn addition to the deal, Sunak announced up to 242 million pounds (286 million euros or $310 million) in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine for humanitarian, energy and stabilization needs. Washington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nEurope's new political chessboard\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy's first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nAs a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\nA French official, speaking anonymously in line with Macron's office customary practices, said there were diverging views with Italian negotiators on some topics, including on sexual and reproductive health and vaccines.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed abortion was being discussed, but said discussions were continuing.\n\n\"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 Summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit,\" said Nick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a nonexploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nThe pope and artificial intelligence\n\nPope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasizing the grave and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector, which has been a frequent focus of the Jesuit pope who has called even traditional weapons makers \"merchants of death.\"\n\nBut Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.\n\nIt's happening where?The G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it will be sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and Carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nAs with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. One group is staging a \"dinner for the poor\" on Friday night calling for \"peace, the rights of peoples and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.\"",

Biden, a Democrat, is in a tight race against former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, while several far-right European parties enjoyed political gains in recent European Union elections.\n\nSome political analysts fear what could happen if the G7 leaders fail to come to a consensus now on shared issues.\n\n\"You hear this a lot when you talk to U.S. and European officials: If we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center, an international affairs think tank. \"We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\"\n\nKirby, however, struck a more optimistic note.\n\n\"We have every confidence that regardless of who fills the seats in the European Parliament, we're going to continue to work closely with our EU partners on all the issues relative to our shared interests across the European continent,\" he said. \"That includes supporting Ukraine.\"\n\nBiden, who plans to hold a joint press conference after his Thursday meeting with Zelenskyy, is scheduled to arrive in Italy late Wednesday. His trip comes after his son, Hunter, was convicted of lying in 2018 about his drug use to purchase a gun illegally, making the president's son the first child of a sitting president convicted of a

It will definitely be a challenge for the G7 not to be derailed in some ways by what's going to happen in Gaza.\n\nItaly is hosting this G7 summit in the seaside region of Apulia. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has said both conflicts will be key priorities for the summit. Italy also has placed artificial intelligence and development in Africa on the G7 agenda, and has invited several African countries to send observers.\n\nIndia, Argentina and Brazil are expected to attend outreach meetings at the Apulia summit, along with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nA Canadian government official said Friday work is underway to provide more support to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets.\n\nAfter a long delay in equipment donations to Ukraine, it's gotten grim on the battlefield, said Dave Perry, president and CEO of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute.\n\nUkraine is losing some territory in the eastern part of the country as Russians make a push that's been relatively successful, he said. Ukraine urgently needs more armoured vehicles, tanks, training, drones and munitions, Perry added.\n\nThey literally need more of everything, he said.\n\nThe U.S. Congress approved a $61 billion military aid package for Ukraine last month, but only after political conflict within the U.S. Republican Party delayed the package for six months.\n\nNow, the U.S. is expected to push G7 leaders to come out with a new financial package using the interest on roughly 200 billion euros in frozen Russian assets held by the financial institution Euroclear in Belgium, said Max Bergmann, a director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nThose frozen assets are generating billions of dollars in interest every year, he said. The idea is to use that money to secure a $50 billion bank loan for ongoing support for Ukraine, he added.\n\nThe major purpose of this is that there's desperation for how to get Ukraine ... money and then also ramp up defence industrial production, said Bergmann.\n\nBut the idea comes with complications, said Bergmann -- including the fact that ambassadors from EU member states already have agreed in principle to seize windfall profits from frozen Russian assets to buy weapons for Ukraine.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland met with G7 finance ministers in Italy last last month. She said she encouraged her counterparts to \"make full use of frozen Russian central bank (new window) assets to pay for Ukraine's recovery and reconstruction.\"\n\nCanada is in a bit of a position of being fortunate to be able to advocate for a good idea without bearing the direct repercussions of anything that might come from changes to the international financing arrangements, Perry said.\n\nThe RCMP said last month it has frozen $140 million (new window) in Russian assets in Canada since February 2022, when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Global Affairs Canada said it also ordered the seizure of a Russian plane (new window) and a company believed to be tied to a Russian oligarch (new window).\n\nThe recent federal budget said Canada is committed to exploring with allies possible legal mechanisms to make full use of these assets.\n\nThe Pope will join this year's G7 summit for the first time ever, for talks on artificial intelligence. In January, after he became the victim of a deepfake photo, Pope Francis warned against the perverse dangers of artificial intelligence and called for its worldwide regulation.\n\nBranka Marijan of Project Ploughshares studies AI in warfare. She said nations are under pressure to establish red lines for the battlefield use of AI.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces used to generate about 50 targets a year using human analysts, Marijan said. Now it can generate close to 100 targets a day, she said -- putting heavy pressure on human operators to make quick decisions that could have a profound impact.\n\nWith speed, there comes the potential that you are engaging the wrong targets or that you are targeting civilian areas or specific infrastructure, she said.\n\nWATCH: How sea drones and AI are reshaping naval warfare\n\n1 month agoDuration6:07Smaller, cheaper sea drones and artificial intelligence are disrupting how war is waged in Ukraine and beyond. CBC's Murray Brewster breaks down what the new technology could mean for Canada's military and the future of naval warfare.\n\nMarijan said Ukraine has been using AI technology to work out where Russian troops are hiding on the ground.\n\nUkraine has generally been out-innovating Russia, but then the Russians have been catching up, she said.\n\nThe G7 should come up with concrete regulations for weapons that can select targets and deploy force without human intervention, she said, and should call for an international body to regulate, monitor and enforce rules on battlefield AI.\n\nCanada has an enormous opportunity to really contribute and shape the dialogue at the G7 because it's a co-chair of a working group on military use of artificial intelligence, Marijan said.\n\nThis year's summit is unfolding during a major year for elections. Voters in the U.K., the U.S. and across the European Union will be headed to the polls, so there will be a strong focus at the summit on free and fair elections and countering misinformation and disinformation, the Canadian government official said Friday.\n\nWATCH: Some MPs helping foreign actors meddle in Canadian politics, report says\n\nA new parliamentary report paints a stark picture of foreign interference in Canadian politics, characterizing the government's response as a 'serious failure' that could impact the country for years to come.\n\nTrudeau is also expected to raise the issue of foreign interference as Canada looks to build on the G7 rapid response mechanism (new window) it launched in 2018, the official said.\n\nThe government has been accused of acting too slowly in response to allegations of foreign meddling. A bombshell report released last week (new window)by a committee of parliamentarians claims there's intelligence indicating that some elected officials have semi-wittingly or wittingly helped foreign governments like China and India meddle in Canadian politics.\n\nSome experts say Canada also needs to actively engage in discussions on another key topic: Africa.\n\nItaly's right-wing government unveiled a multi-billion dollar plan this year to curb migration by boosting economic growth across Africa.\n\nEdward Akuffo, an associate professor at the University of the Fraser Valley's Department of Political Science, said these G7 talks could put pressure on Canada to really up its game.\n\nThe Liberal government promised it would come out with a strategy for Africa in 2022; parliamentary committees are now studying the issue. Many experts have accused the Liberal government of failing to take the region seriously.\n\nWe seriously risk being irrelevant on the African continent, said Akuffo, who writes about Canada's strategic approach to Africa.\n\nAkuffo said Africa has some of the fastest growing economies in the world, 30 per cent of the planet's critical minerals and a fast-growing population.", "source":

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be on hand and is expected to sign a separate bilateral security agreement with U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nBeyond the Ukraine war, Pope Francis will become the first pope to address a G7 summit, adding a dash of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering that is being held this year in Italy's sun-drenched Puglia region. He'll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Host Italy has invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Italy's Africa initiatives. Other guests include Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron face elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nThe US proposal involves using profits from the roughly $260 billion in frozen Russian central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, to help Ukraine, and issuing a $50 billion loan from the US government to Kyiv, using windfall profits from the immobilised funds as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen -- say if the war ends -- then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nOn the eve of the summit, Washington also sent strong signals of support for Ukraine, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in weekend European Parliament elections than the 2022 elections that made her Italy's first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw the far-right Alternative for Germany beat out his Social Democrats.\n\nAs a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One reported sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\n\"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 Summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit,\" said Nick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a non-exploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nItaly, which for decades has been ground zero in Europe's migration debate, has been promoting its Mattei Plan as a way to create jobs and opportunity in Africa and discourage its young people from making dangerous trips across the Mediterranean Sea. The plan involves pilot projects in areas such as education, health care, water, sanitation, agriculture and energy infrastructure.\n\nPope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasising the grave and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialised countries as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector, which has been a frequent focus of the Jesuit pope who has called even traditional weapons makers \"merchants of death.\"\n\nBut Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.\n\nThe 87-year-old pope has said he would also repeat his calls for peace while holding a half-dozen bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the summit.\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theatre set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favourite of celebrities, it will be sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nAs with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. One group is staging a \"dinner for the poor\" on Friday night calling for \"peace, the rights of peoples and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.\"",

seven of the world's richest nations are gathering in Italy for a summit expected to agree a plan to use frozen Russian assets to raise billions of dollars for Ukraine.\n\nThe US proposal could raise $50bn (\u00a339bn) a year for Ukraine, as well as applying fresh economic pressure to Russia.\n\nAlso expected to be on the agenda at the G7 summit are the war in Gaza, migration, economic security and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe summit comes as a number of leaders - including Rishi Sunak, Emmanuel Macron and Joe Biden - face electoral challenges back home.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is down in the polls ahead of a general election next month.\n\nAlso facing the voters in a matter of weeks is the party of French President Emmanuel Macron, who called a snap parliamentary election after a resounding loss to the far-right National Rally in last weekend's elections to the EU's parliament.\n\nMeanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and US President Joe Biden themselves could face defeat the next time voters head to the polls.\n\nItaly's Giorgia Meloni has boasted that her country was heading into this summit with \"the strongest government of all\", after a strong performance in the European elections last weekend.\n\nThe US proposal for Ukraine would see Kyiv granted the money in a loan, secured by the interest on the $325bn of Russian assets that the group, alongside the EU, froze after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nUnder international law, countries cannot confiscate those assets from Russia and give them to Ukraine.\n\nIt is hoped that if passed, the plan would give cash-starved and war-weary Ukraine another vital lifeline.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is due to attend the conference and will sign a new security arrangement with the US.\n\nWith President Biden in the middle of a close election contest himself, and several other Western leaders lagging in the polls, there is pressure to deliver support to Ukraine while they still can.\n\nElsewhere, Mr Sunak is set to announce up to $309m in support for Ukraine's energy and humanitarian needs.\n\nBefore heading to Puglia, he said that allies had to be \"decisive and creative in our efforts to support Ukraine and end [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's illegal war at this critical moment\".\n\nBut the shaky political situation in many G7 countries is causing some observers to have low expectations about what can be achieved.\n\nNatalie Tocci, the director of the Italian Institute for International Affairs, warns that, \"if anything will come out of this summit, it's the fear of a catastrophe playing out before our eyes,\" with possible new governments led by Donald Trump in the US and the far-right in France on the horizon.\n\nAlso on the agenda is the climate crisis, migration from Africa to Europe, the war in Gaza and AI.\n\nPope Francis - who will become the first pontiff to attend a G7 summit - will be addressing the subject of artificial intelligence at the conference.\n\nHe has previously called for global regulation of AI, warning of its danger to ethics and human rights.", "source": {"uri":

Agreed by Mr Sunak on a trip to Kyiv in January, the UK-Ukraine security deal includes the largest delivery of drones by any nation.\n\nAlthough the latest financial commitment was made before the general election was called, the prime minister will hope the focus on Ukraine will help rebut accusations he has little interest in foreign affairs, following the debacle over his early departure from the D-Day commemorations, which has dogged his election campaign so far.\n\nFollow latest updates on the general election\n\nMr Sunak said ahead of the summit in Italy: \"We must be decisive and creative in our efforts to support Ukraine and end Putin's illegal war at this critical moment.\n\n\"The UK remains at the forefront of the international response as we have been from the outset.\n\n\"We must move from 'as long as it takes' to 'whatever it takes' if we are to end this illegal war.\n\n\"From Ukraine to the Middle East, we will be discussing significant global threats at the summit. Such threats are why it is so vital to strengthen the UK's national defence, through our commitment to spend 2.5% of GDP on defence by 2030.\"\n\nMore from Sky News:\n\nPM announces Russian diamonds ban\n\nKremlin threatens war against NATO\n\nSeveral G7 leaders are feeling the pressure to deliver, as they face potentially difficult encounters with their electorates.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron, of France, has called parliamentary elections for the end of this month.\n\nUS President Joe Biden will also attend and is expected to sign a bilateral security agreement with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is invited to the summit.\n\nThe White House said it would send a signal to Russia of American resolve in supporting Kyiv. It is three years since President Biden, at his first G7 summit in Cornwall, declared America was back as a global leader.\n\nRussia is top of the G7 agenda and leaders will discuss how frozen Russian assets held in their countries - with a combined value of $285bn - can be used to support Ukraine.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Click here to follow Electoral Dysfunction wherever you get your podcasts \ud83d\udc48\n\nBut a rift appears to have emerged between the US and European governments over a proposed scheme to loan Ukraine $50bn dollars.\n\nMost of the frozen assets, held by the G7 since 2022, are in Europe and reports quoting EU diplomats suggest Mr Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will tell Mr Biden they do not want to act as guarantors for the loan - fearing they would be taking all the risk while American companies could benefit the most from Ukraine reconstruction contracts.\n\nUK officials say it is a priority for the prime minister and other leaders that \"Russia must pay for the damage it is causing Ukraine\", with \"all lawful avenues\" being explored.\n\nThe prime minister is also expected to discuss global migration challenges, climate change and AI with other leaders, as well as the ongoing efforts to secure a ceasefire in the Middle East.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council has now backed a US resolution for the plan - including the release of hostages and a prisoner swap.\n\nThe US has said Israel has accepted the proposal, despite conflicting remarks from Mr Netanyahu - while Hamas has taken two weeks to propose changes, some of which the US has deemed unworkable.", "source": {"uri": "news.sky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type":

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is announcing up to 242 million pounds (286 million euros or USD 310 million) in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine as Group of Seven leaders gather for a summit overshadowed by war.\n\nSunak is taking time out from the U.K. election campaign to attend Thursday's gathering in southern Italy.\n\nThe U.K. government says the money will go towards \"immediate humanitarian, energy and stabilization needs\" in Ukraine. Sunak has also thrown his support behind a plan to use interest from seized Russian assets to help Ukraine rebuild.\n\nSunak said the war is at a \"critical moment\" and Ukraine's allies \"must move from as long as it takes' to whatever it takes' if we are to end this illegal war.\" The U.K. has pledged 12.5 billion pounds to Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. That includes 7.6 billion pounds worth of military assistance.\n\nSunak is battling to keep his job after the U.K. election on July 4, with opinion polls putting his Conservatives far behind the opposition Labour Party. Labour leader Keir Starmer says he will keep up the United Kingdom's strong support for Ukraine if he becomes prime minister.\n\nTown hosting G7 summit also a faux medieval venue for Hollywood

something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo

That's because while Biden will be huddling with the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom, former President Donald Trump is slated to be in Washington on Thursday. The presumed Republican presidential nominee is scheduled to speak to Business Roundtable CEOs, as well as House and Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill. The planned meetings will be Trump's first with congressional Republicans since he became a felon, convicted on May 30 by a 12-person jury in Manhattan.\n\nA senior White House official on Tuesday signaled Biden's biggest focus during the annual G7 summit would be on the world's hotspots, as well as trying to rally support to counter's China's economic practices -- one of the few issues that mostly unites Republican and Democratic lawmakers at home, even if they often disagree on how to blunt Beijing's trade tactics.\n\nU.S. officials hope G7 leaders might reach some kind of consensus on using frozen Russian assets to directly help Ukrainian citizens, though Kirby made clear a joint decision is not guaranteed.\n\nDuring a virtual briefing with reporters on Tuesday, John Kirby, White House national security communications adviser, sent mixed signals about the expectations for a joint announcement on those assets.\n\nDuring his prepared opening remarks, he said: \"First, we will announce new steps to unlock the value of the immobilized Russian sovereign assets to benefit Ukraine and to help them recover from the destruction that Mr. Putin's army has caused.\" But when pressed for more information by a reporter, Kirby was more measured about the prospects for a deal in Italy.\n\n\"I won't get ahead of the discussions on the frozen assets. As I said, that will be a topic of discussion. The president will continue to reiterate our desire to move in lock step with our allies and partners on using those frozen assets appropriately to help with reconstruction in Ukraine,\" he said. \"As I said in my opening statement, there'll be some announcements on that. But I don't want to get too far ahead of all that. And I certainly won't speak for other of our G7 partners.\"\n\nThe G7 agenda indicates that the seven world leaders will bounce from topic to topic to topic. For instance, the schedule begins Thursday with a session on \"Africa, climate change and development\" and is followed by a working lunch focused on the Middle East, before nearly two hours discussing Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nAlthough White House officials notably have not touted any expected \"deliverables\" -- meaning tangible new joint agreements, in diplomatic-speak -- they have said some new initiatives should be rolled out in Italy.\n\nTo that end, the leaders are expected to go in-depth on the \"full scope of Russia's malign activities,\" Kirby said, adding the G7 honchos intend to \"announce measures to hold Russia accountable, certainly for what they're doing in Ukraine, and to make it harder for their defense-industrial base to threaten the Ukrainian people and the [European] continent.\"\n\nBiden and other G7 leaders are expected to announce an \"impactful set of new sanctions and import-control actions\" on \"entities and networks helping Russia procure what it needs for this war,\" Kirby said.\n\nThe goal of those new economic penalties would be to \"further restrict Russia's future revenues in key sectors,\" he said, adding the summit will focus on Chinese support for Moscow's war and Beijing's trade antics.\n\n\"We will address the PRC's support for the Russian defense industrial base,\" Kirby said. \"And we will confront China's non-market policies that are leading to harmful global spillovers, working with partners in and beyond the G7 to promote economic resilience and security.\"\n\nAll G7 leaders will participate in a Thursday meeting with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and Biden will huddle with the wartime president one-on-one before they address the media together.\n\nThat likely will be the first time reporters will have a chance to ask Biden about his son's guilty verdict, after which the president altered his plans and left Washington, D.C., for his Wilmington, Del., residence on Tuesday afternoon to be with his family.\n\nBefore Biden and Zelenskyy face reporters around 1:30 p.m. EDT on Thursday, some U.S. lawmakers will be watching from afar to see if the seven leaders reach agreement on the \"immobilized\" Russian assets.\n\nDuring a June 5 Senate Financial Services Appropriations Subcommittee hearing, Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., applauded the administration's \"continued efforts to implement tough sanctions on Russia, including the price cap to reduce Russian oil revenues as Putin continues his attacks on the people of Ukraine.\"\n\nVan Hollen told Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen he had been keeping tabs on the administration's \"work to build consensus with our G7 allies on a plan to utilize the value of immobilized Russian sovereign assets to help address the issues within Ukraine.\"\n\nYellen appeared to try managing expectations for any G7 accord on how to use the frozen assets and the interest some are earning while parked in Euroclear, a Belgium-based financial services firm. The goal at the Italy summit, she added, will be to continue \"working together to try to find a way forward.\"\n\n\"So that's a flow that amounts to somewhere in the $3 [billion] to $5 billion range per year and will accrue as long as they remain immobilized,\" Yellen said, referring to the interest. \"We've been discussing the possibility of giving Ukraine the G7 loan and allowing ... this flow of windfall profits to be used to pay off those, the loans that would be given. And this is an approach that seems to be commanding considerable support. So we're hopeful that this can be worked into something to be presented to the leaders at the G7.\"\n\nBut Daniel Fried, a former State Department sanctions coordinator and now an Atlantic Council fellow, noted in an article on the group's website Tuesday that while \"the upcoming G7 summit in Italy would be the time and place to reach agreement\" on the frozen assets, \"that will not be easy.\"\n\n\"Some Europeans seem stuck in a mode of thinking that has not yet internalized Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and its ongoing aggression against other European countries through disinformation, assassination and sabotage,\" according to Fried. \"Neither these nor any serious economic steps against Russia are risk-free or simple; if they were, they would have been introduced already. Each will require resources to identify targets, anticipate potential risks, and enforce.\"", "source": {"uri": "rollcall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Roll Call"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_t_bennett@rollcall.com", "name": "John T.

Most of those assets are currently held in Europe.\n\nUkrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy applauded the move, calling it a vital step forward toward sustainable support for Ukraine.\n\n\"Russia's immobilized assets should be used for defending the lives of Ukrainians from Russian terror and for repaying the damage the aggressor caused Ukraine,\" he said. \"It's fair and absolutely right.\n\nCanada announced Thursday it is contributing C$5 billion.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be on hand and is expected to sign a separate bilateral security agreement with U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nBeyond the Ukraine war, Pope Francis will become the first pope to address a G7 summit, adding a dash of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering that is being held this year in Italy's sun-drenched Puglia region. He'll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Host Italy has invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Italy's Africa initiatives. Other guests include Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves using profits from the roughly $260 billion in frozen Russian central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, to help Ukraine, and issuing a $50 billion loan from the U.S. government to Kyiv, using windfall profits from the immobilized funds as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen -- say if the war ends -- then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nOn the eve of the summit, Washington also sent strong signals of support for Ukraine, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in weekend European Parliament elections than the 2022 elections that made her Italy's first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw the far-right Alternative for Germany beat out his Social Democrats.\n\nAs a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One reported sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\n\"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 Summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit,\" said Nick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a non-exploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nItaly, which for decades has been ground zero in Europe's migration debate, has been promoting its Mattei Plan as a way to create jobs and opportunity in Africa and discourage its young people from making dangerous trips across the Mediterranean Sea. The plan involves pilot projects in areas such as education, health care, water, sanitation, agriculture and energy infrastructure.\n\nPope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasizing the grave and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector, which has been a frequent focus of the Jesuit pope who has called even traditional weapons makers \"merchants of death.\"\n\nBut Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.\n\nThe 87-year-old pope has said he would also repeat his calls for peace while holding a half-dozen bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the summit.\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it will be sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nAs with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. One group is staging a \"dinner for the poor\" on Friday night calling for \"peace, the rights of peoples and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Angela Charlton and Sylvie Corbet in Paris contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

And we have every confidence that regardless of who gets what seat in the EU Parliament that we're going to be able to continue to work with all of our allies and partners,\" White House spokesperson John Kirby said.\n\nBiden focused his speeches in France last week on the importance of alliances and promoting and strengthening democracy. In the days since, Europe has seen a surge in far-right leaders making gains in elections at the same time Biden's opponent in November, Trump, continues to push an \"America First\" vision.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron called snap national elections after his pro-European centrist party demonstrated a weaker return in European parliamentary elections compared to far-right parties Sunday. Macron announced the move shortly after hosting Biden for a high-profile state visit in Paris following the anniversary events in Normandy.\n\nKirby added in response to the results that \"the president will work with the democratically elected leaders of France, no matter who they are.\"\n\nGermany's conservative opposition party also garnered more votes for the European Parliament compared to the center-left party of Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\n\nThe summit, which spans from Thursday to Saturday, comes at a fraught moment amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nIsraeli forces on Sunday freed four hostages being held by Hamas, but the raid killed more than 200 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council approved a resolution Monday sponsored by the United States calling for an immediate, temporary cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. Biden announced the proposal last month in his clearest indication yet that he's ready for the war to end, declaring at the time that Israel has degraded Hamas to the point that it would not be able to carry out another Oct. 7 attack.\n\nBut, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will not agree to a permanent cease-fire until all the hostages are released, and that Hamas is stripped of its ability to threaten Israel militarily and that it does not govern the Gaza Strip.\n\nKirby said Tuesday the U.S. had received Hamas's reply to the cease-fire proposal and was still evaluating it.\n\nBiden is likely to hear from his European allies on the matter, as Israel's place on the world stage continues to take a hit as the war drags on given the tens of thousands of people who have died in Gaza since the start of the war in October.\n\nBiden is expected to meet in Italy with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, marking the second time in a week the two men have met while Biden is abroad. The two previously sat down in Normandy during D-Day anniversary proceedings.\n\n\"At the G7 meeting later this week, our commitment to Ukraine will continue to be right up front and clear,\" Kirby told reporters. \"We will take bolster steps to show Mr. Putin that time is not on his side and he cannot outlast us as we support Ukraine's fight for freedom,\" referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe president is skipping a Ukraine peace summit being held Saturday in Switzerland to return home for a major fundraiser in California. Vice President Harris will attend in his place.\n\nAnother major element of G7 members demonstrating their commitment to Ukraine at the summit will be to come to a consensus on seizing frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine financially.\n\nG7 members froze about $268 billion in Russian assets after the invasion in 2022 and the U.S.-led proposal reportedly calls for countries to use the profits generated on the frozen assets -- about $2.6 billion to $3.6 billion a year -- to pay back a $50 billion loan to provide Ukraine immediately.\n\nBiden and Zelensky will participate in a news conference after their meeting, and the U.S. is expected to announce new sanctions and export control actions against Russia.\n\nBiden has made a point during each of his international trips to highlight the unified front the U.S. and its allies have shown in supporting Ukraine.\n\nCongress approved roughly $61 billion in additional aid for Ukraine after a months-long standoff, giving Biden a legislative win and the ability to tout continued U.S. leadership in supporting Kyiv.\n\nBut Republicans are unlikely to go for any additional aid this year, and the prospect of Trump returning to the White House threatens U.S. support continuing beyond 2024, which could undermine Biden's pleas for allies to keep providing aid to Ukraine.\n\nBiden will enter the G7 summit with good news on the global economic front -- the world economy is stabilizing and the U.S. is powering it.\n\nThe World Bank's economic outlook released Tuesday credited a strong U.S. economy with bolstering the prospects for the global economy.\n\n\"Growth has remained buoyant in the teeth of the fiercest monetary policy tightening in four decades. U.S. dynamism, in fact, is one reason the global economy enjoys some upside potential over the next two years,\" the organization wrote.\n\nThe G7 includes the world's most advanced economies, and they are expected to discuss the improving global economy. Any praise for the U.S.'s hand in strengthening the World Bank's outlook for the international community would be significant for Biden ahead of November's election.\n\nBiden will host a side event at the G7 to promote global infrastructures and investments, the White House outlined.\n\n\"We will continue to offer a path to help countries overcome unsustainable debt burdens, to boost the World Bank's lending firepower, to mobilize additional capital for high standard infrastructure investments and to make new commitments on food and health security,\" Kirby said.\n\nBiden is set to leave for Italy the day after his son, Hunter Biden, was found guilty on all three counts in his gun trial in Wilmington, Del. Biden unexpectedly traveled to Wilmington on Tuesday after the verdict and spent the night at his Delaware home before his trip.\n\nThe president and White House are bracing for the fallout from the younger Biden's guilty verdict and the sentencing. Biden released a statement Tuesday saying he would respect the judicial process after the verdict and reiterated his support for his son.\n\nThe president also faces backlash at home over domestic policies, including his immigration executive order announced last week that would restrict asylum protections for those who cross between ports of entry if average daily crossings exceed 2,500.\n\nDemocrats and immigrant-rights groups have blasted the order as too restrictive while Biden prepares for Republicans to use the influx of migrants at the border against Biden on the campaign trail.\n\nAnd the international trip comes just two weeks before Biden is scheduled to debate Trump. Biden will reportedly spend time at Camp David preparing for the June 27 showdown.", "source": {"uri": "wtaj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WTAJ - www.wtaj.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

If [Russian President] Vladimir Putin thinks he can outlast the coalition supporting Ukraine, he's wrong,\" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters.\n\nConfronting China\n\nUnderscoring US determination to punish Moscow for its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Washington on Wednesday 12 June 2024 dramatically broadened sanctions on Moscow, including by targeting China-based companies selling semiconductors to Moscow.\n\nBy announcing new restrictions on Chinese firms on the eve of the G7 meeting, Biden is no doubt hoping to persuade Western allies to show greater resolve in confronting Beijing over its support for Russia and its industrial over-capacity.\n\nThe European Commission told automakers on Wednesday it would impose extra duties of up to 38.1% on imported Chinese electric cars from July, less than a month after Washington quadrupled duties for Chinese EVs to 100%.\n\nWhile G7 leaders are expected to express concern over high Chinese production levels, which they say disrupt global supply chains and market stability, EU diplomats warn that Europe is anxious to avoid a full-blown trade war with Beijing.\n\nEager not to appear like an elitist fortress, the G7 has thrown open its doors to a large number of outsiders this year, including Pope Francis, who is expected to give a keynote speech on Friday 14 June 2024 on both the risks and potential of AI.\n\nAmong those who have also been invited to Puglia are the leaders of some of the biggest regional powers across the globe such as India, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Algeria and Kenya.\n\nAlthough the summit is scheduled to run until Saturday 15 June 2024, many G7 chiefs will leave on Friday night, including Biden, meaning the final day has been earmarked for bilateral meetings for those staying on and a final news conference from Meloni.", "source": {"uri": "chronicle.lu", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chronicle.lu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He'll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Italy, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Italy's development and migration initiatives on the continent.\n\nOther guests include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves engineering a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia that would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen -- say if the war ends -- then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nIn addition to the deal, Sunak announced up to 242 million pounds (286 million euros or $310 million) in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine for humanitarian, energy and stabilization needs. Washington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nMeloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy's first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nAs a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\nA French official, speaking anonymously in line with Macron's office customary practices, said there were diverging views with Italian negotiators on some topics, including on sexual and reproductive health and vaccines.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed abortion was being discussed, but said discussions were continuing.\n\n\"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 Summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit,\" said Nick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a nonexploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nPope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasizing the grave and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector, which has been a frequent focus of the Jesuit pope who has called even traditional weapons makers \"merchants of death.\"\n\nBut Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it will be sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and Carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nAs with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. One group is staging a \"dinner for the poor\" on Friday night calling for \"peace, the rights of peoples and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.\"\n\nNicole Winfield reported from Bari.

If (Russian President) Vladimir Putin thinks he can outlast the coalition supporting Ukraine, he's wrong,\" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters.\n\nCONFRONTING CHINA\n\nUnderscoring US determination to punish Moscow for its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Washington on Wednesday dramatically broadened sanctions on Moscow, including by targeting China-based companies selling semiconductors to Moscow.\n\nBy announcing new restrictions on Chinese firms on the eve of the G7 meeting, Biden is no doubt hoping to persuade Western allies to show greater resolve in confronting Beijing over its support for Russia and its industrial over-capacity.\n\nThe European Commission told automakers on Wednesday it would impose extra duties of up to 38.1% on imported Chinese electric cars from July, less than a month after Washington quadrupled duties for Chinese EVs to 100%.\n\nWhile G7 leaders are expected to express concern over high Chinese production levels, which they say disrupt global supply chains and market stability, EU diplomats warn that Europe is anxious to avoid a full-blown trade war with Beijing.\n\nThe G7 has thrown open its doors to a large number of outsiders this year, including Pope Francis, who is expected to give a keynote speech on Friday on both the risks and potential of AI.\n\nAmong those who have also been invited to Puglia are the leaders of India, Brazil, Argentina, T\u00fcrkiye, Algeria and Kenya.\n\nAlthough the summit is scheduled to run until Saturday, many G7 chiefs will leave on Friday night, including Biden, meaning the final day has been earmarked for bilateral meetings for those staying on and a final news conference from Meloni.", "source": {"uri": "english.aawsat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asharq

If (Russian President) Vladimir Putin thinks he can outlast the coalition supporting Ukraine, he's wrong,\" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters.\n\nConfronting China\n\nUnderscoring U.S. determination to punish Moscow for its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Washington on June 12 dramatically broadened sanctions on Moscow, including by targeting China-based companies selling semiconductors to Moscow.\n\nBy announcing new restrictions on Chinese firms on the eve of the G7 meeting, Mr. Biden is no doubt hoping to persuade Western allies to show greater resolve in confronting Beijing over its support for Russia and its industrial over-capacity.\n\nThe European Commission told automakers on Wednesday it would impose extra duties of up to 38.1% on imported Chinese electric cars from July, less than a month after Washington quadrupled duties for Chinese EVs to 100%.\n\nWhile G7 leaders are expected to express concern over high Chinese production levels, which they say disrupt global supply chains and market stability, EU diplomats warn that Europe is anxious to avoid a full-blown trade war with Beijing.\n\nEager not to appear like an elitist fortress, the G7 has thrown open its doors to a large number of outsiders this year, including Pope Francis, who is expected to give a keynote speech on Friday on both the risks and potential of AI.\n\nAmong those who have also been invited to Puglia are the leaders of some of the biggest regional powers across the globe such as India, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Algeria and Kenya.\n\nAlthough the summit is scheduled to run until Saturday, many G7 chiefs will leave on Friday night, including Mr. Biden, meaning the final day has been earmarked for bilateral meetings for those staying on and a final news conference from Ms. Meloni.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau is headed to Italy on Wednesday to attend the annual G7 leaders' summit, which is taking place as two major geopolitical conflicts weigh on the international community.\n\nThe three-day summit kicks off on Thursday in Apulia, Italy, where leaders of the seven wealthy democratic nations are expected to discuss the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars, the energy transition, artificial intelligence, migration and collaboration with Africa.\n\nTrudeau is also set to attend the Ukraine Peace Summit in Switzerland on Saturday and Sunday before flying back to Ottawa.\n\n\"It's an unprecedentedly large, interconnected, complex and demanding agenda,\" said John Kirton, a political-science professor who heads the G7 research group at the University of Toronto.\n\nLeaders of G7 countries -- Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and Japan -- meet annually to collaborate on shared goals.\n\n\"In a world in which many international institutions have become paralyzed because of divisions, it is even more important for this group of like-minded democracies to be able to work together,\" said Roland Paris, an international affairs professor at the University of Ottawa who previously served as a senior adviser to Trudeau.\n\nAmong Canada's top priorities at the summit will be the clean energy transition, misinformation and foreign interference, as well as artificial intelligence.\n\nIn a publication previewing the G7 leaders' summit co-edited by Kirton, Trudeau emphasized the clean energy transition as a \"once-in-a-generation opportunity that Canada along with our G7 partners are helping lead.\"\n\nTrudeau is also expected to hold bilateral meetings with other world leaders. Canada is set to host the G7 summit next year.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni hosts this week's summit as the most stable of the alliance's European Union leaders, after her German and French counterparts were shaken by European parliamentary elections.\n\nThe results fortified Meloni's far-right Brothers of Italy as the strongest party in the country, setting her up as a possible bridge-maker, if not kingmaker, in Europe.\n\nAs the host country, Italy is focusing the summit on defending the \"rules-based international system.\"\n\n\"Russia's war of aggression on Ukraine has undermined its principles and triggered growing instability, with multiple crises unfolding worldwide. The G7 will give equal importance to the conflict in the Middle East, with its consequences for the global agenda,\" the country's G7 website said.\n\nParis said he doesn't expect major news on the Israel-Hamas war from the leaders, though he noted real-time events unfolding in the Middle East may prompt the group to respond.\n\nThe G7 leaders put out a statement last week endorsing the peace plan unveiled by U.S. President Joe Biden that would include an immediate ceasefire, the release of all Israeli hostages by Hamas and increased humanitarian assistance for Gazans.\n\nArguably the most anticipated outcome of the summit may be a decision on using frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine.\n\nLast month, G7 finance ministers said they had moved toward agreement on a U.S. proposal to squeeze more money for Ukraine out of Russian assets frozen in their countries.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is pushing for an approach that would borrow against the future interest income from the frozen assets. It could give Ukraine as much as $50 billion immediately.\n\nBut the ministers left a final deal to be worked out ahead of the June summit of national leaders.\n\n\"I think, finally, the leaders themselves will make the long-awaited decision,\" Kirton said.\n\nParis said Ukraine is in need of three things: weapons, personnel and money. Canada, he said, is only able to help with one of those things.\n\n\"We're not going to be able to provide people, our weapons stocks are limited. So we need to be supporting Ukraine financially,\" he said.\n\nThe G7 summit will be followed by the Ukraine Peace Summit hosted by Switzerland.\n\nSwitzerland's president Viola Amherd said on Monday that nearly 90 countries and organizations, half of them from Europe, have confirmed their attendance.\n\nRussia will not attend the summit, which was organized at the request of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nSwiss officials said the conference aims to set a course toward \"lasting peace\" in Ukraine, to reach a \"common understanding\" toward getting there and to draw up a road map for how to get both sides involved in talks.\n\n-- With files from The Associated Press.", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

He said there is a $300 billion stash \"sitting in Europe from Russian sovereign wealth assets\" that should be seized and used to provide more financial aid in Ukraine's defense against Russia.\n\nHe further said that \"we have Russian money in America we should seize,\" adding that the government can turn Russia into a \"state sponsor of terrorism under U.S. law.\"\n\nSo far, U.S. President Joe Biden has confirmed that he had reached an agreement with French President Emmanuel Macron on using profits from frozen Russian assets to provide further aid for Ukraine as it defends itself from Russian attacks.\n\nIt remains to be seen how other G7 countries will take news about the U.S.-France agreement, but Russia has said any diversion of profits from its frozen funds will be considered theft.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marvie_basilan@ibtimes.com", "name": "Marvie Basilan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(meeting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summit (meeting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsey_Graham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lindsey Graham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_the_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Face the Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Loans", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Loans", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Frozen", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Frozen", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4529609/biden-promised-more-aid-ukraine.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644722", "eventUri": "eng-9644722", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is on hand and is expected to sign a separate bilateral security agreement with U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nBeyond the the war in Ukraine, Pope Francis will become the first pope to address a G7 summit, adding a dash of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering that is being held this year in Italy's sun-drenched Puglia region. He'll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Italy, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Italy's development and migration initiatives on the continent.\n\nOther guests include Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves engineering a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia that would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen -- say if the war ends -- then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nIn addition to the deal, Sunak announced up to 242 million pounds (286 million euros or $310 million) in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine for humanitarian, energy and stabilization needs. Washington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy's first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nAs a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\nA French official, speaking anonymously in line with Macron's office customary practices, said there were diverging views with Italian negotiators on some topics, including on sexual and reproductive health and vaccines.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed abortion was being discussed, but said discussions were continuing.\n\n\"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 Summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit,\" said Nick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a nonexploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nPope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasizing the grave and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector, which has been a frequent focus of the Jesuit pope who has called even traditional weapons makers \"merchants of death.\"\n\nBut Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it will be sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and Carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nAs with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. One group is staging a \"dinner for the poor\" on Friday night calling for \"peace, the rights of peoples and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.\"\n\nAngela Charlton and Sylvie Corbet contributed to this report from Paris.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

Profits are estimated at \u20ac3 billion ($3.24 billion) a year.\n\nBut the US has pushed for a larger loan of $50 billion, raising questions about what would happen if the seized Russian state assets were released or did not generate as much profit as expected.\n\n\"There is a question of burden sharing,\" the adviser to Mr Macron said.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nA Group of Seven summit is opening Thursday with agreement on a U.S. proposal to back a $50 billion loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral, giving Kyiv a strong show of support even as Europe's political chessboard shifts to the right.\n\nDiplomats confirmed that an agreement had been reached on the deal before the leaders even landed in southern Italy for the three-day summit. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is on hand and is expected to sign a separate bilateral security agreement with U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nBeyond the the war in Ukraine, Pope Francis will become the first pope to address a G7 summit, adding a dash of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering that is being held this year in Italy's sun-drenched Puglia region. He'll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Italy, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Italy's development and migration initiatives on the continent.\n\nOther guests include Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nFrozen Russian assets to support Ukraine\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves engineering a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia that would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen -- say if the war ends -- then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nIn addition to the deal, Sunak announced up to 242 million pounds (286 million euros or $310 million) in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine for humanitarian, energy and stabilization needs. Washington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nEurope's new political chessboard\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy's first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nAs a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\nA French official, speaking anonymously in line with Macron's office customary practices, said there were diverging views with Italian negotiators on some topics, including on sexual and reproductive health and vaccines.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed abortion was being discussed, but said discussions were continuing.\n\n\"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 Summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit,\" said Nick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a nonexploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nThe pope and artificial intelligence\n\nPope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasizing the grave and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector, which has been a frequent focus of the Jesuit pope who has called even traditional weapons makers \"merchants of death.\"\n\nBut Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.\n\nIt's happening where?\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it will be sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and Carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nAs with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. One group is staging a \"dinner for the poor\" on Friday night calling for \"peace, the rights of peoples and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.\"\n\n___\n\nAngela Charlton and Sylvie Corbet contributed to this report from Paris.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [],

The entire Ukrainian people, including our warriors, see that the G7 will always support Ukraine,\" Zelensky said.\n\nWhile most of the summit will focus on Ukraine's economy and defense, key topics will include the development of a fighter jet coalition, boosting the country's air defense system, and increasing long-range capabilities, according to the president.\n\nThe leaders are also expected to approve a format for using Russian assets to benefit Ukraine.

Biden and Trump are running against each other in the November presidential election and are neck-and-neck in the polls.\n\nThe heads of the world's most developed democracies will address multiple challenges during the June 13-15 meeting, including wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, trade imbalances with China, threats posed by artificial intelligence and development challenges in Africa.\n\nThe leaders will announce new sanctions and export controls against Russia that target entities and networks helping President Vladimir Putin's forces fight the war in Ukraine, White House spokesperson John Kirby said on Tuesday. \"We're going to continue to drive up costs for the Russian war machine,\" Kirby said.\n\nWashington plans to widen sanctions on the sale of semiconductor chips and other goods to Russia, with the goal of targeting third-party sellers in China, sources familiar with the plans said late on Tuesday.\n\nThe administration will announce it is broadening existing export controls to include U.S.-branded goods, not just those made in the United States, the sources said. It will identify certain Hong Kong entities it says are shipping goods to Moscow.\n\nShoring up funding for Ukraine will be a top priority at the G7 meeting, with U.S. and European officials eager to lock in solutions, ahead of a possible Trump re-election and the uncertainty it would raise over future U.S. support for Kyiv.\n\nThe Group of Seven nations and the European Union are considering how to use profits generated by Russian assets immobilized in the West to provide Ukraine with a large up-front loan to secure Kyiv's financing for 2025.\n\n\"We will announce new steps to unlock the value of the immobilized Russian sovereign assets to benefit Ukraine and to help them recover from the destruction that Mr. Putin's army has caused,\" Kirby said.\n\nBiden will press other G7 leaders to agree to an innovative plan to use future interest on some $281 billion of Russian central bank funds to back up a $50 billion loan to Ukraine.\n\nG7 leaders also face electoral challenges, with polls indicating British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will likely to lose power in a national vote next month, and the leaders of France and Germany reeling from heavy defeats in recent European elections.\n\nBiden will meet again with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, followed by a joint press conference, Kirby said.\n\n(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Additional reporting by Jarrett

Everyone in Puglia is aware this could be Biden's last G7 summit if he loses to Donald Trump in November US elections.\n\nBritain's Rishi Sunak is tipped to be ousted in July 4 elections, while France's Macron and Germany's Olaf Scholz are both under pressure after gains by the far right in EU elections last weekend.\n\nThe G7 summit opens Thursday morning with a short session on Africa, development and climate change, before turning to the Middle East.\n\nThe leaders have already announced their support for a Gaza truce deal outlined by Biden, which would also see the release of hostages taken in Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel.\n\nJordan's King Abdullah II -- a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause whose country signed a peace treaty with Israel 30 years ago -- is among around a dozen non-G7 guests also attending who are not, however, participating in the working sessions.\n\nThey include Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, UAE president Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed and India's Narendra Modi.\n\nBrazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva -- whose country holds the rotating G20 presidency this year -- as well as Argentina's Javier Milei and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres also plan to attend.\n\nAll the guests are invited to a dinner Friday night at the Borgo Egnazia luxury hotel complex, built in the style of a traditional village.\n\nWith security extremely tight, the venue is far away from protesters and journalists, with the media centre located some 60 kilometres away in Bari.\n\nAnother key issue in Puglia, to be discussed Friday, will be concerns about China's so-called \"industrial overcapacity\", particularly in green energy and technology sectors such as solar panels and electric vehicles.\n\nThe US, EU and Japan have all voiced concern that generous subsidies from Beijing are resulting in a flood of cheap goods hitting the global market, threatening Western firms.\n\nbur-ar/ide/yad/smw\n\nMore from this

In what could be his last foray on the world stage as PM, Mr Sunak will join leaders including US President Joe Biden and France's Emmanuel Macron at the summit for crunch talks on how to utilise $285billion of frozen Russian assets held in G7 countries to help Ukraine.\n\nFunds left in Western institutions when Vladimir Putin first launched Russia 's bloody assault in 2022 have been left in limbo while leaders try to hammer out a way to use the cash to help Kyiv. One plan on the table would use the massive profits generated from the frozen cash to back a $50billion loan to Ukraine, to shore up its finances next year.\n\nG7 leaders are racing against time to unlock the cash, but there are disagreements over whether the EU or the US should be on the hook for the loan. President Volodymr Zelensky, who is expected to attend the G7 summit, desperately needs funds to repel Russia and there is mounting uncertainty over the strength of American backing for Ukraine if Donald Trump wins the US Presidential election in November.\n\nMr Sunak will also announced \u00a3242million in immediate aid for Ukraine from Britain, to help with humanitarian needs as well as energy after a sustained Russian bombing campaign on critical infrastructure.\n\nThe Prime Minister said: \"We must be decisive and creative in our efforts to support Ukraine and end Putin's illegal war at this critical moment.\n\n\"The UK remains at the forefront of the international response as we have been from the outset. We must move from 'as long as it takes' to 'whatever it takes' if we are to end this illegal war.\n\n\"From Ukraine to the Middle East, we will be discussing significant global threats at the Summit. Such threats are why it is so vital to strengthen the UK's national defence, through our commitment to spend 2.5% of GDP on defence by 2030.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lizzy_buchan@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Lizzy Buchan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(meeting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summit (meeting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Loans", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Loans", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Frozen", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Frozen", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Conferences", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Cash_Registers", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Cash Registers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article29179872.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_BRITAIN-UKRAINE-RUSSIA-CONFLICT-DIPLOMACY.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644722", "eventUri": "eng-9644722", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Biden and Trump are running against each other in the November presidential election and are neck-and-neck in the polls.\n\nThe heads of the world's most developed democracies will address multiple challenges during the June 13-15 meeting, including wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, trade imbalances with China, threats posed by artificial intelligence and development challenges in Africa.\n\nThe leaders will announce new sanctions and export controls against Russia that target entities and networks helping President Vladimir Putin's forces fight the war in Ukraine, White House spokesperson John Kirby said on Tuesday.\n\n\"We're going to continue to drive up costs for the Russian war machine,\" Kirby said.\n\nWashington plans to widen sanctions on the sale of semiconductor chips and other goods to Russia, with the goal of targeting third-party sellers in China, sources familiar with the plans said late on Tuesday.\n\nThe administration will announce it is broadening existing export controls to include U.S.-branded goods, not just those made in the United States, the sources said. It will identify certain Hong Kong entities it says are shipping goods to Moscow.\n\nShoring up funding for Ukraine will be a top priority at the G7 meeting, with U.S. and European officials eager to lock in solutions, ahead of a possible Trump re-election and the uncertainty it would raise over future U.S. support for Kyiv.\n\nThe Group of Seven nations and the European Union are considering how to use profits generated by Russian assets immobilized in the West to provide Ukraine with a large up-front loan to secure Kyiv's financing for 2025.\n\n\"We will announce new steps to unlock the value of the immobilized Russian sovereign assets to benefit Ukraine and to help them recover from the destruction that Mr. Putin's army has caused,\" Kirby said.\n\nBiden will press other G7 leaders to agree to an innovative plan to use future interest on some $281 billion of Russian central bank funds to back up a $50 billion loan to Ukraine.\n\nG7 leaders also face electoral challenges, with polls indicating British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will likely to lose power in a national vote next month, and the leaders of France and Germany reeling from heavy defeats in recent European elections.\n\nBiden will meet again with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, followed by a joint press conference, Kirby said.\n\nReporting by Andrea Shalal; Additional reporting by Jarrett

They reached an agreement in principle on a $50 billion loan plan for Ukraine using Russian sovereign assets. Leaders also discussed supporting African economies and counteracting China's industrial overcapacity.\n\nLeaders of the Group of Seven major democracies started their annual summit on Thursday, many of them under a cloud at home but determined to make a difference on the world stage as they seek to help Ukraine and counter China's economic ambitions. Heading into two days of talks, diplomats said a deal had been agreed in principle on plans to issue $50 billion of loans for Ukraine using interest from Russian sovereign assets frozen after Moscow launched its invasion of its neighbour in 2022.\n\nWestern nations were also unanimous in their concern over China's industrial overcapacity, which they say is distorting global markets, and their determination to help African states develop their economies, diplomats said. \"There is a lot of work to be done, but I am sure that in these two days we will be able to have discussions that will lead to concrete and measurable results,\" Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni told her G7 guests as their talks started in a luxury hotel resort in the southern region of Puglia.\n\nWhile Meloni is flying high after triumphing in weekend European elections, the leaders of the other six nations - the United States, Japan, France, Germany, Britain and Canada - face major domestic woes that risk undermining their authority. U.S. President Joe Biden faces an uphill battle to win re-election in November, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak looks certain to lose power at a national poll next month and French President Emmanuel Macron dissolved his country's parliament on Sunday after his party was trounced in the European vote.\n\nAll smiled broadly as they greeted Meloni under a blazing sun at the entrance to the Borgo Egnazia resort where they will spend the next two days in sessions that will later be opened to a host of fellow leaders, including Pope Francis. For a second year running, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will attend the summit, taking part in talks on Thursday afternoon, after which he will sign a new, long-term security accord with U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nThe G7 leaders will also almost certainly announce that they have agreed the outline of a multi-year loan using profits from the impounded Russian funds, which legal experts will then finalise with the aim of raising cash by the end of the year. \"I think we will have the major tentpoles of this decided, but some of the specifics left to be worked through by experts on a defined timetable,\" White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said of the discussions.\n\nA person close to the talks said the point of deal was to ensure it can run for years regardless of who is in power in each G7 state - a nod to concerns that U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump might be much less favourable to Kyiv if he beats Biden in November. PACKED AGENDA\n\nBiden's goal at the G7 was to reinforce the idea that the United States is best served if it is closely aligned with its democratic allies, Sullivan said, when asked about the prospects of it being the president's last summit given the looming re-election battle. Underscoring U.S. determination to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine, Washington on Wednesday dramatically broadened sanctions on Moscow, including by targeting China-based companies selling semiconductors to Moscow.\n\nBy announcing new restrictions on Chinese firms on the eve of the G7 meeting, Biden was no doubt hoping to persuade Western allies to show greater resolve in confronting Beijing over its support for Russia and its industrial over-capacity. Speaking ahead of the start of the summit, Sullivan said that China was a significant creditor to many heavily indebted countries.\n\n\"The G7 communique is not singling out or focusing on a single country,\" he said, but added that China needed to play a constructive role in dealing with the debt burden. Eager not to appear like an elitist fortress, the G7 has thrown open its doors to a large number of outsiders this year, including the pope, who is expected to give a keynote speech on Friday on the risks and potential of Artificial Intelligence.\n\nAmong those who have also been invited to Puglia are the leaders of some of the biggest regional powers across the globe such as India, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Algeria and Kenya. Although the summit is scheduled to run until Saturday, many G7 chiefs will leave on Friday night, including Biden, meaning the final day has been earmarked for bilateral meetings for those staying on and a closing news conference from Meloni.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType":

Discussions include issuing $50 billion in loans for Ukraine and addressing China's industrial overcapacity. Despite domestic challenges, leaders aim for actionable outcomes, with participation from global figures like Pope Francis and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nLeaders of the Group of Seven major democracies started their annual summit on Thursday, many of them under a cloud at home but determined to make a difference on the world stage as they seek to help Ukraine and counter China's economic ambitions. Heading into two days of talks, diplomats said a deal had been agreed in principle on plans to issue $50 billion of loans for Ukraine using interest from Russian sovereign assets frozen after Moscow launched its invasion of its neighbour in 2022.\n\nWestern nations were also unanimous in their concern over China's industrial overcapacity, which they say is distorting global markets, and their determination to help African states develop their economies, diplomats said. \"There is a lot of work to be done, but I am sure that in these two days we will be able to have discussions that will lead to concrete and measurable results,\" Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni told her G7 guests as their talks started in a luxury hotel resort in the southern region of Puglia.\n\nWhile Meloni is flying high after triumphing in weekend European elections, the leaders of the other six nations - the United States, Japan, France, Germany, Britain and Canada - face major domestic woes that risk undermining their authority. U.S. President Joe Biden faces an uphill battle to win re-election in November, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak looks certain to lose power at a national poll next month and French President Emmanuel Macron dissolved his country's parliament on Sunday after his party was trounced in the European vote.\n\nAll smiled broadly as they greeted Meloni under a blazing sun at the entrance to the Borgo Egnazia resort where they will spend the next two days in sessions that will later be opened to a host of fellow leaders, including Pope Francis. For a second year running, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will attend the summit, taking part in talks on Thursday afternoon, after which he will sign a new, long-term security accord with U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nThe G7 leaders will also almost certainly announce that they have agreed the outline of a multi-year loan using profits from the impounded Russian funds, which legal experts will then finalise with the aim of raising cash by the end of the year. \"I think we will have the major tentpoles of this decided, but some of the specifics left to be worked through by experts on a defined timetable,\" White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said of the discussions.\n\nA senior EU official confirmed there was an outline agreement. \"I think it's done,\" the official said. \"It should be fine. I don't expect leaders to say...(anything against it).\"\n\nA person close to the talks said the point of deal was to ensure it can run for years regardless of who is in power in each G7 state - a nod to concerns that U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump might be much less favourable to Kyiv if he beats Biden in November. PACKED AGENDA\n\nBiden's goal at the G7 was to reinforce the idea that the United States is best served if it is closely aligned with its democratic allies, Sullivan said, when asked about the prospects of it being the president's last summit given the looming re-election battle. Underscoring U.S. determination to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine, Washington on Wednesday dramatically broadened sanctions on Moscow, including by targeting China-based companies selling semiconductors to Moscow.\n\nBy announcing new restrictions on Chinese firms on the eve of the G7 meeting, Biden was no doubt hoping to persuade Western allies to show greater resolve in confronting Beijing over its support for Russia and its industrial over-capacity. Speaking ahead of the start of the summit, Sullivan said that China was a significant creditor to many heavily indebted countries.\n\n\"The G7 communique is not singling out or focusing on a single country,\" he said, but added that China needed to play a constructive role in dealing with the debt burden. Eager not to appear like an elitist fortress, the G7 has thrown open its doors to a large number of outsiders this year, including the pope, who is expected to give a keynote speech on Friday on the risks and potential of Artificial Intelligence.\n\nAmong those who have also been invited to Puglia are the leaders of some of the biggest regional powers across the globe such as India, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Algeria and Kenya. Although the summit is scheduled to run until Saturday, many G7 chiefs will leave on Friday night, including Biden, meaning the final day has been earmarked for bilateral meetings for those staying on and a closing news conference from Meloni.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType":

The meeting will take place in Puglia at the Borgo Egnazia hotel.\n\nThe G7 includes the United States, Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom. The European Union takes part in all discussions and is represented by the Presidents of both the European Council and the European Commission.\n\nThe summit is scheduled to begin on Thursday with discussions on the African continent, climate change and development. Leaders will then discuss the situation in the Middle East before two sessions dedicated to Ukraine, the first of which will be attended by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nMuch attention will be paid to whether the G7 leaders will be able to agree on how to use the profits from Russian assets frozen in the West to benefit Ukraine.\n\nThe White House also expects that the G7 will send a stern warning next week to medium and small Chinese banks that are helping Russia evade Western sanctions.\n\nSources in Washington said that the United States was ready to announce significant new sanctions against financial institutions and non-banking organisations that were part of the \"technology and goods supply channels\" for the Russian defence industrial base. It is not yet known whether other G7 members are ready to follow the US hard line.\n\nOfficially, the summit will last until 15 June, but President Joe Biden leaves for Italy on the night of 13-14

Most of that money is in the European Union.\n\nOne of the options being discussed is a US proposal to give a $50bn loan to Ukraine. That money would be paid back by the interest accrued on Russian assets, which generate up to $3.7bn a year in profits. But there are thorny financial and logistic issues at play.\n\nThe US wants guarantees that the interest is secure. Washington's concerns are heightened because the decision to freeze assets has to be unanimously renewed every six months by all EU member states. Should any EU government oppose the scheme, such as Hungary for example due to its ties with Russia, then the US would find itself without the money to repay the loan.\n\nAnd what if the warring sides sit at a negotiating table and Russia gets its assets back - who would pay for what remains of the loan? Would Moscow agree to pay? EU and Group of Seven (G7) countries are still sorting out details on how to share the eventual risk.\n\nEU countries are divided. Germany and France are sceptical, while the EU Commission and Council are also not fully convinced, diplomatic sources with knowledge of the talks told Al Jazeera.\n\nA third source said there is political will towards an agreement at the summit, even if technical problems need ironing out.\n\nShould these not be resolved by the end of the summit, efforts would still be made to find a formula to communicate that negotiations continue, they said.\n\n\"This is a priority for the United States. We believe it's a priority for the entire G7,\" US President Joe Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said last week. \"We want to see every country come on board with a method by which we can mobilise resources for Ukraine at scale so that they are able to have what they need to be able to succeed in this war.\"\n\nIdeas on what to do with the assets have been floating around since the start of the conflict.\n\nThe US initially insisted on seizing them outright, but European countries have been reluctant. Such an epic seizure would have been a first in international law and it would have jeopardised trust in the euro as an international reserve currency.\n\nMoscow has made it clear that any seizure would have amounted to theft.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin sent a warning shot in May by giving authorities jurisdiction over US-owned property in Russia to compensate for damages from any future bids to take Russian assets.\n\nThe idea of a US loan emerged as a potential compromise, even if the difference in the amount between seizing the assets and using their profits is stark - from $260bn to $50bn.\n\nStill, a final agreement - or a show of intent - would send a strong message of unity against Russia, observers say.\n\n\"The US wants to bring this as a tangible result to the G7 - so there will be a deal, but it will be limited and with thousands of strings attached,\" said Marta Dassu, director of European affairs at the Aspen Institute think-tank and a former deputy minister of Italy's foreign affairs office.\n\nThis year's G7 is being held in Europe, with the Russian-Ukraine conflict topping the agenda, Dassu said, noting that the summit will have a strong political component compared to traditional G7 themes usually focused on global economic governance.\n\nThe November US presidential elections are also in the frame.\n\nThis is the last G7 before a potential shift in the White House administration that could have radical consequences for Ukraine should former US President Donald Trump win.\n\nThe last package of military aid to Ukraine, worth $61bn, was wrangled over in the US Congress for months, suggesting that even if Biden is re-elected, further painful fights for aid lie ahead.\n\nWestern aid is fundamental for Ukraine as the war drags on for a third consecutive year. The delay in sending US military aid paved the way for Russia to make steady territorial gains - for which Biden apologised.\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be in Puglia on Thursday.\n\nAt the last G7 summit, while Kyiv was still calling for support, its forces were in the middle of a counteroffensive which they hoped would be decisive in pushing back Russian forces. But Ukrainian soldiers are on the back foot presently, with Moscow making steady gains in the east and north of the country.\n\nAccording to some observers, a $50bn loan would ensure Kyiv has financing for 2025, regardless of who wins the US election in November.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Biden and Trump are running against each other in the November presidential election and are neck-and-neck in the polls.\n\nThe heads of the world's most developed democracies will address multiple challenges during the June 13-15 meeting, including wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, trade imbalances with China, threats posed by artificial intelligence and development challenges in Africa.\n\nThe leaders will announce new sanctions and export controls against Russia that target entities and networks helping President Vladimir Putin's forces fight the war in Ukraine, White House spokesperson John Kirby said on Tuesday. \"We're going to continue to drive up costs for the Russian war machine,\" Kirby said.\n\nWashington plans to widen sanctions on the sale of semiconductor chips and other goods to Russia, with the goal of targeting third-party sellers in China, sources familiar with the plans said late on Tuesday.\n\nThe administration will announce it is broadening existing export controls to include U.S.-branded goods, not just those made in the United States, the sources said. It will identify certain Hong Kong entities it says are shipping goods to Moscow.\n\nShoring up funding for Ukraine will be a top priority at the G7 meeting, with U.S. and European officials eager to lock in solutions, ahead of a possible Trump re-election and the uncertainty it would raise over future U.S. support for Kyiv.\n\nThe Group of Seven nations and the European Union are considering how to use profits generated by Russian assets immobilized in the West to provide Ukraine with a large up-front loan to secure Kyiv's financing for 2025.\n\n\"We will announce new steps to unlock the value of the immobilized Russian sovereign assets to benefit Ukraine and to help them recover from the destruction that Mr. Putin's army has caused,\" Kirby said.\n\nBiden will press other G7 leaders to agree to an innovative plan to use future interest on some $281 billion of Russian central bank funds to back up a $50 billion loan to Ukraine.\n\nG7 leaders also face electoral challenges, with polls indicating British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will likely to lose power in a national vote next month, and the leaders of France and Germany reeling from heavy defeats in recent European elections.\n\nBiden will meet again with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, followed by a joint press conference, Kirby said.\n\n(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Additional reporting by Jarrett

to use frozen Russian assets for Ukraine", "body": "The G7 summit in Italy was opening on Thursday with an agreement on a US proposal to back a 50 billion dollar (\u00a339 billion) loan to Ukraine using frozen Russian assets as collateral, giving Kyiv a strong show of support even as Europe's political chessboard shifts to the right.\n\nDiplomats confirmed an agreement had been reached on the deal before the leaders even landed for the three-day gathering.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to sign a separate bilateral security agreement with US President Joe Biden.\n\nBeyond the the war in Ukraine, Pope Francis will become the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, adding a dash of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering that is being held this year in Borgo Egnazia in southern Italy's sun-drenched Puglia region.\n\nHe will be speaking on Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nItaly, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders - Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied - to press Italy's development and migration initiatives on the continent.\n\nOther guests include Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Mr Biden, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure is on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nThe US proposal involves engineering a 50 billion dollar (\u00a339 billion) loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia which would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.\n\nThe issue is complicated because if the Russian assets are eventually unfrozen - for example, if the war ends - then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nIn addition to the deal, Mr Sunak announced up to \u00a3242 million (310 million dollars) in non-military aid to Ukraine for humanitarian, energy and stabilization needs.\n\nWashington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy's first female premier.\n\nKnown for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nMr Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nAs a result, Ms Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said.\n\nIn one sign of her flexed far-right muscles, Ms Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy is trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\nA French official said there are diverging views with Italian negotiators on some topics, including on sexual and reproductive health and vaccines.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed abortion is being discussed, but said talks are continuing.\n\nNick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council, said: \"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit.\"\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as she seeks to leverage her programme for a non-exploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening

The leaders, weakened by elections, scandals, and waning influence, are meeting against a backdrop of anti-incumbent sentiments in Western democracies. This raises questions about the effectiveness of the G7 in addressing global issues amidst discontent from their own populations.\n\nThe summit comes after far-right parties made gains in European Parliamentary elections and ahead of critical votes in France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. There is concern about a populist resurgence and a rightward shift driven by issues like migration and the defense of Ukraine, which will be key topics at the summit.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will attend the summit and hold a joint press conference with US President Joe Biden. The leaders are under pressure to address the situation in Ukraine, with plans to provide financial support to rebuild the country's infrastructure using frozen Russian assets. Biden also plans to present a new security pact with Ukraine, emphasizing the importance of the US-Ukraine relationship.\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place against a backdrop of leadership changes in the United States and other countries, adding urgency to the discussions. The leaders are aware of the need to make progress on key issues like China and global security before potential shifts in leadership occur.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the summit's host, appears to be on the most stable political ground among the G7 leaders.

The G7 leaders, who will meet beginning today in Italy, seem on the brink of announcing a compromise.\n\nEuropean leaders feared that seizing the assets would violate international law. So the Biden administration devised a plan to use interest generated by them to back a loan that could be delivered immediately to Ukraine.\n\nThe loan could be as large as $50 billion and would be repaid over time with the profits being generated from Russia's money. Finance ministers from the G7 have been working out the details, and a U.S. spokesman said he anticipated \"unanimity\" on efforts toward it at the summit.\n\nThe leaders are also slated to tackle the question of how to stop China from bolstering Russia by selling it \"dual use\" microelectronics and other gear to rebuild its military. The Biden administration announced yesterday that it would add sanctions aimed at stopping China from helping the Kremlin in its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn related news, Ukraine plans to sell around 20 state-owned companies to fund the war and help its economy.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-owned_enterprise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State-owned enterprise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Physical_Asset_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Physical Asset Management", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/World_War_II_Dormant_Accounts", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/World War II Dormant Accounts", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Commercial_Lending", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Commercial Lending", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/12/multimedia/13ambriefing-asia-nl-g7-2/13ambriefing-asia-nl-g7-2-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644722", "eventUri": "eng-9644722", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

President Volodymyr Zelensky will attend the summit, taking part in talks on Thursday\n\nBARI: Group of Seven leaders will aim to boost funding for Ukraine in its war with Russia and offer a united face in confronting China's political and economic ambitions at their annual summit in southern Italy on Thursday.\n\nFor a second year running, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will attend the summit, taking part in talks on Thursday, and he is due to sign a new, long-term security accord with US President Joe Biden.\n\nThe G7 leaders look likely to announce they have agreed at least in principle on plans to issue $50 billion of loans for Ukraine using interest from Russian sovereign assets frozen after its invasion of Ukraine to back the multi-year debt package.\n\n\"I think we will have the major tentpoles of this decided, but some of the specifics left to be worked through by experts on a defined timetable,\" White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said of the discussions.\n\n\"I think we are on the verge of a good outcome here,\" he added.\n\nOfficials acknowledge the plan is complex, with legal experts still having to thrash out the details that will need the backing of European nations, particularly Belgium, which is not in the G7.\n\nPacked Agenda\n\nWith the Middle East, migration and artificial intelligence also on a packed agenda, the June 13-15 summit in the southern Italian region of Puglia would be taxing for leaders at the best of times, but most of them are also bowed down by their own domestic woes.\n\nOnly the host, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, is riding high after triumphing in Italy's European election last weekend, but achieving meaningful results in the luxury Borgo Egnazia hotel resort will be a tall order.\n\nBiden's goal at the G7 was to reinforce the idea that the United States is best served if it is closely aligned with its democratic allies and partners, Sullivan said, when asked about the prospects of it being the president's last summit given he faces a re-election battle in November.\n\nUnderscoring US determination to punish Moscow for its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Washington on Wednesday dramatically broadened sanctions on Moscow, including by targeting China-based companies selling semiconductors to Moscow.\n\nBy announcing new restrictions on Chinese firms on the eve of the G7 meeting, Biden is no doubt hoping to persuade Western allies to show greater resolve in confronting Beijing over its support for Russia and its industrial over-capacity.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the start of the summit, Sullivan said that China was a significant creditor to many heavily indebted countries.\n\n\"The G7 communique is not singling out or focusing on a single country,\" he said,

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be on hand and is expected to sign a separate bilateral security agreement with US President Joe Biden.\n\nIn the meantime, Pope Francis will become the first leader of the Catholic Church to address a Group of Seven summit, adding a dash of religious authority to the annual gathering being held this year in Italy's sun-drenched Puglia region.\n\nHe'll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US. Host Italy has invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Italy's Africa initiatives.\n\nOther guests include Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi -- fresh off his own election -- and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, British PM Rishi Sunak, and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, the pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nThe US proposal involves using profits from the roughly \u20ac242bn in frozen Russian central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, to help Ukraine and issuing a \u20ac46bn loan from the US government to Kyiv, using windfall profits from the immobilized funds as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters on Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out.\n\nThe issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen -- say if the war ends -- then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nOn the eve of the summit, Washington also sent strong signals of support for Ukraine, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in weekend European Parliament elections than the 2022 elections that made her Italy's first female premier.\n\nKnown for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election, and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw the far-right Alternative for Germany beat out his Social Democrats.\n\nAs a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One reported sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\n\"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 Summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit,\" said Nick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a non-exploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nItaly, which has been ground zero in Europe's migration debate for decades, has been promoting its Mattei Plan as a way to create jobs and opportunities in Africa and discourage its young people from making dangerous trips across the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe plan involves pilot projects in areas such as education, health care, water, sanitation, agriculture and energy infrastructure.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Ukrainian President Zelenskiy will join to discuss a long-term security pact with the U.S. The summit will also cover topics like artificial intelligence and migration.\n\nGroup of Seven leaders will aim to boost funding for Ukraine in its war with Russia and offer a united face in confronting China's political and economic ambitions at their annual summit in southern Italy on Thursday. For a second year running, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will attend the summit, taking part in talks on Thursday, and he is due to sign a new, long-term security accord with U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nThe G7 leaders look likely to announce they have agreed at least in principle on plans to issue $50 billion of loans for Ukraine using interest from Russian sovereign assets frozen after its invasion of Ukraine to back the multi-year debt package. \"I think we will have the major tentpoles of this decided, but some of the specifics left to be worked through by experts on a defined timetable,\" White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said of the discussions.\n\n\"I think we are on the verge of a good outcome here,\" he added. Officials acknowledge the plan is complex, with legal experts still having to thrash out the details that will need the backing of European nations, particularly Belgium, which is not in the G7.\n\nPACKED AGENDA With the Middle East, migration and artificial intelligence also on a packed agenda, the June 13-15 summit in the southern Italian region of Puglia would be taxing for leaders at the best of times, but most of them are also bowed down by their own domestic woes.\n\nOnly the host, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, is riding high after triumphing in Italy's European election last weekend, but achieving meaningful results in the luxury Borgo Egnazia hotel resort will be a tall order. Biden's goal at the G7 was to reinforce the idea that the United States is best served if it is closely aligned with its democratic allies and partners, Sullivan said, when asked about the prospects of it being the president's last summit given he faces a re-election battle in November.\n\nUnderscoring U.S. determination to punish Moscow for its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Washington on Wednesday dramatically broadened sanctions on Moscow, including by targeting China-based companies selling semiconductors to Moscow. By announcing new restrictions on Chinese firms on the eve of the G7 meeting, Biden is no doubt hoping to persuade Western allies to show greater resolve in confronting Beijing over its support for Russia and its industrial over-capacity.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the start of the summit, Sullivan said that China was a significant creditor to many heavily indebted countries. \"The G7 communique is not singling out or focusing on a single country,\" he said, but added that China needed to play a constructive role in dealing with the debt burden.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse

If Vladimir Putin thinks he can outlast the coalition supporting Ukraine, he\u2019s wrong,\u201d Sullivan said.\n\nFifteen countries have signed the security agreement, which will strengthen Ukraine\u2019s \u201cdefensive deterrence capability\u201d, he said. The agreement will include a commitment to working with the US Congress on funding Ukraine going forward but will not commit to using US forces on the ground, Sullivan added.\n\nThe White House had said earlier that Biden will meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the summit, followed by a joint press conference. The US also expects Biden to meet India\u2019s Narendra Modi, who was sworn in as India\u2019s prime minister for a third term, and is waiting for India to formally confirm Modi\u2019s attendance at the summit.\n\nThe G7 leaders arrive at the summit confronting myriad woes at home even as they seek solutions for many of the world\u2019s most pressing problems.\n\nBiden, 81, spent Tuesday evening at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, after a 12-member jury convicted his son Hunter Biden of lying about his drug use to illegally buy a gun in 2018, making him the first child of a sitting US president to be convicted of a crime.\n\nThe trial followed the May 30 criminal conviction of Donald Trump, the first former US president to be found guilty of a felony. Biden and Trump are running against each other in the November presidential election and are neck-and-neck in the polls.\n\nThe heads of the world\u2019s most developed democracies will address multiple challenges during the June 13-15 meeting, including wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, trade imbalances with China, threats posed by artificial intelligence and development challenges in Africa.\n\nThe leaders will also announce new sanctions and export controls against Russia that target entities and networks helping Putin\u2019s forces fight the war in Ukraine. Efforts to curb Russia\u2019s growing war economy will be a major discussion topic, administration officials have said.\n\nThe US on Wednesday dramatically broadened sanctions on Russia, including by targeting China-based companies selling semiconductors to Moscow, as part of its effort to undercut the Russian military machine waging war on Ukraine.\n\nSeparately, the US Commerce Department said it was targeting shell companies in Hong Kong for diverting semiconductors to Russia, taking steps that would affect nearly US$100 million of high-priority items for Moscow including such chips.\n\n\u201cThese actions heighten the risk for financial institutions dealing with Russia\u2019s war economy, slows down avenues for evasion while diminishes Russia\u2019s ability to benefit from access to foreign technology, equipment, software and IT services,\u201d Sullivan said.\n\nShoring up funding for Ukraine will be a top priority at the G7 meeting, with US and European officials eager to lock in solutions, ahead of a possible Trump re-election and the uncertainty it would raise over future US support for Kyiv.\n\nThe Group of Seven nations and the European Union are considering how to use profits generated by Russian assets immobilised in the West to provide Ukraine with a large loan to secure Kyiv\u2019s financing for 2025.\n\nThe White House\u2019s Sullivan said the US is \u201cmaking good progress in generating an outcome in which those proceeds from those frozen assets can be put to good use\u201d.\n\nBiden will press other G7 leaders to agree to an innovative plan to use future interest on some US$281 billion of Russian central bank funds to back up a US$50 billion loan to Ukraine.\n\nG7 leaders also face electoral challenges, with polls indicating British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is likely to lose power in a national vote next month, and the leaders of France and Germany reeling from heavy defeats in recent European elections.", "source": {"uri":

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be on hand and is expected to sign a separate bilateral security agreement with US President Joe Biden.\n\nAlso Read | UFO Sighting in Canada: Barbell-Shaped UFO Glowing Indigo Blue Colour Spotted in Ontario, Claims Pentagon Engineer; Shares Electronic Evidence of 'Alien' Spacecraft.\n\nBeyond the Ukraine war, Pope Francis will become the first pope to address a G7 summit, adding a dash of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering that is being held this year in Italy's sun-drenched Puglia region. He'll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Host Italy has invited several African leaders - Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied - to press Italy's Africa initiatives. Other guests include Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nAlso Read | Kuwait Fire Incident: Kamal Haasan Reacts to Tragic Death of Indian Nationals, Appeals to MEA for Support.\n\nWith Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nFrozen Russian assets to support Ukraine\n\nThe US proposal involves using profits from the roughly USD 260 billion in frozen Russian central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, to help Ukraine, and issuing a USD 50 billion loan from the U.S. government to Kyiv, using windfall profits from the immobilized funds as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen - say if the war ends - then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nOn the eve of the summit, Washington also sent strong signals of support for Ukraine, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nEurope's new political chessboard\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in weekend European Parliament elections than the 2022 elections that made her Italy's first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw the far-right Alternative for Germany beat out his Social Democrats.\n\nAs a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One reported sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\n\"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 Summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially Mediterranean Summit,\" said Nick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a non-exploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nItaly, which for decades has been ground zero in Europe's migration debate, has been promoting its Mattei Plan as a way to create jobs and opportunity in Africa and discourage its young people from making dangerous trips across the Mediterranean Sea. The plan involves pilot projects in areas such as education, health care, water, sanitation, agriculture and energy infrastructure.\n\nThe pope and artificial intelligence\n\nPope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasizing the grave and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector, which has been a frequent focus of the Jesuit pope who has called even traditional weapons makers \"merchants of death.\"\n\nBut Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.\n\nThe 87-year-old pope has said he would also repeat his calls for peace while holding a half-dozen bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the summit.\n\nIt's happening where?\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favourite of celebrities, it will be sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nAs with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. One group is staging a \"dinner for the poor\" on Friday night calling for \"peace, the rights of peoples and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.\" (AP)",

political blow to Mr Biden, 81, who is running for a second term in office in November.\n\nHe has sought to focus his re-election campaign on protecting the US from the return of his predecessor, Donald Trump, who was last month convicted of 34 felonies.\n\nWhile in office, Trump championed the idea of an \"America First\" approach to US foreign policy.\n\nIn March, he said he would encourage Russia to do \"whatever the hell they wanted\" to Nato countries that did not spend enough on defence.\n\nMr Biden has opposed that approach and has sought to advance his vision for continued US engagement with the world.\n\nThree years ago at the G7 summit held in Cornwall, England, Mr Biden in his speech declared that \"America was back\".\n\nPolls show the US election headed for a tight race, and global leaders are concerned that Trump could once again be president.\n\nThe development comes after far-right parties in Europe made significant gains in parliamentary elections this week.\n\nLeaders are also expected to address the continuing Israel-Gaza war, climate change, migration and other issues during the G7 summit.\n\nPope Francis and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are also expected to join the gathering.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jihan_abdalla@thenationalnews.com",

The move clears the way for leaders to announce a $50 billion loan package for Kyiv at the Group of Seven summit, where President Joe Biden is set to sign a security agreement with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nThe highly anticipated agreement will leverage interest and income from the more than $260 billion in frozen Russian assets, largely held in Europe, to secure a $50 billion loan from the U.S. and additional loans from other partners. The first disbursements will be made this year, but it will take time for Ukraine to use all the money, the official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the agreement, which will be included in the G7 leaders' communique on Friday.\n\nThe leaders' statement will also leave the door open to confiscating the Russian assets entirely, for which the allies have yet to secure the political will, largely citing legal and financial stability concerns.\n\nBiden will meet on Thursday with Zelenskyy to discuss a bilateral security agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine, as the international group of wealthy democracies has been looking for new ways to bolster Ukraine's defenses against Russia.\n\nIt comes several months after the White House broke through a logjam in Congress that stalled approval of some $60 billion in U.S. aid for Ukraine. The delay gave Russia time to make up ground on the battlefield.\n\nBiden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, described the pact as a \"real marker\" of the U.S. commitment to Ukraine, \"not just for this month and this year, but for the many years ahead.\"\n\nZelenskyy, on social media, said the document is \"unprecedented, as it should be for leaders who support Ukraine.\"\n\nSullivan said the agreement would not commit U.S. troops directly to Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion. That is a red line drawn by Biden, who does not want to have the U.S. pulled into a direct conflict with nuclear-armed Moscow.\n\nScores of countries and organizations are set to meet over the weekend in Switzerland to discuss peace for Ukraine. Biden is not scheduled to attend the summit, a decision that has disappointed Zelenskyy.

Top of the agenda will be Ukraine, Gaza and migration.\n\nThe right-wing populist Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni heads to the G7 summit strengthened and in a good mood thanks to her party's results in the European parliamentary elections last Sunday. Under Italy's presidency, the \"Grande Sette,\" as the group of the world's seven leading economies is called in Italian, is meeting this week at the luxury Borgo Egnazia hotel in the poorer southern Italian region of Puglia. Meloni was personally involved in many of the details of what she is presenting as \"her summit.\" She wants to show the region from its most beautiful side and underline what is happening there in economic terms, thanks to generous funds that have flowed into Italy via the EU's COVID-19 recovery package. Apart from Italy, the G7 comprises the US, Canada, Japan, France, the UK and Germany, as well as the European Union as a non-enumerated member.\n\nBefore setting off from Rome, the prime minister said: \"I'm proud that we are heading to the G7 and to Europe with the strongest government of all.\"\n\nIndeed, her counterparts in Western Europe are struggling. French President Emmanuel Macron dissolved his country's parliament and called new elections after his party's catastrophic results in the European elections. If his gamble goes wrong, France could end up with a far-right government in less than a month.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz and his coalition also suffered a major defeat in the elections, and is caught up in a major debate about the next budget. In the UK, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is predicted to lose the upcoming elections in early July and the Labour party is set to replace the Conservatives in power after more than a decade.\n\nMeloni, whose right-wing nationalist coalition won in the European elections by a comfortable margin, now wants a significant say in the EU and at the G7. She already has a good relationship with US President Joe Biden, who is running in the US presidential elections later on this year. She is particularly in agreement with him on transatlantic matters and supporting Ukraine in its defense against Russia.\n\nUkraine will be top of the agenda at the summit of the seven states that are providing most financial and military support to Kyiv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will also be attending, appealing for more long-range weapons, ammunition, and air defense capabilities. Scholz has already agreed to help procure these from G7 states and others. Some European countries that have Patriot missile defense systems have been reluctant to supply them to Ukraine.\n\nThe G7 members are not united regarding the possibility of deploying Western soldiers in Ukraine. France and the UK have said that they would be open to sending trainers and consultants, while Germany, Italy and the US are vehemently opposed to this. Scholz wants concrete commitments regarding the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war. The plan at the summit is to make available a further $50 billion (ca. 56 billion euros) to Ukraine in the form of a joint loan that would be gradually paid off with the profits from frozen Russian state assets. How to end the war will also be discussed.\n\nSome of the G7 leaders attending the summit in Italy will travel on to Switzerland for an international peace summit organized by Ukraine. Russia will not be participating.\n\nAnother topic on the agenda will be Africa. Meloni wants to focus on better cooperation with the continent, particularly regarding natural resources and energy imports and exports, supply chains and migration management. Twelve guests from African and Indo-Pacific countries have been invited to discuss more investment in Africa and the production of environmentally-friendly energy for Europe in Africa.\n\nThere have already been many projects of this kind within the framework of the G7. But what is missing are concrete financial commitments and equal partnerships, said the international non-profit Oxfam ahead of the summit.\n\nIn a press release, Oxfam International said that with \"funds equivalent to just 2.9% ($35.7 billion) of their combined annual military spending, Group of Seven (G7) countries could help end world hunger and solve the debt crisis in the Global South.\"\n\nTobias Hauschild from Oxfam Germany said that \"G7 governments manage to invest massively in armaments, but when it comes to stopping hunger, they are suddenly broke.\"\n\nThe development NGO ONE pointed out that the West's financial commitment to Africa had decreased in recent years. Debt, on the other hand, was rising rapidly. In a statement issued ahead of the G7 summit, it said that repayments of debts, also to China increasingly, were beginning to choke certain African states.\n\nMore and more, EU states are coupling their aid to African countries with conditions that include help with migration management. The EU has chalked up migration deals with Libya, Tunisia, Jordan and Egypt in an attempt to prevent people from trying to get to the bloc from transit countries. Rights organizations have criticized this approach, saying that the EU is not living up to its responsibilities.\n\nFor her part, Meloni has promised that Italy will more or less close its borders to migrants and refugees, and outsource asylum procedures when possible.\n\nThe US president recently issued a decree severely restricting the possibility for migrants to apply for asylum on the US' southern border. People can now be deported to Mexico without procedure.\n\nIn the EU, some have called for similar measures to secure the bloc's external borders.\n\nThe G7 members will also back the US-proposed resolution for a cease-fire in Gaza that has been approved by the United Nations Security Council. A high-ranking diplomat at Borgo Egnazia said that the G7 expected Hamas, which is considered a terrorist organization by Germany, Israel, the US and others, to accept conditions for a cease-fire immediately. The Israeli hostages had to be released and the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza had to end. However, it was not clear whether Israel had agreed to back the resolution.", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche Welle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

in confronting Beijing over its support for Russia and its industrial over-capacity.\n\nThe European Commission told automakers on Wednesday it would impose extra duties of up to 38.1% on imported Chinese electric cars from July, less than a month after Washington quadrupled duties for Chinese EVs to 100%.\n\nWhile G7 leaders are expected to express concern over high Chinese production levels, which they say disrupt global supply chains and market stability, EU diplomats warn that Europe is anxious to avoid a full-blown trade war with Beijing.\n\nEager not to appear like an elitist fortress, the G7 has thrown open its doors to a large number of outsiders this year, including Pope Francis, who is expected to give a keynote speech on Friday on both the risks and potential of AI.\n\nAmong those who have also been invited to Puglia are the leaders of some of the biggest regional powers across the globe such as India, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Algeria and Kenya.\n\nAlthough the summit is scheduled to run until Saturday, many G7 chiefs will leave on Friday night, including Biden, meaning the final day has been earmarked for bilateral meetings for those staying on and a final news conference from Meloni.\n\n($1 = 0.9243 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Crispian Balmer, Angelo Amante, Andrew Gray, Andrea Shalal and John Irish; Writing by Crispian Balmer and Keith Weir)",

We want to demonstrate that the US supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them, and that we'll continue to help address their security needs not just tomorrow but out into the future,\" the NSA said.\n\nThe agreement outlines a clear vision of work with Ukraine to continue strengthening Ukraine's credible defence and deterrence capability. Any lasting peace in Ukraine has to be underwritten by Ukraine's own ability to defend itself and deter future aggression, he said \"And by signing this, we'll also be sending Russia a signal of our resolve. If Vladimir Putin thinks that he can outlast the coalition supporting Ukraine, he's wrong. He just cannot wait us out, and this agreement will show our resolve and continued commitment,\" Sullivan said.\n\nA day earlier, White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby told reporters that this year's summit would show that G7 is more unified than ever to tackle global challenges, and to renew their commitment to partners around the world that they will help them invest in bright futures for their people.\n\n\"We will build on the progress we made last year on our shared approach to the Indo-Pacific as well, including by advancing an Indo-Pacific region that is free, open, secure, prosperous, resilient, and connected,\" he said.\n\n\"We will address the PRC's support for the Russian defence industrial base. And we will confront China's non-market policies that are leading to harmful global spillovers, working with partners in and beyond the G7 to promote economic resilience and security,\" Kirby said.\n\nBiden will again host a side event that will highlight its positive value proposition to countries around the world via the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, or PGI, he said.\n\n\"We will continue to offer a path to help countries overcome unsustainable debt burdens, to boost the World Bank's lending firepower, to mobilize additional capital for high-standard infrastructure investments, and to make new commitments on food and health security,\" he added.\n\nG7 leaders will be joined by His Holiness, Pope Francis, for a session on artificial intelligence, among other topics. \"This will be an important moment for our countries to come together and develop our shared approach to harnessing the benefits of AI while at the same time managing the risks to our national security and impacts that it may have to our workforces and inequality,\" Kirby said.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\n\"The bottom line here is that President Biden believes we must continue to imagine, to invent and to inspire.

If (Russian President) Vladimir Putin thinks he can outlast the coalition supporting Ukraine, he's wrong,\" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters.\n\nCONFRONTING

the summit is scheduled to run until Saturday, many G7 chiefs will leave on Friday night, including Biden, meaning the final day has been earmarked for bilateral meetings for those staying on and a

(Kyodo) -- The United States will announce an \"impactful set\" of additional sanctions and export control actions against Russia as part of efforts to deprive the Kremlin of resources used to sustain its invasion of Ukraine, the White House said Tuesday.\n\nWhite House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters that the Group of Seven's commitment to Ukraine will also continue to be \"right up front and clear\" and it will take \"bold steps\" to show Russian President Vladimir Putin that \"time is not on his side.\"\n\nKirby refrained from providing details, but added that new actions to be taken by the world's leading industrialized democracies will include unlocking the value of frozen Russian assets to benefit Ukraine and help the country recover from the war's destruction.\n\nAt the group's summit this year in southern Italy, starting Thursday, a major topic will be how best to use the interest earned by the immobilized Russian assets to aid Ukraine.\n\nDiplomatic sources have said the G7 members, including Britain, Japan and the United States, are finalizing arrangements to establish a fund to support Ukraine.\n\nAs for the upcoming U.S. sanctions, Kirby said they will follow through on some of the commitments G7 leaders have made to date, making it more difficult for financial facilitators to support Russia's defense industrial base.\n\nOn the sidelines of the three-day summit at a luxurious hotel in the southern Italian region of Puglia, U.S. President Joe Biden will sit down with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss Washington's next steps for the war-torn country, he said.\n\nThe bilateral meeting, followed by a joint press conference by the two presidents, is scheduled for Thursday, according to Kirby.\n\nHe said that during the G7 summit, the leaders will also advance efforts toward an Indo-Pacific region that is \"free, open, secure, prosperous, resilient and connected,\" and discuss China's deepening ties with Russia as well as Beijing's non-market policies that are triggering \"harmful global spillovers.\"", "source": {"uri": "mainichi.jp", "dataType": "news", "title":

Biden and Trump are running against each other in the November presidential election and are neck-and-neck in the polls.\n\nThe heads of the world's most developed democracies will address multiple challenges during the June 13-15 meeting, including wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, trade imbalances with China, threats posed by artificial intelligence and development challenges in Africa.\n\nThe leaders will announce new sanctions and export controls against Russia that target entities and networks helping President Vladimir Putin's forces fight the war in Ukraine, White House spokesperson John Kirby said on Tuesday. \"We're going to continue to drive up costs for the Russian war machine,\" Kirby said.\n\nWashington plans to widen sanctions on the sale of semiconductor chips and other goods to Russia, with the goal of targeting third-party sellers in China, sources familiar with the plans said late on Tuesday.\n\nThe administration will announce it is broadening existing export controls to include U.S.-branded goods, not just those made in the United States, the sources said. It will identify certain Hong Kong entities it says are shipping goods to Moscow.\n\nShoring up funding for Ukraine will be a top priority at the G7 meeting, with U.S. and European officials eager to lock in solutions, ahead of a possible Trump re-election and the uncertainty it would raise over future U.S. support for Kyiv.\n\nThe Group of Seven nations and the European Union are considering how to use profits generated by Russian assets immobilized in the West to provide Ukraine with a large up-front loan to secure Kyiv's financing for 2025.\n\n\"We will announce new steps to unlock the value of the immobilized Russian sovereign assets to benefit Ukraine and to help them recover from the destruction that Mr. Putin's army has caused,\" Kirby said.\n\nBiden will press other G7 leaders to agree to an innovative plan to use future interest on some $281 billion of Russian central bank funds to back up a $50 billion loan to Ukraine.\n\nG7 leaders also face electoral challenges, with polls indicating British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will likely to lose power in a national vote next month, and the leaders of France and Germany reeling from heavy defeats in recent European elections.\n\nBiden will meet again with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, followed by a joint press conference, Kirby said.

Welcome to our live coverage of this year's G7 summit. I am Martin Belam and I'll be with you for the next while.\n\nG7 leaders are gathering for the first day the summit, hosted by Italy's prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, and are seeking to seal a deal on using frozen Russian assets to help war-torn Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will join US President Joe Biden and leaders from Italy, Britain, France, Germany, Canada and Japan at the luxury Borgo Egnazia resort in Puglia.\n\nThe leaders are hoping to agree on a $50bn loan for Kyiv, secured against the future profits from interest on 300bn euros ($325bn) of Russian central bank assets frozen after the February 2022 invasion, reports Agence France-Presse.\n\nThe European Union - where most of the funds are being held - agreed earlier this year to use the profits for Ukraine.\n\nBut the idea at the G7 is to use this to provide more, faster help in the form of a massive upfront loan - although key questions such as who issues the debt and who shares the risk are still being hammered out.\n\nThe G7 summit opens Thursday morning with a short session on Africa, development and climate change, before turning to the Middle East.\n\nThe leaders have already announced their support for a Gaza truce deal outlined by Biden, which would also see the release of hostages taken in Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel.\n\nMore on that in a moment but first, here's a summary of the latest developments:", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martin_belam@theguardian.com", "name": "Martin Belam",

an agreement had been reached on the deal before the leaders even landed for the three-day gathering.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to sign a separate bilateral security agreement with US President Joe Biden.\n\nBeyond the the war in Ukraine, Pope Francis will become the first pontiff to address a G7 summit, adding a dash of celebrity and moral authority to the annual gathering that is being held this year in Borgo Egnazia in southern Italy's sun-drenched Puglia region.\n\nHe will be speaking on Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe G7 comprises Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nItaly, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders - Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied - to press Italy's development and migration initiatives on the continent.\n\nOther guests include Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Mr Biden, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure is on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nThe US proposal involves engineering a 50 billion dollar (\u00a339 billion) loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia which would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters on Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders has been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still have to be worked out.\n\nThe issue is complicated because if the Russian assets are eventually unfrozen - for example, if the war ends - then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nIn addition to the deal, Mr Sunak announced up to \u00a3242 million (310 million dollars) in non-military aid to Ukraine for humanitarian, energy and stabilization needs.\n\nWashington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy's first female premier.\n\nKnown for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, did not fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote.\n\nMr Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nAs a result, Ms Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said.\n\nIn one sign of her flexed far-right muscles, Ms Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy is trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\nA French official said there are diverging views with Italian negotiators on some topics, including on sexual and reproductive health and vaccines.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed abortion is being discussed, but said talks are continuing.\n\nNick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council, said: \"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit.\"\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as she seeks to leverage her programme for a non-exploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nicole_winfield@irishexaminer.com", "name": "Nicole Winfield",

Since the G7 started freezing Russian assets in 2022, more than C$140 million worth of Russian assets have been seized in Canada.\n\nThrough this initiative, which has yet to be formally announced, sources say the G7 countries would use the interest accrued on nearly US$300 billion in frozen Russian assets to provide Ukraine with a loan worth US$50 billion.\n\nIt remains unclear when the deal will be finalized and officially announced but the U.S. president, who spearheaded this effort, is scheduled to meet with Ukrainian President Volodmyrr Zelenskyy later Thursday. During that meeting, Biden is expected to sign a new security agreement with Ukraine to pledge America's long-term support to the country.\n\n\"By signing this we'll also be sending Russia a signal of our resolve. If Vladimir Putin thinks he can outlast the coalition supporting Ukraine, he's wrong,\" U.S. White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters travelling with Joe Biden on Air Force One.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau also has a private one-on-one meeting scheduled with Zelenskyy on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canadian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Sullivan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Sullivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air Force One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Physical_Asset_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Physical Asset Management", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Signs_and_Signals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Signs and Signals", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/6/13/prime-minister-justin-trudeau-1-6924869-1718274940129.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644722", "eventUri": "eng-9644722", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

companies selling semiconductors to Moscow.\n\nBy announcing new restrictions on Chinese firms on the eve of the G7 meeting, Biden is no doubt hoping to persuade Western allies to show greater resolve in confronting Beijing over its support for Russia and its industrial over-capacity.\n\nThe European Commission told automakers on Wednesday it would impose extra duties of up to 38.1 percent on imported Chinese electric cars from July, less than a month after Washington quadrupled duties for Chinese EVs to 100 percent.\n\nWhile G7 leaders are expected to express concern over high Chinese production levels, which they say disrupt global supply chains and market stability, EU diplomats warn that Europe is anxious to avoid a full-blown trade war with Beijing.\n\nEager not to appear like an elitist fortress, the G7 has thrown open its doors to a large number of outsiders this year, including Pope Francis, who is expected to give a keynote speech on Friday on both the risks and potential of AI.\n\nAmong those who have also been invited to Puglia are the leaders of some of the biggest regional powers across the globe such as India, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Algeria and Kenya.\n\nAlthough the summit is scheduled to run until Saturday, many G7 chiefs will leave on Friday night, including Biden, meaning the final day has been earmarked for bilateral meetings for those

use interest from Russian assets for Ukraine", "body": "Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni welcomed the G7 heads of state to the summit at a luxury resort in Borgo Egnazia in southern Italy, saying she wanted the message of the meeting to be one of dialogue with the global south and unity.\n\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy Zelenskiy is expected to sign a separate bilateral security agreement with US president Joe Biden.\n\nBeyond the war in Ukraine, Pope Francis will become the first pontiff to address a G7 summit.\n\nHe will speak on Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe G7 comprises Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nItaly, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders - Algerian president Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan president William Ruto and Tunisian president Kais Saied - to press Italy's development and migration initiatives on the continent.\n\nOther guests include Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Mr Biden, UK prime minister Rishi Sunak and now French president Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure is on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nThe US proposal involves engineering a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia which would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters on Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders has been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still have to be worked out.\n\nThe issue is complicated because if the Russian assets are eventually unfrozen - for example, if the war ends - then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nIn addition to the deal, Mr Sunak announced up to \u00a3242 million (\u20ac287 million) in non-military aid to Ukraine for humanitarian, energy and stabilisation needs.\n\nWashington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nMs Meloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy's first female premier.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, did not fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote.\n\nMr Macron called a snap election and German chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).\n\nAs a result, Ms Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said.\n\nIn one sign of her flexed far-right muscles, Ms Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy is trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\nA French official said there are diverging views with Italian negotiators on some topics, including on sexual and reproductive health and vaccines.\n\nItalian foreign minister Antonio Tajani confirmed abortion is being discussed, but said talks are continuing.\n\nNick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council, said: \"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 summit, this electoral win offers premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit'.\"\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as she seeks to leverage her programme for a non-exploitative relationship

He'll be speaking Friday about the promises and perils of artificial intelligence, but is expected to also renew his appeal for a peaceful end to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nAfter smallest Saturday crowd in decades, Cardinals attendance lows piling up Missouri teacher 'wouldn't recommend' OnlyFans career, says she's a 'total outcast' Kansas City home built by Whitey Herzog is for sale, complete with bat banister Mothers allege Kirkwood Schools withheld yearbook sex survey records St. Louis Public Schools asks teachers to drive buses this fall 2 truths and an underlying question: Revealing trends in Cardinals' riveting loss to Bucs Teen driver gets 4 months in deaths of 3 Lincoln County teens.

Francis Howell schools scrap video platform over claims it pushes 'social agendas' McClellan: Today's politics are a slow-motion trainwreck BenFred: There goes the Cardinals' momentum again. Here's why it keeps happening. Renovated Kirkwood home includes rentable outdoor oasis\n\nThe G7 includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Italy, which is hosting the summit, has invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Italy's development and migration initiatives on the continent.\n\nOther guests include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nFrozen Russian assets to support Ukraine\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves engineering a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia that would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen -- say if the war ends -- then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nIn addition to the deal, Sunak announced up to 242 million pounds (286 million euros or $310 million) in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine for humanitarian, energy and stabilization needs. Washington also sent strong signals of support, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nEurope's new political chessboard\n\nMeloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in the European Parliament election than the national general election in 2022 that made her Italy's first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw his Social Democrats finish behind mainstream conservatives and the far-right Alternative for Germany.\n\nAs a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\nA French official, speaking anonymously in line with Macron's office customary practices, said there were diverging views with Italian negotiators on some topics, including on sexual and reproductive health and vaccines.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed abortion was being discussed, but said discussions were continuing.\n\n\"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 Summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit,\" said Nick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a nonexploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nThe pope and artificial intelligence\n\nPope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasizing the grave and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector, which has been a frequent focus of the Jesuit pope who has called even traditional weapons makers \"merchants of death.\"\n\nBut Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.\n\nIt's happening where?\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it will be sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and Carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nAs with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. One group is staging a \"dinner for the poor\" on Friday night calling for \"peace, the rights of peoples and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.\"\n\nNicole Winfield reported from Bari.

Under Italy's presidency, the \"Grande Sette,\" as the group of the world's seven leading economies is called in Italian, is meeting this week at the luxury Borgo Egnazia hotel in the poorer southern Italian region of Puglia. Meloni was personally involved in many of the details of what she is presenting as \"her summit.\" She wants to show the region from its most beautiful side and underline what is happening there in economic terms, thanks to generous funds that have flowed into Italy via the European Union's pandemic recovery package. Apart from Italy, the G7 comprises the US, Canada, Japan, France, the UK and Germany, as well as the European Union as a nonenumerated member.\n\nBefore setting off from Rome, the prime minister said: \"I'm proud that we are heading to the G7 and to Europe with the strongest government of all.\"\n\nIndeed, her counterparts in Western Europe are struggling. French President Emmanuel Macron dissolved his country's parliament and called new elections after his party's catastrophic results in the European elections. If his gamble goes wrong, France could end up with a far-right government in less than a month.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz and his coalition also suffered a major defeat in the elections, and is caught up in a major debate about the next budget. In the UK, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is predicted to lose the upcoming elections in early July and the Labour party is set to replace the Conservatives in power after more than a decade.\n\nMeloni, whose right-wing nationalist coalition won in the European elections by a comfortable margin, now wants a significant say in the EU and at the G7. She already has a good relationship with US President Joe Biden, who is running in the US presidential elections later on this year. She is particularly in agreement with him on transatlantic matters and supporting Ukraine in its defense against Russia.\n\nUkraine will be top of the agenda at the summit of the seven states that are providing most financial and military support to Kyiv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will also be attending, appealing for more long-range weapons, ammunition, and air defense capabilities. Scholz has already agreed to help procure these from G7 states and others. Some European countries that have Patriot missile defense systems have been reluctant to supply them to Ukraine.\n\nThe G7 members are not united regarding the possibility of deploying Western soldiers in Ukraine. France and the UK have said that they would be open to sending trainers and consultants, while Germany, Italy and the US are vehemently opposed to this. Scholz wants concrete commitments regarding the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war. The plan at the summit is to make available a further $50 billion (ca. 56 billion euros) to Ukraine in the form of a joint loan that would be gradually paid off with the profits from frozen Russian state assets. How to end the war will also be discussed.\n\nSome of the G7 leaders attending the summit in Italy will travel on to Switzerland for an international peace summit organized by Ukraine. Russia will not be participating.\n\nAnother topic on the agenda will be Africa. Meloni wants to focus on better cooperation with the continent, particularly regarding natural resources and energy imports and exports, supply chains and migration management. Twelve guests from African and Indo-Pacific countries have been invited to discuss more investment in Africa and the production of environmentally-friendly energy for Europe in Africa.\n\nThere have already been many projects of this kind within the framework of the G7. But what is missing are concrete financial commitments and equal partnerships, said the international non-profit Oxfam ahead of the summit.\n\nIn a press release, Oxfam International said that with \"funds equivalent to just 2.9% ($35.7 billion) of their combined annual military spending, Group of Seven (G7) countries could help end world hunger and solve the debt crisis in the Global South.\"\n\nTobias Hauschild from Oxfam Germany said that \"G7 governments manage to invest massively in armaments, but when it comes to stopping hunger, they are suddenly broke.\"\n\nThe development NGO ONE pointed out that the West's financial commitment to Africa had decreased in recent years. Debt, on the other hand, was rising rapidly. In a statement issued ahead of the G7 summit, it said that repayments of debts, also to China increasingly, were beginning to choke certain African states.\n\nMore and more, EU states are coupling their aid to African countries with conditions that include help with migration management. The EU has chalked up migration deals with Libya, Tunisia, Jordan and Egypt in an attempt to prevent people from trying to get to the bloc from transit countries. Rights organizations have criticized this approach, saying that the EU is not living up to its responsibilities.\n\nFor her part, Meloni has promised that Italy will more or less close its borders to migrants and refugees, and outsource asylum procedures when possible.\n\nThe US president recently issued a decree severely restricting the possibility for migrants to apply for asylum on the US' southern border. People can now be deported to Mexico without procedure.\n\nIn the EU, some have called for similar measures to secure the bloc's external borders.\n\nThe G7 members will also back the US-proposed resolution for a cease-fire in Gaza that has been approved by the United Nations Security Council. A high-ranking diplomat at Borgo Egnazia said that the G7 expected Hamas, which is considered a terrorist organization by Germany, Israel, the US and others, to accept conditions for a cease-fire immediately. The Israeli hostages had to be released and the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza had to end. However, it was not clear whether Israel had agreed to back the resolution.", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche Welle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The unpredictable, celebrity-turned-president who had alienated the US in so many ways had been replaced by a familiar American statesman, and he was pledging to restore and strengthen American alliances and its leadership on the world stage.\n\nWhen Biden touches down in Brindisi, Italy, on Wednesday almost exactly three years later to the day to attend the final G7 meeting of his first term, the shadow of his predecessor will once again loom large.\n\n\"There was a real sense of relief in the room that America was back, and actually leading at the table. And that's still more true now than ever,\" White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Tuesday. \"The President's message at that G7 in Cornwall was that we need to step up in solidarity and demonstrate that democracies can still deliver for our people, and for people all over the world. And for the past few years, we've done that.\"\n\nTrump's potential return to the White House adds weight to the question of how much Biden's bet on repairing America's alliances abroad has paid off. Anxiety has set in in world capitals as some governments look beyond Biden and instead work to curry favor with the presumptive Republican nominee.\n\nBiden and his fellow group of world leaders - huddled for three days in a luxury resort in Puglia on the Mediterranean coastline that has been frequented by Hollywood celebrities and diplomats alike - will tackle questions of war and peace, a fragile economic recovery and competing against China.\n\nTrump's isolation from his fellow leaders was on display the last time Italy hosted the G7 summit, in 2017. Perched on a cliffside resort in Sicily, Trump resisted entreaties to remain in the Paris climate accord. An enduring memory from the gathering was Trump trailing behind the leaders in a golf cart as the rest of the group toured a small piazza on foot.\n\nAs the highly anticipated summit kicks off this year, Russia's assault on Ukraine that began in early 2022 is showing no signs of letting up. With the conflict grinding on, Biden's rallying cry championing Ukraine's fight for its survival has fallen on increasingly unsympathetic ears - and even growing resistance - in some corners of Washington.\n\nA big enough contingent of Republicans lawmakers, balking in no small part at the growing price tag of US security assistance to Ukraine, delayed the approval of the last American aid package for months. US officials have publicly lamented the delay, claiming it hamstrung Ukrainian forces at a pivotal moment in the war, allowing Russia to make key advances on the battlefield.\n\n\"Biden has been trying to allay concerns of allies for the last four years. The message that he ran on and the message of his presidency has been: 'America is back,'\" said Rachel Rizzo, a senior fellow at the Europe Center. \"And I think the question a lot of leaders are asking themselves is: Is it really? Because what we're seeing in the United States is a serious fight on Capitol Hill in terms of Ukraine funding.\"\n\nVisiting France last week to commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-Day, Biden drew parallels between the US and its allies standing up against Russia's tyranny over Ukraine and the fight against Nazi Germany in World War II.\n\n\"Isolation was not the answer 80 years ago and is not the answer today,\" Biden said, as he vowed: \"We will not walk away.\"\n\nHe also issued a public apology to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for the latest delay in US security assistance to the country. Biden and Zelensky will participate in a news conference together in Italy during the G7 summit, according to Kirby.\n\n\"We will take bold steps to show Mr. Putin that time is not on his side and that he cannot outlast us as we support Ukraine's fight for freedom,\" Kirby said.\n\nAs frequently as Biden has pointed to the war in Ukraine as having so far proven the strength and value of the NATO alliance, the conflict has tested not only Biden, but a number of his counterparts, back in their home countries. Among the G7 leaders that gather in Italy this week include French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who both suffered political losses to the far-right in European Parliament elections this weekend.\n\nEven despite some of those headwinds at home, the leaders of the seven nations are racing against the clock to approve a $50 billion loan for Ukraine. The Biden administration has been leading a campaign to persuade leaders of the fellow G7 nations to sign off on a plan that it views as vital to giving Ukraine a shot at turning around its prospects on the battlefield.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to iron out some of the thorniest financing details in the coming days so that an agreement can be announced as part of the G7 leaders' communiqu\u00e9 at the end of the week. But questions about the modalities of such a program - including the precise form of disbursement and repayment assurances, among others - are still in the process of being worked out.\n\nOne source familiar with planning for the summit said that the leaders were expected to speak in unison about their concerns about a \"resurgence\" of the Russian military - and the threat that poses not only to Ukraine's future, but more broadly, European, NATO and transatlantic security.\n\nLeaders also plan to discuss what the US views as Chinese manufacturing overcapacity and concerns about Beijing flooding the global market beyond existing demand - echoing what was a significant focus of last year's G7 gathering. US officials have consistently expressed concern about economies across the world being over-reliant on Chinese goods, and reducing China's economic dominance has been a key feature of Biden's first-term foreign policy.\n\nJosh Lipsky, senior director of the GeoEconomics Center, told reporters on a call previewing this year's summit that the world leaders invited who are not officially a member of the G7 alliance speaks volumes about the stakes of the moment.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, newly sworn in for a third term; Pope Francis; Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan; Argentinian President Javier Milei; and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva are all expected to participate in this week's meeting.\n\n\"It's not just the G7 meeting, it's actually the top 10 largest economies in the world minus China,\" Lipsky said. \"It all conveys a sense of urgency and the stakes around this G7. And it has a feeling to me of last chance to do something big before things may change significantly.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri":

We want to demonstrate that the U.S. supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them, and that we'll continue to help address their security needs, not just tomorrow but out into the future,\" Sullivan said.\n\nBiden is scheduled to meet Thursday with Zelensky. The two will hold a press conference following their discussions.\n\nThe agreement will outline a vision for how the U.S. and its allies can work with Ukraine to strengthen its ability to defend itself against Russia and deter future aggression by Moscow.\n\nSullivan said the pact will make clear that the White House intends to work with Congress to find a path for sustainable resources for Ukraine, a potentially challenging goal given Republican resistance to continued aid for Kyiv.\n\nThe agreement also makes clear there is no commitment for U.S. forces to join the fight in Ukraine, Sullivan said.\n\n\"By signing this, we'll also be sending Russia a signal of our resolve,\" Sullivan said. \"If [Russian President] Vladimir Putin thinks he can outlast the coalition supporting Ukraine, he's wrong. He just cannot wait us out and this agreement will show our resolve and continued commitment.\"\n\nBiden has made a point during each of his international trips to highlight the unified front the U.S. and its allies have shown in supporting Ukraine, and that topic is again likely to be central to this week's events at the G7.\n\nLeaders is Europe are reportedly deeply alarmed about former President Trump's potential return to the White House and what that would mean for Ukraine support and broader Western alliances. Trump has promised to end the Ukraine war almost immediately upon entering office, though he has offered few specifics about what a peace deal might look like.\n\nBiden is skipping a Ukraine peace summit being held Saturday in Switzerland to return home for a major fundraiser in California. Vice President Harris will attend in his place.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

summit in southern Italy.\n\nFor a second year running, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will attend the summit, taking part in talks on Thursday, and is due to sign a new long-term security accord with US President Joe Biden.\n\nThe G7 leaders are likely to announce they have agreed at least in principle on plans to issue $US50 billion ($A75 billion) of loans for Ukraine using interest from Russian sovereign assets frozen after its invasion of Ukraine to back the multi-year debt package.\n\n\"I think we will have the major tentpoles of this decided, but some of the specifics left to be worked through by experts on a defined timetable,\" White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said of the discussions.\n\n\"I think we are on the verge of a good outcome here.\"\n\nOfficials acknowledge the plan is complex, with legal experts still having to thrash out the details that will need the backing of European nations, particularly Belgium, which is not in the G7.\n\nWith the Middle East, migration and artificial intelligence also on a packed agenda, the three-day summit in the southern Italian region of Puglia would be taxing for leaders at the best of times, but most of them are also bowed down by domestic woes.\n\nOnly the host, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, is riding high after triumphing in Italy's European election but achieving meaningful results in the luxury Borgo Egnazia hotel resort will be a tall order.\n\nBiden's goal at the G7 was to reinforce the idea that the US was best served if it was closely aligned with its democratic allies and partners, Sullivan said when asked about the prospects of it being the president's last summit given he faces a re-election battle in November.\n\nUnderscoring US determination to punish Moscow for its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Washington on Wednesday dramatically broadened sanctions on Moscow including by targeting China-based companies selling semiconductors to Moscow.\n\nBy announcing new restrictions on Chinese firms on the eve of the G7 meeting, Biden was no doubt hoping to persuade Western allies to show greater resolve in confronting Beijing over its support for Russia and its industrial over-capacity.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the start of the summit, Sullivan said China was a significant creditor to many heavily indebted countries.\n\n\"The G7 communique is not singling out or focusing on a single country,\" he said but added that China needed to play a constructive role in dealing with the debt burden.", "source": {"uri":

They will be negotiating the details during the summit, aiming to announce the agreement in the G7 communique at the end of the summit this week, the source added.\n\nThis plan to finance Ukraine would send a powerful message to Russia's Vladimir Putin that he will not outlast the U.S. and its allies' support for Ukraine, regardless of how elections in their countries unfold, according to the source.\n\nBut the G7 nations have to hammer out tricky details, including how disbursement would work and what the repayment assurances would be, the source said. European countries also have differing views on utilizing these profits, with some preferring direct spending on weapons. There are also complicated legal issues and concerns about who would back the loan.\n\nThis is the first G7 summit since the Hamas Oct. 7 attack on Israel. While there have been divisions among member countries over the war, the countries have now unified around President Biden's plan for a cease-fire. Earlier this month, G7 leaders released a joint statement formally endorsing Biden's plan and calling on Hamas to accept it.\n\nAnother key area of discussion among leaders is countering China's trade practices and overcapacity. According to the source, the G7 nations agree that China's excess industrial capacity poses a global problem.\n\nThe fear is that a flood of heavily subsidized products from China -- including steel, machinery, solar products, electric vehicles, and batters -- would decimate those industries in the U.S. and other countries. Last month, President Biden significantly increased tariffs on Chinese imports in strategic sectors, while leaving in place tariffs on more than $300 billion worth of Chinese goods that Trump had imposed.\n\nPope Francis will attend the summit to speak about artificial intelligence, another top priority at the G7.

REUTERS/Guglielmo Mangiapane\n\nBy Andrea Shalal and Angelo Amante\n\nBORGO EGNAZIA, Italy (Reuters) - Leaders of the Group of Seven major democracies started their annual summit on Thursday, many of them under a cloud at home but determined to make a difference on the world stage as they seek to help Ukraine and counter China's economic ambitions.\n\nHeading into two days of talks, diplomats said a deal had been agreed in principle on plans to issue $50 billion of loans for Ukraine using interest from Russian sovereign assets frozen after Moscow launched its invasion of its neighbour in 2022.\n\nWestern nations were also unanimous in their concern over China's industrial overcapacity, which they say is distorting global markets, and their determination to help African states develop their economies, diplomats said.\n\n\"There is a lot of work to be done, but I am sure that in these two days we will be able to have discussions that will lead to concrete and measurable results,\" Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni told her G7 guests as their talks started in a luxury hotel resort in the southern region of Puglia.\n\nWhile Meloni is flying high after triumphing in weekend European elections, the leaders of the other six nations - the United States, Japan, France, Germany, Britain and Canada - face major domestic woes that risk undermining their authority.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden faces an uphill battle to win re-election in November, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak looks certain to lose power at a national poll next month and French President Emmanuel Macron dissolved his country's parliament on Sunday after his party was trounced in the European vote.\n\nAll smiled broadly as they greeted Meloni under a blazing sun at the entrance to the Borgo Egnazia resort where they will spend the next two days in sessions that will later be opened to a host of fellow leaders, including Pope Francis.\n\nFor a second year running, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will attend the summit, taking part in talks on Thursday afternoon, after which he will sign a new, long-term security accord with U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nThe G7 leaders will also almost certainly announce that they have agreed the outline of a multi-year loan using profits from the impounded Russian funds, which legal experts will then finalise with the aim of raising cash by the end of the year.\n\n\"I think we will have the major tentpoles of this decided, but some of the specifics left to be worked through by experts on a defined timetable,\" White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said of the discussions.\n\nA senior EU official confirmed there was an outline agreement.\n\n\"I think it's done,\" the official said. \"It should be fine. I don't expect leaders to say...(anything against it).\"\n\nA person close to the talks said the point of deal was to ensure it can run for years regardless of who is in power in each G7 state - a nod to concerns that U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump might be much less favourable to Kyiv if he beats Biden in November.\n\nPACKED AGENDA\n\nBiden's goal at the G7 was to reinforce the idea that the United States is best served if it is closely aligned with its democratic allies, Sullivan said, when asked about the prospects of it being the president's last summit given the looming re-election battle.\n\nUnderscoring U.S. determination to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine, Washington on Wednesday dramatically broadened sanctions on Moscow, including by targeting China-based companies selling semiconductors to Moscow.\n\nBy announcing new restrictions on Chinese firms on the eve of the G7 meeting, Biden was no doubt hoping to persuade Western allies to show greater resolve in confronting Beijing over its support for Russia and its industrial over-capacity.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the start of the summit, Sullivan said that China was a significant creditor to many heavily indebted countries.\n\n\"The G7 communique is not singling out or focusing on a single country,\" he said, but added that China needed to play a constructive role in dealing with the debt burden.\n\nEager not to appear like an elitist fortress, the G7 has thrown open its doors to a large number of outsiders this year, including the pope, who is expected to give a keynote speech on Friday on the risks and potential of Artificial Intelligence.\n\nAmong those who have also been invited to Puglia are the leaders of some of the biggest regional powers across the globe such as India, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Algeria and Kenya.\n\nAlthough the summit is scheduled to run until Saturday, many G7 chiefs will leave on Friday night, including Biden, meaning the final day has been earmarked for bilateral meetings for those staying on and a closing news conference from Meloni.\n\n(Reporting by Crispian Balmer, Angelo Amante, Andrew Gray, Andrea Shalal, Thomas Escrit and John

Piero Cruciatti/AFP/Getty Images hide caption\n\nWestern leaders have agreed to the concept of using the interest from frozen Russian financial assets to help support Ukraine fight Russia and rebuild after the lengthy war.\n\nBut they're still working out the details of exactly how and when to distribute the roughly $3 billion in annual interest. Those negotiations are at the top of the agenda for the G7 leaders' summit in Puglia, Italy.\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Western governments froze about $300 billion in Russian assets -- including money, securities, gold and bonds -- held mainly in banks in Europe.\n\nLeaders of the G7 economies have agreed to use the interest generated by the assets -- about $3 billion per year -- to help Ukraine buy weapons for its fight against Russia and rebuild after the war.\n\nThe United States and European countries have different proposals for distributing the money.\n\nScheherazade Rehman, a professor of international finance at George Washington University, explained it in simple terms.\n\n\"The Europeans would like to transfer them to Ukraine yearly or every two years, so spread it out. The Americans, however, want to find a way to get this money very quickly to Ukraine all at once,\" Rehman said.\n\nThe European proposal would see about $3 billion a year go to Ukraine, and only interest from a certain part of the frozen Russian assets -- $190 billion held by a company called Euroclear in Belgium -- would be shared.\n\nThe U.S., on the other hand, wants to give $60 billion to Ukraine up front, because Ukraine's need on the battlefield is dire. Officials have said the interest generated from the frozen Russian assets would go toward paying back that money.\n\nRehman said Washington has the weaker hand in the debate because only about $5 billion of the $300 billion in Russian assets are held in the United States -- and European nations are concerned about how they would be paid back for a big initial lump sum.\n\nIt's hard to say what this agreement will look like in its final form -- but officials familiar with the planning have told reporters that President Biden is going to make a final push to secure a deal.\n\nThe agreement will likely be some sort of compromise between the European and U.S. proposals. But Rehman said recent elections in countries like France and Germany may also affect discussions.\n\n\"Europeans really have to get their act together at this G7 meeting because they're on shaky ground just because of the European parliamentary elections that just took place where the hard right has now got a historic toehold,\" she said.\n\n\"The Europeans are coming into this with very different footing than if this was 10 days ago.\"", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "deepa_shivaram@npr.org", "name": "Deepa Shivaram", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(meeting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summit (meeting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Security (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brindisi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brindisi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brindisi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apulia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apulia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Apulia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euroclear", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euroclear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Washington University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Unclaimed_Money", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Unclaimed Money", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Associations", "wgt": 12}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4717x2653+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F17%2Fb0%2F0433e7954f75a953c0de0fd4f077%2Fgettyimages-2156532583.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644722", "eventUri": "eng-9644722", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

That has widened to the possibility other G7 countries could participate in the risk-sharing.\n\n\"This option... would send a strong message of international unity and cooperation to support Ukraine,\" European finance ministers said in early June in a preparatory document for a meeting.\n\nG7 member Japan faces some restrictions: its constitution prohibits it from financing the military spending of third countries.\n\n- What could go wrong? -\n\nEU sanctions imposed on Russia -- including the freezing of Russian assets -- have to be renewed every six months by a unanimous vote at the Council of Europe.\n\nHungary's nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has close ties to Putin, could block the renewal, particularly since Budapest will take over the rotating EU Presidency in July.\n\nAnd critics have asked what would happen if peace was declared and the assets were unfrozen.\n\nG7 finance ministers said Moscow's assets \"will remain tied up until Russia pays for the damage it has caused to Ukraine\" -- suggesting they could generate profits for a long time to come.\n\nConcerns have also been raised that third countries like China could reduce investments in the West for fear that assets could be seized.\n\nRussia is also threatening retaliation.\n\nPutin signed a decree in May authorising the confiscation in Russia of assets belonging to the US or \"associated\" individuals.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "thesun.my"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type":

Thanks so much for joining this on-the-record gaggle to preview the G7 and go through the news of day with White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby.\n\nKirby will have a few words at the top, and then we'll take your questions.\n\nKirby, I'll turn it over to you.\n\nMR. KIRBY: Thanks, Eduardo. Hey. Good afternoon, everybody.\n\nI think as you all know, tomorrow President Biden will be heading to Puglia, Italy, for the G7 Leaders' Summit.\n\nI want to start by just taking a quick step back to the President's very first G7 in Cornwall. The leaders hadn't been in person for years at that point because of the pandemic, and there was a real sense of relief in the room that America was back and actually leading at the table. And that's still more true now than ever. The President's message on that G7 in Cornwall was that we need to step up in solidarity and demonstrate that democracies can still deliver for our people and for people all over the world.\n\nAnd for the past few years, we've done that in a number of areas. That includes in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which not only threatens democracy in Ukraine but actually affects security across the European continent as well, and also affects the post-World War Two international order that the President talked about very eloquently in Normandy last week.\n\nAt the G7 meeting later this week, our commitment to Ukraine will continue to be right up front and clear. We will take bold steps to show Mr. Putin that time is not on his side and that he cannot outlast us, as we support Ukraine's fight for freedom.\n\nFirst, we will announce new steps to unlock the value of the immobilized Russian sovereign assets to benefit Ukraine and to help them recover from the destruction that Mr. Putin's army has caused.\n\nOn Thursday, President Biden and President Zelenskyy will sit down to discuss our strong support for Ukraine now and into the future. And following that meeting, both leaders, President Biden and President Zelenskyy, will participate in a news conference.\n\nThroughout the last two and a half years, we've also stood up to Putin in other ways: imposing the strongest set of sanctions and export controls ever placed on a major economy; moving in lockstep to immobilize Russia's sovereign assets to deprive Putin's war machine of critical funding; and to enforce a price cap on Russian oil.\n\nWe're going to continue to drive up costs for the Russian war machine. And this week, we will announce an impactful set of new sanctions and export control actions.\n\nThese actions will follow through on several of the commitments that G7 leaders have made to date. The actions will target the entities and networks that are helping Russia procure what it needs for its war. They will make it harder for financial facilitators, for instance, to support Russia's defense industrial base. And they will further restrict Russia's future revenues in key sectors.\n\nNow, you'll also see in Italy that the G7 is more unified than ever as we stand up for shared values, to tackle global challenges, and to renew our commitment to partners around the world that we will help them invest in bright futures for their people.\n\nWe will build on the progress we made last year on our shared approach to the Indo-Pacific as well, including by advancing an Indo-Pacific region that is free, open, secure, prosperous, resilient, and connected.\n\nWe will address the PRC's support for the Russian defense industrial base. And we will confront China's non-market policies that are leading to harmful global spillovers, working with partners in and beyond the G7 to promote economic resilience and security.\n\nThis year, President Biden will again host a side event that will highlight our positive value proposition to countries around the world via the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, or PGI.\n\nWe will continue to offer a path to help countries overcome unsustainable debt burdens, to boost the World Bank's lending firepower, to mobilize additional capital for high-standard infrastructure investments, and to make new commitments on food and health security.\n\nAnd as many of you saw, leaders will be joined by His Holiness, Pope Francis, for a session on artificial intelligence, among other topics. This will be an important moment for our countries to come together and develop our shared approach to harnessing the benefits of AI while at the same time managing the risks to our national security and impacts that it may have to our workforces and inequality.\n\nThe bottom line here is that President Biden believes we must continue to imagine, to event -- invent, I'm sorry, and to inspire. And we are committed to investing in that vision with our closest allies. We are very confident that if we do, the United States will continue to lead on the world stage for generations to come.\n\nSo the President is very excited about getting over to Italy and having these important discussions at the G7. And I said -- as I said earlier, you'll all be able to hear directly from him and President Zelenskyy as well.\n\nOne last point before I turn it over to questions.\n\nOn behalf of the entire press team at the NSC, I want to congratulate Michael Feldman and his new bride, Wendy, who got married over the weekend in Virginia. Exciting time for them as they start a whole new chapter in their lives. And we wish them all the best and all the happiness.\n\nAs I've long noted and known myself, marriage is the only ocean for which no compass has yet been invented. And I think that's one of the most special things about it. You start on a journey together; you don't really know how long it's going go and how far and how -- and where you're going to go. And I think that's the exciting thing about it. And we're all excited for Michael and Wendy.\n\nAnd with that, we can take some questions.\n\nMODERATOR: Thanks. Our first question will go to the line of Colleen Long. You should be able to unmute yourself.\n\nQ Thank you. Hey, Kirby. Two things. On the G7, I wondered what the likelihood is that the G7 nations are going to agree to the $50 billion loan to Ukraine using frozen assets.\n\nAnd then on Hamas, the ceasefire deal, it looks like they've given mediators back a reply on the proposed deal with some remarks. I wondered if this is, you know, good enough progress, if the U.S. is still sort of believing that the ceasefire deal is imminent. If you could update us on that.\n\nMR. KIRBY: Hey, Colleen. I won't get ahead of the discussions on the frozen assets. As I said, that will be a topic of discussion. The President will continue to reiterate our desire to move in lockstep with our allies and partners on using those frozen assets appropriately to help with reconstruction in Ukraine.\n\nAs I said in my opening statement, there'll be some announcements on that. But I don't want to get too far ahead of all that. And I certainly won't speak for other of our G7 partners.\n\nBut I just want to circle back and just -- as I said before, the only way this works is if we do have participation and support from other nations. But as I said, there'll be some announcements on that. And I think I best leave it at that for right now.\n\nOn your second question, we're in receipt of this reply that Hamas delivered to Qatar and to Egypt. And we are evaluating it right now. And I think that's really as far as I'm going to go today -- just that we have this response, and we're working our way through it and looking at it. And I think, really, that's where I'm going to have to leave it.\n\nMODERATOR: Next up we'll go to Andrea Mitchell. You should be able to unmute yourself.\n\nQ Thank you very much. I understand that, but there's some language in it that indicates that they might still be wanting to continue the hostilities. Do you think it's at least helpful that they have responded?\n\nAnd what is your assessment of the Wall Street Journal's report with communications from Sinwar that seem to be -- that are taking, you know, pleasure in the death of civilians and thinking that it is to the advantage of Hamas to have so many people being killed?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Yeah, on your first question, it's certainly helpful that we have a response, Andrea. No question about that. I mean, we've been eagerly awaiting a response.\n\nBut as for the reported details that may be out there, I think I'm just going to demur right now. We've only just gotten it. Our team is going through it. As I understand, the Qataris and the Egyptians are as well. And I think we just need to reserve comment until we've had a chance to fully examine it. And I hope people can understand that.\n\nI know it's not a super satisfying answer for you all this afternoon, but it's really the most responsible thing that we can do right now, is to really kind of take the thing in full and take our time to go through it to make sure we fully understand it.\n\nI'm not in a position to confirm the specific reporting in the Wall Street Journal about Sinwar, but I will say this: It should come as a shock to no one that Mr. Sinwar cares nothing at all about the lives of innocent Palestinians that have been caught up in this war, a war he started. And it should surprise and shock no one that a beast like Mr. Sinwar would actually take glee in it and see advantage to it.\n\nAgain, without confirming the specifics of the reporting, it is -- in general, it's certainly not uncharacteristic of the brutality that this man is capable of and the willingness that he has shown himself able or capable of, since the beginning, of trying to advance his own agenda on the backs of and in the lives of innocent Palestinians living in Gaza.\n\nAnd it should underscore and be a reminder to everybody how this war started, how quickly it could end if Mr. Sinwar didn't have these predilections and would do the right thing, and exactly what Hamas as an organization is still capable of. I think I'll leave it at that.\n\nQ Hey, thanks so much. Sorry about that. John, are you able to talk a little bit more about the sanctions that you mentioned at the top of the call?\n\nMR. KIRBY: No, Josh. I'm really going to leave it to the opening statement. There'll be some announcements on that, ways in which we're going to increase pressure -- economic pressure on Russia, as I said, specifically around its defense industrial base. But I do hope you can understand that I'm not prepared to use today's gaggle to actually make those announcements.\n\nQ And can you give us any indication as to whether the President plans to speak with Prime Minister Modi, assuming he's still planning on attending, and whether they will discuss the allegations with respect to the alleged plot targeting a national on U.S. soil? Thanks.\n\nMR. KIRBY: The President -- he's looking forward to speaking to all the leaders of the G7, and he'll take advantage of every opportunity he's got to do that. I don't have something on the -- I don't have anything on the calendar that I can point to right now at this point. I know on the flight over you all will be hearing from Jake a little bit more. I think Jake will be able to provide a little bit more flesh on the bone for what the schedule is going to look like. I don't have anything more right now.\n\nMODERATOR: Next up we'll go to the line of Nadia Charters.\n\nQ Thank you, Eduardo. Hi, John. Hello from Italy. Hope to see you soon. I have two questions. Number one is: How does this recent European election and the rise of the right will affect a long-term cooperation between the U.S. and your allies, especially with regarding Ukraine?\n\nAnd second about the Gaza proposal. There's some kind of, like, understanding with either from the Israelis or Hamas that they can still fight whether it is they agree to the term or not? Is the proposal unambiguous enough for the two sides to accept it but to lead them to believe that actually they can continue the way they believe that they can score victory?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Look, on your first question, the results were\n\nmixed inside various countries and they were mixed across Europe. And, look, you know, that's democracy. And democracy, as the President said in Normandy, is an incredibly powerful force for humanity around the world, and we respect it. And more critically, we respect our allies and partners across the continent of Europe.\n\nAnd we have every bit -- every confidence that regardless of who gets what seat in the EU parliament, that we're going to be able to continue to work with all our allies and partners, and we're going to continue to work with the EU. And we look forward to continuing our great relationship with President von der Leyen. And we're not at all concerned that we're not still going to be able to advance shared interests and values across the European continent and continue to support, as we have supported with our EU partners, Ukraine's fight for its freedom and its territorial integrity.\n\nOn your second question: Again, I'm not going to provide any context or details about this response, which just came in and which our team is evaluating and our friends in Qatar and Egypt are as well.\n\nI would just say -- I would just point you back to the way the President characterized this: that if we can get this deal in place, in phase one the fighting stops; the fighting stops all across Gaza. That's what phase one is all about. That's how you get the hostages out safely, and that's how you get, hopefully, up to 600 trucks a day going into Gaza, is with a calm -- a sustainable calm that can potentially lead to phase two, which could lead to a cessation of hostilities altogether.\n\nSo if the deal is entered into by both sides, then you get a ceasefire, at least for six weeks, which means no fighting anywhere in Gaza.\n\nMODERATOR: Next up we'll go to MJ Lee.\n\nQ Thank you. Just back to the Hamas response to the ceasefire proposal. Can you give us even a general sense of whether the changes that they say they are demanding are significant or not? And is it also your understanding that the response came from Sinwar and had his blessing?\n\nAnd then just secondly -- obviously understand the primary focus of this briefing, but given the significant news today, just as the President's advisor and a spokesperson for this White House, can you give us a sense of how the President has been processing the news of his son's conviction and just where his head is right now?\n\nMR. KIRBY: MJ, two very fair questions, and I'm afraid I'm just not going to be able to be helpful on either of them. I really don't want to prejudice or get ahead of our review of the text here. So I'm not going to get into content one way or the other at this point.\n\nIt has in the past, and so it is today, our assumption that if Hamas has delivered a response to Qatar, which they have, that it comes with Mr. Sinwar's approbation. That's the way Hamas has operated in the past -- that Sinwar has to sign off on it. That's certainly our assumption going into this text here.\n\nBut I need to reserve any comment until the experts have had a chance to go through it and make their own assessments.\n\nAgain, this just happened within the last couple of hours, guys, so just -- I understand that -- I do really understand the interest in it, but we're just going to need to take the time to work through that text in the right way. And again, I hope you all can understand it.\n\nThere's a whole heck of a lot riding here, a whole lot at stake, and not the least of which -- in fact, the most important of which is the lives of these hostages and their families. And we just -- we need to be very, very careful about what we say and how we say it. And this just came across the desk, and so we're going to take the time to evaluate it the right way and figure out what the next step is going to be.\n\nAnd on your second question, that's well beyond the scope of my duties at the National Security Council, and I'm simply not able to speak to that one way or the other.\n\nMODERATOR: Next up we'll go to the line of Aurelia End. You should be able to --\n\nQ Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. The first question is just to clarify: These announcements on the frozen assets and on sanctions, will those G7 announcements or will those be announcement from this administration?\n\nAnd second question: The President goes to Europe just after elections that have shown a rise in -- you know, from populist parties and parties that for some of them have clear pro-Russia positions. So how concerned is he about that?\n\nAnd also, more precisely, is he ready to maybe in a few weeks work with a far-right-led government in France?\n\nMR. KIRBY: The President will work with the democratically elected leaders of France no matter who they are. As he said when we were in Normandy and in Paris, France is our oldest ally, and we will always work with whoever the French people decide to elect as their representatives. Full stop right there.\n\nOn your second question: As I said, we have every confidence that regardless of who fills what seats in the EU parliament, we're going to continue to work closely with President von der Leyen and our EU partners on all the issues relative to our shared interest across the European continent, and that includes supporting Ukraine. And I'll leave it at that. We're confident in that.\n\nAnd, dang it, I didn't write down your first question. What the heck was it again?\n\nQ I was asking: These announcements this week on frozen assets and on sanctions, are those going to be common G7 announcements or only U.S. announcements?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Well, I think, again, you're going to -- the issue of the frozen assets will actually be on the agenda. You'll see those leaders talk about the need to move in lockstep, as we have in the past, to immobilize these Russian sovereign assets.\n\nAnd I think you're going to see -- what I can say is: You'll see -- I think you're going to see unanimity here at the G7 when it comes to working towards using these frozen assets to help Ukraine with their reconstruction. I'll leave it at that.\n\nMODERATOR: Next up we'll go to Marek. You should be able to unmute yourself.\n\nQ Thank you, Eduardo. Hi, John. The NATO Summit is just a month away from now, here in Washington. How far is NATO from a consensus on the next Secretary General?\n\nMR. KIRBY: Marek, I wouldn't be able to answer that one. That's really for the Alliance to speak to, and I'm not going to get ahead of the Alliance on that and who the next Secretary General is. That's beyond the scope of my ability today.\n\nMODERATOR: Next up we'll go to Patsy.\n\nQ Thank you, Eduardo. Hi, John. First question: How confident is the President that there will be a G7 agreement on a concrete plan to deal with Chinese overcapacity?\n\nAnd to follow up on the questions on the surge of far-right parties, I thought I heard you say that the President is looking forward to a great relationship with President von der Leyen. So are you saying that he is confident that Ursula von der Leyen will secure a second term?\n\nAnd just last on logistics, if I may: Will the President have a bilat with Giorgia Meloni and also an audience with the Pope, and when? Thank you.\n\nMR. KIRBY: Yeah, again, on the specific meetings with specific leaders, you'll hear more from Jake tomorrow and more details about the agenda. I'll defer to Jake on that.\n\nAnd my comments about President von der Leyen were certainly representative of what we generally believe to be the likely outcome here.\n\nMODERATOR: Next up we'll go to Karen DeYoung.\n\nQ Thanks, John. In their response to the U.N. resolution yesterday and in their response today, Hamas said that what they're seeking is a commitment to a permanent ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal. As I understand the plan, as the President explains it, negotiations in phase one are open-ended until -- assuming that both sides act in good faith -- until there's an agreement to a permanent ceasefire and withdrawal. So, in other words, in phase one, a ceasefire would continue. Israel has never committed to that and, in fact, has said it's not finished with its operations in Gaza.\n\nBased on the administration's conversations with the Israelis, do you believe that Israel has committed to that and is prepared to say so publicly or (inaudible)?\n\nMR. KIRBY: This is an Israeli proposal, Karen, and they've acknowledged that themselves. This is an Israeli proposal. The President accurately and meticulously identified the details of it to include, as you rightly point out, what would happen in phase two.\n\nNow, the phase two negotiations obviously haven't begun because we're not even in phase one. But the idea of getting to phase one is you use that six weeks to start negotiating phase two. But you accurately depicted what would happen in phase two, and the Israelis have said that that is their proposal.\n\nMODERATOR: Next up we'll go to Molly Nagle.\n\nQ Hi. Thanks so much for doing this. I wanted to see if you could confirm -- there are reports that President Biden has approved the deployment of another Patriot missile system to Ukraine and that it could be deployed to the frontlines in the next several days. Can you confirm this report?\n\nQ Hey, thanks for having this. I have a quick question on the Houthis. The U.S. Navy continues to expend lots of resources fighting the Houthis. For instance, they've fired off more than 500 munitions costing some $1 billion, and yet the Houthis have continued to attack ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. I'm wondering how sustainable is the U.S. naval presence in the region and how long does the administration expect that this can go on for.\n\nMR. KIRBY: Without getting into, you know, inventory levels and resupply -- you know, that gets you into an operational security environment pretty dang quick in talking about making sure ships are armed and ready.\n\nI can tell you that President Biden and the entire national security team is committed to making sure this coalition of more than 20 nations that are operating in and around the Red Sea to defend and to defeat Houthi attacks on commercial shipping remains high. And we will continue to do everything that we can to knock that steel out of the sky and make sure that our Navy is fully prepared to do so.\n\nIt is still -- you know, you're asking me -- if you're asking me -- and I'm not suggesting you are; but if you are, like, you know, what date on the calendar does this operation end, I would tell you we don't have a date on the calendar right now because it's still a very viable threat. And shipping companies are still making pretty dang tough decisions about what route they're going to take to get goods to market. And we want to make sure that they have a measure of confidence that they can still travel through the Red Sea.\n\nSo the mission is still alive. It's still viable. And, quite frankly, we believe it's still vital. And we're going to treat it that way when it comes to resourcing it.\n\nMODERATOR: We have time for one more question. We'll go to the line of Laura Kelly.\n\nQ Hi. Thank you so much for taking my question. Looking ahead at the G7 and the NATO Summit in Washington, how concerned is the U.S. about increasing Russian hybrid attacks\n\non NATO member states in Europe? We saw those that are attributed to Russia and those that are suspected of being attributed to Russia. And do we see that the U.S. and allies are going to make any statements addressing this or have any work done about taking some sort of action? Thank you.\n\nMR. KIRBY: I don't have anything with respect to statements about these hybrid attacks at the G7. But make no mistake, as I mentioned in my opening statement: What Russia has done in Ukraine and what they continue to do or try to do across the landscape of the European continent remains a significant concern for President Biden, certainly for our entire national security team and those of our G7 partners. And I have little doubt that the full scope of Russia's malign activities will be discussed at the G7.\n\nBut as to what individual leaders plan to say about all that, you know, I certainly can't predict. We are watching these, quote, unquote, \"hybrid attacks,\" to use your phrase,\n\nclosely. We are certainly mindful that these are the kinds of things that Russia has done in the past and has certainly continued to prove their capability of doing now. It is of a page from their playbook.\n\nAnd as I said in my opening statement, we will continue to examine, pursue, and announce measures to hold Russia accountable, certainly for what they're doing in Ukraine, and to make it harder for their defense industrial base to continue to\n\nthreaten the security of not only the Ukrainian people but the European continent. I'll leave it at that.\n\nMODERATOR: Thanks, Kirby. And thanks, everyone, for joining. That's all the time we have for today. If you have any follow-up questions, feel free to email our distro, and we'll get back to you.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky will attend the summit to personally drive home the urgency.\n\nBiden is also expected to meet with Zelensky this week -- their second meeting in a week after their sit down in Paris.\n\nYet, the seven member countries have not reached a consensus. They will be negotiating the details during the summit, aiming to announce the agreement in the G7 communique at the end of the summit this week, the source added.\n\nThis plan to finance Ukraine would send a powerful message to Russia's Vladimir Putin that he will not outlast the U.S. and its allies' support for Ukraine, regardless of how elections in their countries unfold, according to the source.\n\nBut the G7 nations have to hammer out tricky details, including how disbursement would work and what the repayment assurances would be, the source said. European countries also have differing views on utilizing these profits, with some preferring direct spending on weapons. There are also complicated legal issues and concerns about who would back the loan.\n\nIsrael/Hamas war\n\nThis is the first G7 summit since the Hamas Oct. 7 attack on Israel. While there have been divisions among member countries over the war, the countries have now unified around President Biden's plan for a cease-fire. Earlier this month, G7 leaders released a joint statement formally endorsing Biden's plan and calling on Hamas to accept it.\n\nChina\n\nAnother key area of discussion among leaders is countering China's trade practices and overcapacity. According to the source, the G7 nations agree that China's excess industrial capacity poses a global problem.\n\nThe fear is that a flood of heavily subsidized products from China -- including steel, machinery, solar products, electric vehicles, and batters -- would decimate those industries in the U.S. and other countries. Last month, President Biden significantly increased tariffs on Chinese imports in strategic sectors, while leaving in place tariffs on more than $300 billion worth of Chinese goods that Trump had imposed.\n\nPope Francis, AI\n\nPope Francis will attend the summit to speak about artificial intelligence, another top priority at the G7.

Security Council resolution.\"\n\nAs Biden was in flight to Italy, the U.S. Treasury Department announced fresh sanctions that target individuals and companies, including those based in China, that are selling semiconductors to Russia.\n\nIt includes an expansion of secondary sanctions that allow the United States to blacklist any bank around the world that does business with Russian financial institutions already facing sanctions. The goal is to prevent smaller banks in China and other countries from funding the Russian war effort.\n\nThe sanctions also target networks Russia uses to obtain critical materials for building aerial drones, anti-drone equipment, industrial machinery and for the country's chemical and biological weapons program, the Treasury Department said.\n\n\"We are increasing the risk for financial institutions dealing with Russia's war economy and eliminating paths for evasion, and diminishing Russia's ability to benefit from access to foreign technology, equipment, software, and IT services,\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement.\n\nThe Moscow Exchange, Russia's top financial marketplace, announced it was halting trading of dollars and euros after being listed in the new sanctions.\n\nBiden is also set to sign on Thursday a bilateral security agreement with Ukraine during his meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The agreement is intended to show U.S. resolve to strengthen Ukraine's defense and deterrence capabilities without committing American troops on the Ukrainian battlefield. The agreement would include Ukrainian commitment to reform and on end-use monitoring of U.S.-provided weapons.\n\nIt will be Biden's second meeting with Zelenskyy in the span of days; the two met in Paris on the sidelines of the 80-year commemoration of D-Day last week.\n\nRussian frozen assets\n\nZelenskyy will be urging G7 leaders to get behind Biden's plan to provide Kyiv with a loan of up to $50 billion for Ukraine's war efforts against Russia, amid Moscow's strategic advances in the battlefield. The U.S. proposal would pay back Western allies using interest income from the $280 billion in Russian assets frozen in Western financial institutions, estimated at $3 billion a year, for 10 years or more.\n\nThe goal is a Leaders' Declaration at the end of the summit, a \"framework that is not generic, that is quite specific in terms of what it would entail,\" Sullivan told VOA as he spoke to reporters in flight. However, \"core operational details\" would still need to be worked out. It's unclear whether the loan will be provided by the G7 or only some of its members.\n\nIn April, Biden signed legislation to seize the roughly $5 billion in Russian assets that had been immobilized in U.S. financial institutions. But the bulk of the money, $190 billion, is in Belgium and much of the rest, is in France and Germany.\n\nA big source of concern for Europeans is who will be responsible to cover losses should interest rates fall below expectations or if the sanctions that immobilize the funds are not renewed. Russia considers the immobilizing of its assets following its invasion on Ukraine as theft and has threatened retaliation.\n\nAlthough Ukraine is not a G7 member, this is the second consecutive year Zelenskyy is attending the summit. From Italy, he heads to Switzerland for a Ukraine peace conference over the weekend.\n\nEU puts tariffs on Chinese EVs\n\nBiden imposed a drastic tariff hike in May to confront what he calls Chinese overcapacity in strategic green technologies and has been urging the G7 to do the same.\n\nOn Wednesday, the European Union responded to the call by announcing it would slap Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) with higher tariffs, up to 38.1%, saying the imports benefit \"heavily from unfair subsidies\" and pose a \"threat of economic injury\" to producers in Europe.\n\nU.S. tariffs on Chinese EVs were quadrupled to a 100% rate, while solar cell and semiconductor import tariffs were doubled to 50%. The rates on certain steel and aluminum imports were tripled to 25%. The additional duties covered $18 billion in Chinese products.\n\nEurope is taking action to address Chinese overcapacity just as the United States has done, Sullivan said. A \"common framework\" on how to deal with various economic security issues posed by China will likely be included in the G7 final communique, he added.\n\nThe punitive moves could prompt retaliation from Beijing, which accuses the West of hyping overcapacity claims to blunt China's competitive edge.\n\nBiden arrived on the global forum after a family drama. On Tuesday, a day before departing for the summit, his son Hunter Biden was found guilty on federal charges of possessing of a gun while being addicted to drugs.\n\nBiden has said he would not use presidential powers to pardon his son. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to respond to further questions, including the possibility of commuting Hunter Biden's sentence when it is given by the judge.", "source":

But players from many other nations and international organizations - and even Pope Francis - will be in attendance as well.\n\nThe summit is not just a formality, and how the leaders of these seven countries act through it carries weight, says Victor Cha, senior vice president for Asia and the Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based nonprofit research organization. Leading up to the summit, for instance, the Biden administration announced new sanctions targeting Russia due to its war with Ukraine. The G7 also is expected to focus on using profits generated by Russia's frozen assets to help its invaded neighbor, and Biden is expected to sign a new security agreement with Ukraine.\n\n\"This informal grouping is suddenly increasingly seen as this very important institution that is trying to address these global issues,\" says Cha, who is also a professor of government at Georgetown University, a former Biden administration appointee and the former director for Asian Affairs for President George W. Bush's National Security Council.\n\nCha spoke with U.S. News this week about why the G7 matters, in addition to the priorities for the summit and for Biden himself. Questions and answers below have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat is the G7, and why is it important?\n\nThe G7 is a group of advanced industrialized democracies that come together once a year. And they basically discuss whatever issue the host country thinks is most important. For example, last year at the G7 Hiroshima summit in Japan, there was a lot of focus on supply chains and economic security. At this G7 summit, the host is Italy, and they have suggested that migration - which is particularly important for Italy, migration from North Africa - is one of the topics that will be discussed.\n\nThere are two wars going on, so they will discuss these wars in the Middle East and Europe, and many other global issues like climate change, energy transition, environmental protection, development. The leaders come together to discuss what are the major global issues, and then release a statement in which they sometimes define norms and principles about new areas - for example, the use of artificial intelligence - or they make commitments with regard to development assistance to Africa or to other developing and emerging economies in the world.\n\nIt's very unique, in the sense that it is a very informal structure. It's not like the U.N. Security Council. It has no official secretariat anywhere. It is largely Europe-dominated, so only three of the seats are non-European: the U.S., Canada and Japan. The European Council and the European Commission also have a seat (representing the European Union).\n\nYou mentioned a bunch of priorities on the agenda. Among those, is there one that you think is most important?\n\nSo there (are sessions) on Africa, climate, the Middle East, Ukraine, migration. And then there's also a session on the Indo-Pacific, which is a little bit bizarre since there's only one country from the Indo-Pacific that'll be there - Japan. In the past, Australia and South Korea have been invited. They were invited last year. But the host determines all that and the host this year, despite a lot of U.S. lobbying, chose not to invite South Korea and Australia, and invited in a whole bunch of different countries.\n\nThe Indo-Pacific is important because it's where the majority of the world's economies are. It's also a hot spot for security, for tech, for supply chains.\n\nWhat might the stakes for President Biden be at this year's summit?\n\nI'm sure that he will get asked a lot about whether he's going to win in November. You remember, the first G7 that Trump went to, that famous statement by (former German Chancellor Angela) Merkel afterwards, saying Europe has to look after itself from now on and can't rely on the United States. That certainly won't be the vibe at this summit. I think most of the G7 leaders will welcome Biden, will welcome his commitment as a globalist to advancing democracy and freedom.\n\nSo it'll be a good opportunity for Biden to trumpet, from a domestic political context, what he stands for and how the world welcomes that kind of United States - one that's engaged with the world, a responsible stakeholder, not America first. I think it'll give him an opportunity to reiterate the themes that he spoke on at the D-Day commemoration.\n\nThere's some reporting about an additional action tied to Russia at the summit. Have you heard anything about that?\n\nThat's certainly been the buzz. If there's one particular action, it might be efforts to use Russia's frozen assets to help Ukraine.\n\nThese are sorts of the things that the G7 leaders can do. What they say and do obviously doesn't have the force of a U.N. Security Council resolution, because they're not mandated to comply with it. But when the major advanced industrialized democracies say they're going to coordinate policy on doing something, it can have a real impact.\n\nThese G7 meetings are important in that respect because right now, if you think about it, the U.N. Security Council is not working, because of China and Russia. The G20, which was created in the aftermath of the financial crisis at the beginning of the Obama administration, that's way too big. It doesn't work. The World Trade Organization has 160 members in it, that doesn't work. We have two wars and we don't have a lot of global governance, and so the G7, this informal grouping is suddenly increasingly seen as this very important institution that is trying to address these global issues, but in a very informal way.\n\nYou mentioned things they can come together on and do that can have a real impact. Can you think of an example from past summits?\n\nThis has been really a more recent phenomenon of the G7. They originally came together as the G4 or 5 in the 1970s in the wake of the oil shock to try to coordinate monetary policy. So it was a very informal grouping that was largely focused on macroeconomics.\n\nLast year, the big focus was economic security, supply chains, stopping economic coercion. They didn't say who, but they obviously meant China. When the seven advanced industrial democracies get together and they say, \"We're going to get together and try to create supply chains that can't be disrupted by China, and we're going to try to actually come up with a strategy for deterring China from using economic coercion as a regular tool of diplomacy,\" then that matters. This is the first time that the countries said they were going to do that. That then led the NATO leaders' summit, which followed the G7, to say, \"We're going to do the same thing too.\"\n\nGoing back to Biden: Is there anything else you think of that he likely hopes to accomplish on behalf of the U.S.?\n\nI certainly think that some sort of financial action on Russia is going to be something they would hope to make some progress on. The other would be Gaza and support for the ceasefire. Although I would imagine views on Gaza are pretty divided within that group.\n\nI think the other would also be with regard to China. It's ironic because none of the key Asian players were invited, but this has been sort of a baseline theme of all U.S. foreign policy under Biden, this long-term strategic competition with China. So I'm sure he's going to try to push for some sort of statement on defense of Taiwan or the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, in the interests of all the G7 members, not just in the interest of the U.S. and Taiwan. I think he's also going to want to see the G7 members speak out on this growing relationship between China and Russia. (China is) not sending arms to Russia like the North Koreans, but they are supporting Russia in terms of industrial capacity. I'm sure they're going to want to call China out on that.\n\nIs there anything else about the G7 that you think is important to highlight?\n\nI think if the G7 is going to play this role as the new global governance institution, it needs some reform, and one of them is its membership. The G7 today represents less than 10% of the world population and less than half of the global economy. That was not the case in the 70s. It was a huge part of the global economy.\n\nThere have been a number of people that have called for adding new members from outside of Europe, and the two that most often come up are Australia and South Korea.

The loan is expected to be announced later today, before U.S. President Joe Biden and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, are to meet at the G7 site in Fasano, in southern Italy.\n\n\"I am very confident that an agreement could be made in the hours to come,\" Charles Michel, president of the EU Council, who participates in the G7 summit, told reporters on the sidelines of the G7 meeting on Thursday.\n\nThe reports said that the loan would be provided by the G7 countries based on the size of their economies, meaning Canada's portion would be relatively small. The loan would be repaid by the profits of on the roughly US$300-billion of frozen Russian financial assets held abroad, most of them in Europe at the Belgian clearing house Euroclear.\n\nThose profits come to some US$3-billion a year.\n\nThe EU had proposed handing only the profits from the assets to Kyiv. The United States, backed by Canada and the U.K., had floated the more ambitious idea of using the profits to back a US$50-billion loan, an amount that would allow Ukraine to buy large amounts of weapons in the short-to medium-term.\n\nMr. Zelensky had been urging his Western allies for the larger amount. In recent months, the war has gone badly for Ukraine, with Russian forces making small but steady progress in the eastern parts of country. Ukraine's military has been forced to ration everything from air-defence missiles to 155 mm cannon shells as stores of weapons went short.\n\nA leaked G7 statement called the money \"Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) loans for Ukraine,\" according to a Financial Times report. The statement said the loans were to be arranged \"With a view to supporting Ukraine's current and future needs in the face of a prolonged defence against Russia.\"\n\nThe size of the loan, and its potentially long repayment period, suggests that the G7 leaders think the Ukraine-Russia war will not end anytime soon, though Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, has said he could end the war in \"24 hours.\"\n\nDetails of the loan, including who would bear the ultimate risk in case the payments went into default, were not known on Thursday. It seems likely that many of those details will be worked out after the G7 ends on June 16.\n\n\"I think we will have the major tent poles of this decided, but some of the specifics left to be worked through by experts on a defined timetable,\" U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Thursday in Italy.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and

While Biden aides are coming into the summit hopeful the coalition can clinch a deal, they cautioned that there are still major hurdles to clear.\n\n\"The president will continue to reiterate our desire to move in lockstep with our allies and partners on using those frozen assets,\" White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said ahead of the summit. \"The only way this works is if we do have participation and support from other nations.\"\n\nMaking headway has fast become a top priority, propelled by political upheaval on both sides of the Atlantic that officials in the U.S. and Europe now worry could jeopardize the West's long-term support for the war.\n\nEuropean leaders arrived here still reeling from steep parliamentary losses to far-right forces -- most conspicuously in France and Germany, where its governments have played central roles in unifying the continent behind Ukraine. In the U.S., deepening GOP divisions over Ukraine have cut off Biden's ability to deliver continued aid from U.S. taxpayers. And if Donald Trump returns to power in November, officials fear he might pull America's backing completely, dealing a death blow to the global coalition.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the G7 nations have increasingly coalesced around the frozen asset scheme as likely their best and only available pathway to keep aid flowing and help turn the tide of the war. The group is expected to agree this week to pursue the plan, even amid ongoing differences over how exactly to structure it. Biden on Thursday will also hold a press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a further demonstration of solidarity.\n\n\"They want to show that the West, basically, is still unified,\" said Daniel Hamilton, a former senior State Department official who served as its deputy assistant secretary for European affairs. \"It's all about finding a way to continue to finance Ukraine regardless of who is president of the United States.\"\n\nThe fresh urgency is just the latest test of the president's ability to sustain the type of international support for Ukraine that he has described as critical for the larger struggle over the future of democracy and made a central selling point of his reelection campaign.\n\nIt also underscores how limited the options are for the administration to execute on that vision. The U.S. on Thursday will sign a bilateral security agreement with Ukraine that pledges greater cooperation on military training, weapons and intelligence-sharing over the next decade. It is also imposing a fresh round of sanctions targeting Russia and the entities supporting its military operations. But those are narrow steps that can be reversed should Trump win in November, leaving the U.S. and its allies searching for options that are more inoculated from shifting politics across the West.\n\nThe emerging funding plan centers on using the interest and other investment returns generated by the frozen assets to secure a loan of around $50 billion to Ukraine, in a scheme designed to navigate a thicket of regulations across several countries that has never been attempted before.\n\nSome European officials, including those in Germany and France, have remained skeptical. And even Zelenskyy expressed some misgivings of his own, warning last week that the the funding it generates may not be enough.\n\n\"It's certainly complicated,\" said Tobin Marcus, a former Biden economic adviser. He added it will be a \"great triumph of structured finance\" if the countries pull it off. \"It's been challenging to get folks on board, and there's a lot of reluctance.\"\n\nThat has made the process a frustrating one at times for U.S. officials, who view the frozen assets as a key tool for sustaining Ukraine's economic rebuilding. In an effort to speed the negotiations, the U.S. at one point offered to put up the entirety of the $50 billion loan, said one person familiar with the discussions, who was granted anonymity to discuss the private talks. Still, it's still unclear how that would work and to what extent it would need sign-off from lawmakers, and negotiators more recently have focused on funding the loan collectively.\n\n\"We expect the participation of multiple countries, not just one country,\" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Wednesday.\n\nSullivan expressed optimism that the talks were making progress, but emphasized the need for the group to move quickly in finalizing an overall framework.\n\n\"The goal is not to wait until some indefinite point in the future, it's to provide the necessary resources now,\" he said.\n\nThe more than $250 billion of Russian assets sitting in Western financial institutions has been immobilized since the start of the war. But for much of the past two years, European nations resisted diverting the money. They feared that doing so would spark broader concerns about the safety of assets stored in the eurozone, prompting other countries to pull their money from the region and undermine its overall stability.\n\nThat opposition, though, has thawed as the West exhausted its faster, simpler options for getting aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. is paralyzed by a divided Congress that took six months to approve its last $60 billion package and is unlikely to consider another. European allies, meanwhile, have sent much of their readily available aid to Ukraine already and now face the prospect of shouldering a greater proportion of the war's expense.\n\nWith Russia showing no signs of tempering its military ambitions, U.S. and European officials now feel greater urgency to show Russian President Vladimir Putin that Ukraine's allies are dug in for a lengthy fight.\n\nThat's an impulse that, for some European nations, is driven equally by sympathy for Ukraine and concern for their own self-preservation. The war has brought Russia closer to their borders at just the moment where Trump's potential election is shaking their faith in the U.S.' reliability as an ally.\n\n\"For many Europeans, they now sense an existential threat in a way that they didn't even during the Cold War,\" said Charles Kupchan, a former Obama-era senior National Security Council official. \"It's in part a function of how long the war's gone on, it's in part a function of the fact that Ukraine is now on its back foot and the Russians have been making gains, and I do think it's in part about responding to the domestic politics of this issue.\"\n\nStill, there are significant details still to be worked out. The G7 nations continue to haggle over how to structure the arrangement, including central elements like which countries would provide aid up front, where they would raise that money from and how long the funding would last. In Europe, finance ministers have fretted in particular about the prospect of loaning funds to Ukraine, only to see the war end before they get paid back in full.\n\nWhatever the final structure, Biden faces an intensifying crunch to get his fellow G7 leaders aligned. There's little appetite to let the issue linger unresolved for the next several weeks, much less overlap with a November election that could upend the entire Western alliance.\n\nEven if Biden wins, officials and foreign policy experts say, he is most likely to face a divided Congress that has grown increasingly stubborn about supporting a long-term fight.\n\nBut far more concerning to much of the West is that Trump returns to the Oval Office, bringing with him a radically different approach to Ukraine -- and to the security of the rest of the continent.\n\n\"If you're actually going to do something to Trump-proof Ukraine should U.S. aid stop flowing, it's too late to act in November or December,\" said Max Bergmann, a former senior State Department official during the Obama administration. \"You have to act now.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(meeting)",

The president upended his schedule on Tuesday to return to Wilmington, Delaware to be with his son, hugging him on the airport tarmac.\n\nHe left for Italy from Wilmington, heading to meet with the leaders of the world's biggest seven economies in what could be his last G7 conference.\n\nPolitics will dominate his trip.\n\nNervous world leaders are watching the upcoming American election carefully and wondering if it will be Biden or Trump who will join them at next year's meeting in Canada.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and his granddaughter Finnegan Biden begin the trip to Italy\n\nPresident Biden boards Air Force One\n\nBiden, when he came into office, vowed to return America to its place in the world after Trump's more isolationist policy.\n\n'There was a real sense of relief in the room that America was back and actually leading at the table,' said National Security Council spokesman John Kirby on Tuesday.\n\nBut Trump is leading in the key battleground states that will decide the election. And it's not just in the United States - across Europe a far-right movement is on the march.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, just a day after meeting with Biden, called for snap elections after his party after his rival Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN) crushed his party in the European elections.\n\nFar-right parties also made gains in Germany's elections. And, in the UK, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Conservative Party is trailing the center-left opposition by about 20 points.\n\nWhile in Italy for two-days of meetings, Biden will seek to hold together his Western alliance, which is central to the defense of Ukraine in its war against Russia.\n\nHe is coming off a grueling travel schedule that saw him in France last week where he traveled to Normandy twice - once for the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings and then to speak at Pointe du Hoc. He and first lady Jill Biden attended a state dinner on Saturday.\n\nOn Sunday they returned to Wilmington to see son Hunter. On Monday Biden was back at the White House for a Juneteenth concert. On Tuesday, he spoke to a gun-control group in remarks that were interrupted by protests over the Gaza War. He then rushed home to Wilmington to be with his son.\n\nPresident Joe Biden hugs his son Hunter Biden upon arrival in Wilmington, Del.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, with White House Deputy Chief of Staff, Annie Tomasini (left), and granddaughter Finnegan Biden (second left), is welcomed by Air Force Colonel Angela Ochoa (right) at Joint Base Andrews\n\nPresidents Biden and Zelensky met in France last week - and will meet again this week at G7\n\nAll of this will put America's oldest-ever president under scrutiny as he returns to the world state.\n\nAnd the president has indicated he feels the pressure.\n\nBiden has often spoken of how world leaders tell him he must win a second term in the White House.\n\n'There's not a major international meeting I attend that... a world leader doesn't pull me aside as I'm leaving and say, 'He can't win. You can't let him win,'' Biden told Time magazine recently.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also will be at the G7, where he will meet with Biden and other world leaders. Biden will also hold a joint press conference with Zelensky, bringing the war in Ukraine to the forefront of the world stage.\n\nWhile meeting in Italy, the G7 leaders will seek to reach an agreement on plans to provide Ukraine with as much as $50 billion in aid based on interest generated on $300 billion in frozen Russian assets.\n\nThe assets were frozen by the U.S. and Europe after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMore sanctions against Russia are expected to be announced\n\nThe G7 nations - the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the U.K. - have provided billions in aid to the Ukraine.\n\nBut if Trump wins the White House in November, that could change. Republicans in Congress held up funding for Ukraine for months. Biden apologized to Zelensky for that when he met with him in France last week.\n\nKirby said the White House was confident that 'regardless of who gets what seat in the EU parliament' that the U.S. would still be able to work closely with European allies to support Ukraine.\n\n'We're not at all concerned that we're not going to be able to advance shared interests and values across the European continent,' Kirby said.\n\nThe shadow of Donald Trump will hang over the G7 - above the former president faces down world leaders at the G7 meeting in Canada in 2018\n\nThe G7 leaders are gathering in a five-star resort in southern Italy. They will also discuss the Middle East, trade imbalances with China, threats posed by artificial intelligence and development challenges in Africa.\n\nBut, on the sunny seaside, the shadow of his son's conviction will hang over Biden.\n\nAides are reported to be worried about the toll on the president, who is close to his son and said to continuously worry about him.\n\nHunter Biden has grappled with addiction issues for years.\n\nThe trial revealed some of the family's darkest moments as they dealt with Hunter's drug use.\n\nJill Biden was there nearly every day, sitting in the front of the courtroom to watch the testimony play out.\n\nBiden has said he will not use his power as president to pardon his son and has been careful to distance himself from the Justice Department case.\n\nHe released a statement of support after Hunter's conviction. Hunter was convicted on three counts of lying on a government form about his drug use in his purchase of handgun in 2018.\n\n'As I said last week, I am the president, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. So many families who have had loved ones battle addiction understand the feeling of pride seeing someone you love come out the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery.'\n\nHunter Biden also faces a second trial in September, this time on tax charges.\n\nBiden's stay in Italy will be brief. He arrives around midnight local time on Wednesday and departs on Friday evening where he'll head straight to Los Angeles for a campaign fundraiser with George Clooney, Jimmy Kimmel and Julia Roberts.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Joe_Biden", "type":

(Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nPresident Joe Biden is set to sign a bilateral security agreement with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on Thursday, signifying continuing U.S. support for Ukraine's national security.\n\nWhite House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan announced the plans to finalize this bilateral agreement during a discussion with reporters aboard Air Force One on Wednesday.\n\nThe forthcoming U.S.-Ukraine bilateral agreement comes after President Biden and the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom -- collectively known as the Group of Seven or G7 -- announced during last year's G7 summit that they would each establish their own direct security terms with Ukraine.\n\nMr. Sullivan said President Biden and Mr. Zelenskyy would meet on the sidelines of this year's G7 summit to discuss the continued U.S. support for Ukraine. After that, \"the leaders will sign a bilateral security agreement making clear our support will last long into the future and pledging continued cooperation, particularly in the defense and security space.\"\n\nFifteen countries have already entered into direct bilateral security agreements with Ukraine, showing their support as Ukrainian forces contend with a Russian invasion of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.\n\n\"Any lasting peace in Ukraine has to be underwritten by Ukraine's own ability to defend itself and deter future aggression,\" Mr. Sullivan said. \"And by signing this, we'll also be sending Russia a signal of our resolve. If [Russian President Vladimir Putin] thinks that he can outlast the coalition supporting Ukraine, he's wrong. He just cannot wait us out, and this agreement will show our resolve and continued commitment.\"\n\nMr. Sullivan said the new agreement covers the kind of military support the U.S. government has already provided for Ukraine but would not commit U.S. troops to direct involvement in the conflict.\n\n\"They have asked for our weapons and assistance as they fight to defend their territory. They have not asked our forces to join the fight. So, this agreement does not include any commitment to using our own forces to defend Ukraine,\" he said.\n\nWhile the new bilateral agreement would signify a continued U.S. commitment to supply Ukrainian forces with military aid, Mr. Sullivan said the U.S. side stands to gain \"from Ukraine's insights and experience, its battlefield innovations, and its lessons learned from the front.\"\n\nThe White House national security advisor also said the new bilateral agreement would include some new Ukrainian commitments to account for the various weapons systems the U.S. government continues to provide.\n\nMr. Sullivan offered few additional details about the specific provisions and enforcement mechanisms for the forthcoming security agreement, which comes about in the final months of President Biden's term.\n\nU.S. support for the Zelenskyy government may continue if President Biden wins a second term after the U.S. general elections in November. On the other hand, former President Donald Trump -- the presumptive GOP nominee -- has wavered on whether to continue flowing military aid to Ukraine.\n\nLast year, former President Trump repeatedly suggested he would prefer to quickly negotiate a settlement to end the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, at points indicating he could reach a cease-fire within 24 hours if he regained the White House.\n\nHowever, former President Trump has more recently suggested that the United States could continue to supply aid to Ukraine in the form of a loan. In an April press conference, as Congress negotiated a $95 billion foreign aid package with about $60 billion in new Ukraine-related funding, the former president said he and House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) had discussed structuring future Ukraine-related aid as a loan \"instead of just a gift.\" The former president also argued during that same April press conference that European countries must also \"step up\" their own support for Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We must move from 'as long as it takes' to 'whatever it takes' if we are to end this illegal war.\n\n\"From Ukraine to the Middle East, we will be discussing significant global threats at the summit. Such threats are why it is so vital to strengthen the UK's national defence, through our commitment to spend 2.5% of GDP on defence by 2030.\"\n\nThe summit in Italy comes as Mr Sunak continues to face pressure at home over his decision to leave D-Day commemorations in France. The backlash has dominated his election campaign for the last week.\n\nForeign Secretary Lord David Cameron took Mr Sunak's place at a ceremony with leaders including US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron, who the Prime Minister will meet at the G7 summit.\n\nDuring the summit, Mr Sunak will also press other leaders to recognise migration challenges \"across the route\" and to take collective action.\n\nHe touted his flagship Rwanda scheme - which he says will go ahead with deportations starting in July if his party is re-elected - during a recent trip to Austria.\n\nFifteen EU countries, including Austria, signed a letter last month calling on the European Commission to tighten migration policy and to look at third country schemes.\n\nAt the Puglia summit, Mr Sunak will also attend sessions on the Middle East, economic security and China, and a credible G7 and UK offer to \"the global majority\".", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com",

This agreement aims to provide long-term defense and security cooperation between the U.S. and Ukraine.\n\nAccording to ABC News, the agreement is intended to show Russia that the U.S. supports Ukraine. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan stated that the U.S. will help Ukraine with its security needs both now and in the future.\n\nCNN reports that the agreement includes commitments for training Ukraine's armed forces, cooperation in weapons production, ongoing military assistance, and increased intelligence sharing. However, it is an \"executive agreement,\" meaning future U.S. administrations could revoke it.\n\nThe agreement does not include a specific monetary pledge. Instead, it outlines a plan for the Biden administration to work with Congress on long-term funding for Ukraine's defense. It also includes provisions for immediate consultations following any future Russian attacks.\n\nThe agreement does not include a mutual defense clause, which would commit the U.S. to defending Ukraine militarily. Zelenskyy has noted that while these agreements are helpful, they do not replace the need for NATO membership, which includes a mutual defense provision.\n\nConcerns remain about potential changes in U.S. policy if former President Donald Trump wins another term. Trump has not clearly stated his position on continued support for Ukraine and has suggested he would push for increased European defense contributions.\n\nNational Security Council spokesperson John Kirby confirmed the U.S. commitment to Ukraine at the G7 summit. The U.S. will also announce plans to use Russia's frozen assets for Ukraine's reconstruction.\n\nThis security pact is similar to agreements Ukraine has with other allies like the UK, France, and Germany. This marks a significant step in supporting Ukraine amid its conflict with Russia.\n\nCNN also noted that Biden recently agreed to let Ukraine use U.S.-provided weapons to strike targets in Russia, a major policy change aimed at strengthening Ukraine's defense.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "litty_simon@ibtimes.com", "name": "Litty Simon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Sullivan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jake Sullivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bari", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bari"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bari"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kirby_(admiral)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Kirby (admiral)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States National Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Advisories_and_Patches", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Advisories and Patches", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/FAQs,_Help,_and_Tutorials", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/FAQs, Help, and Tutorials", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4529565/biden-assured-zelensky-amcericas-support.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644722", "eventUri": "eng-9644722", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

We want to demonstrate that the US supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them, and that we'll continue to help address their security needs not just tomorrow but out into the future,\" the NSA said.\n\nThe agreement outlines a clear vision of work with Ukraine to continue strengthening Ukraine's credible defence and deterrence capability. Any lasting peace in Ukraine has to be underwritten by Ukraine's own ability to defend itself and deter future aggression, he said \"And by signing this, we'll also be sending Russia a signal of our resolve. If Vladimir Putin thinks that he can outlast the coalition supporting Ukraine, he's wrong. He just cannot wait us out, and this agreement will show our resolve and continued commitment,\" Sullivan said.\n\nA day earlier, White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby told reporters that this year's summit would show that G7 is more unified than ever to tackle global challenges, and to renew their commitment to partners around the world that they will help them invest in bright futures for their people.\n\n\"We will build on the progress we made last year on our shared approach to the Indo-Pacific as well, including by advancing an Indo-Pacific region that is free, open, secure, prosperous, resilient, and connected,\" he said.\n\n\"We will address the PRC's support for the Russian defence industrial base. And we will confront China's non-market policies that are leading to harmful global spillovers, working with partners in and beyond the G7 to promote economic resilience and security,\" Kirby said.\n\nBiden will again host a side event that will highlight its positive value proposition to countries around the world via the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, or PGI, he said.\n\n\"We will continue to offer a path to help countries overcome unsustainable debt burdens, to boost the World Bank's lending firepower, to mobilize additional capital for high-standard infrastructure investments, and to make new commitments on food and health security,\" he added.\n\nG7 leaders will be joined by His Holiness, Pope Francis, for a session on artificial intelligence, among other topics. \"This will be an important moment for our countries to come together and develop our shared approach to harnessing the benefits of AI while at the same time managing the risks to our national security and impacts that it may have to our workforces and inequality,\" Kirby said.\n\n\"The bottom line here is that President Biden believes we must continue to imagine, to invent and to inspire. We are committed to investing in that vision with our closest allies. We are very confident that if we do, the United States will continue to lead on the world stage for generations to come,\" said the White House official.

We must move from 'as long as it takes' to 'whatever it takes' if we are to end this illegal war.\n\n\"From Ukraine to the Middle East, we will be discussing significant global threats at the summit. Such threats are why it is so vital to strengthen the UK's national defence, through our commitment to spend 2.5 per cent of GDP on defence by 2030.\"\n\nMr Sunak will fly to Bari after his appearance in a TV election programme in Grimsby with Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader.\n\nIt is not the first time a prime minister has attempted to use an international summit for electoral advantage.\n\nMargaret Thatcher attended the G7 summit in Venice days before the June 1987 election, which she went on to win handsomely.\n\nBritain's extra money for Ukraine will help lay the foundations for longer-term economic and social recovery and reconstruction, Mr Sunak believes.\n\nCritical energy infrastructure has suffered from an intense Russian missile and bombing campaign over the past few months.\n\nMr Sunak wants to work with partners to agree a way to use immobilised Russian assets to support Ukraine.\n\nLast month, Jeremy Hunt, the Chancellor, attended the G7 finance ministers and central bank governors' meeting, where the G7 discussed potential avenues to bring forward the profits stemming from these assets, to the benefit of Ukraine.\n\nThe value of the assets held in G7 jurisdictions is $285 billion (\u00a3222 million).\n\nThe UK has committed almost \u00a312.7 billion in military, humanitarian and economic support to Ukraine and has often been the first mover on vital lethal aid, from Storm Shadow cruise missiles to a squadron of Challenger 2 tanks.\n\nMr Sunak recently announced that the UK will send its largest package of military equipment, designed to help back the Russian invasion on land, sea and air.\n\nWhile at the summit, Mr Sunak will attend sessions on Ukraine; illegal migration; economic security and China; the Middle East; and a credible G7 and UK offer to the third world.\n\nHe will work to encourage G7 unity in response to the situation on the ground in Gaza, focused on the goal of a stable and prosperous Middle East.\n\nMr Sunak will press other leaders to recognise migration challenges \"across the route\" and to take collective action.\n\nHe will also seek to strengthen the West's economic security in relation to China and work with partners to identify ways to ensure the UK leverages the revolution in green technologies for the benefit of the British people and industries.", "source": {"uri":

After that, \"the leaders will sign a bilateral security agreement making clear our support will last long into the future and pledging continued cooperation, particularly in the defense and security space.\"\n\nFifteen countries have already entered into direct bilateral security agreements with Ukraine, showing their support as Ukrainian forces contend with a Russian invasion of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.\n\n\"Any lasting peace in Ukraine has to be underwritten by Ukraine's own ability to defend itself and deter future aggression,\" Mr. Sullivan said. \"And by signing this, we'll also be sending Russia a signal of our resolve. If [Russian President Vladimir Putin] thinks that he can outlast the coalition supporting Ukraine, he's wrong. He just cannot wait us out, and this agreement will show our resolve and continued commitment.\"\n\nMr. Sullivan said the new agreement covers the kind of military support the U.S. government has already provided for Ukraine but would not commit U.S. troops to direct involvement in the conflict.\n\n\"They have asked for our weapons and assistance as they fight to defend their territory. They have not asked our forces to join the fight. So, this agreement does not include any commitment to using our own forces to defend Ukraine,\" he said.\n\nWhile the new bilateral agreement would signify a continued U.S. commitment to supply Ukrainian forces with military aid, Mr. Sullivan said the U.S. side stands to gain \"from Ukraine's insights and experience, its battlefield innovations, and its lessons learned from the front.\"\n\nThe White House national security advisor also said the new bilateral agreement would include some new Ukrainian commitments to account for the various weapons systems the U.S. government continues to provide.\n\nMr. Sullivan offered few additional details about the specific provisions and enforcement mechanisms for the forthcoming security agreement, which comes about in the final months of President Biden's term.\n\nU.S. support for the Zelenskyy government may continue if President Biden wins a second term after the U.S. general elections in November.

We are committed to investing in that vision with our closest allies. We are very confident that if we do, the United States will continue to lead on the world stage for generations to come,\" said the White House official.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType":

Amid the olive trees and swimming pools, the anti-incumbent sentiments coursing through Western democracies are creating extraordinarily high stakes for global geopolitics.\n\nRarely has the yearly gathering of the world's leading economies been so overshadowed by the political vulnerabilities of nearly all its members. It raises questions of how effective the \"steering committee of the free world,\" as US President Joe Biden's aides have labeled the G7, can actually be amid anger and discontent from their own populations.\n\nComing less than a week after far-right parties dominated in European Parliamentary elections and ahead of critical votes in France, the United Kingdom and the United States, the G7 summit will occur amid nagging anxiety about a populist resurgence.\n\nAt a state dinner held in Biden's honor at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in Paris last week, French lawmakers mingling underneath crystal chandeliers spoke openly about their fears of a potential Donald Trump victory, according to an attendee. That was a day before France's President Emmanuel Macron suffered steep losses to the far right, prompting him to dissolve the National Assembly and call snap elections.\n\nConcerns about migration and the burden of defending Ukraine are part of what is driving the rightward shift. Those have been central issues for the G7 since Biden joined the group in 2021 and promise to again be the driving topic for this year's summit.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will attend and convene a joint news conference with Biden on Thursday. Leaders are under pressure to find ways of turning around the battlefield momentum after Russia seized the initiative amid delays in American support, for which Biden apologized to Zelensky last week.\n\n\"We had trouble getting a bill that we had to pass that had the money in it from some of our very conservative members who were holding it up,\" he said. \"But we got it done, finally.\"\n\nAhead of the summit, diplomats were finalizing plans to loan Ukraine tens of billions of dollars to rebuild its devastated infrastructure, financed by interest from frozen Russian assets. The somewhat convoluted plan, which took years for the Western allies to come to consensus on, was still being hashed out as Biden was flying to Italy.\n\nAnd the president was planning to present a new bilateral security pact with Ukraine, a deal that lays out a path for the US' long-term security relationship with Kyiv but that could also be undone by future US administrations.\n\nIndeed, the specter of leadership change in the United States and beyond is the uneasy backdrop to this year's G7, lending a degree of urgency to their work.\n\n\"This is not a normal G7,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the GeoEconomics Center at the Atlantic Council, pointing to the series of upcoming elections and the wider group invited to this year's summit. \"You hear this a lot when you talk to US and European officials: if we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance. We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\"\n\nAmong the G7 leaders, it is the summit's host, right wing Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who appears on the most stable political ground. She emerged as the only European G7 leader bolstered by last week's European Parliament elections.\n\nOnce a skeptic who publicly voiced his concerns about Meloni's brand of right-wing populism, Biden has instead found in his Italian counterpart a somewhat unlikely ally on Ukraine. She has bucked far-right leaders elsewhere as a staunch supporter of continued aid to Kyiv.\n\nStill, she and Biden diverge on a number of other topics. Meloni has drawn comparisons to Trump and addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2022. Her party, Brothers of Italy, has post-fascist roots.\n\n\"I am proud that Italy will present itself to the G7, to Europe with the strongest government of all. This is something that has not happened in the past but is happening today, it is a satisfaction and also a great responsibility,\" Meloni said early on Monday following the EU elections, according to Reuters.\n\nThe leaders of France and Germany are contending with very different sets of political circumstances. After a surge from the far right, Macron is now risking parliamentary elections in a few weeks that could badly damage his ability to govern over the remaining three years of his term.\n\nIn Britain, Prime Minster Rishi Sunak has called for elections in July in which his party is expected to lose power for the first time in 14 years. Canada's Justin Trudeau -- now the longest-serving leader in the G7 -- is unpopular, with a general election required sometime next year. Japan's Fumio Kishida has been beset by a party corruption scandal that has caused his approval ratings to plummet.\n\nAnd Biden, who has spent his term heralding a revival of traditional alliances and a defense of the West, is running neck-and-neck with a rival who's been convicted of felonies and who Biden accuses of undermining democracy itself.\n\nWhether it is Trump at the G7 table next year or Biden is among the great unknowable questions hanging over the gathering. Few leaders who lived through it would welcome a return the animosity that marked the summits of that era, be it battles over climate on a cliffside in Sicily, haggling on trade in the forests of Quebec or an argument over readmitting Russia at a lighthouse in Biarritz.\n\nBy the end of his term, Trump had begun questioning the utility of attending the gatherings at all, fed up with what he saw as an unpleasant and unwelcoming experience.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_liptak@cnn.com", "name": "Kevin Liptak", "type":

Those negotiations are at the top of the agenda for the G7 leaders' summit in Puglia, Italy.\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Western governments froze about $300 billion in Russian assets -- including money, securities, gold and bonds -- held mainly in banks in Europe.\n\nLeaders of the G7 economies have agreed to use the interest generated by the assets -- about $3 billion per year -- to help Ukraine buy weapons for its fight against Russia and rebuild after the war.\n\nThe United States and European countries have different proposals for distributing the money.\n\nScheherazade Rehman, a professor of international finance at George Washington University, explained it in simple terms.\n\n\"The Europeans would like to transfer them to Ukraine yearly or every two years, so spread it out. The Americans, however, want to find a way to get this money very quickly to Ukraine all at once,\" Rehman said.\n\nThe European proposal would see about $3 billion a year go to Ukraine, and only interest from a certain part of the frozen Russian assets -- $190 billion held by a company called Euroclear in Belgium -- would be shared.\n\nThe U.S., on the other hand, wants to give $60 billion to Ukraine up front, because Ukraine's need on the battlefield is dire. Officials have said the interest generated from the frozen Russian assets would go toward paying back that money.\n\nRehman said Washington has the weaker hand in the debate because only about $5 billion of the $300 billion in Russian assets are held in the United States -- and European nations are concerned about how they would be paid back for a big initial lump sum.\n\nIt's hard to say what this agreement will look like in its final form -- but officials familiar with the planning have told reporters that President Biden is going to make a final push to secure a deal.\n\nThe agreement will likely be some sort of compromise between the European and U.S. proposals. But Rehman said recent elections in countries like France and Germany may also affect discussions.\n\n\"Europeans really have to get their act together at this G7 meeting because they're on shaky ground just because of the European parliamentary elections that just took place where the hard right has now got a historic toehold,\" she said.\n\n\"The Europeans are coming into this with very different footing than if this was 10 days ago.\"", "source": {"uri": "kgou.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KGOU 106.3"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(meeting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summit (meeting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Security (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apulia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apulia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Apulia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euroclear", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euroclear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Washington University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Unclaimed_Money", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Unclaimed Money", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Associations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/90ce699/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3637x1909+0+409/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnpr.brightspotcdn.com%2Fdims3%2Fdefault%2Fstrip%2Ffalse%2Fcrop%2F3637x2728%20455%200%2Fresize%2F3637x2728%21%2F%3Furl%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F42%2F21%2Fbf5c56f14c369d81030a597624c0%2Fgettyimages-2156623983.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644722", "eventUri": "eng-9644722", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

The Ukrainian think tank Institute of Legislative Ideas estimates the total value of these assets at $397 billion, while the World Bank estimates that rebuilding the war-torn country will cost more than $486 billion.\n\nThe United States initially advocated for direct confiscation of Russian assets but has now aligned with the European plan to use the interest generated by the frozen assets.\n\nA significant portion of the frozen assets is held in the EU, with around 185 billion euros frozen by Euroclear, an international deposit organization based in Belgium. This gives Europe a crucial role in deciding whether and how to use the blocked assets. Britain, Austria, Japan, Switzerland, and the United States hold the remaining assets.\n\nInternational law prohibits the West from confiscating the Russian central bank's money. To circumvent this, EU countries looking to help Ukraine agreed early last month to seize the interest generated by frozen Russian assets instead, which is estimated to be between 2.5 and 3.0 billion euros per year. G7 finance ministers also agreed in principle at the end of May to front-load the money by using expected future profits generated by the frozen assets, without specifying how it would work.\n\nWhat are the challenges?\n\nSeveral questions remain, such as how the risk would be shared between the US and Europe, how interest rates might change over time, and who would issue the debt. Initially, there was talk of a loan issued solely by the US, but this has expanded to the possibility of other G7 countries participating in risk-sharing.\n\nThe plan faces several challenges, including the need for unanimous approval from EU member states to renew sanctions against Russia every six months.\n\nThere are also concerns about what would happen if peace was declared and the assets were unfrozen, as well as the potential for third countries like China to reduce investments in the West for fear of asset seizure.\n\nAdditionally, Russia is threatening retaliation, with Putin signing a decree in May authorizing the confiscation of assets belonging to the US or \"associated\" individuals in Russia.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The G7 leaders, who will meet beginning today in Italy, seem to be on the brink of announcing a compromise.\n\nEuropean leaders feared that seizing the assets would violate international law. So the Biden administration devised a plan to use the interest generated by them to back a loan that could be delivered immediately to Ukraine.\n\nThe loan could be as large as $50 billion and would be repaid over time with the profits being generated from Russia's money, Western officials said.\n\nThe leaders are also expected to discuss the question of how to stop China from bolstering Russia by selling it \"dual use\" microelectronics and other gear to rebuild its military. The Biden administration announced yesterday that it would add sanctions aimed at stopping China from helping the Kremlin in its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn related news, Ukraine plans to auction about 20 state-owned companies to fund its war effort and help its economy.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-owned_enterprise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State-owned enterprise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Loans", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Loans", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Physical_Asset_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Physical Asset Management", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/12/multimedia/13ambriefing-europe-nl-g7/13ambriefing-asia-nl-g7-2-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644722", "eventUri": "eng-9644722", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

But even that amount, experts say, would only begin to make a dent in building a new Ukraine.\n\nThe financing announcement will be only a part of a summit this week that will range from how to reverse Russia's new momentum to how to bring about a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. There will be moments when the leaders will try to lift their eyes beyond the current crises, including a meeting between the leaders and Pope Francis, focused on harnessing the power of artificial intelligence.\n\nAnd for Mr. Biden himself, who leaves for Italy on Wednesday morning, the summit comes at a fraught moment.

Amid the olive trees and swimming pools, the anti-incumbent sentiments coursing through Western democracies are creating extraordinarily high stakes for global geopolitics.\n\nRarely has the yearly gathering of the world's leading economies been so overshadowed by the political vulnerabilities of nearly all its members. It raises questions of how effective the \"steering committee of the free world,\" as US President Joe Biden's aides have labeled the G7, can actually be amid anger and discontent from their own populations.\n\nComing less than a week after far-right parties dominated in European Parliamentary elections and ahead of critical votes in France, the United Kingdom and the United States, the G7 summit will occur amid nagging anxiety about a populist resurgence.\n\nAt a state dinner held in Biden's honor at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in Paris last week, French lawmakers mingling underneath crystal chandeliers spoke openly about their fears of a potential Donald Trump victory, according to an attendee. That was a day before France's President Emmanuel Macron suffered steep losses to the far right, prompting him to dissolve the National Assembly and call snap elections.\n\nConcerns about migration and the burden of defending Ukraine are part of what is driving the rightward shift. Those have been central issues for the G7 since Biden joined the group in 2021 and promise to again be the driving topic for this year's summit.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will attend and convene a joint news conference with Biden on Thursday. Leaders are under pressure to find ways of turning around the battlefield momentum after Russia seized the initiative amid delays in American support, for which Biden apologized to Zelensky last week.\n\n\"We had trouble getting a bill that we had to pass that had the money in it from some of our very conservative members who were holding it up,\" he said. \"But we got it done, finally.\"\n\nAhead of the summit, diplomats were finalizing plans to loan Ukraine tens of billions of dollars to rebuild its devastated infrastructure, financed by interest from frozen Russian assets. The somewhat convoluted plan, which took years for the Western allies to come to consensus on, was still being hashed out as Biden was flying to Italy.\n\nAnd the president was planning to present a new bilateral security pact with Ukraine, a deal that lays out a path for the US' long-term security relationship with Kyiv but that could also be undone by future US administrations.\n\nIndeed, the specter of leadership change in the United States and beyond is the uneasy backdrop to this year's G7, lending a degree of urgency to their work.\n\n\"This is not a normal G7,\" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the GeoEconomics Center at the Atlantic Council, pointing to the series of upcoming elections and the wider group invited to this year's summit. \"You hear this a lot when you talk to US and European officials: if we can't get this done now, whether it's on China, whether it's on the assets, we may not have another chance. We don't know what the world will look like three months, six months, nine months from now.\"\n\nAmong the G7 leaders, it is the summit's host, right wing Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who appears on the most stable political ground. She emerged as the only European G7 leader bolstered by last week's European Parliament elections.\n\nOnce a skeptic who publicly voiced his concerns about Meloni's brand of right-wing populism, Biden has instead found in his Italian counterpart a somewhat unlikely ally on Ukraine. She has bucked far-right leaders elsewhere as a staunch supporter of continued aid to Kyiv.\n\nStill, she and Biden diverge on a number of other topics. Meloni has drawn comparisons to Trump and addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2022. Her party, Brothers of Italy, has post-fascist roots.\n\n\"I am proud that Italy will present itself to the G7, to Europe with the strongest government of all. This is something that has not happened in the past but is happening today, it is a satisfaction and also a great responsibility,\" Meloni said early on Monday following the EU elections, according to Reuters.\n\nThe leaders of France and Germany are contending with very different sets of political circumstances. After a surge from the far right, Macron is now risking parliamentary elections in a few weeks that could badly damage his ability to govern over the remaining three years of his term.\n\nIn Britain, Prime Minster Rishi Sunak has called for elections in July in which his party is expected to lose power for the first time in 14 years. Canada's Justin Trudeau -- now the longest-serving leader in the G7 -- is unpopular, with a general election required sometime next year. Japan's Fumio Kishida has been beset by a party corruption scandal that has caused his approval ratings to plummet.\n\nAnd Biden, who has spent his term heralding a revival of traditional alliances and a defense of the West, is running neck-and-neck with a rival who's been convicted of felonies and who Biden accuses of undermining democracy itself.\n\nWhether it is Trump at the G7 table next year or Biden is among the great unknowable questions hanging over the gathering. Few leaders who lived through it would welcome a return the animosity that marked the summits of that era, be it battles over climate on a cliffside in Sicily, haggling on trade in the forests of Quebec or an argument over readmitting Russia at a lighthouse in Biarritz.\n\nBy the end of his term, Trump had begun questioning the utility of attending the gatherings at all, fed up with what he saw as an unpleasant and unwelcoming experience.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

All of Europe will be threatened. ... The autocrats of the world are watching closely to see what happens in Ukraine.\"\n\nYet Biden's undertaking will come up against growing concerns in Europe that he will merely be an interregnum between two Donald Trump administrations. The ex-president's term that ended in 2021 shattered decades-old certainties that the United States will be a stabilizing force in transatlantic affairs and will always secure Europe's security. And the \"autocrats of the world\" name checked by Biden will no doubt be watching on Thursday when Trump demonstrates his lock on the Republican Party by meeting GOP House members and senators on Capitol Hill. The show of authority will take place two weeks after Trump became the first former president to be convicted of a crime and less than five months before the presumptive Republican nominee will ask voters to return him to the White House.\n\nBiden's emotional, political and diplomatic investment in Ukraine cannot be questioned and will be the foundation of his presidential legacy. But uncertainty over the West's long-term commitment is perennially stubborn. It's fueled by shifting political currents on both sides of the Atlantic that must worry Zelensky.\n\nIn the United States, Trump - who disdains Ukraine, lionizes Putin and cares little for Europe's security given his endless attacks on NATO - may be less than five months from winning back the presidency. Big gains by far-right parties in European Parliament elections last weekend - especially in powerhouses France and Germany - could create future complications for European Union support for Ukraine. And Putin's willingness to throw thousands of Russian lives into the meat grinder of the front-line without suffering any political effects back home in a nation purged of political opponents means the possibility always remains that the West tire of the conflict before he does.\n\nBut a flurry of new initiatives from the US and its allies looks like an attempt to Trump-proof Ukraine's Western lifeline and to bring Kyiv closer to Western economic and defense structures should Biden and wobbling G7 leaders who formed the first wave of its support after the Russian invasion get swept away. But no US president can truly bind his successor to a course of action. And the tortuous delays in squeezing the latest $60 billion US aid package for Kyiv through Congress underscore that America's fractious politics means that future US largesse cannot be guaranteed even if Biden wins in November.\n\nA flurry of new Western plans to help Ukraine\n\nStill, the latest Western plans to help Ukraine send a strong message of intent.\n\n-- Biden's return to Europe Wednesday, only three days after he left, encapsulated his role as the most proactive leader of the Western alliance since President George H.W. Bush. Time on the presidential calendar is a reliable barometer of a White House's priorities and is closely watched by both US allies and adversaries.\n\n-- As he left for Italy, the administration unveiled new sanctions on more than 300 individuals and entities designed to paralyze the parallel economy, which includes plentiful Chinese channels, that the Kremlin has constructed to evade previous US punishments. The sanctions target foreign financial firms aiding Putin's war effort, restrict Russian access to some US software and information technology. \"Russia today has become a war economy,\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said, unveiling measures designed to raise the cost of that conflict. \"Every day, Russia continues to mortgage its future to sustain its unjust war of choice against Ukraine.\"\n\n-- Biden and Zelensky are expected to sign a bilateral security pact that commits the US to train Ukraine's armed forces for 10 years and to expand cooperation in the production of armaments and equipment. \"We want to demonstrate that the US supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them and that we'll continue to address their security needs not just tomorrow but out into the future,\" Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security adviser, told reporters on Air Force One. Still, the \"executive agreement\" would not be hard for Trump to break if he wins power.\n\n-- US officials are also optimistic that the G7 summit - which groups the US, France, Britain, Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada - will sign off on months of negotiations on a $50 billion economic support package to finance the repair of Ukrainian infrastructure to be financed by the interest on frozen Russian assets.\n\n-- These measures are expected to be bolstered by a new NATO package to be unveiled at the alliance summit in Washington later this summer that would institutionalize military support for Ukraine. The move would still however fall well short of Zelensky's elusive wish for a clear timetable for entry into the Western alliance.\n\nRussian advances on the battlefield\n\nThese are substantial and credible political, economic and political demonstrations of support for Ukraine. But they come at a vulnerable time for the country with its survival far from assured.\n\nThe latest battlefield assessment released by the Hudson Institute, for instance, cites \"a worrisome trend\" of incremental gains on multiple battlefronts, including in eastern and northeastern Ukraine.\n\nRelentless Russian attacks on civilian infrastructure have destroyed half of Kyiv's electricity production capacity, the report found, underscoring why already, in mid-June, there are mounting concerns about the plight of Ukrainian civilians in the coming winter with Russia expected to double down on past efforts to use the annual chill as a weapon.\n\nRussian success in rebuilding a military machine that was shockingly devastated on the road to Kyiv two years ago has led some senior European officials to warn of a mounting threat to Europe's territorial integrity. Wider tensions between the US and Russia are meanwhile being highlighted by the arrival of a convoy of Russian ships in Cuba that has Cold War overtones.\n\nRetired Gen. Wesley Clark, the former supreme allied commander of Europe, warned in a Hudson Institute briefing this month that it would be wrong to underestimate the potency of the Russian military following the mockery in the West that greeted the decimation of the Kremlin expeditionary force and its poor leadership and tactics earlier in the war.\n\n\"The Russian character, the Russian force is structured around grinding forward, grinding forward regardless of losses, grinding forward through bad command decisions,\" Clark said. \"Don't underestimate them. Technically, they're pretty smart. They've got China behind them; they've got Iran and sanctions-busting behind them.\"\n\nUkraine's heroic resistance to the Russian invasion in early 2022 was an inspirational moment. But the blue and yellow flags that once seemed to be flying everywhere in Western cities have become ragged and faded more than two years later.\n\nAn inspiring war turns into a bitter slog\n\nAn extraordinary moment of instability in developed-world politics has forced many foreign leaders to prioritize their own problems, even while seeking to sustain support for Kyiv. A new war following the Hamas terror attacks on Israel shifted attention away from the conflict in Ukraine - which simultaneously evokes the carnage of the trench warfare of World War I and a frightening new era of warfare with swarming drones delivering death to troops in their fox holes.\n\nAt times, an annoyed tone has crept into some of the exhausted Zelensky's interactions with the West.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader made no secret of his frustration at the time it took to deliver the latest US aid package - a delay for which Biden apologized when he met with Zelensky at the D-Day event. He has also expressed impatience that world leaders have not taken up his invitation to a summit in Switzerland after the G7 designed to unite the world behind his vision of how an eventual peace deal to end the war could shape up.\n\nBiden, who is taking repeated days off from the campaign trail to travel to Europe, will not attend. Vice President Kamala Harris will be there instead, alongside Sullivan.\n\nNot surprisingly, Zelensky has always chafed at the self-imposed limits of Western support for his war effort that are a symptom of Biden's core aim of avoiding a direct NATO confrontation with Russia. The US president's critics have long accused him of only offering Kyiv the means to avoid losing the war but declining to provide the wherewithal to win it. Biden has, however, recently allowed the use of limited categories of US weapons in limited circumstances in Ukrainian operations on Russian soil.\n\nJohn Kirby, the White House National Security Council spokesman, insists that Biden is determined to \"take bold steps to show Mr. Putin that time is not on its side and that he cannot outlast us, as we support Ukraine's fight for freedom.\"\n\nBut there's a rising tide of political tension, high stakes elections and ideological estrangement between globalists and isolationists in Western societies and a Russian leader who ruthlessly refuses to change course whatever the cost. So however long the war lasts, the West will never escape questions about its staying power.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The president upended his schedule on Tuesday to return to Wilmington, Delaware to be with his son, hugging him on the airport tarmac.\n\nOn Wednesday, the president woke up at his Wilmington lakefront home, flew with Finnegan to Joint Base Andrews and then boarded Air Force One, as he headed to meet with the leaders of the world's biggest seven economies in what could be his last G7 conference.\n\nPolitics will dominate his trip.\n\nNervous world leaders are watching the upcoming American election carefully and wondering if it will be Biden or Trump who will join them at next year's meeting in Canada.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and his granddaughter Finnegan Biden begin the trip to Italy\n\nPresident Biden boards Air Force One\n\nBiden, when he came into office, vowed to return America to its place in the world after Trump's more isolationist policy.\n\n'There was a real sense of relief in the room that America was back and actually leading at the table,' said National Security Council spokesman John Kirby on Tuesday.\n\nBut Trump is leading in the key battleground states that will decide the election. And it's not just in the United States - across Europe a far-right movement is on the march.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, just a day after meeting with Biden, called for snap elections after his party after his rival Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN) crushed his party in the European elections.\n\nFar-right parties also made gains in Germany's elections. And, in the UK, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Conservative Party is trailing the center-left opposition by about 20 points.\n\nWhile in Italy for two-days of meetings, Biden will seek to hold together his Western alliance, which is central to the defense of Ukraine in its war against Russia.\n\nHe is coming off a grueling travel schedule that saw him in France last week where he traveled to Normandy twice - once for the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings and then to speak at Pointe du Hoc. He and first lady Jill Biden attended a state dinner on Saturday.\n\nOn Sunday they returned to Wilmington to see son Hunter. On Monday Biden was back at the White House for a Juneteenth concert. On Tuesday, he spoke to a gun-control group in remarks that were interrupted by protests over the Gaza War. He then rushed home to Wilmington to be with his son.\n\nPresident Joe Biden hugs his son Hunter Biden upon arrival in Wilmington, Del.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, with White House Deputy Chief of Staff, Annie Tomasini (left), and granddaughter Finnegan Biden (second left), is welcomed by Air Force Colonel Angela Ochoa (right) at Joint Base Andrews\n\nPresidents Biden and Zelensky met in France last week - and will meet again this week at G7\n\nAll of this will put America's oldest-ever president under scrutiny as he returns to the world state.\n\nAnd the president has indicated he feels the pressure.\n\nBiden has often spoken of how world leaders tell him he must win a second term in the White House.\n\n'There's not a major international meeting I attend that... a world leader doesn't pull me aside as I'm leaving and say, 'He can't win. You can't let him win,\" Biden told Time magazine recently.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also will be at the G7, where he will meet with Biden and other world leaders. Biden will also hold a joint press conference with Zelensky, bringing the war in Ukraine to the forefront of the world stage.\n\nWhile meeting in Italy, the G7 leaders will seek to reach an agreement on plans to provide Ukraine with as much as $50 billion in aid based on interest generated on $300 billion in frozen Russian assets.\n\nThe assets were frozen by the U.S. and Europe after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMore sanctions against Russia are expected to be announced\n\nThe G7 nations - the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the U.K. - have provided billions in aid to the Ukraine.\n\nBut if Trump wins the White House in November, that could change. Republicans in Congress held up funding for Ukraine for months. Biden apologized to Zelensky for that when he met with him in France last week.\n\nKirby said the White House was confident that 'regardless of who gets what seat in the EU parliament' that the U.S. would still be able to work closely with European allies to support Ukraine.\n\n'We're not at all concerned that we're not going to be able to advance shared interests and values across the European continent,' Kirby said.\n\nThe shadow of Donald Trump will hang over the G7 - above the former president faces down world leaders at the G7 meeting in Canada in 2018\n\nThe G7 leaders are gathering in a five-star resort in southern Italy. They will also discuss the Middle East, trade imbalances with China, threats posed by artificial intelligence and development challenges in Africa.\n\nBut, on the sunny seaside, the shadow of his son's conviction will hang over Biden.\n\nAides are reported to be worried about the toll on the president, who is close to his son and said to continuously worry about him.\n\nHunter Biden has grappled with addiction issues for years.\n\nThe trial revealed some of the family's darkest moments as they dealt with Hunter's drug use.\n\nJill Biden was there nearly every day, sitting in the front of the courtroom to watch the testimony play out.\n\nBiden has said he will not use his power as president to pardon his son and has been careful to distance himself from the Justice Department case.\n\nHe released a statement of support after Hunter's conviction. Hunter was convicted on three counts of lying on a government form about his drug use in his purchase of handgun in 2018.\n\n'As I said last week, I am the president, but I am also a Dad. Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. So many families who have had loved ones battle addiction understand the feeling of pride seeing someone you love come out the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery.'\n\nHunter Biden also faces a second trial in September, this time on tax charges.\n\nBiden's stay in Italy will be brief. He arrives around midnight local time on Wednesday and departs on Friday evening where he'll head straight to Los Angeles for a campaign fundraiser with George Clooney, Jimmy Kimmel and Julia Roberts.", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Joe_Biden", "type":

However, Russia claims that any diversion of profits from its frozen assets is considered theft, Reuters reports.\n\nOn 4 June, a senior US Treasury official said that the US and its G7 partners are making progress on finding ways to provide Ukraine with urgently needed funds by using Russian frozen assets.\n\nThe West hesitates to confiscate frozen Russian assets due to concerns over sovereign immunity and potential economic repercussions, such as the loss of other foreign investments, including $3 trillion in Chinese reserves. Although the UN General Assembly has a resolution allowing for reparations from Russian reserves, its implementation remains stalled.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe $ 300 billion question: Why the West does not confiscate Russian frozen assets despite Ukraine war\n\nReuters: US eyes profits from frozen Russian assets to provide Ukraine urgent aid\n\nFinancial Times: Orb\u00e1n holds up Ukraine arms funding from frozen Russian assets\n\nGermany ready to use revenues from frozen Russian assets for Ukraine aid, ministry sources told Reuters", "source": {"uri": "euromaidanpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euromaidan Press"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vira_kravchuk@euromaidanpress.com", "name": "Vira Kravchuk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Russia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Bank of Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereign immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_direct_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign direct investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Physical_Asset_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Physical Asset Management", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/World_War_II_Dormant_Accounts", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/World War II Dormant Accounts", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Frozen", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Frozen", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://euromaidanpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Make-Russia-pay-confiscation-assets.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644722", "eventUri": "eng-9644722", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 1168, "textEnd": 1174}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

That's because while Biden will be huddling with the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom, former President Donald Trump is slated to be in Washington on Thursday. The presumed Republican presidential nominee is scheduled to speak to Business Roundtable CEOs, as well as House and Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill. The planned meetings will be Trump's first with congressional Republicans since he became a felon, convicted on May 30 by a 12-person jury in Manhattan.\n\nA senior White House official on Tuesday signaled Biden's biggest focus during the annual G7 summit would be on the world's hot spots, as well as trying to rally support to counter's China's economic practices -- one of the few issues that mostly unites Republican and Democratic lawmakers at home, even if they often disagree on how to blunt Beijing's trade tactics.\n\nU.S. officials hope G7 leaders might reach some kind of consensus on using frozen Russian assets to directly help Ukrainian citizens, though Kirby made clear a joint decision is not guaranteed.\n\nDuring a virtual briefing with reporters on Tuesday, John Kirby, White House national security communications adviser, sent mixed signals about the expectations for a joint announcement on those assets.\n\nDuring his prepared opening remarks, he said: \"First, we will announce new steps to unlock the value of the immobilized Russian sovereign assets to benefit Ukraine and to help them recover from the destruction that Mr. Putin's army has caused.\" But when pressed for more information by a reporter, Kirby was more measured about the prospects for a deal in Italy.\n\n\"I won't get ahead of the discussions on the frozen assets. As I said, that will be a topic of discussion. The president will continue to reiterate our desire to move in lockstep with our allies and partners on using those frozen assets appropriately to help with reconstruction in Ukraine,\" he said. \"As I said in my opening statement, there'll be some announcements on that. But I don't want to get too far ahead of all that. And I certainly won't speak for other of our G7 partners.\"\n\nThe G7 agenda indicates that the seven world leaders will bounce from topic to topic to topic. For instance, the schedule begins Thursday with a session on \"Africa, climate change and development\" and is followed by a working lunch focused on the Middle East, before nearly two hours discussing Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nAlthough White House officials notably have not touted any expected \"deliverables\" -- meaning tangible new joint agreements, in diplomatic-speak -- they have said some new initiatives should be rolled out in Italy.", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Critical energy infrastructure, for example, has suffered from an intense Russian missile and bombing campaign over the past few months.\n\nA priority for the PM at the Summit will be to work with partners to agree a way to use immobilised Russian assets to support Ukraine. Last month, the Chancellor attended the G7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting, where the G7 discussed potential avenues to bring forward the extraordinary profits stemming from these assets, to the benefit of Ukraine.\n\nThe UK and G7 leaders have been clear that Russian must pay for the damage it is causing Ukraine. We will explore all lawful avenues by which immobilised Russian assets can be used to support Ukraine. The value of the assets held in G7 jurisdictions is $285 billion.\n\nThe UK was the first country to introduce legislation explicitly enabling us to keep sanctions in place until Russia pays for damage it has caused. We also introduced new powers to compel sanctioned individuals and entities to disclose assets they hold in the UK.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said:\n\nWe must be decisive and creative in our efforts to support Ukraine and end Putin's illegal war at this critical moment. The UK remains at the forefront of the international response as we have been from the outset. We must move from 'as long as it takes' to 'whatever it takes' if we are to end this illegal war.\n\nFrom Ukraine to the Middle East, we will be discussing significant global threats at the Summit. Such threats are why it is so vital to strengthen the UK's national defence, through our commitment to spend 2.5% of GDP on defence by 2030.\n\nThe UK has now committed almost \u00a312.7 billion in military, humanitarian and economic support to Ukraine and has often been the first mover on vital lethal aid, from Storm Shadow cruise missiles to a squadron of Challenger 2 tanks.\n\nThe Prime Minister recently announced that the UK will send our largest-ever package of military equipment from the UK, designed to help push back the Russian invasion on land, sea and air.\n\nWhile at the summit, he will attend sessions on Ukraine; Illegal Migration; Economic Security and China; The Middle East; and a credible G7 and UK offer to 'the global majority'.\n\nThe Prime Minister will work to encourage G7 unity in response to the situation on the ground in Gaza, focused on the long-term goal of a stable and prosperous Middle East.\n\nHe will press other leaders to recognise migration challenges 'across the route' and to take collective action.\n\nHe will also seek to strengthen our economic security in relation to China and work collaboratively with partners to identify ways to ensure we leverage the revolution in green technologies for the benefit of the British people and our industries.", "source": {"uri": "gov.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "gov.uk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Germany", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Shadow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Storm Shadow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenger_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Challenger 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(meeting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summit (meeting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cruise missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Conferences", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://www.gov.uk/assets/static/govuk-opengraph-image-03837e1cec82f217cf32514635a13c879b8c400ae3b1c207c5744411658c7635.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644722", "eventUri": "eng-9644722", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Additionally, Biden's ongoing support for Ukraine and the US initiative for global infrastructure investment forms the crux of America's strategy to reaffirm its leadership on the world stage.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(meeting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Summit (meeting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Sullivan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Sullivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Globalization", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Globalization", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Global_Governance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Global Governance", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/06_06_2024_09_51_46_0176571.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644722", "eventUri": "eng-9644722", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

UK provides package of up to \u00a3242m funding for immediate humanitarian, energy and stabilisation needs in Ukraine. Leaders seek to leverage billions from immobilised Russian assets to support Ukraine.\n\nThe Prime Minister will be clear that the UK will lead from the front on supporting international peace and security as he attends the G7 Leaders Summit in Italy against a backdrop of heightened volatility.\n\nAt the Summit, the Prime Minister will announce up to \u00a3242 million in bilateral assistance to Ukraine, to support immediate humanitarian, energy and stabilisation needs, and lay the foundations for longer term economic and social recovery and reconstruction.\n\nThis funding demonstrates the UK's continued international solidarity with Ukraine, and our flexibility in responding to immediate needs created by Russian aggression. Critical energy infrastructure, for example, has suffered from an intense Russian missile and bombing campaign over the past few months.\n\nA priority for the PM at the Summit will be to work with partners to agree a way to use immobilised Russian assets to support Ukraine. Last month, the Chancellor attended the G7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting, where the G7 discussed potential avenues to bring forward the extraordinary profits stemming from these assets, to the benefit of Ukraine.\n\nThe UK and G7 leaders have been clear that Russian must pay for the damage it is causing Ukraine. We will explore all lawful avenues by which immobilised Russian assets can be used to support Ukraine. The value of the assets held in G7 jurisdictions is $285 billion.\n\nThe UK was the first country to introduce legislation explicitly enabling us to keep sanctions in place until Russia pays for damage it has caused. We also introduced new powers to compel sanctioned individuals and entities to disclose assets they hold in the UK.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak said:\n\nWe must be decisive and creative in our efforts to support Ukraine and end Putin's illegal war at this critical moment. The UK remains at the forefront of the international response as we have been from the outset. We must move from 'as long as it takes' to 'whatever it takes' if we are to end this illegal war.\n\nFrom Ukraine to the Middle East, we will be discussing significant global threats at the Summit. Such threats are why it is so vital to strengthen the UK's national defence, through our commitment to spend 2.5% of GDP on defence by 2030.\n\nThe UK has now committed almost \u00a312.7 billion in military, humanitarian and economic support to Ukraine and has often been the first mover on vital lethal aid, from Storm Shadow cruise missiles to a squadron of Challenger 2 tanks.\n\nThe Prime Minister recently announced that the UK will send our largest-ever package of military equipment from the UK, designed to help push back the Russian invasion on land, sea and air.\n\nWhile at the summit, he will attend sessions on Ukraine; Illegal Migration; Economic Security and China; The Middle East; and a credible G7 and UK offer to 'the global majority'.\n\nThe Prime Minister will work to encourage G7 unity in response to the situation on the ground in Gaza, focused on the long-term goal of a stable and prosperous Middle East.\n\nHe will press other leaders to recognise migration challenges 'across the route' and to take collective action.\n\nHe will also seek to strengthen our economic security in relation to China and work collaboratively with partners to identify ways to ensure we leverage the revolution in green technologies for the benefit of the British people and our industries.\n\n/Public Release.

which he says will go ahead with deportations starting in July if his party is re-elected - during a recent trip to Austria.\n\nFifteen EU countries, including Austria, signed a letter last month calling on the European Commission to tighten migration policy and to look at third country schemes.\n\nAt the Puglia summit, Mr Sunak will also attend sessions on the Middle East, economic security and China, and a credible G7 and UK offer to \"the global majority\".", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(meeting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summit (meeting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Normandy landings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cameron", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Cameron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwanda", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rwanda"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Rwanda"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Conferences", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/12/22/wire-86047149-1718227893-132_636x382.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644722", "eventUri": "eng-9644722", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 402, "textEnd": 408}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

Host Italy has invited several African leaders -- Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Kenyan President William Ruto and Tunisian President Kais Saied -- to press Italy's Africa initiatives. Other guests include Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fresh off his own election, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nWith Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and now French President Emmanuel Macron facing elections in the coming months, pressure was on the G7 to get done what it can while the status quo lasts.\n\nThe U.S. proposal involves using profits from the roughly $260 billion in frozen Russian central bank assets, most of them held in the European Union, to help Ukraine, and issuing a $50 billion loan from the U.S. government to Kyiv, using windfall profits from the immobilized funds as collateral.\n\nA French official, briefing reporters Wednesday, said a political decision by the leaders had been reached but that technical and legal details of the mechanism to tap into the assets still had to be worked out. The issue is complicated because if the Russian assets one day are unfrozen -- say if the war ends -- then the windfall profits will no longer be able to be used to pay off the loan, requiring a burden-sharing arrangement with other countries.\n\nOn the eve of the summit, Washington also sent strong signals of support for Ukraine, with widened sanctions against Russia to target Chinese companies that are helping its war machine.\n\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni goes into the meeting fortified at home and abroad after her far-right party had an even stronger showing in weekend European Parliament elections than the 2022 elections that made her Italy's first female premier. Known for its revolving-door governments, Italy is now in the unusual position of being the most stable power in the EU.\n\nThe leaders of the G7's two other EU members, Germany and France, didn't fare nearly as well, rattled after hard-right parties made strong showings in the vote. Macron called a snap election and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz saw the far-right Alternative for Germany beat out his Social Democrats.\n\nAs a result, Meloni is likely to be able to steer the three-day meeting to her key priority items as she further cements her role on the world stage, analysts said. One reported sign of her flexed far-right muscles: Meloni's office denied media reports that Italy was trying to water down language about access to abortion in the final communique.\n\n\"While it's unlikely the recent results will radically shift the focus of the upcoming G7 Summit, this electoral win offers Premier Meloni additional leverage to frame this as an essentially 'Mediterranean Summit,\" said Nick O'Connell, deputy director of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThat includes pushing her migration agenda as Meloni seeks to leverage her program for a non-exploitative relationship with Africa to boost development while curbing illegal migration to Europe.\n\nItaly, which for decades has been ground zero in Europe's migration debate, has been promoting its Mattei Plan as a way to create jobs and opportunity in Africa and discourage its young people from making dangerous trips across the Mediterranean Sea. The plan involves pilot projects in areas such as education, health care, water, sanitation, agriculture and energy infrastructure.\n\nPope Francis has called for an international treaty to ensure AI is developed and used ethically, acknowledging the promise it offers but emphasizing the grave and existential threats it poses.\n\nHe'll bring that campaign to the world's industrialized countries as wars are raging across multiple fronts. One of his greatest concerns has been on the use of AI in the armaments sector, which has been a frequent focus of the Jesuit pope who has called even traditional weapons makers \"merchants of death.\"\n\nBut Francis is also concerned about what AI means for the poorest and weakest: technology that could determine the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the right of a migrant to receive political asylum or the chance of reoffending by someone previously convicted of a crime.\n\nThe 87-year-old pope has said he would also repeat his calls for peace while holding a half-dozen bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the summit.\n\nThe G7 summit is taking place in a sprawling luxury resort that's something of a theater set, a faux town made to resemble one of Puglia's medieval white-washed hamlets but that actually only dates from 2010.\n\nLocated next to an actual archaeological park, Borgo Egnazia features narrow streets, villas, restaurants and a town square complete with a clocktower. A favorite of celebrities, it will be sealed off to outsiders for the duration of the summit.\n\nNo such five-star accommodations await the 2,000-plus police and carabinieri forces who have been brought in to provide security. Authorities on Wednesday sequestered the decommissioned cruise ship that had been housing them in Brindisi's port, after the police union complained about unacceptable hygienic conditions on board.\n\nAs with any G7, an assortment of anti-global, anti-war and climate activists are staging protests around the summit venue, but far from where the leaders are meeting. One group is staging a \"dinner for the poor\" on Friday night calling for \"peace, the rights of peoples and against the Big 7 who claim to decide the destiny of the world and our planet.\"",

Climate change and China will also feature prominently.\n\nThe G7, consisting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, is an informal forum for discussing economic and security issues. A key outcome of the summit is the agreement to lend Ukraine USD 50 billion, using frozen Russian assets as collateral. This deal, finalized before the summit, also involves U.S. President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing a bilateral security agreement. Additionally, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced USD 310 million in nonmilitary aid to Ukraine, aimed at humanitarian, energy, and stabilization needs. This comes just days before the UK election, amid concerns of Sunak losing to the opposition Labour Party.\n\nThe summit venue, Borgo Egnazia, known for hosting celebrities like Madonna and the Beckhams, adds a touch of medieval charm to this high-stakes meeting.

Trump particularly alarmed allies in February when he said he would encourage Russia to do \"whatever the hell they want\" to countries that he views as not spending enough on defense.\n\nBiden will also find a changed political landscape in Europe, even from just days ago when he was in France to commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-Day.\n\nFar-right parties in France and Germany made large gains in the weekend's European Parliament elections, leading French President Emmanuel Macron to dissolve the French Parliament and call snap elections just weeks before the start of the Paris Olympics. Polls suggest Marine Le Pen's far-right nationalists will make massive gains, potentially hobbling Macron's agenda until the end of his presidential term in 2027.\n\nKirby downplayed any U.S. concerns about the European election results and said Washington believes Ursula von der Leyen will be reelected the president of the European Commission, a role that functions as the bloc's chief executive.\n\n\"We're not at all concerned that we're not going to be able to advance shared interests and values across the European continent,\" Kirby said.\n\nThe changed landscape will be evident in the person of the summit's host, Giorgia Meloni, Italy's hard-right prime minister, who will welcome her foreign counterparts to a five-star resort in southern Italy on the heels of a result in the European elections that is likely to bolster her profile.\n\nThe summit also comes just days after his son, Hunter, was found guilty on three counts of lying on gun-purchasing paperwork and unlawfully possessing a gun. Hunter Biden's legal and personal troubles - he is a recovering drug addict - have deeply affected the president, and aides increasingly worry about the toll it is taking on the elder Biden.\n\nAfter the verdict, the president scrambled his schedule Tuesday to travel to Wilmington, Del., where the trial took place, to be with his family on the night before he departed for Italy. Some of those family members, including at least one of Hunter Biden's children, traveled with Biden to Italy aboard Air Force One.\n\nBut it is the specter of a Trump return that will hang over the summit this week as European leaders contemplate a future in which they may be unable to rely as much on American support and must stand more on their own.\n\n\"The shadow of Trump is indeed hanging over the G-7, but it has galvanized them,\" said Armida van Rij, senior research fellow at the London-based think tank Chatham House.\n\nSome of the summit's agenda items will highlight the sharp differences between Biden and Trump on global issues.\n\nAt the top of the agenda, the leaders will be looking to tap the profits from frozen Russian assets for a $50 billion loan to Ukraine.\n\nThe United States hopes the G-7 can seal an agreement to do that this week. \"Our commitment to Ukraine will continue to be right upfront and clear,\" Kirby said.\n\nBiden is scheduled to meet Thursday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is among the many foreign leaders invited to the summit, and the two will sign a bilateral security agreement. They will then hold a joint press conference.\n\n\"We want to demonstrate that the U.S. supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them and that we'll continue to help address their security needs,\" Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security adviser, told reporters aboard Air Force One.\n\nReaching a deal on the frozen assets could be technically complex, but it would mark a victory for Biden and other leaders seeking to send a signal of unified support for Ukraine.\n\n\"The countries all agree on making a financial effort on behalf of Ukraine,\" said a senior Italian official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions. \"They're all ready, but it's about the [details].\"\n\nSullivan declined to comment on the specific negotiations, but he said the countries were making progress.\n\nVon der Leyen, speaking Tuesday in Berlin, said 1.5 billion euros' worth of \"windfall profits\" from Russian assets would be available in July, with 90 percent of those funds going to defense and 10 percent toward reconstruction.\n\n\"Now we make Russia pay,\" she said.\n\nThe leaders are also likely to discuss the U.S.-sponsored cease-fire plan in the Middle East. Pope Francis - who admits to being a \"disaster\" with computers - will flag the risks of artificial intelligence. Meloni will try to bring Africa to the forefront, pushing her signature foreign policy plan for investment and cooperation on the continent with an end goal of encouraging waves of migrants to stay put.\n\nOver the next few days, Meloni will embody her role as the only hard-right figure to be largely welcomed by both the Biden administration and bureaucrats at E.U. headquarters in Brussels - unlike, for instance, the illiberal prime minister of Hungary, Viktor Orban.\n\nThe leaders will hold six sessions beside the Adriatic Sea in Italy's Puglia region, with leaders gathering at the sand-colored Borgo Egnazia resort, nestled amid olive groves and modeled after an Italian town. Remote and posh, the location will be cordoned off by a heavy security presence, with journalists kept at bay in a distant media center an hour's drive away.\n\nOn one issue, however, Biden and Trump have been more closely aligned, both imposing tariffs on China for unfair competition.\n\nSince the United States slapped steep new tariffs on Chinese electric cars, advanced batteries, solar cells, steel, aluminum and medical equipment, Europe had been weighing how and whether to follow suit. Europeans remain concerned that more Chinese goods may now shift from the United States to Europe, where, for instance, the once-thriving solar panel industry in countries such as Germany has already sustained major blows from cheap Chinese imports.\n\nAhead of the summit, the European Commission announced Wednesday a new set of tariffs of up to 38 percent on Chinese-made electric vehicles, far below the United States' 100 percent tariffs, though the decision comes amid German warnings of a ballooning trade war with China.\n\n\"We are not closing our markets to foreign companies, because we don't want that for our companies either,\" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a speech last week. Protectionism and customs barriers, he added, \"ultimately only make everything more expensive and all of us poorer.\"\n\nAs a sign of his competing priorities, Biden's stay in Italy is expected to be brief. After arriving close to midnight on Wednesday, he will depart Friday and head straight to Los Angeles to appear at a political fundraiser with former president Barack Obama, actors George Clooney and Julia Roberts, and late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_viser@washingtonpost.com",

"G7 leaders seek deal to use interest from Russian assets for Ukraine", "body": "By Andrea Shalal and Andrew Gray\n\nBARI, Italy (Reuters) -Group of Seven leaders will aim to boost funding for Ukraine in its war with Russia and offer a united face in confronting China's political and economic ambitions at their annual summit in southern Italy on Thursday.\n\nFor a second year running, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will attend the summit, taking part in talks on Thursday, and he is due to sign a new, long-term security accord with U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nThe G7 leaders look likely to announce they have agreed at least in principle on plans to issue $50 billion of loans for Ukraine using interest from Russian sovereign assets frozen after its invasion of Ukraine to back the multi-year debt package.\n\n\"I think we will have the major tentpoles of this decided, but some of the specifics left to be worked through by experts on a defined timetable,\" White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said of the discussions.\n\n\"I think we are on the verge of a good outcome here,\" he added.\n\nOfficials acknowledge the plan is complex, with legal experts still having to thrash out the details that will need the backing of European nations, particularly Belgium, which is not in the G7.\n\nPACKED AGENDA\n\nWith the Middle East, migration and artificial intelligence also on a packed agenda, the June 13-15 summit in the southern Italian region of Puglia would be taxing for leaders at the best of times, but most of them are also bowed down by their own domestic woes.\n\nOnly the host, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, is riding high after triumphing in Italy's European election last weekend, but achieving meaningful results in the luxury Borgo Egnazia hotel resort will be a tall order.\n\nBiden's goal at the G7 was to reinforce the idea that the United States is best served if it is closely aligned with its democratic allies and partners, Sullivan said, when asked about the prospects of it being the president's last summit given he faces a re-election battle in November.\n\nUnderscoring U.S. determination to punish Moscow for its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Washington on Wednesday dramatically broadened sanctions on Moscow, including by targeting China-based companies selling semiconductors to Moscow.\n\nBy announcing new restrictions on Chinese firms on the eve of the G7 meeting, Biden is no doubt hoping to persuade Western allies to show greater resolve in confronting Beijing over its support for Russia and its industrial over-capacity.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the start of the summit, Sullivan said that China was a significant creditor to many heavily indebted countries.\n\n\"The G7 communique is not singling out or focusing on a single country,\" he said, but added that China needed to play a constructive role in dealing with the debt burden.\n\n(Reporting by Crispian Balmer, Angelo Amante, Andrew Gray,

interest from Russian assets for Ukraine", "body": "For a second year running, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will attend the summit, taking part in talks on Thursday, and he is due to sign a new, long-term security accord with U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nThe G7 leaders look likely to announce they have agreed at least in principle on plans to issue $50 billion of loans for Ukraine using interest from Russian sovereign assets frozen after its invasion of Ukraine to back the multi-year debt package.\n\n\"I think we will have the major tentpoles of this decided, but some of the specifics left to be worked through by experts on a defined timetable,\" White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said of the discussions.\n\n\"I think we are on the verge of a good outcome here,\" he added.\n\nOfficials acknowledge the plan is complex, with legal experts still having to thrash out the details that will need the backing of European nations, particularly Belgium, which is not in the G7.\n\nWith the Middle East, migration and artificial intelligence also on a packed agenda, the June 13-15 summit in the southern Italian region of Puglia would be taxing for leaders at the best of times, but most of them are also bowed down by their own domestic woes.\n\nOnly the host, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, is riding high after triumphing in Italy's European election last weekend, but achieving meaningful results in the luxury Borgo Egnazia hotel resort will be a tall order.\n\nBiden's goal at the G7 was to reinforce the idea that the United States is best served if it is closely aligned with its democratic allies and partners, Sullivan said, when asked about the prospects of it being the president's last summit given he faces a re-election battle in November.\n\nUnderscoring U.S. determination to punish Moscow for its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Washington on Wednesday dramatically broadened sanctions on Moscow, including by targeting China-based companies selling semiconductors to Moscow.\n\nBy announcing new restrictions on Chinese firms on the eve of the G7 meeting, Biden is no doubt hoping to persuade Western allies to show greater resolve in confronting Beijing over its support for Russia and its industrial over-capacity.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the start of the summit, Sullivan said that China was a significant creditor to many heavily indebted countries.\n\n\"The G7 communique is not singling out or focusing on a single country,\" he said, but added that China needed to play a constructive role in dealing with the debt burden.\n\n(Reporting by Crispian Balmer, Angelo Amante, Andrew Gray, Andrea Shalal and John Irish Writing by Crispian Balmer and Keith Weir Editing by Christina Fincher)", "source": {"uri":

Source: Cargreen\n\nThe Group of Seven (G7) countries have agreed to set up a fund to support Ukraine, which will receive proceeds from frozen Russian assets. There will be no need to return the funds.\n\nAccording to Nikkei, the fund will be created under the auspices of an international organization, such as the World Bank. The United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, Canada, France, and Italy will make contributions in the form of loans.\n\nAt the same time, Ukraine will not return the money received, as it will be provided in the form of donations. The fund's loans will be repaid with funds received from the profits from the investment of frozen assets. The decision of the Group of Seven is to be officially announced in a joint statement by the leaders of the G7 member states following the summit, which will begin in Italy on June 13.\n\nFirst Deputy Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Tax Committee Yaroslav Zhelezniak (Holos) called it good news for Ukraine. He especially emphasized that the allocation of funds through the World Bank provides for compliance with the conditions in the form of reforms.\n\n\"This is exactly what we need. We are talking about the U.S. plan to give us $50 billion at once, not as the EU wanted $3 billion a year, and that is not a fact. Well, this is good news.

And we have every confidence that regardless of who gets what seat in the EU Parliament that we're going to be able to continue to work with all of our allies and partners,\" White House spokesperson John Kirby said.\n\nBiden focused his speeches in France last week on the importance of alliances and promoting and strengthening democracy. In the days since, Europe has seen a surge in far-right leaders making gains in elections at the same time Biden's opponent in November, Trump, continues to push an \"America First\" vision.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron called snap national elections after his pro-European centrist party demonstrated a weaker return in European parliamentary elections compared to far-right parties on Sunday. Macron announced the move shortly after hosting Biden for a high-profile state visit after Normany in Paris.\n\nGermany's conservative opposition party also garnered more votes for the European parliament compared to the center left party of Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\n\nKirby added in response to the results that \"the president will work with the democratically elected leaders of France, no matter who they are.\"\n\nFraught conflict in the Middle East\n\nThe summit, which spans from Thursday to Saturday, comes at a fraught moment when it comes to the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nIsraeli forces on Sunday freed four hostages being held by Hamas, but the raid killed more than 200 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council on Monday approved a resolution sponsored by the United States calling for an immediate, temporary cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. Biden announced the proposal last month in his clearest indication yet that he's ready for the war to end, declaring at the time that Israel has degraded Hamas to the point that it would not be able to carry out another Oct. 7 attack.\n\nBut, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will not agree to a permanent cease-fire until all the hostages are released, and that Hamas is stripped of its ability to threaten Israel militarily and that it does not govern the Gaza Strip.\n\nKirby said Tuesday the U.S. had received Hamas' reply to the cease-fire proposal and was still evaluating it.\n\nBiden is likely to hear from his European allies on the matter, as Israel's place on the world stage continues to take a hit as the war drags on given the tens of thousands of people who have died in Gaza since the start of the war in October.\n\nA second Zelensky meeting\n\nBiden is expected to meet in Italy with Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky, marking the second time in a week the two men have met while Biden is abroad. The two previously sat down in Normandy during D-Day anniversary proceedings.\n\n\"At the G-7 meeting later this week, our commitment to Ukraine will continue to be right up front and clear,\" Kirby told reporters. \"We will take bolster steps to show Mr. Putin that time is not on his side and he cannot outlast us as we support Ukraine's fight for freedom.\"\n\nThe president is skipping a Ukraine peace summit being held Saturday in Switzerland to return home for a major fundraiser in California. Vice President Harris will attend in his place.\n\nAnother major element of G-7 members demonstrating their commitment to Ukraine at the summit will be to come to a consensus on seizing frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine financially.\n\nG-7 members froze about $268 billion in Russian assets after the invasion in 2022 and the U.S.-led proposal reportedly calls for countries to use the profits generated on the frozen assets - about $2.6 to $3.6 billion a year - to pay back a $50 billion loan to provide Ukraine immediately.\n\nBiden and Zelensky will participate in a news conference after their meeting and the U.S. is expected to announce new sanctions and export control actions against Russia.\n\nBiden has made a point during each of his international trips to highlight the unified front the U.S. and its allies have shown in supporting Ukraine.\n\nCongress approved roughly $61 billion in additional aid for Ukraine after a months-long standoff, giving Biden a legislative win and the ability to tout continued U.S. leadership in supporting Kyiv.\n\nBut Republicans are unlikely to go for any additional aid this year, and the prospect of Trump returning to the White House threatens the prospect of U.S. support continuing beyond 2024, which could undermine Biden's pleas for allies to keep providing aid to Ukraine.\n\nGlobal economy improving, powered by US\n\nBiden enters the G-7 summit with good news on the global economic front - the world economy is stabilizing and the U.S. is powering it.\n\nThe World Bank's economic outlook released Tuesday credited a strong U.S. economy with bolstering the prospects for the global economy.\n\n\"Growth has remained buoyant in the teeth of the fiercest monetary policy tightening in four decades. U.S. dynamism, in fact, is one reason the global economy enjoys some upside potential over the next two years,\" the organization wrote.\n\nThe G-7 includes the world's most advanced economies and they are expected to discuss the improving global economy. Any praise for the U.S.'s hand in strengthening the World Bank's outlook for the international community would be significant for Biden ahead of November's election.\n\nBiden will host a side event at the G-7 to promote global infrastructures and investments, the White House outlined.\n\n\"We will continue to offer a path to help countries overcome unsustainable debt burdens, to boost the World Bank's lending firepower, to mobilize additional capital for high standard infrastructure investments and to make new commitments on food and health security,\" Kirby said.\n\nDomestic issues facing Biden\n\nBiden is set to leave for Italy the day after his son, Hunter Biden, was found guilty on all three counts in his gun trial in Wilmington, Del. Biden unexpectedly traveled to Wilmington on Tuesday after the verdict and spent the night at his Delaware home before his trip.\n\nThe president and White House are bracing for the fallout from the younger Biden's guilty verdict and the sentencing. Biden on Tuesday released a statement saying he would respect the judicial process after the verdict and reiteraed his support for his son.\n\nThe president also faces backlash at home over domestic policies, including his immigration executive order announced last week that would restrict asylum protections for those who cross between ports of entry if average daily crossings exceed 2,500.\n\nDemocrats and immigrant rights groups have blasted the order as too restrictive while Biden prepares for Republicans to use the influx of migrants at the border against Biden on the campaign trail.\n\nAnd the international trip comes just two weeks before Biden is scheduled to debate Trump. Biden will reportedly spend time at Camp David preparing for the June 27 showdown.", "source": {"uri": "brproud.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BRPROUD"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Hundreds of billions of assets are frozen in Europe, with just a small amount - roughly $3 billion - located in banks in the US.\n\nThat led European officials to raise concerns that they could be on the hook if Ukraine failed to pay back the loan, the investments generated less profit, or the assets get delivered back to Russia as part of a peace deal.\n\nA senior US official says negotiators, who have continued working out final details in Brindisi, Italy, ahead of the G7 leaders' arrival, have structured the deal so that all countries participating share the risk.\n\n\"This loan will mostly be provided by the United States and will be supplemented by money from Europe,\" an \u00c9lys\u00e9e source told journalists at a briefing.\n\n\"Countries are still discussing how to partition the cost if the profits from Russian assets are not sufficient to cover the need,\" the French source added.\n\nThe source spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing professional norms in Europe.\n\n\"The $50 billion will be transferred before the end of 2024,\" the source said.\n\nUS national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters traveling with President Joe Biden to the summit that the discussions were moving toward a \"common understanding\" of how the loan would be structured, though multiple countries would participate and work out the technical details after the summit.\n\n\"I believe that we are making good progress in generating an outcome in which those proceeds from those frozen assets can be put to good use,\" Sullivan said.\n\nG7 countries began brainstorming ways to identify longer-term sources of funding for Ukraine in late 2023, as lawmakers delayed in greenlighting the White House's funding request. Amid doubts on future political and financial wherewithal to continue spending taxpayer money in Ukraine - and facing a calendar stacked with elections on both sides of the Atlantic - officials began zeroing in on the Russian money gathering dust and interest payments in accounts around the world.\n\nBeginning in early 2023, working groups led by Treasury, State and the National Security Council officials held three, two-hour meetings each week beginning at 7 a.m. ET to accommodate time differences around the world.\n\nBanks and clearing houses that hold and process the funds raised concerns that simply taking the money would open up companies and countries alike to lawsuits and retribution from Russia. Utilizing the profits generated while Russia has no access to the money was conceived as a workaround that satisfied international legal concerns.\n\n\"It's the difference between someone seizing your home and renting out your home,\" said Tim Adams, president and CEO of the Institute of International Finance.\n\nThe United States has provided $175 billion to Ukraine since Russia's invasion, a total that now surpasses the $171 billion in 2024 dollars that the US provided to the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe after World War II. The European Union has delivered $107 billion in aid.\n\nThe World Bank estimates that Ukraine would need more than $500 billion to rebuild, a figure that climbs each day the war continues.\n\nCNN's

agree Russian frozen assets funding deal for Ukraine", "body": "G7 leaders are set to reach a political agreement to provide Ukraine with $50 billion of financial aid using the windfall profits generated by frozen Russian central bank assets, according to several people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nTechnical details of a deal are still to be finalised after a G-7 leaders' summit taking place in Italy this week, an Elyse\u00e9 official confirmed, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nEU member states agreed earlier this year that using the windfall profits generated by the frozen capital is legally sound as the profits, contrary to the capital of the assets, do not legally belong to Russia.\n\nUnder the plans, 90% of the funds would initially be allocated to the European Peace Facility (EPF), the bloc's mechanism to reimburse member states for weapons delivered to Kyiv, and then to the newly created Ukraine Assistance Fund (UAF).\n\nThe remaining 10% would be transferred to the EU budget and used to boost the capacity of the Ukrainian defence industry.\n\nHowever, the new idea at the G7 level is to use this to front-load more, faster help in the form of a massive upfront loan and secure them against political changes in the participating member countries.\n\nKey questions such as who issues the debt and who shares the risk are still being hammered out, the Elyse\u00e9 official said.\n\nUS President Joe Biden, who had been spearheading the plan, is expected to press his G7 counterparts to agree to the innovative plan, but on the eve of the summit, it caused a rift between the US and European governments.\n\nTo move ahead with the plan, people familiar with the talks said, there would need to be a need for risk-sharing between the EU and the US, as EU countries and the European Central Bank have been wary of the potential risk to the EU's single currency.\n\nEurozone finance ministers gave their political backing last week but said the terms would need to be discussed after the G7 summit gives political guidance.\n\nHowever, the plan would rely heavily on the fact that Russian frozen assets remain frozen in the long term until Moscow agrees to pay reparations and would require changes to the EU's Russia sanctions regime to provide for steady rollover.", "source": {"uri": "euractiv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EurActiv.com"}, "authors":

The move is a key 'deliverable' of Biden's G7 meetings set to begin in the Apulia region of Italy Thursday. The president arrived last night, and meets one on one with Zelensky before the two leaders are set to hold a joint press conference Thursday evening local time.\n\n'We want to demonstrate that the U.S. supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them, and that we'll continue to help address their security needs not just tomorrow but out into the future,' White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to the annual confab. 'This is a big deal,' he added Thursday. He called it a 'real marker of our commitment, not just for this month, this year, but for many years ahead, to continue to support Ukraine, both in defending against Russian aggression and in deterring future aggression.'\n\nThe bilateral deal would not have the strength of a treaty ratified by the U.S. Senate, so Biden or any successor could withdraw from it. But it would still present a barrier should Biden's Republican successor retake the White House. It is one of several efforts considered in Congress to try to 'Trump-proof' elements of the established order.\n\nIt comes after Biden was able to push through a $60 billion measure to aid Ukraine after overcoming prolonged opposition from Republican lawmakers in Congress. Trump heads to Capitol Hill Thursday to meet with Republicans who currently control the House and are in position to potentially seize control of the Senate in the November elections.\n\nTrump's White House tenure featured an angry impeachment clash triggered in part over a split within his administration over withholding military aid to Ukraine amid accusations by Trump allies of corruption in the country. Moscow launched its latest invasion of Ukraine in 2022, dramatically esacalating its 2014 invasion of the Donbas region.\n\nAnother deal emerging from the G7 meetings is an agreement to provide Ukraine with a $50 billion loan amid its territorial losses to Russian forces. The money comes from interest on $300 million in seized Russian assets - and gets around opposition from within the alliance to using those funds.\n\nDetails were still being worked out and administration officials were loath to confirm earlier reporting on the outlines of the deal. But the funds could reach Kiev by year's end. Sullivan told reporters Thursday morning that progress was likely, but he stopped short of offering guarantees on Russian sovereign assets and other issues.\n\n'I think we're teed up for success in that regard ... we'll have to see how the next two days unfold,' he said. Sullivan stopped short of promising immediate success. He said it wouldn't come today, and said leaders were on 'the verge of a good outcome. I think we will have the major tent poles of this decided,' he said, with some of the specifics yet to be resolved.\n\nThe diplomatic slog through arcane financial architecture comes at a summit where Biden and fellow G7 leaders will meet at an elegant medieval style village at Borgo Egnazia (although local police protecting them complained of dirty water and torn mattresses on the 'Goddess of the Night' tour ship that has been housing them.\n\nAll of Hunter Biden's children are accompanying the president on the trip, which comes as the family is still processing Hunter's guilty verdict and Biden has yet to speak publicly on it.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

He stopped short of saying a full agreement had been reached, and demurred on details while signaling he expects agreement across countries.\n\n\"You're going to see unanimity here at the G-7 when it comes to working towards using these frozen assets to help Ukraine with their reconstruction,\" he said.\n\nEarlier: Ukraine Satisfied on G-7 Asset Plan Progress, Finance Chief Says\n\nThe G-7 summit in Italy this week will include a heavy show of support for Ukraine, with the nation's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, attending the gathering. He and Biden will meet Thursday and hold a joint press conference, Kirby said.\n\nThe effort to leverage the immobilized Russian assets has continued for months. The political deal anticipated to be announced this week might leave some details to be negotiated later. One key technical aspect likely to be settled later is how risks will be shared among the allies.\n\nThe proceeds from the frozen assets in Europe are estimated to be worth \u20ac3 billion to \u20ac5 billion annually, depending on interest rates and other factors, a US official said separately, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe funds are expected to support Ukraine in the medium term, with officials saying they will help cover financing needs in 2025 and beyond. For the US and its allies, it is critical to send a message to Russia that they are willing to stand by Ukraine for as long as it takes.\n\nThe loan's repayment hinges on the assets remaining immobilized for long enough so that their windfall profits can repay it, which will take several years.\n\nThe EU's sanctions regime, which requires any decision on keeping the assets immobilized to be renewed on a six-month basis, raises questions about the reliability of the repayment plan, with countries like Hungary holding veto power over the process twice a year.\n\nEarlier: Ukraine Aid From Russian Assets Is Moving Forward in G-7 Draft\n\nShould the war come to an end sooner and the assets are \"re-mobilized\" as part of a peace deal with Russia, it is unclear who would be on the hook to repay the original loan.\n\nThe US expects the deal can be fashioned in a way that avoids a requirement for congressional approval, the official said. The money could be available later this year, the official added.\n\n\"We will take bold steps to show Mr. Putin that time is not on his side and that he cannot outlast us as we support Ukraine's fight for freedom,\" Kirby said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kirby_(admiral)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Kirby (admiral)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States National Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Physical_Asset_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Physical Asset Management", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/World_War_II_Dormant_Accounts", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/World War II Dormant Accounts", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Commercial_Lending", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Commercial Lending", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.2083906!/fileimage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/a-display-of-unmanned-systems-during-a-presentation-of-drone-military-hardware-of-the-unmanned-systems-force-of-the-ukraine-armed-forces-in-kyiv-ukraine-on-tuesday-june-11-2024-ukraine-demonstrated-various-types-of-remotely-operated-unmanned-robotic-systems-used-by-the-ukrainian-military-photographer-andrew-kravchenko-bloomberg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644722", "eventUri": "eng-9644722", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

While no final decision was made, they claimed \"progress\" in their discussions.\n\nRead more about what was agreed upon and whether it can be considered progress in the article by Nataliia Sichevliuk, Transparency International Ukraine legal adviser - Money, but not the right kind: Why the West didn't dare to transfer frozen Russian assets to Ukraine.\n\nThe specific mechanism is promised to be approved this week, but from the statement already made, it is clear that they plan to confiscate not all Russian assets, but only the interest accrued from them. These funds will not go to Ukraine directly, but to its creditor.\n\nThe proposed plan looks like this: Ukraine's allies will not seize the $285 currently frozen assets, but only the interest earned as an unexpected profit from investing these funds.\n\nPreviously, the European Union had discussed the possible transfer of interest from these assets directly to Ukraine. Since the interest from investing frozen Russian assets will obviously not cover the damages caused to Ukraine by Russia over more than two years of full-scale invasion, nor will it meet the current military needs of the country, the United States proposed another way: to provide Ukraine with a $50 billion loan.\n\nHowever, to ensure that Ukraine does not have to repay this loan, it is proposed to secure it with the collateral of the above-mentioned interest from Russian assets. Another important point is that this likely only applies to the interest earned after the decision to confiscate is made.\n\nThus, the accumulated income over the two years of full-scale invasion is not planned to be seized, citing the prohibition of retroactive law application.\n\nFor Ukraine, such a decision is rather a humiliating compromise than an effective measure against the aggressor. Furthermore, practical questions about the implementation of the developed mechanism have only increased.\n\nFirst and foremost, the question remains of who exactly, in what way, and for how long will pay Ukraine the mentioned $50 billion.\n\nFrom the experience of making such unpopular decisions, it seems that it should be a shared responsibility.\n\nInstead of having the opportunity to fight using Russia's funds, we again receive money for military and post-war needs from the taxpayers of partner countries -- Americans and Europeans. Such a resolution cannot be called a victory in either financial or any other sense.\n\nWe believe that all frozen sovereign assets of the Russian Federation, as well as any income from them, should be directly transferred to Ukraine as soon as possible within the framework of the international doctrine of \"countermeasures\" in response to Russia's unprecedented aggression and numerous violations of international law.\n\nThe international doctrine of \"countermeasures\" allows for the confiscation of state assets if such a state has violated its security obligations. Moreover, according to this principle, freezing assets is also a countermeasure, so the states that hold the assets of the Russian central bank have already violated immunity when they froze these assets.\n\nFurther delays in making this purely political decision demoralise and humiliate Ukrainians, who confront the aggressor daily.", "source": {"uri": "eurointegration.com.ua", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u0404\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_reserves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange reserves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transparency International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Collateral (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Russia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central Bank of Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Physical_Asset_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Physical Asset Management", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/World_War_II_Dormant_Accounts", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/World War II Dormant Accounts", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Associations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://img.eurointegration.com.ua/images/doc/e/2/e2e99f0-g7-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644722", "eventUri": "eng-9644722", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-27", "textStart": 3, "textEnd": 9}], "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

If the plan is approved, it will cover Ukraine's need for external financing for 2025 and provide a guarantee of funding regardless of political changes.\n\nThis was announced by the head of the Committee on Finance, Taxation and Customs Policy, Danylo Hetmantsev (Servant of the People). On Thursday, June 13, a three-day summit of G7 leaders began in the Italian region of Puglia, where one of the main topics to be discussed at the initiative of the United States will be the securitization of Russian assets . This event is extremely important for Ukraine, as it is about the possibility of obtaining concessional financing worth about $50 billion starting in 2025.\n\nThe essence of securitization of Russian assets\n\nThe plan envisages the issuance of securities (bonds) secured by the income from the frozen assets of the Bank of Russia in the long term. Mr. Getmantsev notes that there are still many unresolved issues as to how the future deal will be structured. Some of them include:\n\nAccording to Danylo Hetmantsev, if this plan is approved, it will be an important milestone for Ukraine in the coming years . He notes that such a decision will cover the need for external financing for 2025, which the Ministry of Finance currently estimates at $32 billion. Ukraine will receive a guarantee of receiving such funding regardless of political cycles, including the US elections.\n\n\"All these details will be agreed upon for a long time after the G7 Summit, and there will definitely be risks.

On June 13 and 14, the Ukrainian president is due to attend the G7 summit in Puglia, Italy, with the leaders of the world's richest democratic countries: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States and the United Kingdom. Additionally, the meeting, chaired by the head of the Italian government, Georgia Meloni, will also welcome 15 representatives of countries from the non-aligned Global South, who have been determined not to take sides between Russia and Ukraine since the start of the conflict.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who has maintained a relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, will both be present. Although Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (\"MBS\") declined at the last minute, Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Argentine President Javier Milei, Tunisian President Kais Saied and Kenyan President William Ruto will also be present. Even Pope Francis will be taking part in a session on artificial intelligence on Friday.\n\nAccording to Arturo Varvelli, of the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), this summit is an \"opportunity to broaden and deepen affinities and alliances with important medium-sized powers, which the West intends to distance from the Chinese or Russian sphere.\" \"It is emblematic of the way in which the G7 is gradually turning into a control room for relations with these powers,\" he added. In the meantime, the G7 is regrouping afterbeing the coordinator of Western sanctions against Moscow following the Russian invasion. Some guest states such as India, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates have either not adopted or are finding ways to bypass them.\n\nFor the West, the stakes are of the utmost importance, at a time when they are seeking to provide long-term support for Ukraine, which is experiencing difficulties on the battlefield. The G7 leaders are due to agree on a new $50 billion (\u20ac46.2 billion) \"solidarity loan\" to Kyiv by the end of the year, the details of which are causing friction between the US, France and Germany. It will be up to the countries' finance ministers to reach a compromise on the details, before Donald Trump's potential return to the White House.\n\nThe situation on the diplomatic front is much more complex. Since the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel and the Israeli retaliation in the Gaza Strip, the search for support from countries in the South has become even more difficult. Western leaders, led by Joe Biden, have been accused of a \"double standard\" when it comes to the support given to Israel by Ukraine's allies, to the detriment of the Palestinian cause. Varvelli believes it would be important for the G7 to push for a ceasefire in the largely destroyed enclave and move toward a new \"security architecture\" to ensure the coexistence of the Israel and Palestine.", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le Monde.fr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label":

Join us in this fight.\n\nThe U.S. and Ukraine will sign a long-awaited bilateral security agreement on June 13 during the Group of Seven (G7) summit in Italy, U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told the press on June 12.\n\nUkraine and the U.S. have held multiple rounds of negotiations on the bilateral security agreement, which follows the pledge made by the G7 during the NATO summit in Vilnius in July 2023 to commit to Ukraine's long-term defense.\n\n\"Our negotiations have concluded and we will sign this agreement tomorrow,\" Sullivan said, describing the deal as a \"signal of our resolve.\"\n\n\"We want to demonstrate that the U.S. supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them, and that we will continue to help address their security needs, not just tomorrow but out into the future,\" Sullivan said.\n\nAccording to Sullivan, the agreement outlines a vision of how to strengthen Ukraine's defense and deterrence capabilities, together with U.S. allies and partners.\n\nThe agreement also secures \"commitments from Ukraine on reforms\" and on \"end-use monitoring\" for U.S.-provided weapons, Sullivan added.\n\n\"Any lasting lasting peace in Ukraine has to be underwritten by Ukraine's own ability to protect itself and deter future aggression,\" Sullivan said.\n\nUkraine and the U.S. have held multiple rounds of negotiations on the agreement, which \"does not make a specific monetary pledge to support Ukraine's defense,\" two sources told CNN.\n\nThe agreement is \"expected to commit the U.S. for 10 years to continued training of Ukraine's armed forces, more cooperation in the production of weapons and military equipment, the continued provision of military assistance, and greater intelligence sharing,\" CNN said.\n\nAccording to CNN's sources, the agreement paves the way for the U.S. to have a long-term security relationship with Kyiv, but could also be undone by future presidential administrations.\n\nThe security agreement will therefore be \"less formal than a treaty and not necessarily binding for any future presidents,\" CNN said.\n\nIf signed, the U.S. would join 14 other countries including the U.K., Germany, France, Canada, and the Netherlands, which have signed similar deals to help Ukraine repel Russia's aggression based on a pledge made by G7 at the NATO summit in Vilnius in July 2023.\n\nMost recently, President Volodymyr Zelensky and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez signed a 10-year bilateral security agreement between Ukraine and Spain on May 27.",

We want to demonstrate that the US supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them, and that we'll continue to help address their security needs not just tomorrow but out into the future,\" the NSA said.\n\nThe agreement outlines a clear vision of work with Ukraine to continue strengthening Ukraine's credible defence and deterrence capability. Any lasting peace in Ukraine has to be underwritten by Ukraine's own ability to defend itself and deter future aggression, he said \"And by signing this, we'll also be sending Russia a signal of our resolve. If Vladimir Putin thinks that he can outlast the coalition supporting Ukraine, he's wrong. He just cannot wait us out, and this agreement will show our resolve and continued commitment,\" Sullivan said.\n\nA day earlier, White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby told reporters that this year's summit would show that G7 is more unified than ever to tackle global challenges, and to renew their commitment to partners around the world that they will help them invest in bright futures for their people.\n\n\"We will build on the progress we made last year on our shared approach to the Indo-Pacific as well, including by advancing an Indo-Pacific region that is free, open, secure, prosperous, resilient, and connected,\" he said.\n\n\"We will address the PRC's support for the Russian defence industrial base. And we will confront China's non-market policies that are leading to harmful global spillovers, working with partners in and beyond the G7 to promote economic resilience and security,\" Kirby said.\n\nBiden will again host a side event that will highlight its positive value proposition to countries around the world via the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, or PGI, he said.\n\n\"We will continue to offer a path to help countries overcome unsustainable debt burdens, to boost the World Bank's lending firepower, to mobilize additional capital for high-standard infrastructure investments, and to make new commitments on food and health security,\" he added.\n\nG7 leaders will be joined by His Holiness, Pope Francis, for a session on artificial intelligence, among other topics. \"This will be an important moment for our countries to come together and develop our shared approach to harnessing the benefits of AI while at the same time managing the risks to our national security and impacts that it may have to our workforces and inequality,\" Kirby said.\n\n\"The bottom line here is that President Biden believes we must continue to imagine, to invent and to inspire. We are committed to investing in that vision with our closest allies. We are very confident that if we do, the United States will continue to lead on the world stage for generations to come,\" said the White House official.

Join us in this fight.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden announced on June 9 that he had reached an agreement with French President Emmanuel Macron on using the profits from frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) reported.\n\nThe G7 and the European Union are exploring ways to utilize the profits from Russian assets frozen in the West to offer Ukraine a substantial upfront loan and ensure its financial stability through 2025.\n\nApproximately $281 billion in Russian central bank funds are frozen worldwide, primarily in the EU. These funds generate up to $3.8 billion annually in profit, which the EU states are not contractually owed to Russia and thus represent a windfall.\n\nThe U.S. has championed the idea of using these profits as a steady revenue stream to service a large loan of $50 billion that could be raised on the market. Russia argues that diverting profits from frozen funds constitutes theft.\n\nEU Sanctions Envoy David O'Sullivan indicated on May 31 that Kyiv is expected to receive the first tranche of revenue from frozen Russian assets from the European Union this summer.\n\n\"We are talking about summer. I would not like to promise when exactly the money will be transferred to the account, but decisions will be made in the next few weeks, and the payment will be made later,\" O'Sullivan said in answer to the question of when the first tranche might arrive.\n\nThe EU Council agreed on May 21 to use profits from the frozen Russian sovereign assets to aid Ukraine. According to the statement, the proceedings could amount to between 2.5 billion and 3 billion euros ($2.7-3.26 billion) annually, with most of it allocated to Kyiv's military needs.", "source": {"uri": "kyivindependent.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Kyiv Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Free_Europe/Radio_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Radio Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Russia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central Bank of Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_the_European_Union", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Council of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Frozen", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Frozen", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/06/GettyImages-2155649031.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644722", "eventUri": "eng-9644722", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-09", "textStart": 105, "textEnd": 111}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-31", "textStart": 1039, "textEnd": 1045}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-21", "textStart": 1485, "textEnd": 1491}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

After more than two years, this war has become another example of an asymmetrical conflict, as much in terms of what the implications are for either side as it is of military capabilities.\n\nFor Ukraine, this is about defending its sovereignty and territorial integrity, which it cannot afford to lose. For Russia, in what is primarily Vladimir Putin's war, the longer it continues without significant achievements, the more it becomes about the Russian president's staying power.\n\nPredictably and justifiably, Russia's naked aggression against its neighbor drew a powerful reaction from large parts of the international community, which has supported the Ukrainian people and equally hindered Moscow's further expansionist attempts to restore much of what used to comprise the Soviet Union. However, as time goes by, other pressing global and domestic issues are diverting the world's attention and exerting pressure to accordingly direct resources away from supporting Ukraine.\n\nNo surprise, then, that the Western countries that have contributed almost all the financial and military aid in support of Kyiv in its war effort are looking for creative mechanisms to continue to do so without detrimental economic and political impacts on their own societies. The most recent idea to emerge from the EU, which will be considered at this week's G7 meeting, is to raise tens of billions of euros in debt for Ukraine secured against future profits generated by the Russian state's assets that have been frozen by Western countries. There are some \u20ac210 billion ($225 billion) in Russian assets currently frozen in the EU, which could yield up to \u20ac3 billion a year that, according to this plan, would be used to support Ukraine's war effort.\n\nAs of the end of February, European donors and the EU have allocated a total of \u20ac89.9 billion in aid for military, humanitarian and financial support since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In addition, the US allocated the equivalent of \u20ac67 billion over the same period and, after prolonged wrangling in Congress, in April approved a further $61 billion. The contributions of the US and Europe account for more than 95 percent of all aid allocations to Ukraine.\n\nAt times of sluggish economic growth and the unavoidable, although distracting, fatigue among the public as well as in some decision-making circles, the long-term support for Ukraine is weakening. Hence, in principle, using some of the profits from the aggressor's assets should not be rejected a priori.\n\nHowever, one person -- and not the only one -- to remain unimpressed by this scheme is European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, who, despite the growing pressure on Europe to raise funds for Ukraine, is adamant that \"moving from freezing the assets to confiscating the assets, disposing of them, is something that needs to be looked at very carefully.\" Lagarde argues that such a move would \"start breaking the international legal order that you want to protect, that you would want Russia and all countries around the world to respect.\"\n\nLagarde's view must be taken seriously because one of the accusations customarily levelled against the US and its Western allies is that of hypocrisy and double standards when it comes to the manner in which they conduct their foreign affairs, especially their alleged failure to live up to the same principles and values, such as those of international law, that they expect others to follow.\n\nYet, there is a way to square this circle by limiting the suggested practice to either the length of the war or until Putin goes and a new government emerges in Russia; one that is ready to enter into constructive negotiations with Ukraine to end the war while respecting its sovereignty. In the meantime, using the interest from these assets, while bearing in mind that they belong to the Russian people and will have to be returned to them, is a practical and not immoral solution to financing Ukraine's defensive war.\n\nMuch of these assets can only be described as part of the post-Cold War hoarding of Russia's \"family silver,\" including the country's natural resources, industrial infrastructure and media outlets, by a small group of oligarchs conspiring with the political class. Admittedly this was with the more-or-less tacit support of other, mainly high-income, countries for their own benefit; although this has hardly benefited ordinary Russian people.\n\nBut for now, supporting Ukraine is the top priority. And, in any case, the many billions of dollars accumulating in interest will not be returned to Russia at least until the end of the war. Meanwhile, the need to sufficiently finance Ukraine's war effort is becoming even more urgent as a result of a changing balance of power on the battlefield, which in some areas is turning against Ukraine. Russian forces have already crossed the international border north of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-biggest city, and are making what was described as \"tactically significant advances,\" along with similar inroads into some parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nIt must be emphasized that this new suggested economic measure should remain an exception and should be endorsed only because of the exceptional circumstances of this war and the far-reaching and dismal implications for global security if Moscow was to have its way.\n\nMoreover, following the death of Alexei Navalny in a Russian gulag, there is now hardly any opposition that could mount a credible challenge to Putin and, even if there should be a change of leadership from within Russian politics, it will not necessarily be for the better. Hence, those who are currently guarding the Russian assets should see themselves as their custodians or guardians, who in due course, when circumstances change, will return them to the people who will be able to use them to build a new Russia.\n\nFor now, ensuring that Russia is defeated goes beyond saving Ukraine and is as much about promoting peace and security in the spirit of the UN Charter. However, in the aftermath of this war, it is the logic of the post-Second World War Marshall Plan that should guide those who support Ukraine and not the punitive reparations imposed on the defeated aggressor in the aftermath of the First World War. This should be kept in mind, especially if it is that aggressor's assets that are hopefully going to change the tide of the war in favor of Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "eurasiareview.com",

The bulk of frozen Russian assets lie in Europe, and the European Union has announced its plans to \"make Russia pay\" by allocating those assets to Ukraine to fund its war against Russia directly.\n\nUkraine will receive $1.6 billion in frozen Russian assets this July, according to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen who spoke at the Ukraine Recovery Conference 2024 on June 11. She stated that 90% of stolen Russian funds will go directly to defense, while the other 10% will be put toward the reconstruction effort. \"My friends we have always said that Russia must be held accountable for its crimes and now we make Russia pay,\" von der Leyen said.\n\nI already noted that President Joe Biden said Ukraine will receive a loan of up to $3.7 billion through 2025. The elites claim these funds amount to money that the Russian oligarchs stole from the Russian people, but that is simply not the case. The West has confiscated assets from a foreign nation during a time of peace as Ukraine is not in the NATO alliance. Now the West is using those illegally confiscated assets to attack its adversary. This is complete and total economic warfare.\n\nNo one knows where the money that is packaged as Ukrainian aid actually goes. Portions are funneled back into the military-industrial complex and paid out to the very nations supplying aid. Everyone acts on the invisible hand in their own best interest. None of these aid packages were meant to be a handout, and Ukraine would suffer the repercussions.\n\nRussia was patient as the West held their citizen's wealth hostage. Putin has said numerous times that he is fighting a war with the West and not Ukraine at this point in time. Russia would have easily defeated Ukraine had there been no interference, and Russia would have never invaded in the first place had their been no interference (see: Minsk Agreement).

After more than two years, this war has become another example of an asymmetrical conflict, as much in terms of what the implications are for either side as it is of military capabilities.\n\nFor Ukraine, this is about defending its sovereignty and territorial integrity, which it cannot afford to lose. For Russia, in what is primarily Vladimir Putin's war, the longer it continues without significant achievements, the more it becomes about the Russian president's staying power.\n\nPredictably and justifiably, Russia's naked aggression against its neighbor drew a powerful reaction from large parts of the international community, which has supported the Ukrainian people and equally hindered Moscow's further expansionist attempts to restore much of what used to comprise the Soviet Union. However, as time goes by, other pressing global and domestic issues are diverting the world's attention and exerting pressure to accordingly direct resources away from supporting Ukraine.\n\nNo surprise, then, that the Western countries that have contributed almost all the financial and military aid in support of Kyiv in its war effort are looking for creative mechanisms to continue to do so without detrimental economic and political impacts on their own societies. The most recent idea to emerge from the EU, which will be considered at this week's G7 meeting, is to raise tens of billions of euros in debt for Ukraine secured against future profits generated by the Russian state's assets that have been frozen by Western countries. There are some \u20ac210 billion ($225 billion) in Russian assets currently frozen in the EU, which could yield up to \u20ac3 billion a year that, according to this plan, would be used to support Ukraine's war effort.\n\nAt times of sluggish economic growth and fatigue among the public, the long-term support for Ukraine is weakening\n\nYossi Mekelberg\n\nAs of the end of February, European donors and the EU have allocated a total of \u20ac89.9 billion in aid for military, humanitarian and financial support since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In addition, the US allocated the equivalent of \u20ac67 billion over the same period and, after prolonged wrangling in Congress, in April approved a further $61 billion. The contributions of the US and Europe account for more than 95 percent of all aid allocations to Ukraine.\n\nAt times of sluggish economic growth and the unavoidable, although distracting, fatigue among the public as well as in some decision-making circles, the long-term support for Ukraine is weakening. Hence, in principle, using some of the profits from the aggressor's assets should not be rejected a priori.\n\nHowever, one person -- and not the only one -- to remain unimpressed by this scheme is European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, who, despite the growing pressure on Europe to raise funds for Ukraine, is adamant that \"moving from freezing the assets to confiscating the assets, disposing of them, is something that needs to be looked at very carefully.\" Lagarde argues that such a move would \"start breaking the international legal order that you want to protect, that you would want Russia and all countries around the world to respect.\"\n\nLagarde's view must be taken seriously because one of the accusations customarily levelled against the US and its Western allies is that of hypocrisy and double standards when it comes to the manner in which they conduct their foreign affairs, especially their alleged failure to live up to the same principles and values, such as those of international law, that they expect others to follow.\n\nYet, there is a way to square this circle by limiting the suggested practice to either the length of the war or until Putin goes and a new government emerges in Russia; one that is ready to enter into constructive negotiations with Ukraine to end the war while respecting its sovereignty. In the meantime, using the interest from these assets, while bearing in mind that they belong to the Russian people and will have to be returned to them, is a practical and not immoral solution to financing Ukraine's defensive war.\n\nUsing the interest from these assets is a practical and not immoral solution to financing Ukraine's defensive war\n\nYossi Mekelberg\n\nMuch of these assets can only be described as part of the post-Cold War hoarding of Russia's \"family silver,\" including the country's natural resources, industrial infrastructure and media outlets, by a small group of oligarchs conspiring with the political class. Admittedly this was with the more-or-less tacit support of other, mainly high-income, countries for their own benefit; although this has hardly benefited ordinary Russian people.\n\nBut for now, supporting Ukraine is the top priority. And, in any case, the many billions of dollars accumulating in interest will not be returned to Russia at least until the end of the war. Meanwhile, the need to sufficiently finance Ukraine's war effort is becoming even more urgent as a result of a changing balance of power on the battlefield, which in some areas is turning against Ukraine. Russian forces have already crossed the international border north of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-biggest city, and are making what was described as \"tactically significant advances,\" along with similar inroads into some parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nIt must be emphasized that this new suggested economic measure should remain an exception and should be endorsed only because of the exceptional circumstances of this war and the far-reaching and dismal implications for global security if Moscow was to have its way.\n\nMoreover, following the death of Alexei Navalny in a Russian gulag, there is now hardly any opposition that could mount a credible challenge to Putin and, even if there should be a change of leadership from within Russian politics, it will not necessarily be for the better. Hence, those who are currently guarding the Russian assets should see themselves as their custodians or guardians, who in due course, when circumstances change, will return them to the people who will be able to use them to build a new Russia.\n\nFor now, ensuring that Russia is defeated goes beyond saving Ukraine and is as much about promoting peace and security in the spirit of the UN Charter. However, in the aftermath of this war, it is the logic of the post-Second World War Marshall Plan that should guide those who support Ukraine and not the punitive reparations imposed on the defeated aggressor in the aftermath of the First World War. This should be kept in mind, especially if it is that aggressor's assets that are hopefully going to change the tide of the war in favor of Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "arabnews.com", "dataType":

The EU has estimated the total profits from the assets would be between \u20ac15bn-\u20ac20bn (\u00a312bn-\u00a316bn) by 2027, including around \u20ac3bn (\u00a32.5bn) this year.\n\nAdvanced talks are ongoing over providing a loan to Ukraine of about $50bn (\u00a338bn), to be paid back in instalments through the profits from frozen Russian assets. But there is said to be disagreement between the US and EU over who would guarantee the loan and how it would be distributed.\n\n\"What Washington is proposing is, 'The US takes a loan, Europe takes all the risk, Europe pays the interest, and the US uses the money for a US-Ukraine fund',\" an unnamed senior European diplomat told Politico. \"We might be stupid but we're not that stupid.\"\n\nAhead of the summit, a group of European MPs and officials - including British Foreign Affairs Select Committee Chair, Alicia Kearns, signed an open letter published in the Financial Times calling for all of the Russian funds in Europe to be appropriated.\n\n\"The ultimate objective must be to fully confiscate all Russian assets and transfer them to Ukraine, ensuring that this process adheres to international law,\" the officials argued. \"Russia's war of aggression has already done almost \u20ac500bn (\u00a3420b) in damage to Ukraine's infrastructure -- and that amount grows daily.\n\n\"At least \u20ac3bn a month in outside financial assistance is required just to prevent a collapse of Ukraine's economy.\"\n\nThe stakes are heightened in Italy as it is the last summit before the US election in November, which could bring the return of Donald Trump and his isolationist agenda, and Hungary's accession to the EU Council presidency in July, which could grant Viktor Orban's regime opportunities to continue to thwart aid packages.\n\nDr Anton Moiseienko, a senior lecturer in law at the Australian National University and a sanctions specialist, suggests the outcomes are unpredictable.\n\n\"We have as the status quo the EU's commitment to taking the profits generated on frozen Russian assets, and allocating those profits to a special fund that will be used, among other things, to enable the supply of military equipment to Ukraine,\" he said.\n\n\"You could take that as a stepping stone towards a more far-reaching approach in future - so first you go after the profits and then the totality of those assets. Or you could say it's just a way to satisfy some critics and then kick the issue into the long grass.\"\n\nDiscussion among leaders could be similar to \"shepherding cats\", Dr Moiseienko predicts. While some concerns over the legal basis for appropriations have been assuaged, there is still widespread fear of stepping too far into the unknown, he said.\n\n\"No country wants to be the first...and therefore we are seeing invocations of unity and moving in lockstep,\" he said. \"But it's really difficult to shepherd these cats and provide a single position.\"\n\nSupporters of appropriating all frozen Russian assets argue that the interest would provide only a drop in the ocean compared with Ukraine's vast military, humanitarian, and general economic needs.\n\nWhile much of the war is being fought with cheap home-made drones and old fashioned artillery, Kyiv argues that it also needs more advanced munitions such as British-made Storm Shadow missiles, valued at about \u00a32m each.\n\nThe rate of ammunition expenditure has caused global shortages and led to new manufacturing plants being established by allies in Europe and the US.\n\nUkraine has received more than \u00a380b in military aid to date, according to the Kiel Institute tracker, with the US and EU recently passing new support packages.\n\nUkraine is also dealing with financial headaches such as mass emigration and the loss of much of its workforce to military service, while key industries such as agriculture have been decimated by the war.\n\nThe cost of reconstruction was estimated at almost $500b (\u00a3389bn) by the World Bank and the rate of destruction is not slowing with Russia now training its fire on Ukraine's second city Kharkiv.\n\nSuch daunting costs will require new sources of revenue as placing the burden on American and European taxpayers \"will become politically difficult\", Dr Moiseienko believes.\n\nBut influential economists are concerned that appropriating Russian funds could have a far reaching impact on the international financial system.\n\nEuropean Central Bank President, Christine Lagarde, said recently that \"moving from freezing the assets to confiscating the assets, disposing of them, is something that needs to be looked at very carefully\".\n\nSuch a move would risk \"breaking the international legal order that you want to protect, that you would want Russia and all countries around the world to respect,\" she said.\n\nBanking executives in London told i in February that seizing Russian funds could undermine confidence in financial institutions, and potentially lead to mass withdrawals, particularly from nations that could also foresee themselves becoming targets such as China and Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"They may feel that if it can happen to Russia it could happen to them and this could set in motion a withdrawal of funds by nations such as these from the Western banking system,\" said Richard Werner, a professor of banking and economics at the University of Winchester.\n\nRussia has also threatened to retaliate if its assets are appropriated, which analysts suggest could take the form of seizing foreign investors' assets in Russia.\n\n\"Whenever you take a unilateral act in international affairs, you can only predict the response by the other side, you can't be sure,\" said Dr Yossi Mekelberg, an international relations scholar at Chatham House. \"But it's an exceptional situation, and the cost is going up and up.\"", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri":

JEAN-PIERRE: Okay. I have two things at the top, and then I'll hand it over to Jake Sullivan.\n\nSo, tomorrow, Senate Democrats will introduce a bill that would safeguard access to IVF for families across the country.\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration strongly supports protecting access to IVF. Americans should have the right to make deeply personal decisions about their health, lives, and families, but that fundamental right is under re- -- relentless attack.\n\nIt has been nearly two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. What followed has been nothing short of devastating.\n\nSince Roe was overturned, Republican elected officials have implemented 21 extreme state abortion bans. One out of three women of reproductive age now live in a state with an abortion ban. In nearly all these states, doctors could be charged with a felony for simply doing their jobs. Contraception is under attack. Just last week, Senate Republicans blocked a bill that would guarantee the right for women to access contraception. And IVF is under attack.\n\nAbout one in five American women struggle with infertility, and many rely on IVF. This is a basic issue of reproductive freedom.\n\nPresident Biden believes that women must have the freedom to make deeply personal healthcare decisions, including the right to decide if and when to start or grow their family.\n\nWe are committed to protecting access to reproductive care and will continue to urge Congress to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade into federal law.\n\nAnd finally, in anticipation of your questions, I just want to read the President's statement from yesterday. And it reads:\n\n\"As I said last week, I am the President, but I am also a dad. Jill an- -- Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. So many families who have had loved ones battle addiction understand the feeling of pride seeing someone you love come out the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery. As I also said last week, I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal. Jill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that.\"\n\nEnd quote. And from that, I don't have anything beyond the statement that the President put out yesterday, as I just read through.\n\nBut right now, I do have Jake Sullivan, our National Security Advisor. He's going to -- he's going to discuss our strong support for Ukraine and -- for Ukraine now and in the -- into the future as we head into the G7 in the upcoming hours.\n\nSo, the President is looking forward to seeing his fellow G7 leaders as well as the leaders of a number of guest countries over the course of the next couple of days.\n\nAs you guys have all seen, it's going to be an action-packed schedule. And we did a background briefing on this yesterday, so you got a good laydown of what the agenda looks like and the main issues.\n\nBefore I talk about a couple of specific issues relevant to the G7, I just wanted to make a couple of comments about the ongoing effort to secure a ceasefire and hostage deal.\n\nSo, we're continuing to work for a ceasefire along the lines of the May 27th Israeli proposal, as outlined in President Biden's speech on May 31st. The proposal has been endorsed by the G7, by countries around the world. It was then supported this week by a U.N. Security Council resolution.\n\nHamas has now submitted a response to that proposal, and we have now reviewed its contents. Many of the proposed changes are minor and not unanticipated. Others differ more substantively from what was outlined in the U.N. Security Council resolution.\n\nThe United States will now work with the mediators, specifically Egypt and Qatar, to bridge final gaps consistent with the President's May 31st speech and with the contents of the U.N. Security Council resolution.\n\nOur aim is to bring this process to a conclusion. Our view is that the time for haggling is over. It's time for a ceasefire to begin and for the hostages to come home.\n\nAnd I know, as I said before, that you've already gotten a preview, so I'm not going to go into details on individual sessions.\n\nI did want to take some time before turning to your questions to discuss what will be a big focus for us on the first day on the ground.\n\nTomorrow, President Biden and President Zelenskyy will sit down to discuss our strong support for Ukraine now and into the future.\n\nFollowing that meeting, the leaders will sign a bilateral security agreement making clear our support will last long into the future and pledging continued cooperation, particularly in the defense and security space.\n\nYou all will recall that in July of '23, just under a year ago, at the Vilnius Summit, President Biden organized the G7 around a joint declaration of support for Ukraine that highlighted our commitment to pursue these security agreements.\n\nOur G7 partners have done so. Another 25 countries have actually signed on to that joint declaration. Many of them have also done these security agreements.\n\nSo, we announced last year that each country would essentially commit to negotiate a long-term bilateral security arrangement with Ukraine. At this point, 15 countries have signed their agreements, and I'm pleased to share that our negotiations with Ukraine have concluded and we'll sign this agreement tomorrow.\n\nOur goal here is straightforward. We want to demonstrate that the U.S. supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them, and that we'll continue to help address their security needs not just tomorrow but out into the future.\n\nIn the agreement, which we will share with all of you later this week, we outline a clear vision of work with our allies and partners, with Ukraine in order to continue to strengthen Ukraine's credible defense and deterrence capability. Any lasting peace in Ukraine has to be underwritten by Ukraine's own ability to defend itself and deter future aggression.\n\nAnd by signing this, we'll also be sending Russia a signal of our resolve. If Vladimir Putin thinks that he can outlast the coalition supporting Ukraine, he's wrong. He just cannot wait us out, and this agreement will show our resolve and continued commitment.\n\nThrough this commitment, we're also securing commit- -- through this agreement, we're also securing commitments from Ukraine on reforms and on end-use monitoring for weapons we provide.\n\nAnd in deepening cooperation with Ukraine, our government will benefit from Ukraine's insights and experience, its battlefield innovations, and its lessons learned from the front.\n\nOur view is that Ukraine's security is central to Europe's security and therefore central to America's security.\n\nSo, this agreement, together with the mutually reinforcing security agreements from a broad and powerful network of countries, provides a pathway to a stable, independent, democratic, and secure Ukraine.\n\nYou'll hear more about this tomorrow, but I want to share two final notes.\n\nFirst, we're explicit in the agreement that we intend to work with Congress over the coming months to find a path to sustainable resources for Ukraine. And finally, this agreement covers the kind of support that Ukraine has sought as it bravely defends its freedom.\n\nThey have asked for our weapons and assistance as they fight to defend their territory. They have not asked our forces to join the fight. So, this agreement does not include any commitment to using our own forces to defend Ukraine. It is a pledge that we will ensure Ukraine can defend itself today and deter future aggression as well, as the President said last year.\n\nFinally -- and thank you for bearing with me -- today, we've announced sweeping new measures to intensify the pressure on Russia. These actions will ratchet up the risk that foreign financial institutions take by dealing with Russia's war economy.\n\nThe Department of Treasury is making clear that foreign banks risk being sanctioned for dealing with any entity or individual blocked under our Russia sanctions, including designated Russian banks.\n\nTreasury and Commerce are also issuing complimentary prohibitions to restrict the ability of Russia's defense industrial base to take advantage of access to certain U.S. software or IT services. And Commerce is announcing steps to more aggressively target transhipment to Russia of U.S.-branded items, regardless of where those items are produced, and a new measure to crackdown on diversion through shell companies.\n\nWe're imposing around 300 new sanctions and Entity List additions of specific companies or individuals. And the targets for those include Russian financial infrastructure, including major non-bank entities that help Russia finance its war effort and evade sanctions; entities and individuals across multiple evasion and foreign procurement networks, like networks that support Russia's UAV production, gold laundering, and procurement of sensitive items like anti-UAV equipment, machine tools, industrial materials, and micro- -- microelectronics.\n\nThe foreign targets include more than two dozen PRC entities and individuals and additional targets across multiple other third countries in multiple regions -- in East Asia, the Middle East, Europe, Africa, Central Asia, and the Caribbean.\n\nThey include Russia domestic war economy targets, including entities across the defense and related materiel transportation and technology sectors. They include future energy, metals, and mining revenue generation targets and areas such as future LNG projects, future coal and oil projects, and gold smuggling.\n\nAnd we're also targeting additional Russian elites, including those involved in the deportation and so-called reeducation of Ukrainian children.\n\nAltogether, these actions heighten the risk for financial institutions dealing with Russia's war economy, close down avenues for evasion while diminishing Russia's ability to benefit from access to foreign technology, equipment, software, and I- -- IT services.\n\nAnd you'll see from the President tomorrow that our commitment to Ukraine will continue and we will show our resolve through the specific actions we are taking and through close coordination with all of our partners.\n\nThe final thing I will just note is that discussions continue on the ground in Puglia on unlocking the proceeds of the Russian sovereign assets. We consider those discussions constructive, productive, driving forward.\n\nI don't have anything to announce to you today, but I believe that we are making good progress in generating an outcome in which those proceeds from those frozen assets can be put to good use.\n\nAnd with that --\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Colleen.\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: -- thank you for your patience.\n\nQ Can you confirm the U.S. has sent another Patriot missile system to Ukraine? And will -- can we expect additional weapons, then, to be part of the security agreement going forward?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: The security agreement doesn't announce the delivery of particular weapon systems. It sets a frame for the kind of ongoing cooperation that we've had with Ukraine over the past two years, including in identified areas like air defense.\n\nI can't confirm because I'm not here to make any announcements on particular air defense capabilities today. I will tell you that it has been a top priority of President Biden to get more air defense systems to Ukraine. And if and when we have announcements on that, we'll be sure to let you know.\n\nQ Jake --\n\nQ Jake, on the -- on the ceasefire discussions. There are reports -- we have -- we have reports that Hamas is asking for written assurances from the United States of a permanent ceasefire. Can you say what the U.S. position is on that and whether you think that is possible to -- to move this process forward and -- and --\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: I have not heard that specific Hamas request today. Obviously, this is a fast-moving situation. And also, there's a lot of different Hamas voices. So, we'll await consultation with Egypt and Qatar, who speak through an authoritative channel with Hamas. And then we'll make our determinations about the best way to deliver this ceasefire and hostage deal consistent with what the President laid out and what the Security Council resolution laid out.\n\nQ And, Jake, on the Russian frozen asset. Can you -- I know you said you don't want to talk anymore. But is the expectation for a clear, detailed plan of the terms or a framework for further discussion? And is the amount still $50 billion? And will it be signed by G7 or just some members?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: This is a leaders' declaration. Anything that we do with respect to Russian sovereign assets is not going to lay out every detail because we need our technical experts to work through it. What we are working towards is a framework that is not generic, that is quite specific in terms of -- of what it would entail.\n\nBut, of course, the core operational details of anything that is agreed in Italy will then have to be worked through, and the leaders would give direction to the experts to work that through on a defined timeframe, again, if and when we're prepared to announce something on this.\n\nQ Jake, two questions. First on the agreement that you're planning to do with the Ukrainians. So, last -- at the NATO summit in Vilnius, there was a lot of early discussion about this, mostly as a substitute for rapid entry into -- into NATO. And there was discussion of using the -- the Israel model here, which, of course, with Congress is a 10-year-long commitment for a certain amount of funding and then -- and then security commitments.\n\nCan you compare what you're about to go announce here to what we do with Israel? And would you compare it, as well, to the agreement that President Bush reached that announced secur- -- security arrangements for Ukraine with Britain, with Russia, in fact, you know, 20 years ago when --\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Are you talking about the Budapest Memorandum?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: -- the -- the breakup of the Soviet (inaudible) --\n\nQ It was very vague and, of course, has left the Ukrainians with a bit of a bitter feeling in their mouths for -- understandably.\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Obviously, that document came in a totally different context at a totally different time. This document comes on the foundation of two years of the U.S. supplying substantial resources, military assistance, intelligence, economic support. And it essentially projects continued backing of Ukraine's capacity to defend itself and deter future aggression.\n\nWith respect to comparing it to other models, I would call this the Ukraine model. It does not include specific dollar figures. It includes a commitment to work with Congress on sustainable funding going forward, which we will do. And it lays out a framework for how we work with Ukraine and with other allies and partners to ensure Ukraine has what it needs in terms of the physical capacity as well as the intelligence and other capacities to be able to defend itself effectively and to deter Russia.\n\nThe other thing that I would say about the document that's very important is that it is part of a latticework of other agreements, where the whole will end up being greater than the sum of its parts because it will be a broad range of nations all working together to reinforce the same types of support for the same purposes.\n\nFinally, with respect to the question of how it relates to NATO, at Vilnius last year, the NATO Joint Statement signed on to by all Allies, including the United States, said that Ukraine's future is in NATO, and it said that Allies would be in a position to give an invitation to Ukraine to join NATO when conditions are met and all Allies agree.\n\nWhen the President went out and described the process leading to this bilateral security agreement, he said this would be a bridge from now to Ukraine's ultimate membership in NATO when conditions are met and all Allies agree.\n\nThat bridge involves us helping Ukraine have the capacity that it needs for its own security and for sustaining -- sustaining its own sovereignty and territorial integrity. So, that's how they link together.\n\nYou'll see that in the text of the document, as you've seen it in the text of other bilateral security agreements that have been signed by other countries.\n\nQ And on the sanctions that you mentioned. As you noted, a good number of them are -- are noted -- are directed at the PRC. Some of your colleagues have made the point that support with dual-use technology for the PRC has really surged in the past six or eight months.\n\nWhat do you see as the Chinese strategy here? Are they viewing this differently than they did a year ago? Are they holding to the kind of warnings that you gave them at Riverside when the President discussed support for Russia with Xi Jinping and urged him not to provide weapons or technology?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: So, we have made clear our concerns to the PRC about the supply of certain dual-use capabilities to Russia that are being used in the Russian war machine to slaughter Ukrainians and to back an illegal war of aggression.\n\nAnd we have also worked closely with our European partners to speak in a common way about how this undermines peace and security in Europe writ large.\n\nAnd we have also been clear with the PRC that we reserve the right to take action against particular companies and entities that we are -- believe are engaged in supporting Russia's war machine through the provision of inputs, whether it's industrial materials or microelectronics or UAV parts or whatever it may be.\n\nAnd we have put our money where our mouth is. We have already imposed sanctions on PRC entities. Today, we are doing more.\n\nBut, of course, we're not only focused on China. We're focused on the broad network of entities and individuals working to try to circumvent sanctions and get these inputs to Russia.\n\nAnd so, today's action is quite comprehensive in going after entities and individuals across multiple regions of the world.\n\nBut going forward, what the Treasury Department has shown today is that financial institutions from any country, including the PRC, that continue to fil- -- facilitate transactions with sanctioned Russian entities connected to the Russian defense industrial base, to the Russian war machine, they are now at risk -- at serious risk of running afoul of the Treasury Department and of falling under a sanctions regime.\n\nSo, we'll continue to consult with the PRC. We'll continue to make our views known.\n\nIn terms of their motivations or their perspective, I'll let them speak for themselves. It is difficult for me to speculate. What I can speak to is our clear position that we are going to take action to reduce the flow of material going to Russia, including from China. And today's action is a step in that direction.\n\nQ Jake, on -- on Gaza. In -- did you see anything in Hamas's response that you would consider to be a significant hurdle to an agreement? And in terms of a timetable, what are you looking at? Are -- you know, you obviously don't want a lot of haggling here, but what's a realistic timetable for a deal to be reached? Are we looking at a week? Two weeks? Three weeks?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: It's very difficult to ever predict the\n\ntempo or timing of a negotiation, especially a complex negotiation like this one -- especially a negotiation that has an indirect dimension to it. So, I will not be making any wagers on how long this will take.\n\nI'm also not going to characterize particular changes that Hamas has suggested. I think I want to let the mediators work together to try to figure out what is a way to bridge remaining gaps.\n\nI would point out that, in his remarks on May 31st, the President anticipated that Hamas would come back, they would suggest some changes, and that the important thing was that all parties sit at the table until -- the proverbial table here -- until we get to an agreement. That's what we're reinforcing today.\n\nWe believe that the time has come to get this done. We believe it can get done. But there are elements of what Hamas put forward that we don't think are consistent with what was laid out in the Security Council resolution. So, we'll have to work through that.\n\nQ Can -- can I just follow-up on the ceasefire, Jake? Has -- Benny Gantz was a key figure in the ceasefire negotiations. Has his exit complicated in any way the President's push for peace?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Israel stood behind the proposal that was provided in late May, through the mediators to Hamas, before Minister Gantz left the government. And Israel continues to stand behind it.\n\nAnd so, from our perspective, the key thing is the position of the Israeli government today, and the Israeli government has continued to stand behind the proposal.\n\nQ Could you clarify on the seized assets? I'm not sure if you can. But are they intended to be used for the war effort or for post-war in -- in sort of the rehabilitation of the country?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: So, first, the concept here is to pull forward the windfall profits from the seized assets so that you can have a substantial source of funding backed by the immobilized assets.\n\nSecond, the goal is not to wait until some indefinite point in the future. It's to provide the necessary resources to Ukraine now for its economic energy and other needs so that it's capable of having the resilience necessary to withstand Russia's continuing aggression.\n\nQ Jake, on --\n\nQ (Inaudible) numbers thrown around, including $50 billion. Some U.S. officials have said it could be more than that or less than that. Do you have a number in mind -- a target number in mind? Or is it up to the leader discussions?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: I do have a number in mind. I think the negotiations have a number in mind, but that's one I'll leave for further announcements if and when --\n\nQ Can you talk about the vehicle? I mean, there's been a couple of models proposed -- proposed here. One, this would be a loan to an entity that would then provide a grant to Ukraine. Is that the system that we're kind of narrowing in on?\n\nAnd, if so, are those loans individual from the contributor states? Or would a single G7 nation make that loan to the middle entity?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Again, I want to be careful not to get ahead of the negotiations. I think we are moving towards a common understanding of the mechanism. I'm not going to characterize it further now. But what I will say is that we expect the participation of multiple countries in this, not just one country.\n\nQ Sorry.\n\nQ Do -- do you think you can get around Congress with a -- that the CBO score will be low enough?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: We definitely are not going to, quote, \"get around Congress.\" We have no intention of doing that. Whatever we do will be consistent with the authorities Congress has given us.\n\nQ Do you think the executive authorities will be sufficient for whatever the CBO score is here?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: All I will say is we're not going to do anything that's inconsistent with -- with our authorities. And we will, of course, work hand in hand in consultation with Congress to ensure that everybody is on the same page on this.\n\nQ On the -- on the Russian asset, the vehicle -- like, the mechanism of dispersing the money to -- to Ukraine. Have you settled on a -- on any kind of a -- an administrator? Will it be the World Bank? Will it be some other organization that basically oversees the -- the disbursement of those funds? Because you wouldn't give larger -- like, the full amount wouldn't go to Ukraine at once, right?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: So, I guess my multiple efforts to -- (laughter) -- avoid frontrunning any agreements that may emerge over the course of the next couple of days are -- are going for naught right now.\n\nAll I -- (laughter) -- I'm going to try to row back into my zone of comfort.\n\nAll I will say is that we now have good experience using\n\nexternal mechanisms for the disbursement of funds. We have done it bilaterally. Other countries have done it. Those lessons will be relevant to how this plays out. And I will leave it at that.\n\nQ Is Prime Minister Modi is still expected to attend? And if so, can you walk us through the President's plans and whether the allegations with respect to the attempted killing on U.S. soil is sort of hanging over that? Is the President avoiding Prime Minister Modi or not? Are you satisfied with Indian cooperation so far?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: So, you know, we've made our views known on this issue, and it will be a continuing topic of dialogue between the U.S. and India, including at very senior levels.\n\nPresident Biden actually spoke with President Modi by phone while we were in Paris to congratulate him on the election outcome and on being named Prime Minister for a third term.\n\nHe expects to see Prime Minister Modi here. It's up to the Indians to formally confirm his attendance, but our -- our expectation is that the two of them will have the opportunity to encounter one another. What the nature of that encounter is is still fluid because so much of the schedule is fluid.\n\nQ Jake, on China.\n\nQ Does the President --\n\nQ Just to follow- -- sorry --\n\nQ Does the President expect tough conversations on Gaza from other leaders? I know there's unity behind -- G7 unity behind the ceasefire proposal. But there's split opinions about the ICC warrant on Netanyahu, for example.\n\nAnd on that note, today, the U.N. inquir- -- a U.N. inquiry found that both Hamas and Israel are guilty of war crimes and violating international law. If you can comment on that, please.\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: So, I haven't had a chance to read that report. I've just seen the headline. So, I'll refrain from comment until I can understand better what the substance of it is.\n\nIn terms of the question of what he expects the conversation to be like around Gaza, all of the G7 leaders that we have been consulting with in the run-up to Italy are focused on one thing overall: getting a ceasefire in place and getting the hostages home as part of that.\n\nThat is what is going to end the suffering. That is what is going to bring long-term security for Israel. That is what is going to get us to a day after so that both Israelis and Palestinians can live in peace, security, and dignity.\n\nSo, the President will be consulting with G7 leaders about the intensive efforts underway to make that happen. He has their full backing for what he is doing. He will have their encouragement, I believe, over the course of this time.\n\nAnd it's not just the G7 leaders now; it's countries across the world all speaking with one voice and saying, \"Let's get this deal done.\"\n\nPresident Biden is determined to use every ounce of effort to do that.\n\nQ Jake --\n\nQ On China. Just to follow up --\n\nQ Since you --\n\nQ So, you -- you're taking, you know, new steps to sort of express your frustration with China over the supplying of dual-use items and other continued things. There's also going to be some language, we understand, in terms of overcapacity, excess industrial capacity, and there's also some work to be done on -- on debt and the slow process of settling debt. China is, of course, the largest creditor to -- to many developing countries.\n\nIs this a moment where the G7 is -- is sort of squaring up and -- and taking stock of China's behavior? And, you know, what -- do you expect, sort of, a unified front despite the, you know, differences that might exist?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: You know, the communiqu\u00e9 in Hiroshima last year put it well when it said each country has its own distinctive approach to China, but we're united around a set of common principles, and we're also united around the proposition that we need to align and coordinate in dealing with some of the challenges that China's policies and practices pose to our economies and to our security.\n\nOvercapacity is one of those issues. The President has been vocal about that. Frankly, European countries have been vocal about that.\n\nThe President has taken action with respect to Chinese overcapacity, including the -- the 301 review announcements from a few weeks ago. Now Europe has taken action.\n\nSo, I do think you can expect to see a common framework around some of these issues emerging as part of the final text of the communiqu\u00e9. But I will leave that communiqu\u00e9 to speak for itself so that I'm not announcing every outcome here on the plane on the way over.\n\nQ Jake, it's two weeks since the President's decision to allow limited strikes into Russian territory around Kharkiv by the Ukrainians.\n\nWe've seen President Putin respond by saying he may place weapons that could hold some Western or NATO countries at risk. He didn't say where. He didn't say what kind. Have you seen any action in -- in response, other than what Putin and some of his aides have said?\n\nAnd can you explain what, if anything, they're doing around Cuba with this set of exercises?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: So, first, we've seen what President Putin and other Russian officials have said, and we'll continue to watch what they actually do as we go forward.\n\nSecond, our position here, we believe, is straightforward and commonsensical. Russians are launching attacks from one side of the border directly onto the other side of the border, and Ukraine ought to be able to fire back across that border so that Russia cannot just use the border as a way of gaining an advantage that allows them to take more Ukrainian territory. That, to us, is just pretty straightforward and common sense. And the change in policy came with it on the basis of a change in circumstance, which was this new front opened opposite the border in -- in Kharkiv Oblast.\n\nYour other question was about -- oh, Cuba. So, just to take a step back, we have seen these Russian naval deployments sailing into Cuba in the Bush administration, the Obama administration, the Trump administration, and now the Biden administration.\n\nIt's something we watch closely, carefully. It's something that we went out publicly on several days before it happened so the world would understand the context and the world would also know that we are watching. And so, we will see how this unfolds in the coming days.\n\nBut we have seen this kind of thing before, and we expect to see this kind of thing again. And I'm not going to read into any particular motives --\n\nQ But it looks the same --\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: -- by Russia.\n\nQ But it looks a lot like those previous exercises.\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: There are elements in this one that are different, that are distinct. But fundamentally, the notion that Russia takes a -- some of its Russian naval assets and does a port visit to Havana is something we have seen before.\n\nQ What is distinct here?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: One of the distinct things is -- I think we have gone out and explained is they have a submarine associated with this port visit that they have not had before. They also have similar capabilities on a surface ship that they have had before. So, for us --\n\nQ But they're transferring or emplacing any -- any missiles, anything like that?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: We have not seen anything like that, and the Cubans have gone out with their own statements reinforcing that that is not happening. Of course, we don't necessarily literally take the Cubans' word for it, but we, through our own means, have not seen anything to that extent and do not expect anything like that to occur.\n\nQ Jake --\n\nQ Can you say how --\n\nQ -- after the G7 wraps up, you're going to be going to Switzerland with the Vice President. What -- what's the level of optimism that that conference can -- can move the ball forward on Ukraine? And, like, you know, what -- what are you looking for at the end of that?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: We're looking for two things. One is for the maximum number of nations to sign up to what should be an indisputable proposition that any just peace has to be based on the U.N. Charter and the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the inviolability of orders that taking -- that taking territory by force is completely unacceptable. So, that would be a powerful outcome if we can achieve it.\n\nAnd then the other thing is practical support for Ukraine's efforts on issues like energy security, the return of abducted children, the security of nuclear plants in Ukraine. We'll work through some of those issues as well and hope to get some momentum from them.\n\nQ Do you have any --\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: I think we'll do one -- one more.\n\nQ Can you just comment quickly on this --\n\nQ Do you know why the Saudi's aren't coming?\n\nQ -- this --\n\nQ I'm sorry.\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: I'm sorry?\n\nQ Do you know why the Saudis aren't coming?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Pardon?\n\nQ MBS -- MBS isn't coming?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: I do not know why. No, I haven't had the chance to speak with them to understand that. So --\n\nQ Is that a disappointment in terms of maybe moving -- moving forward on --\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Well --\n\nQ -- the Middle East?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: -- we always welcome more countries, in- -- including influential countries like Saudi Arabia. But they haven't been to previous G7 summits, so this isn't unusual that they're not at this one.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right. Got to wrap it up.\n\nQ Can you comment really quickly between this on/off again deal between Iran and Russia -- this comprehensive security agreement?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: I -- I don't have any comment on it today. If I gain any greater insight or wisdom for you, I'll share it.\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: We continue to be concerned about the exchange of fire across the border. And we're particularly concerned about Hezbollah strikes that are aimed at civilian areas in Israel. It's something we're in close consultation with the Israelis on.\n\nLook, fundamentally, as the President said in his speech on May 31st, generating a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza can put us on a path to get calm on the border between Israel and Lebanon and ultimately an agreement that provides sufficient security assurances that people can return to their home safely. That's what we're driving for, and that's what we hope to achieve.\n\nQ A couple questions. First of all, can you tell us who from the President's family is with him on the trip? I think it's a couple of grandchildren, but I (inaudible).\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, what I can say: There are a number of family members traveling on this -- on this trip with the President. I don't have any names to share. But I can confirm -- and I think you've all seen it for yourselves -- there are family members traveling with him.\n\nQ And then, I know you read the statement at the beginning, but I wondered if you could say anything about how the President absorbed the news of his son's conviction.\n\nAnd then, also, he has said that he was -- he has ruled out pardoning his son, but I wondered about a commutation -- whether that would be something that would be on the table -- a commutation.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah, so, look, as I stated at the top, I don't have anything to say beyond -- to your first question -- beyond what the President's statement was yesterday. He has been very clear. We've been very clear. You know, he -- he loves his son. And he and the First Lady love their son, and they support their son.\n\nI just don't have anything -- certainly anything beyond that.\n\nWhat I will say is -- look, I -- I haven't spoken to the President about this since the verdict came out. And as we all know, the sentencing hasn't even been scheduled yet. But you saw the President do an interview just last week when he was in Normandy. And he was asked, you know, a question -- several questions -- a couple of questions about this. And he was very clear, very upfront, very -- obviously very definitive. And I just don't have anything -- he -- you have his w- -- own words. I just don't have anything beyond that.\n\nQ Can you explain (inaudible) --\n\nQ So, you're not ruling out that he would commute the sentence?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, what I'm saying is that the President -- the Pre- -- I have not spoken to the President about this. And what I'm saying is he was asked about a pardon. He was asked about -- he was asked about the trial specifically. And he answered it very clearly, very forthright.\n\nAs we know, the sentencing hasn't even been scheduled yet. I don't have anything beyond what the President said. He's been very clear about this.\n\nQ Can you just speak about the logistics of how much time he spent with Hunter, Karine? Because as I understand, when he went to Wilmington yesterday, Hunter went back to LA. And as far as we can figure out, the only time that they spent was on the tarmac. Is that accurate? I just --\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I -- I'm just not going to speak to the President's private time with the family. And I just don't have anything beyond the statement. The President and the First Lady support their son. They love their son. I'm not going to get into -- into time that he spent with his family. That's something that we never do, and I'm not going to do that today.\n\nQ And then -- and then on the -- if no one el- -- just on the -- on the summit side of it, Karine. If we can -- if you can talk a little bit about the -- the President's plans to meet the Pope and also any kind of --\n\nQ And if there's any bilats other than Meloni? And also any pull asides, maybe with her Erdo\u011fan or Modi?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: As you know, these things -- and I think Jake kind of said it -- they're kind of -- they're very dynamic. They're very in the moment. There's a lot that goes on at these summits. And so, if there is a -- a pull aside, if there's anything beyond what we've shared with you up to -- up to now, we certainly will share that.\n\nThese engagements, as you know, tend -- they come and go. And they -- and when they do, they happen very quickly. And obviously, they happen, you know, sometimes unexpectedly. So, if we have anything like that to share, we certainly will have a readout. We will let all of you know.\n\nAs the -- far as the Pope, don't have anything specific here to share at this moment. But, again, we will -- we have, you know, next 48 hours or so. I'm sure we'll have a lot of readouts and a lot of things to share with all of you --\n\nQ Karine --\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: -- as this is a very critically important summit.\n\nQ Is this -- are you thinking about this as being the President's -- potentially the President's last overseas trip in this term? Or is there still any discussion about Africa?\n\nOne of the core areas that the leaders will be talking about will be sustainability and development, and especially --\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.\n\nQ -- with an eye to Africa.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah. I think the President spoke to Africa, specifically, when he was asked. He said that he would love to do it, you know, in Febru- -- I think he may have even said in -- in February -- as early of next year. So, he's determined and wants to keep that commitment.\n\nAs you know, we had the Kenyan state visit. That went very well. And -- and there was a two-plus-two there.\n\nI just don't have anything beyond his schedule on -- on that particular question about going to Africa.\n\nAny additional scheduling, overseas OCONUS trips, obviously, we will let you know. I just don't have anything in the future to lay out for you at this time.\n\nQ Karine, does the White House have any reaction to the CPI report that just came out this morning? And -- and what does the President make of, you know, the expectation that the Fed may only do two rate cuts instead of three?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look -- and we've always been really clear about the Fed. They're independent. We do not comment on -- on the Fed. And we -- in this administration, we are very -- we are very committed to making sure that the Fed has the -- the space and the inte- -- independence to make those in- -- those monetary policy decisions. So, I don't have a comment on that.\n\nWhat I will say more broadly: We -- the President did put out -- we put out a statement from the President on the S- -- CPI. He understands and we always want to acknowledge where the American people are. We understand that they're struggling. We understand that there's more progress to be made.\n\nObviously, we welcome the news coming out of the CPI data. Inflation is down more than two thirds with the lowest core inflation since April 2021. Wages are rising faster than prices over the last year. And since the pandemic, 15.6 million jobs created. And unemployment at or below 4 poi- -- 4 poi- -- 4 percent for the longest stretch in 50 years.\n\nLook, the President has been really clear. He's from Scranton. He knows what it's like for families to sit around the kitchen table and make difficult decisions. That's why he's continuing to do everything that he can to lower costs.\n\nAnd there's a contrast. Republicans in Congress, they want to give a tax break to billionaires and -- and corporations. That's not where we are.\n\nWe want to continue to make sure that we give folks some health -- hel- -- some ease on healthcare, right? That's why we did the insulin ca- -- tapping -- capping insulin at 30 -- 35 bucks a month for our seniors who are paying hundreds and hundreds of dollars a month; making sure that Medicare is able to negotiate, which is something that the last administrations, many other administrations have tried to do and they couldn't and this administration has been able to do.\n\nSo, look, we know that there's more work to be done. We're going to continue to do that work to lower costs. But we obviously welcome the CPI data and the progress that we're making.\n\nQ Do you have any update on FDIC chair, the search for a --\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: No update on FDIC chair. Obviously, the President is going to nominate someone who he -- who -- as he does with every nominee, who has the experience and the respect in their field. And once we do that, we'll certainly share -- share that information. And we understand how important it is to have an FDIC chair in place. So, we're going to certainly stay very laser focused on getting that done.\n\nQ The President today got the endorsement of three major seniors groups. And I realize you can't talk about the campaign --\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Thank you for saying that in your question.\n\nQ (Laughs.) But -- but can you say anything about the President's agenda for a second term in terms of deepening the work to aid seniors? You mentioned --\n\nQ -- going forward as part of the fight against inflation but also for seniors?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah. No -- no, I appreciate the question. And I think that's really important. I've got to be really mindful not to speak about the 2024 election.\n\nBut to answer -- to -- to lean into your -- your question about the -- the second term, look, the President is going to continue to work on -- on behalf of the American people. That is what he's going to do.\n\nLowering costs -- obviously, as we talk about our -- his economic policy is at the center of that and continuing to do that. That's why the Inflation Reduction Act was so important, because it allows us to, yes, fight climate change by lowering costs on energy prices. Also, healthcare -- by lowering costs for 15 million Americans across the country that are going to see a lower cost -- 800 bucks lower a year. That's because of what this President has -- was able to do with only Democrats in Congress. Insulin -- I already talked about that -- for seniors capped at 35 bucks.\n\nI mean, there's -- there's a lot more work to be done.\n\nAnd -- and we see that -- we understand that -- that Americans are still struggling.\n\nBut we have seen some progress. And we want to continue that progress, whether it is creating more jobs, making sure that unemployment continues to be low -- it's a 50 -- a 50-year low, as we -- as we know. And so, we're going to be pretty consistent on doing that.\n\nHealthcare, climate change, lowering costs across the board -- that is going to be pretty consistent with what we do.\n\nQ -- about just another summit session tomorrow, which is the Partnership for Ini- --\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.\n\nQ You know what I mean. The PGI.\n\nAnyway, this is something that's very important for the President. He launched it as \"Build Back Better World\" in G7 Cornwall. How close is the G7 to reaching the goal of $600 billion by 2027?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.\n\nQ I mean, as I understand, this is also the President's second-term goal --\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.\n\nQ -- that Jake mentioned to provide more resources to developing countries.\n\nAnd then, just on a logistics note, we don't see the President attending the dinner for tomorrow, the G7 dinner, if you can explain why.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, it's going to be a jam-packed two days. Just starting with your last question first. There's going to be a lot of meetings happening, a lot of\n\nsessions, as you know.\n\nAnd so, the President is certainly going to be engaged for the -- the two days -- or two -- two -- two and a half days that he is in Italy at the G7. So, I wouldn't read too much into him not going to one dinner.\n\nThe President is going to be engaged with the leaders of the G7. And you all will see that and hear from us on that.\n\nAs it relates to initiative -- yes, this is an initiative that the President started himself. It is -- it is something that he's proud of. We will have more to share. I know Jake talked about that in -- a little bit at the top. I don't have anything more as to the second -- second stage of this. But we will have more to share, so stay tuned.\n\nBut -- but, yeah, this is a President that's come -- when he comes to these things, you see his leadership o- -- on the world stage. These are incredibly important engagement with these world leaders. And -- and so -- and he -- it -- there will be no lack of engagement. There will be full engagement with this President, as he continues to do so in -- in all of these OCONUSs trip, as you guys have covered.\n\nI think you -- do you have something?\n\nQ Thank you. I have two quick questions. Sorry, the first one is on Hunter. Where was the President yesterday when the verdict came down? Can you just give us a little bit of color about where he was or if someone from the White House notified him?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: What's your second question as well?\n\nQ If just -- if they -- if someone had to notify him or he was watching coverage. Yeah.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I mean, look, I'm just not going to go dive into any specifics here. I'm just not going to do that from here. You know, this is -- this is about his -- his family. This is about his son, who he loves and obviously supports.\n\nI -- I know these questions are going to come a million different ways. As I've said before when I've been asked about this, we're just going to be very consistent, stick to the statement that he put out. And I'm just going to leave it there.\n\nSorry. I have another one on the border, the executive actions last week. Over -- like, over the last 24 hours, there have been a number of reports about suspected terrorists at ports of entry and then also a sting operation where suspected ISIS terrorists were collected throughout the United States. Do you guys believe so far that the executive actions are working, or is there going to be another announcement down the line with more to do?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, a couple of things. DOJ, H- -- DOJ, DHS put out a joint statement. So, I would refer you to that statement on that particular question that you just asked me about those eight in- -- I believe there were eight individuals.\n\nSo -- and we are also grateful for the law enforcement for their quick -- quick work on this to make sure that we keep Americans safe.\n\nThis is another example of why we think some calls from Republicans to defund the FBI is -- is a bad idea, is troublesome. And so, we'll continue to call that out as well.\n\nBut, again, DHS and DOJ put out a statement, so I -- a joint statement, so I would refer you to that.\n\nAs it relates to the executive -- the executive action the President did last week, look, just to take a step back just for a second -- like, this is a president that has taken the issue of what we're seeing at the border, the immigration\n\nsystem being broken very seriously -- I mean, very, very seriously.\n\nThat's why he put out a comprehensive legislation on day one. That's why he worked with senators -- both Republicans and Democrats -- for a couple of months to bring forth a -- a plan, a policy that he wants to sign. He wanted them to move forward with it, and Republicans rejected their own plan.\n\nAnd so, he wants to see a bipartisan solution here, but that didn't happen. As you noted, he took an executive action.\n\nAs it relates to any impact of those actions, we're still early in the implementation phase. But we -- we look at this in its totality, when it comes to actions -- just the actions that we took this year as well. And so, it's including our work with international partners like Mexico.\n\nEn- -- encounters are down more than 50 percent from December. So, however, we understand that migration flows are dynamic, and we'll continue to -- to surge resources and personnel to the areas that need them.\n\nBut the President, again, wants to do this in a bipartisan way. He believes this the best way to deal with this broken system -- a system that's been broken for decades -- is to have both sides come together and have a legislative answer to this.\n\nQ Can you share any outreach from the White House to progressives that were frustrated by the actions announced last week?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, what I can say to you is that our office, the -- our Office of Leg Affairs is -- is consistently and constantly engaging with legislators, both on the House and the Senate, in both chambers, on -- on an array of issues, including immigration.\n\nAnd you saw us -- I mean, you saw us for months -- you saw our team -- for months, the President directed his team to reach out to senators, both De- -- Democrats and Republicans.\n\nAnd so, we have be- -- we've been in the -- in the process as well. Right? We've gotten our hands dirty in this in a sense of getting to work and trying to find a solution. And there is one. There is one. Republicans rejected because of the former President saying that it would hurt him and help Joe Biden.\n\nAnd those are -- tho- -- and that's what you all have reported, is what I'm repeating here.\n\nQ Can you say a word or two about what the President will be doing in L.A.? Is it just solely a campaign event or is there any official business?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I would -- it's campaign. And so, I would refer you to the campaign. It's go- -- he'll only be doing campaign events. But that's for the campaign to speak to.\n\nQ And he'll --\n\nQ (Inaudible) any consideration to having the President just stay in Europe after the D-Day and France state visit? You -- he's gone across the Atlantic -- he will have done, basically, four crossings in 10 days, which is tough, even if you're not 81. So -- (laughs) --\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I mean, look, the President -- and most presidents -- have a jam-packed schedule. He came back for two really important events. One is Juneteenth, a holiday that he helped create it, signed into law, which -- which, you know, is a -- we believe is important holiday to -- to honor and to commem- -- commemorate. You all saw the President attend that event.\n\nHe also spoke about an issue that really truly matters --\n\nQ (Inaudible.)\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: -- guns. Look, gun violence -- guns is -- is an epidemic in our country, the number one killer of our children. And so, for him to come out -- come back and talk about these two incredibly domestic issues -- right? -- I think is important.\n\nThe President's schedule is jam-packed. It is. There is a lot to be done on behalf of the American people.\n\nBut the President is -- is looking forward to the G7. Important -- it's going to be an important summit to talk an a- -- about an array of issues -- that you heard Jake talk through -- that's going out currently right now.\n\nAnd so, look, you know, again, the President has -- this is a president that is able to do foreign policy matters, dealing with that, and also domestic issues as well that matter to the American people.\n\nWe know that the gun issue, for example, is one of the important, top issues that Americans really care about. It affects many communities across the country.\n\nQ Karine, what do you think the President is going to say -- a lot of, you know, other foreign leaders have expressed -- you know, are anticipating or -- or have expressed concern that potentially President -- former President Trump could be reelected and what the implications would be. What is the President's message going to be to other leaders?\n\nHe often talks about, you know, going to that first G7 meeting and saying, \"America is back.\" As the election nears, the polls are not clear. It's very much neck and neck. Is he going with any kind of a message --\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.\n\nQ -- to the leaders about the o- -- you know, about -- I realize you can't say --\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: No, I appreciate the question, and I get the question, especially in the year that we're in. I have to be super mindful and not -- and not speak to any question that alludes to, obviously, an election that's coming up in a couple of months. So, going to be super, super mindful.\n\nWhat I will say more broadly -- and I know you all -- some of you traveled with us when he -- he went to Normandy and visited the beaches of Normandy, an 80 a- -- 80-year anniversary of D-Day. And you heard the -- the President talk about the importance of our alliances and our (inaudible) partnership and how, you know, it is important that we fight for democracy and our freedom, because it matters for all of us.\n\nAnd so, you saw the President. It was incredibly powerful what he said on that Thursday speech and also the Friday remarks. And I think that is a show of what this President believes in. And so, I'm going to leave that there.\n\nAnd then, you'll see the President goes to the G7, another important opportunity to engage with our allies and partners on what's going on globally in the world. Right?\n\nQ I mean, this is a topic that has taken more urgency, particularly after the European Parliament elections, where we see a surge of support for far-right parties. So, we assume that this will be a topic of discussion among leaders, especially with France holding snap elections; Germany, Olaf Scholz also weakened.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.\n\nQ And I think yesterday John Kirby told me that the President is confident that Ursula von der Leyen will be selected again for another term. But I just wanted to get an understanding of the President's head when he's speaking with leaders about the potential rise of far -- potential rise of far-right parties on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, a couple of things. I do want to speak to the EU election results. I'm not sure if my NSC colleagues were able to talk about it in detail, but I'll say here on the record.\n\nSo, we congratulate the millions of citizens across the European Union's 27 member states who cast ballots in European Parliament elections. The successful administration and conclusion of these elections is a good example of democracy and democratic institutions for the world to see.\n\nSo, I'm not going to comment on election results themselves since we do not involve ourselves in the domestic politics of our allies and partners.\n\nI will say that we have worked closely together with the EU to address global challenges and advance our national security interests, such as supporting Ukraine and holding Russia accountable for its actions on trade and other many issues. We certainly expect all of that, as we talked about the EU and our relationship and how we move forward, to continue.\n\nAnd so, look, I -- you know, I'm not going to get into every specific state and their elections. But we believe that our relationship -- that relationship we -- that we have with the EU is going to continue.\n\nI'm going to be, again, very mindful on coming into any speculation or hypotheticals here, especially as it relates to elections coming up this year.\n\nAll right.\n\nQ Do you have any names of CEOs that he's meeting with? We reported that there's, like, a CEO session with him and Meloni.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: We'll probably have more to share with you later. I don't have anything right now.", "source": {"uri": "whitehouse.gov", "dataType": "news", "title": "The White House"}, "authors": [{"uri": "white_house@whitehouse.gov", "name": "White House", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Sullivan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jake Sullivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microelectronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microelectronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Science", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Master of Science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

(Kyodo) -- Leaders of the Group of Seven countries are \"on the verge of a good outcome\" over how to financially support Ukraine and are more unified than ever on key global issues, including China's

Moscow's invasion.\n\n\"We see proceeds from these assets as being a valuable source of resources for Ukraine at a moment when Russia continues to brutalize the country, not just through military

united front in dealing with geopolitical crises and critical challenges related to the global economy.\n\nHe said the challenges include China's industrial overcapacity and welcomed the European

EDT\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Okay. I have two things at the top, and then I'll hand it over to Jake Sullivan.\n\nSo, tomorrow, Senate Democrats will introduce a bill that would safeguard access to IVF for families across the country.\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration strongly supports protecting access to IVF. Americans should have the right to make deeply personal decisions about their health, lives, and families, but that fundamental right is under re- -- relentless attack.\n\nIt has been nearly two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. What followed has been nothing short of devastating.\n\nSince Roe was overturned, Republican elected officials have implemented 21 extreme state abortion bans. One out of three women of reproductive age now live in a state with an abortion ban. In nearly all these states, doctors could be charged with a felony for simply doing their jobs. Contraception is under attack. Just last week, Senate Republicans blocked a bill that would guarantee the right for women to access contraception. And IVF is under attack.\n\nAbout one in five American women struggle with infertility, and many rely on IVF. This is a basic issue of reproductive freedom.\n\nPresident Biden believes that women must have the freedom to make deeply personal healthcare decisions, including the right to decide if and when to start or grow their family.\n\nWe are committed to protecting access to reproductive care and will continue to urge Congress to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade into federal law.\n\nAnd finally, in anticipation of your questions, I just want to read the President's statement from yesterday. And it reads:\n\n\"As I said last week, I am the President, but I am also a dad. Jill an- -- Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today. So many families who have had loved ones battle addiction understand the feeling of pride seeing someone you love come out the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery. As I also said last week, I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal. Jill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that.\"\n\nEnd quote. And from that, I don't have anything beyond the statement that the President put out yesterday, as I just read through.\n\nBut right now, I do have Jake Sullivan, our National Security Advisor. He's going to -- he's going to discuss our strong support for Ukraine and -- for Ukraine now and in the -- into the future as we head into the G7 in the upcoming hours.\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Thank you.\n\nQ Hey, Jake.\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Hey, guys. How are you?\n\nSo, the President is looking forward to seeing his fellow G7 leaders as well as the leaders of a number of guest countries over the course of the next couple of days.\n\nAs you guys have all seen, it's going to be an action-packed schedule. And we did a background briefing on this yesterday, so you got a good laydown of what the agenda looks like and the main issues.\n\nBefore I talk about a couple of specific issues relevant to the G7, I just wanted to make a couple of comments about the ongoing effort to secure a ceasefire and hostage deal.\n\nSo, we're continuing to work for a ceasefire along the lines of the May 27th Israeli proposal, as outlined in President Biden's speech on May 31st. The proposal has been endorsed by the G7, by countries around the world. It was then supported this week by a U.N. Security Council resolution.\n\nHamas has now submitted a response to that proposal, and we have now reviewed its contents. Many of the proposed changes are minor and not unanticipated. Others differ more substantively from what was outlined in the U.N. Security Council resolution.\n\nThe United States will now work with the mediators, specifically Egypt and Qatar, to bridge final gaps consistent with the President's May 31st speech and with the contents of the U.N. Security Council resolution.\n\nOur aim is to bring this process to a conclusion. Our view is that the time for haggling is over. It's time for a ceasefire to begin and for the hostages to come home.\n\nAnd I know, as I said before, that you've already gotten a preview, so I'm not going to go into details on individual sessions.\n\nI did want to take some time before turning to your questions to discuss what will be a big focus for us on the first day on the ground.\n\nTomorrow, President Biden and President Zelenskyy will sit down to discuss our strong support for Ukraine now and into the future.\n\nFollowing that meeting, the leaders will sign a bilateral security agreement making clear our support will last long into the future and pledging continued cooperation, particularly in the defense and security space.\n\nYou all will recall that in July of '23, just under a year ago, at the Vilnius Summit, President Biden organized the G7 around a joint declaration of support for Ukraine that highlighted our commitment to pursue these security agreements.\n\nOur G7 partners have done so. Another 25 countries have actually signed on to that joint declaration. Many of them have also done these security agreements.\n\nSo, we announced last year that each country would essentially commit to negotiate a long-term bilateral security arrangement with Ukraine. At this point, 15 countries have signed their agreements, and I'm pleased to share that our negotiations with Ukraine have concluded and we'll sign this agreement tomorrow.\n\nOur goal here is straightforward. We want to demonstrate that the U.S. supports the people of Ukraine, that we stand with them, and that we'll continue to help address their security needs not just tomorrow but out into the future.\n\nIn the agreement, which we will share with all of you later this week, we outline a clear vision of work with our allies and partners, with Ukraine in order to continue to strengthen Ukraine's credible defense and deterrence capability. Any lasting peace in Ukraine has to be underwritten by Ukraine's own ability to defend itself and deter future aggression.\n\nAnd by signing this, we'll also be sending Russia a signal of our resolve. If Vladimir Putin thinks that he can outlast the coalition supporting Ukraine, he's wrong. He just cannot wait us out, and this agreement will show our resolve and continued commitment.\n\nThrough this commitment, we're also securing commit- -- through this agreement, we're also securing commitments from Ukraine on reforms and on end-use monitoring for weapons we provide.\n\nAnd in deepening cooperation with Ukraine, our government will benefit from Ukraine's insights and experience, its battlefield innovations, and its lessons learned from the front.\n\nOur view is that Ukraine's security is central to Europe's security and therefore central to America's security.\n\nSo, this agreement, together with the mutually reinforcing security agreements from a broad and powerful network of countries, provides a pathway to a stable, independent, democratic, and secure Ukraine.\n\nYou'll hear more about this tomorrow, but I want to share two final notes.\n\nFirst, we're explicit in the agreement that we intend to work with Congress over the coming months to find a path to sustainable resources for Ukraine. And finally, this agreement covers the kind of support that Ukraine has sought as it bravely defends its freedom.\n\nThey have asked for our weapons and assistance as they fight to defend their territory. They have not asked our forces to join the fight. So, this agreement does not include any commitment to using our own forces to defend Ukraine. It is a pledge that we will ensure Ukraine can defend itself today and deter future aggression as well, as the President said last year.\n\nFinally -- and thank you for bearing with me -- today, we've announced sweeping new measures to intensify the pressure on Russia. These actions will ratchet up the risk that foreign financial institutions take by dealing with Russia's war economy.\n\nThe Department of Treasury is making clear that foreign banks risk being sanctioned for dealing with any entity or individual blocked under our Russia sanctions, including designated Russian banks.\n\nTreasury and Commerce are also issuing complimentary prohibitions to restrict the ability of Russia's defense industrial base to take advantage of access to certain U.S. software or IT services. And Commerce is announcing steps to more aggressively target transhipment to Russia of U.S.-branded items, regardless of where those items are produced, and a new measure to crackdown on diversion through shell companies.\n\nWe're imposing around 300 new sanctions and Entity List additions of specific companies or individuals. And the targets for those include Russian financial infrastructure, including major non-bank entities that help Russia finance its war effort and evade sanctions; entities and individuals across multiple evasion and foreign procurement networks, like networks that support Russia's UAV production, gold laundering, and procurement of sensitive items like anti-UAV equipment, machine tools, industrial materials, and micro- -- microelectronics.\n\nThe foreign targets include more than two dozen PRC entities and individuals and additional targets across multiple other third countries in multiple regions -- in East Asia, the Middle East, Europe, Africa, Central Asia, and the Caribbean.\n\nThey include Russia domestic war economy targets, including entities across the defense and related materiel transportation and technology sectors. They include future energy, metals, and mining revenue generation targets and areas such as future LNG projects, future coal and oil projects, and gold smuggling.\n\nAnd we're also targeting additional Russian elites, including those involved in the deportation and so-called reeducation of Ukrainian children.\n\nAltogether, these actions heighten the risk for financial institutions dealing with Russia's war economy, close down avenues for evasion while diminishing Russia's ability to benefit from access to foreign technology, equipment, software, and I- -- IT services.\n\nAnd you'll see from the President tomorrow that our commitment to Ukraine will continue and we will show our resolve through the specific actions we are taking and through close coordination with all of our partners.\n\nThe final thing I will just note is that discussions continue on the ground in Puglia on unlocking the proceeds of the Russian sovereign assets. We consider those discussions constructive, productive, driving forward.\n\nI don't have anything to announce to you today, but I believe that we are making good progress in generating an outcome in which those proceeds from those frozen assets can be put to good use.\n\nAnd with that --\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Go ahead, Colleen.\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: -- thank you for your patience.\n\nQ Can you confirm the U.S. has sent another Patriot missile system to Ukraine? And will -- can we expect additional weapons, then, to be part of the security agreement going forward?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: The security agreement doesn't announce the delivery of particular weapon systems. It sets a frame for the kind of ongoing cooperation that we've had with Ukraine over the past two years, including in identified areas like air defense.\n\nI can't confirm because I'm not here to make any announcements on particular air defense capabilities today. I will tell you that it has been a top priority of President Biden to get more air defense systems to Ukraine. And if and when we have announcements on that, we'll be sure to let you know.\n\nQ Jake --\n\nQ Jake, on the -- on the ceasefire discussions. There are reports -- we have -- we have reports that Hamas is asking for written assurances from the United States of a permanent ceasefire. Can you say what the U.S. position is on that and whether you think that is possible to -- to move this process forward and -- and --\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: I have not heard that specific Hamas request today. Obviously, this is a fast-moving situation. And also, there's a lot of different Hamas voices. So, we'll await consultation with Egypt and Qatar, who speak through an authoritative channel with Hamas. And then we'll make our determinations about the best way to deliver this ceasefire and hostage deal consistent with what the President laid out and what the Security Council resolution laid out.\n\nQ And, Jake, on the Russian frozen asset. Can you -- I know you said you don't want to talk anymore. But is the expectation for a clear, detailed plan of the terms or a framework for further discussion? And is the amount still $50 billion? And will it be signed by G7 or just some members?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: This is a leaders' declaration. Anything that we do with respect to Russian sovereign assets is not going to lay out every detail because we need our technical experts to work through it. What we are working towards is a framework that is not generic, that is quite specific in terms of -- of what it would entail.\n\nBut, of course, the core operational details of anything that is agreed in Italy will then have to be worked through, and the leaders would give direction to the experts to work that through on a defined timeframe, again, if and when we're prepared to announce something on this.\n\nQ Jake, two questions. First on the agreement that you're planning to do with the Ukrainians. So, last -- at the NATO summit in Vilnius, there was a lot of early discussion about this, mostly as a substitute for rapid entry into -- into NATO. And there was discussion of using the -- the Israel model here, which, of course, with Congress is a 10-year-long commitment for a certain amount of funding and then -- and then security commitments.\n\nCan you compare what you're about to go announce here to what we do with Israel? And would you compare it, as well, to the agreement that President Bush reached that announced secur- -- security arrangements for Ukraine with Britain, with Russia, in fact, you know, 20 years ago when --\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Are you talking about the Budapest Memorandum?\n\nQ (Inaudible.)\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: I believe that was in the 1990s --\n\nQ It was (inaudible) --\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: -- following --\n\nQ That's right.\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: -- the -- the breakup of the Soviet (inaudible) --\n\nQ It was very vague and, of course, has left the Ukrainians with a bit of a bitter feeling in their mouths for -- understandably.\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Obviously, that document came in a totally different context at a totally different time. This document comes on the foundation of two years of the U.S. supplying substantial resources, military assistance, intelligence, economic support. And it essentially projects continued backing of Ukraine's capacity to defend itself and deter future aggression.\n\nWith respect to comparing it to other models, I would call this the Ukraine model. It does not include specific dollar figures. It includes a commitment to work with Congress on sustainable funding going forward, which we will do. And it lays out a framework for how we work with Ukraine and with other allies and partners to ensure Ukraine has what it needs in terms of the physical capacity as well as the intelligence and other capacities to be able to defend itself effectively and to deter Russia.\n\nThe other thing that I would say about the document that's very important is that it is part of a latticework of other agreements, where the whole will end up being greater than the sum of its parts because it will be a broad range of nations all working together to reinforce the same types of support for the same purposes.\n\nFinally, with respect to the question of how it relates to NATO, at Vilnius last year, the NATO Joint Statement signed on to by all Allies, including the United States, said that Ukraine's future is in NATO, and it said that Allies would be in a position to give an invitation to Ukraine to join NATO when conditions are met and all Allies agree.\n\nWhen the President went out and described the process leading to this bilateral security agreement, he said this would be a bridge from now to Ukraine's ultimate membership in NATO when conditions are met and all Allies agree.\n\nThat bridge involves us helping Ukraine have the capacity that it needs for its own security and for sustaining -- sustaining its own sovereignty and territorial integrity. So, that's how they link together.\n\nYou'll see that in the text of the document, as you've seen it in the text of other bilateral security agreements that have been signed by other countries.\n\nQ And on the sanctions that you mentioned. As you noted, a good number of them are -- are noted -- are directed at the PRC. Some of your colleagues have made the point that support with dual-use technology for the PRC has really surged in the past six or eight months.\n\nWhat do you see as the Chinese strategy here? Are they viewing this differently than they did a year ago? Are they holding to the kind of warnings that you gave them at Riverside when the President discussed support for Russia with Xi Jinping and urged him not to provide weapons or technology?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: So, we have made clear our concerns to the PRC about the supply of certain dual-use capabilities to Russia that are being used in the Russian war machine to slaughter Ukrainians and to back an illegal war of aggression.\n\nAnd we have also worked closely with our European partners to speak in a common way about how this undermines peace and security in Europe writ large.\n\nAnd we have also been clear with the PRC that we reserve the right to take action against particular companies and entities that we are -- believe are engaged in supporting Russia's war machine through the provision of inputs, whether it's industrial materials or microelectronics or UAV parts or whatever it may be.\n\nAnd we have put our money where our mouth is. We have already imposed sanctions on PRC entities. Today, we are doing more.\n\nBut, of course, we're not only focused on China. We're focused on the broad network of entities and individuals working to try to circumvent sanctions and get these inputs to Russia.\n\nAnd so, today's action is quite comprehensive in going after entities and individuals across multiple regions of the world.\n\nBut going forward, what the Treasury Department has shown today is that financial institutions from any country, including the PRC, that continue to fil- -- facilitate transactions with sanctioned Russian entities connected to the Russian defense industrial base, to the Russian war machine, they are now at risk -- at serious risk of running afoul of the Treasury Department and of falling under a sanctions regime.\n\nSo, we'll continue to consult with the PRC. We'll continue to make our views known.\n\nIn terms of their motivations or their perspective, I'll let them speak for themselves. It is difficult for me to speculate. What I can speak to is our clear position that we are going to take action to reduce the flow of material going to Russia, including from China. And today's action is a step in that direction.\n\nQ Jake, on -- on Gaza. In -- did you see anything in Hamas's response that you would consider to be a significant hurdle to an agreement? And in terms of a timetable, what are you looking at? Are -- you know, you obviously don't want a lot of haggling here, but what's a realistic timetable for a deal to be reached? Are we looking at a week? Two weeks? Three weeks?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: It's very difficult to ever predict the\n\ntempo or timing of a negotiation, especially a complex negotiation like this one -- especially a negotiation that has an indirect dimension to it. So, I will not be making any wagers on how long this will take.\n\nI'm also not going to characterize particular changes that Hamas has suggested. I think I want to let the mediators work together to try to figure out what is a way to bridge remaining gaps.\n\nI would point out that, in his remarks on May 31st, the President anticipated that Hamas would come back, they would suggest some changes, and that the important thing was that all parties sit at the table until -- the proverbial table here -- until we get to an agreement. That's what we're reinforcing today.\n\nWe believe that the time has come to get this done. We believe it can get done. But there are elements of what Hamas put forward that we don't think are consistent with what was laid out in the Security Council resolution. So, we'll have to work through that.\n\nAnd I think, for today, I'm -- I'm best leaving it at that.\n\nQ Can you --\n\nQ Can -- can I just follow-up on the ceasefire, Jake? Has -- Benny Gantz was a key figure in the ceasefire negotiations. Has his exit complicated in any way the President's push for peace?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Israel stood behind the proposal that was provided in late May, through the mediators to Hamas, before Minister Gantz left the government. And Israel continues to stand behind it.\n\nAnd so, from our perspective, the key thing is the position of the Israeli government today, and the Israeli government has continued to stand behind the proposal.\n\nQ Could you clarify on the seized assets? I'm not sure if you can. But are they intended to be used for the war effort or for post-war in -- in sort of the rehabilitation of the country?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: So, first, the concept here is to pull forward the windfall profits from the seized assets so that you can have a substantial source of funding backed by the immobilized assets.\n\nSecond, the goal is not to wait until some indefinite point in the future. It's to provide the necessary resources to Ukraine now for its economic energy and other needs so that it's capable of having the resilience necessary to withstand Russia's continuing aggression.\n\nQ Jake, on --\n\nQ (Inaudible) numbers thrown around, including $50 billion. Some U.S. officials have said it could be more than that or less than that. Do you have a number in mind -- a target number in mind? Or is it up to the leader discussions?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: I do have a number in mind. I think the negotiations have a number in mind, but that's one I'll leave for further announcements if and when --\n\nQ Should we not be using \"50\" in our stories right now?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: (Inaudible) announcements to come.\n\nQ Can you --\n\nQ Can you talk about the vehicle? I mean, there's been a couple of models proposed -- proposed here. One, this would be a loan to an entity that would then provide a grant to Ukraine. Is that the system that we're kind of narrowing in on?\n\nAnd, if so, are those loans individual from the contributor states? Or would a single G7 nation make that loan to the middle entity?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Again, I want to be careful not to get ahead of the negotiations. I think we are moving towards a common understanding of the mechanism. I'm not going to characterize it further now. But what I will say is that we expect the participation of multiple countries in this, not just one country.\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nQ Jake, on the -- on the Russian Assets --\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nQ On the Russian assests --\n\nQ Sorry. Sorry, could I just finish?\n\nQ Sorry.\n\nQ Do -- do you think you can get around Congress with a -- that the CBO score will be low enough?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: We definitely are not going to, quote, \"get around Congress.\" We have no intention of doing that. Whatever we do will be consistent with the authorities Congress has given us.\n\nQ Do you think the executive authorities will be sufficient for whatever the CBO score is here?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: All I will say is we're not going to do anything that's inconsistent with -- with our authorities. And we will, of course, work hand in hand in consultation with Congress to ensure that everybody is on the same page on this.\n\nQ On the -- on the Russian asset, the vehicle -- like, the mechanism of dispersing the money to -- to Ukraine. Have you settled on a -- on any kind of a -- an administrator? Will it be the World Bank? Will it be some other organization that basically oversees the -- the disbursement of those funds? Because you wouldn't give larger -- like, the full amount wouldn't go to Ukraine at once, right?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: So, I guess my multiple efforts to -- (laughter) -- avoid frontrunning any agreements that may emerge over the course of the next couple of days are -- are going for naught right now.\n\nAll I -- (laughter) -- I'm going to try to row back into my zone of comfort.\n\nAll I will say is that we now have good experience using\n\nexternal mechanisms for the disbursement of funds. We have done it bilaterally. Other countries have done it. Those lessons will be relevant to how this plays out. And I will leave it at that.\n\nQ Is Prime Minister Modi is still expected to attend? And if so, can you walk us through the President's plans and whether the allegations with respect to the attempted killing on U.S. soil is sort of hanging over that? Is the President avoiding Prime Minister Modi or not? Are you satisfied with Indian cooperation so far?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: So, you know, we've made our views known on this issue, and it will be a continuing topic of dialogue between the U.S. and India, including at very senior levels.\n\nPresident Biden actually spoke with President Modi by phone while we were in Paris to congratulate him on the election outcome and on being named Prime Minister for a third term.\n\nHe expects to see Prime Minister Modi here. It's up to the Indians to formally confirm his attendance, but our -- our expectation is that the two of them will have the opportunity to encounter one another. What the nature of that encounter is is still fluid because so much of the schedule is fluid.\n\nQ Jake, on China.\n\nQ Does the President --\n\nQ Just to follow- -- sorry --\n\nQ Does the President expect tough conversations on Gaza from other leaders? I know there's unity behind -- G7 unity behind the ceasefire proposal. But there's split opinions about the ICC warrant on Netanyahu, for example.\n\nAnd on that note, today, the U.N. inquir- -- a U.N. inquiry found that both Hamas and Israel are guilty of war crimes and violating international law. If you can comment on that, please.\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: So, I haven't had a chance to read that report. I've just seen the headline. So, I'll refrain from comment until I can understand better what the substance of it is.\n\nIn terms of the question of what he expects the conversation to be like around Gaza, all of the G7 leaders that we have been consulting with in the run-up to Italy are focused on one thing overall: getting a ceasefire in place and getting the hostages home as part of that.\n\nThat is what is going to end the suffering. That is what is going to bring long-term security for Israel. That is what is going to get us to a day after so that both Israelis and Palestinians can live in peace, security, and dignity.\n\nSo, the President will be consulting with G7 leaders about the intensive efforts underway to make that happen. He has their full backing for what he is doing. He will have their encouragement, I believe, over the course of this time.\n\nAnd it's not just the G7 leaders now; it's countries across the world all speaking with one voice and saying, \"Let's get this deal done.\"\n\nPresident Biden is determined to use every ounce of effort to do that.\n\nQ Jake --\n\nQ On China. Just to follow up --\n\nQ Since you --\n\nQ So, you -- you're taking, you know, new steps to sort of express your frustration with China over the supplying of dual-use items and other continued things. There's also going to be some language, we understand, in terms of overcapacity, excess industrial capacity, and there's also some work to be done on -- on debt and the slow process of settling debt. China is, of course, the largest creditor to -- to many developing countries.\n\nIs this a moment where the G7 is -- is sort of squaring up and -- and taking stock of China's behavior? And, you know, what -- do you expect, sort of, a unified front despite the, you know, differences that might exist?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: You know, the communiqu\u00e9 in Hiroshima last year put it well when it said each country has its own distinctive approach to China, but we're united around a set of common principles, and we're also united around the proposition that we need to align and coordinate in dealing with some of the challenges that China's policies and practices pose to our economies and to our security.\n\nOvercapacity is one of those issues. The President has been vocal about that. Frankly, European countries have been vocal about that.\n\nThe President has taken action with respect to Chinese overcapacity, including the -- the 301 review announcements from a few weeks ago. Now Europe has taken action.\n\nSo, I do think you can expect to see a common framework around some of these issues emerging as part of the final text of the communiqu\u00e9. But I will leave that communiqu\u00e9 to speak for itself so that I'm not announcing every outcome here on the plane on the way over.\n\nQ Jake, it's two weeks since the President's decision to allow limited strikes into Russian territory around Kharkiv by the Ukrainians.\n\nWe've seen President Putin respond by saying he may place weapons that could hold some Western or NATO countries at risk. He didn't say where. He didn't say what kind. Have you seen any action in -- in response, other than what Putin and some of his aides have said?\n\nAnd can you explain what, if anything, they're doing around Cuba with this set of exercises?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: So, first, we've seen what President Putin and other Russian officials have said, and we'll continue to watch what they actually do as we go forward.\n\nSecond, our position here, we believe, is straightforward and commonsensical. Russians are launching attacks from one side of the border directly onto the other side of the border, and Ukraine ought to be able to fire back across that border so that Russia cannot just use the border as a way of gaining an advantage that allows them to take more Ukrainian territory. That, to us, is just pretty straightforward and common sense. And the change in policy came with it on the basis of a change in circumstance, which was this new front opened opposite the border in -- in Kharkiv Oblast.\n\nYour other question was about -- oh, Cuba. So, just to take a step back, we have seen these Russian naval deployments sailing into Cuba in the Bush administration, the Obama administration, the Trump administration, and now the Biden administration.\n\nIt's something we watch closely, carefully. It's something that we went out publicly on several days before it happened so the world would understand the context and the world would also know that we are watching. And so, we will see how this unfolds in the coming days.\n\nBut we have seen this kind of thing before, and we expect to see this kind of thing again. And I'm not going to read into any particular motives --\n\nQ But it looks the same --\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: -- by Russia.\n\nQ But it looks a lot like those previous exercises.\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: There are elements in this one that are different, that are distinct. But fundamentally, the notion that Russia takes a -- some of its Russian naval assets and does a port visit to Havana is something we have seen before.\n\nQ What is distinct here?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: One of the distinct things is -- I think we have gone out and explained is they have a submarine associated with this port visit that they have not had before. They also have similar capabilities on a surface ship that they have had before. So, for us --\n\nQ But they're transferring or emplacing any -- any missiles, anything like that?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: We have not seen anything like that, and the Cubans have gone out with their own statements reinforcing that that is not happening. Of course, we don't necessarily literally take the Cubans' word for it, but we, through our own means, have not seen anything to that extent and do not expect anything like that to occur.\n\nQ Jake --\n\nQ Can you say how --\n\nQ -- after the G7 wraps up, you're going to be going to Switzerland with the Vice President. What -- what's the level of optimism that that conference can -- can move the ball forward on Ukraine? And, like, you know, what -- what are you looking for at the end of that?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: We're looking for two things. One is for the maximum number of nations to sign up to what should be an indisputable proposition that any just peace has to be based on the U.N. Charter and the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the inviolability of orders that taking -- that taking territory by force is completely unacceptable. So, that would be a powerful outcome if we can achieve it.\n\nAnd then the other thing is practical support for Ukraine's efforts on issues like energy security, the return of abducted children, the security of nuclear plants in Ukraine. We'll work through some of those issues as well and hope to get some momentum from them.\n\nQ Do you have any --\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: I think we'll do one -- one more.\n\nQ Can you just comment quickly on this --\n\nQ Do you know why the Saudi's aren't coming?\n\nQ -- this --\n\nQ I'm sorry.\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: I'm sorry?\n\nQ Do you know why the Saudis aren't coming?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Pardon?\n\nQ MBS -- MBS isn't coming?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: I do not know why. No, I haven't had the chance to speak with them to understand that. So --\n\nQ Is that a disappointment in terms of maybe moving -- moving forward on --\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: Well --\n\nQ -- the Middle East?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: -- we always welcome more countries, in- -- including influential countries like Saudi Arabia. But they haven't been to previous G7 summits, so this isn't unusual that they're not at this one.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right. Got to wrap it up.\n\nQ Can you comment really quickly between this on/off again deal between Iran and Russia -- this comprehensive security agreement?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: I -- I don't have any comment on it today. If I gain any greater insight or wisdom for you, I'll share it.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks --\n\nQ (Inaudible) strikes in northern Israel?\n\nMR. SULLIVAN: We continue to be concerned about the exchange of fire across the border. And we're particularly concerned about Hezbollah strikes that are aimed at civilian areas in Israel. It's something we're in close consultation with the Israelis on.\n\nLook, fundamentally, as the President said in his speech on May 31st, generating a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza can put us on a path to get calm on the border between Israel and Lebanon and ultimately an agreement that provides sufficient security assurances that people can return to their home safely. That's what we're driving for, and that's what we hope to achieve.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right. Thanks, Jake.\n\nQ Thanks, Jake.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Hi. (Laughs.)\n\nQ Hi.\n\nQ Hi.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: All right, Colleen. What you got?\n\nQ A couple questions. First of all, can you tell us who from the President's family is with him on the trip? I think it's a couple of grandchildren, but I (inaudible).\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, what I can say: There are a number of family members traveling on this -- on this trip with the President. I don't have any names to share. But I can confirm -- and I think you've all seen it for yourselves -- there are family members traveling with him.\n\nQ And then, I know you read the statement at the beginning, but I wondered if you could say anything about how the President absorbed the news of his son's conviction.\n\nAnd then, also, he has said that he was -- he has ruled out pardoning his son, but I wondered about a commutation -- whether that would be something that would be on the table -- a commutation.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah, so, look, as I stated at the top, I don't have anything to say beyond -- to your first question -- beyond what the President's statement was yesterday. He has been very clear. We've been very clear. You know, he -- he loves his son. And he and the First Lady love their son, and they support their son.\n\nI just don't have anything -- certainly anything beyond that.\n\nWhat I will say is -- look, I -- I haven't spoken to the President about this since the verdict came out. And as we all know, the sentencing hasn't even been scheduled yet. But you saw the President do an interview just last week when he was in Normandy. And he was asked, you know, a question -- several questions -- a couple of questions about this. And he was very clear, very upfront, very -- obviously very definitive. And I just don't have anything -- he -- you have his w- -- own words. I just don't have anything beyond that.\n\nQ Can you explain (inaudible) --\n\nQ So, you're not ruling out that he would commute the sentence?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Look, what I'm saying is that the President -- the Pre- -- I have not spoken to the President about this. And what I'm saying is he was asked about a pardon. He was asked about -- he was asked about the trial specifically. And he answered it very clearly, very forthright.\n\nAs we know, the sentencing hasn't even been scheduled yet. I don't have anything beyond what the President said. He's been very clear about this.\n\nQ Can you just speak about the logistics of how much time he spent with Hunter, Karine? Because as I understand, when he went to Wilmington yesterday, Hunter went back to LA. And as far as we can figure out, the only time that they spent was on the tarmac. Is that accurate? I just --\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I -- I'm just not going to speak to the President's private time with the family. And I just don't have anything beyond the statement. The President and the First Lady support their son. They love their son. I'm not going to get into -- into time that he spent with his family. That's something that we never do, and I'm not going to do that today.\n\nQ And then -- and then on the -- if no one el- -- just on the -- on the summit side of it, Karine. If we can -- if you can talk a little bit about the -- the President's plans to meet the Pope and also any kind of --\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Plan to what?\n\nQ To meet the Pope.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Oh, to meet the Pope.\n\nQ And if there's any bilats other than Meloni? And also any pull asides, maybe with her Erdo\u011fan or Modi?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: As you know, these things -- and I think Jake kind of said it -- they're kind of -- they're very dynamic. They're very in the moment. There's a lot that goes on at these summits. And so, if there is a -- a pull aside, if there's anything beyond what we've shared with you up to -- up to now, we certainly will share that.\n\nThese engagements, as you know, tend -- they come and go. And they -- and when they do, they happen very quickly. And obviously, they happen, you know, sometimes unexpectedly. So, if we have anything like that to share, we certainly will have a readout. We will let all of you know.\n\nAs the -- far as the Pope, don't have anything specific here to share at this moment. But, again, we will -- we have, you know, next 48 hours or so. I'm sure we'll have a lot of readouts and a lot of things to share with all of you --\n\nQ Karine --\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: -- as this is a very critically important summit.\n\nQ Is this -- are you thinking about this as being the President's -- potentially the President's last overseas trip in this term? Or is there still any discussion about Africa?\n\nOne of the core areas that the leaders will be talking about will be sustainability and development, and especially --\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.\n\nQ -- with an eye to Africa.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah. I think the President spoke to Africa, specifically, when he was asked. He said that he would love to do it, you know, in Febru- -- I think he may have even said in -- in February -- as early of next year. So, he's determined and wants to keep that commitment.\n\nAs you know, we had the Kenyan state visit. That went very well. And -- and there was a two-plus-two there.\n\nI just don't have anything beyond his schedule on -- on that particular question about going to Africa.\n\nAny additional scheduling, overseas OCONUS trips, obviously, we will let you know. I just don't have anything in the future to lay out for you at this time.\n\nQ Karine, does the White House have any reaction to the CPI report that just came out this morning? And -- and what does the President make of, you know, the expectation that the Fed may only do two rate cuts instead of three?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: You're talking about the Fed?\n\nQ Rate cuts, yeah.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look -- and we've always been really clear about the Fed. They're independent. We do not comment on -- on the Fed. And we -- in this administration, we are very -- we are very committed to making sure that the Fed has the -- the space and the inte- -- independence to make those in- -- those monetary policy decisions. So, I don't have a comment on that.\n\nWhat I will say more broadly: We -- the President did put out -- we put out a statement from the President on the S- -- CPI. He understands and we always want to acknowledge where the American people are. We understand that they're struggling. We understand that there's more progress to be made.\n\nObviously, we welcome the news coming out of the CPI data. Inflation is down more than two thirds with the lowest core inflation since April 2021. Wages are rising faster than prices over the last year. And since the pandemic, 15.6 million jobs created. And unemployment at or below 4 poi- -- 4 poi- -- 4 percent for the longest stretch in 50 years.\n\nLook, the President has been really clear. He's from Scranton. He knows what it's like for families to sit around the kitchen table and make difficult decisions. That's why he's continuing to do everything that he can to lower costs.\n\nAnd there's a contrast. Republicans in Congress, they want to give a tax break to billionaires and -- and corporations. That's not where we are.\n\nWe want to continue to make sure that we give folks some health -- hel- -- some ease on healthcare, right? That's why we did the insulin ca- -- tapping -- capping insulin at 30 -- 35 bucks a month for our seniors who are paying hundreds and hundreds of dollars a month; making sure that Medicare is able to negotiate, which is something that the last administrations, many other administrations have tried to do and they couldn't and this administration has been able to do.\n\nSo, look, we know that there's more work to be done. We're going to continue to do that work to lower costs. But we obviously welcome the CPI data and the progress that we're making.\n\nQ Do you have any update on FDIC chair, the search for a --\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: No update on FDIC chair. Obviously, the President is going to nominate someone who he -- who -- as he does with every nominee, who has the experience and the respect in their field. And once we do that, we'll certainly share -- share that information. And we understand how important it is to have an FDIC chair in place. So, we're going to certainly stay very laser focused on getting that done.\n\nQ The President today got the endorsement of three major seniors groups. And I realize you can't talk about the campaign --\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: No -- (laughs) -- I can't talk about the --\n\nQ I understand that, but --\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Thank you for saying that in your question.\n\nQ (Laughs.) But -- but can you say anything about the President's agenda for a second term in terms of deepening the work to aid seniors? You mentioned --\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.\n\nQ -- you know, a few things.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Insulin. Yeah, the thirty- --\n\nQ Is it -- is it a top priority for him --\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.\n\nQ -- going forward as part of the fight against inflation but also for seniors?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah. No -- no, I appreciate the question. And I think that's really important. I've got to be really mindful not to speak about the 2024 election.\n\nBut to answer -- to -- to lean into your -- your question about the -- the second term, look, the President is going to continue to work on -- on behalf of the American people. That is what he's going to do.\n\nLowering costs -- obviously, as we talk about our -- his economic policy is at the center of that and continuing to do that. That's why the Inflation Reduction Act was so important, because it allows us to, yes, fight climate change by lowering costs on energy prices. Also, healthcare -- by lowering costs for 15 million Americans across the country that are going to see a lower cost -- 800 bucks lower a year. That's because of what this President has -- was able to do with only Democrats in Congress. Insulin -- I already talked about that -- for seniors capped at 35 bucks.\n\nI mean, there's -- there's a lot more work to be done.\n\nAnd -- and we see that -- we understand that -- that Americans are still struggling.\n\nBut we have seen some progress. And we want to continue that progress, whether it is creating more jobs, making sure that unemployment continues to be low -- it's a 50 -- a 50-year low, as we -- as we know. And so, we're going to be pretty consistent on doing that.\n\nHealthcare, climate change, lowering costs across the board -- that is going to be pretty consistent with what we do.\n\nQ Karine, can I ask --\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.\n\nQ -- about just another summit session tomorrow, which is the Partnership for Ini- --\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.\n\nQ You know what I mean. The PGI.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah, the P- --\n\nQ Partnership for Global Initiative Investment --\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nQ -- Investment Initiative.\n\nAnyway, this is something that's very important for the President. He launched it as \"Build Back Better World\" in G7 Cornwall. How close is the G7 to reaching the goal of $600 billion by 2027?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.\n\nQ I mean, as I understand, this is also the President's second-term goal --\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.\n\nQ -- that Jake mentioned to provide more resources to developing countries.\n\nAnd then, just on a logistics note, we don't see the President attending the dinner for tomorrow, the G7 dinner, if you can explain why.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, it's going to be a jam-packed two days. Just starting with your last question first. There's going to be a lot of meetings happening, a lot of\n\nsessions, as you know.\n\nAnd so, the President is certainly going to be engaged for the -- the two days -- or two -- two -- two and a half days that he is in Italy at the G7. So, I wouldn't read too much into him not going to one dinner.\n\nThe President is going to be engaged with the leaders of the G7. And you all will see that and hear from us on that.\n\nAs it relates to initiative -- yes, this is an initiative that the President started himself. It is -- it is something that he's proud of. We will have more to share. I know Jake talked about that in -- a little bit at the top. I don't have anything more as to the second -- second stage of this. But we will have more to share, so stay tuned.\n\nBut -- but, yeah, this is a President that's come -- when he comes to these things, you see his leadership o- -- on the world stage. These are incredibly important engagement with these world leaders. And -- and so -- and he -- it -- there will be no lack of engagement. There will be full engagement with this President, as he continues to do so in -- in all of these OCONUSs trip, as you guys have covered.\n\nI think you -- do you have something?\n\nQ Thank you. I have two quick questions. Sorry, the first one is on Hunter. Where was the President yesterday when the verdict came down? Can you just give us a little bit of color about where he was or if someone from the White House notified him?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: What's your second question as well?\n\nQ If just -- if they -- if someone had to notify him or he was watching coverage. Yeah.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I mean, look, I'm just not going to go dive into any specifics here. I'm just not going to do that from here. You know, this is -- this is about his -- his family. This is about his son, who he loves and obviously supports.\n\nI -- I know these questions are going to come a million different ways. As I've said before when I've been asked about this, we're just going to be very consistent, stick to the statement that he put out. And I'm just going to leave it there.\n\nQ I think you know -- another one on the --\n\n(Cross-talk.)\n\nSorry. I have another one on the border, the executive actions last week. Over -- like, over the last 24 hours, there have been a number of reports about suspected terrorists at ports of entry and then also a sting operation where suspected ISIS terrorists were collected throughout the United States. Do you guys believe so far that the executive actions are working, or is there going to be another announcement down the line with more to do?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, a couple of things. DOJ, H- -- DOJ, DHS put out a joint statement. So, I would refer you to that statement on that particular question that you just asked me about those eight in- -- I believe there were eight individuals.\n\nSo -- and we are also grateful for the law enforcement for their quick -- quick work on this to make sure that we keep Americans safe.\n\nThis is another example of why we think some calls from Republicans to defund the FBI is -- is a bad idea, is troublesome. And so, we'll continue to call that out as well.\n\nBut, again, DHS and DOJ put out a statement, so I -- a joint statement, so I would refer you to that.\n\nAs it relates to the executive -- the executive action the President did last week, look, just to take a step back just for a second -- like, this is a president that has taken the issue of what we're seeing at the border, the immigration\n\nsystem being broken very seriously -- I mean, very, very seriously.\n\nThat's why he put out a comprehensive legislation on day one. That's why he worked with senators -- both Republicans and Democrats -- for a couple of months to bring forth a -- a plan, a policy that he wants to sign. He wanted them to move forward with it, and Republicans rejected their own plan.\n\nAnd so, he wants to see a bipartisan solution here, but that didn't happen. As you noted, he took an executive action.\n\nAs it relates to any impact of those actions, we're still early in the implementation phase. But we -- we look at this in its totality, when it comes to actions -- just the actions that we took this year as well. And so, it's including our work with international partners like Mexico.\n\nEn- -- encounters are down more than 50 percent from December. So, however, we understand that migration flows are dynamic, and we'll continue to -- to surge resources and personnel to the areas that need them.\n\nBut the President, again, wants to do this in a bipartisan way. He believes this the best way to deal with this broken system -- a system that's been broken for decades -- is to have both sides come together and have a legislative answer to this.\n\nQ Can you share any outreach from the White House to progressives that were frustrated by the actions announced last week?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, what I can say to you is that our office, the -- our Office of Leg Affairs is -- is consistently and constantly engaging with legislators, both on the House and the Senate, in both chambers, on -- on an array of issues, including immigration.\n\nAnd you saw us -- I mean, you saw us for months -- you saw our team -- for months, the President directed his team to reach out to senators, both De- -- Democrats and Republicans.\n\nAnd so, we have be- -- we've been in the -- in the process as well. Right? We've gotten our hands dirty in this in a sense of getting to work and trying to find a solution. And there is one. There is one. Republicans rejected because of the former President saying that it would hurt him and help Joe Biden.\n\nAnd those are -- tho- -- and that's what you all have reported, is what I'm repeating here.\n\nQ Can you say a word or two about what the President will be doing in L.A.? Is it just solely a campaign event or is there any official business?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I would -- it's campaign. And so, I would refer you to the campaign. It's go- -- he'll only be doing campaign events. But that's for the campaign to speak to.\n\nQ And he'll --\n\nQ (Inaudible) any consideration to having the President just stay in Europe after the D-Day and France state visit? You -- he's gone across the Atlantic -- he will have done, basically, four crossings in 10 days, which is tough, even if you're not 81. So -- (laughs) --\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: I mean, look, the President -- and most presidents -- have a jam-packed schedule. He came back for two really important events. One is Juneteenth, a holiday that he helped create it, signed into law, which -- which, you know, is a -- we believe is important holiday to -- to honor and to commem- -- commemorate. You all saw the President attend that event.\n\nHe also spoke about an issue that really truly matters --\n\nQ (Inaudible.)\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: -- guns. Look, gun violence -- guns is -- is an epidemic in our country, the number one killer of our children. And so, for him to come out -- come back and talk about these two incredibly domestic issues -- right? -- I think is important.\n\nThe President's schedule is jam-packed. It is. There is a lot to be done on behalf of the American people.\n\nBut the President is -- is looking forward to the G7. Important -- it's going to be an important summit to talk an a- -- about an array of issues -- that you heard Jake talk through -- that's going out currently right now.\n\nAnd so, look, you know, again, the President has -- this is a president that is able to do foreign policy matters, dealing with that, and also domestic issues as well that matter to the American people.\n\nWe know that the gun issue, for example, is one of the important, top issues that Americans really care about. It affects many communities across the country.\n\nQ Karine, what do you think the President is going to say -- a lot of, you know, other foreign leaders have expressed -- you know, are anticipating or -- or have expressed concern that potentially President -- former President Trump could be reelected and what the implications would be. What is the President's message going to be to other leaders?\n\nHe often talks about, you know, going to that first G7 meeting and saying, \"America is back.\" As the election nears, the polls are not clear. It's very much neck and neck. Is he going with any kind of a message --\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.\n\nQ -- to the leaders about the o- -- you know, about -- I realize you can't say --\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah, I -- I --\n\nQ -- you know --\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: No, I appreciate the question, and I get the question, especially in the year that we're in. I have to be super mindful and not -- and not speak to any question that alludes to, obviously, an election that's coming up in a couple of months. So, going to be super, super mindful.\n\nWhat I will say more broadly -- and I know you all -- some of you traveled with us when he -- he went to Normandy and visited the beaches of Normandy, an 80 a- -- 80-year anniversary of D-Day. And you heard the -- the President talk about the importance of our alliances and our (inaudible) partnership and how, you know, it is important that we fight for democracy and our freedom, because it matters for all of us.\n\nAnd so, you saw the President. It was incredibly powerful what he said on that Thursday speech and also the Friday remarks. And I think that is a show of what this President believes in. And so, I'm going to leave that there.\n\nAnd then, you'll see the President goes to the G7, another important opportunity to engage with our allies and partners on what's going on globally in the world. Right?\n\nQ Can I just jump on (inaudible)?\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Sure, sure.\n\nQ I mean, this is a topic that has taken more urgency, particularly after the European Parliament elections, where we see a surge of support for far-right parties. So, we assume that this will be a topic of discussion among leaders, especially with France holding snap elections; Germany, Olaf Scholz also weakened.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: Yeah.\n\nQ And I think yesterday John Kirby told me that the President is confident that Ursula von der Leyen will be selected again for another term. But I just wanted to get an understanding of the President's head when he's speaking with leaders about the potential rise of far -- potential rise of far-right parties on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: So, look, a couple of things. I do want to speak to the EU election results. I'm not sure if my NSC colleagues were able to talk about it in detail, but I'll say here on the record.\n\nSo, we congratulate the millions of citizens across the European Union's 27 member states who cast ballots in European Parliament elections. The successful administration and conclusion of these elections is a good example of democracy and democratic institutions for the world to see.\n\nSo, I'm not going to comment on election results themselves since we do not involve ourselves in the domestic politics of our allies and partners.\n\nI will say that we have worked closely together with the EU to address global challenges and advance our national security interests, such as supporting Ukraine and holding Russia accountable for its actions on trade and other many issues. We certainly expect all of that, as we talked about the EU and our relationship and how we move forward, to continue.\n\nAnd so, look, I -- you know, I'm not going to get into every specific state and their elections. But we believe that our relationship -- that relationship we -- that we have with the EU is going to continue.\n\nI'm going to be, again, very mindful on coming into any speculation or hypotheticals here, especially as it relates to elections coming up this year.\n\nAll right.\n\nQ Do you have any names of CEOs that he's meeting with? We reported that there's, like, a CEO session with him and Meloni.\n\nMS. JEAN-PIERRE: We'll probably have more to share with you later. I don't have anything right now.\n\nAll right. Thanks, everybody. Enjoy the ride.\n\n11:58 A.M. EDT\n\n/Public Release.

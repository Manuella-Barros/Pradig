And, obviously, the conclusions lots of people are drawing are not at all great.\n\n'But I don't know all the facts at the moment. I'd be loath to condemn without there being an investigation that's been concluded.'\n\nA Conservative spokesman said: 'We have been contacted by the Gambling Commission about a small number of individuals.\n\n'As the Gambling Commission is an independent body, it wouldn't be proper to comment further, until any process is concluded.'\n\nMr Williams is also being investigated after putting a \u00a3100 bet on the election being held in July, just days before the PM announced the July 4 vote. The 5-1 flutter would have netted him \u00a3500.\n\nThe issue with those with close connections to the PM placing a bet on the election date comes with the individual having possible inside information that could give them an advantage.\n\nIt has not been confirmed whether Ms Saunders had any inside information when allegedly placing the bet.\n\nThe use of confidential information to gain unfair advantage when betting may constitute a criminal offence of cheating under section 42 of the Gambling Act.\n\nThose convicted face and unlimited fine or up to two years in jail.\n\nRead More Sunak aide investigated for placing \u00a3100 bet on July election days before PM set July 4 date\n\nThe investigation regarding Ms Saunders also comes as a police officer in Mr Sunak's close protection team has been suspended and arrested over alleged bets about the timing of the election, it was revealed on Wednesday.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police was contacted by the Gambling Commission last Friday and told the commission was investigating the activities of a member of Scotland Yard's Royalty and Specialist Protection (RaSP) command.\n\nThe police constable was removed from operational duties with immediate effect.\n\nA Met Police spokesperson said: 'We can confirm that on Friday, 14 June, the Met were contacted by the Gambling Commission who informed us that they were investigating alleged bets made by a Police Constable from the Met's Royalty and Specialist Protection Command, which were related to the timing of the General Election.\n\n'The matter was immediately referred to officers in the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards, who opened an investigation, and the officer was also removed from operational duties.\n\n'The officer was subsequently arrested on Monday 17 June on suspicion of misconduct in public office.

The BBC reported earlier that Mr Lee - who took a leave of absence from his job on Wednesday afternoon - is married to a Conservative candidate who is being looked into by the betting industry regulator.Laura Saunders, the party's candidate in Bristol North West, has worked for the Tories since 2015 and is married to Mr Lee. It is not known when either individual placed a bet or for how much money. Laura Saunders and Tony Lee have been approached for comment by the BBC and have not responded. A Conservative Party spokesman told the BBC: \"We have been contacted by the Gambling Commission about a small number of individuals. \"As the Gambling Commission is an independent body, it wouldn't be proper to comment further, until any process is concluded.\"A spokesperson for the Gambling Commission said: \"The Gambling Commission regulates gambling in the interests of consumers and the wider public. \"Currently the Commission is investigating the possibility of offences concerning the date of the election. This is an ongoing investigation, and the Commission cannot provide any further details at this time.\"We are not confirming or denying the identity of any individuals involved in this investigation.\"If someone uses confidential information to gain an unfair advantage when betting, this could be a criminal offence under section 42 of the Gambling Act. Mr Sunak announced 4 July as the date of the general election on 22 May, taking much of Westminster by surprise.Last week it was alleged that one of Rishi Sunak's closest aides, Craig Williams, placed a \u00a3100 bet on a July polling day three days before the PM named the date .Mr Williams, who was the Tory MP for Montgomery until the election was called and is standing again in the new constituency of Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr, previously apologised and said he made a \"huge error of judgement\". When asked by the BBC, he refused to say whether he placed a bet on the basis of inside information.Labour and the Liberal Democrats have both called for Ms Saunders and Mr Williams to be suspended as Conservative candidates.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: \"It's very telling that Rishi Sunak has not already done that.\"If it was one of my candidates, they'd be gone and their feet would not have touched the floor.\"Lib Dem deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: \"It would be an utter disgrace if Conservative politicians were shown to be more focussed on turning a quick buck rather than the needs of the country.\"Housing Secretary Michael Gove said it would be \"deeply wrong\" if anyone had used \"inside information\" to place bets.\"What I can't do is sort of get too much into the detail of the case while an investigation is going on,\" he told the BBC\"But I can talk about the broad principle and you're absolutely right, it's reprehensible.\"On Wednesday, it emerged that a police officer working as part of the prime minister's close protection team had been arrested following an allegation of bets on the timing of the election.The officer was initially suspended by the Metropolitan Police and then arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office.The individual has been bailed pending further inquiries.The Met was contacted by the Gambling Commission last Friday. It informed the force that it was investigating alleged bets made by a police constable from the Met's Royalty and Specialist Protection Command.Labour's campaign coordinator Pat McFadden ...", "source": {"uri": "rocketnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RocketNews | Top News Stories From Around the Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gambling Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tony Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Mason_(journalist)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Mason (journalist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_North_West_(UK_Parliament_constituency)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bristol North West (UK Parliament constituency)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_editor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political editor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Kuenssberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laura Kuenssberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Williams_(British_politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Craig Williams (British politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Democrats (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Levelling_Up,_Housing_and_Communities", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisy_Cooper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daisy Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomeryshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Montgomeryshire (UK Parliament constituency)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_McFadden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat McFadden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Gove", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Gove"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constable", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665618", "eventUri": "eng-9665618", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 1707, "textEnd": 1713}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-22", "textStart": 1753, "textEnd": 1759}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

He was taken into custody, bailed and has been removed from operational duties.\n\nLast week it emerged that Craig Williams, parliamentary private secretary to Sunak and hitherto Tory MP for Montgomeryshire, was also facing a Gambling Commission probe. He is alleged to have placed a \u00a3100 (Rs 10,600) bet at odds of 5/1 on a July polling date three days before the July 4 election was called. He said: \"I put a flutter on the general election some weeks ago.

This is an ongoing investigation.

While betting is legal in the UK, any bets placed with the advantage of insider information could fall within the purview of illegality.\n\n\"The matter was immediately referred to officers in the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards, who opened an investigation, and the officer was also removed from operational duties,\" the Met Police was quoted by the BBC as saying.\n\n\"The officer was subsequently arrested on Monday 17 June on suspicion of misconduct in public office. He was taken into custody and bailed pending further enquiries,\" the Met Police said.\n\nLast week, the 'Guardian' newspaper reported that Sunak's close parliamentary aide, Craig Williams, placed a GBP 100 bet with Ladbrokes at a five to one odds on a July election just three days before the British Indian leader had surprised the country with a summer election, as opposed to a widely expected autumn date later in the year. Williams, 39, is the Tory candidate for Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr in Wales. In a statement, he said his \"flutter\" on the election had prompted some \"routine inquiries\" and that he would \"fully cooperate with these\".\n\n\"I don't want it to be a distraction from the campaign. I should have thought through how it looks,\" he said.\n\nIt has since emerged that a second Conservative candidate, who is married to the party's Director of Campaigns - who would be expected to have knowledge of election matters, is also facing an investigation over allegedly betting on the timing of the general election. While Laura Saunders, the Tory candidate for Bristol North West, is reportedly among those being looked into by the Gambling Commission, her husband Tony Lee is said to have taken \"a leave of absence\" from his role.\n\n\"The Gambling Commission regulates gambling in the interests of consumers and the wider public,\" a commission spokesperson said.\n\n\"Currently, the commission is investigating the possibility of offences concerning the date of the election. This is an ongoing investigation, and the commission cannot provide any further details at this time. We are not confirming or denying the identity of any individuals involved in this investigation,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nUnder Section 42 of the UK's Gambling Act 2005, it is an offence to cheat at gambling or to do anything that allows someone else to cheat. The Conservative Party has said that the Gambling Commission being an independent regulatory body, it would not be \"proper to comment further, until any process is concluded\".\n\nHowever, the Opposition Labour Party has mounted pressure on Sunak, with leader Keir Starmer calling for Saunders to be suspended and said it is \"very telling\" that action had not been taken.\n\n\"If it was one of my candidates, they'd be gone and their feet would not have touched the floor,\" he said.\n\nSunak was asked about the first allegation involving Craig Williams on the sidelines of the G7 Summit in Italy last week, when he described it as \"very disappointing news\" but added that it \"wouldn't be appropriate for me to comment\" while the Gambling Commission's inquiries are ongoing.\n\nIt comes as the embattled Tories continue to be hammered in the pre-election surveys, with almost all analyses forecasting heavy losses for the governing party.", "source": {"uri": "telegraphindia.com",

Democrats called for the Tories to suspend both Ms Saunders and Mr Williams.\n\nSir Keir Starmer said: \"If it was one of my candidates, they'd be gone and their feet would not have touched the

Laura Saunders, standing for Bristol North West, is the second Tory MP hopeful facing an investigation following allegations last week that another Conservative candidate had placed a \u00a3100 bet on a July polling day, three days before the Prime Minister announced the date to the public.\n\nMs Saunders, who is married to the Tory Party's campaign chief Tony Lee, was the head of the international department at the Conservative Party, working with London embassies and the Tories' sister parties overseas and she had previously worked on organising campaign visits in the 2017 and 2019 elections. The BBC reports that Mr Lee was taking a leave of absence from his role at Tory HQ, with just two weeks until polling day.\n\nDetails of when the alleged bet was made and how much money was placed have not yet been made public. It comes after the arrest of one of Mr Sunak's police protection officers and a Gambling Commission investigation into his parliamentary aide Craig Williams over similar betting allegations.\n\nRead more:\n\nCabot Circus coffee shop to temporarily close down Major works on Temple Island in latest Bristol plans\n\nIn response to the latest allegations about Ms Saunders, a Conservative spokesman said: \"We have been contacted by the Gambling Commission about a small number of individuals. As the Gambling Commission is an independent body, it wouldn't be proper to comment further, until any process is concluded.\"\n\nHousing Secretary Mr Gove told the BBC: \"If people have used inside information to place bets, that is deeply wrong. What I can't do is sort of get too much into the detail of the case while an investigation is going on. But I can talk about the broad principle and you're absolutely right, it's reprehensible.\"\n\nThe Gambling Commission said: \"Currently the commission is investigating the possibility of offences concerning the date of the election. This is an ongoing investigation, and the commission cannot provide any further details at this time.\"\n\nMr Williams, who is standing for the Conservatives in Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr and who served as Mr Sunak's parliamentary private secretary, was under investigation after he \"put a flutter\" on when the election would take place. He is alleged to have placed a \u00a3100 bet on a July polling day some three days before Mr Sunak named the date as July 4, at a Ladbrokes in his constituency.\n\nHe previously said he had clearly made a \"huge error of judgment\" but refused to say whether he placed a bet on the basis of insider information. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak previously said it was \"very disappointing\" that Mr Williams had allegedly placed a bet on the date of the general election.\n\nOn Wednesday, July 19, the Metropolitan Police said they were informed by the Gambling Commission that a police constable from the force's Royalty and Specialist Protection Command was being investigated over alleged betting.\n\nThe police officer, who has been removed from operational duties, was bailed pending further inquiries after they were taken into custody on Monday on suspicion of misconduct in a public office. The matter has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which said it will \"make a decision on the level of IOPC involvement in due course\".\n\nWant the latest Bristol breaking news and top stories first?

She is considering legal action against the BBC and any other publishers who infringe her privacy rights.\"\n\nNews of the investigation into Bristol North West candidate Ms Saunders emerged after the arrest of one of the Prime Minister's police protection officers and the previous revelation of a Gambling Commission investigation into his parliamentary aide Craig Williams over betting allegations.\n\nBetfair data appears to show a flurry of bets on a July poll placed on May 21, the day before Mr Sunak called the election, adding to concerns about political insiders gambling on its timing.\n\nFollowing a few months of people wagering a few pounds on a summer poll, betting spiked on the day prior to the announcement, including some in the hundreds of pounds at odds that would have delivered handsome profits in the thousands.\n\nCabinet minister Michael Gove admitted the situation \"doesn't look great\" for the Tories.\n\nA Conservative spokesman said: \"We have been contacted by the Gambling Commission about a small number of individuals.\n\n\"As the Gambling Commission is an independent body, it wouldn't be proper to comment further, until any process is

the commission cannot provide any further details at this time.\n\n\"We are not confirming or denying the identity of any individuals involved in this investigation.\"\n\nLabour and the Liberal Democrats called for the Tories to suspend both Ms Saunders and Mr Williams.\n\nSir Keir Starmer said: \"If it was one of my candidates, they'd be gone and their feet would not have touched the floor.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the Metropolitan Police said they were informed by the Gambling Commission that a police constable from the force's Royalty and Specialist Protection Command was being investigated over the alleged bets.\n\nThe police officer, who has been removed from operational duties, was bailed pending further inquiries after they were taken into custody on Monday on suspicion of misconduct in a public office.\n\nThe revelations about Mr Williams emerged last week, and he admitted it was a \"huge error of judgment\" to have a \"flutter\" on the election.", "source": {"uri":

Voters are sick to the back teeth of this endless carousel of chaos, sleaze and scandal.\n\n\"People across the country are crying out for change and that is why in many areas they are backing the Liberal Democrats to get a strong local champion that will take their issues right to the heart of Parliament and not take them for granted any longer.\"\n\nIt emerged last week that Craig Williams, who served as Mr Sunak's parliamentary private secretary and is the Conservative candidate for Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr, was under investigation after he \"put a flutter\" on when the election would take place.\n\nOn Wednesday the Metropolitan Police said they were informed by the Gambling Commission that a police constable from the force's Royalty and Specialist Protection Command was being investigated over the alleged bets.\n\nThe police officer, who has been removed from operational duties, was bailed pending further inquiries after they were taken into custody on Monday on suspicion of misconduct in a public office.\n\nThe matter has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which said it will \"make a decision on the level of IOPC involvement in due course\".\n\nMr Sunak previously said it was \"very disappointing\" that Mr Williams had allegedly placed a bet on the date of the General Election.\n\nCraig Williams, who was the Tory MP for Montgomery until the election was called and is the party's candidate for Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr, is alleged to have placed a \u00a3100 bet on a July polling day some three days before Mr Sunak named the date as July 4, at a Ladbrokes in his constituency.\n\nHe previously said he had clearly made a \"huge error of judgment\" but refused to say whether he placed a bet on the basis of insider information.\n\nElsewhere on Thursday, Mr Sunak will join three other party leaders in taking part in a BBC Question Time special.\n\nThe two-hour programme will see each leader appear one by one to face questions from the audience.\n\nLabour's Sir Keir Starmer will also take part along with Scotland's First Minister John Swinney for the SNP and Sir Ed Davey for the Liberal Democrats.\n\nThe latest televised election event comes after YouGov said the Conservatives are projected to slump to their \"lowest seat tally in the party's almost 200-year history\" at the election.\n\nYouGov said its latest study projects Labour to secure 425 seats, the Tories 108, the Liberal Democrats 67, the SNP 20, Reform UK five, Plaid Cymru four and the Green Party two.\n\nIt noted such a scenario would hand Sir Keir a 200-seat majority while it added Reform UK leader Nigel Farage is \"likely\" to win in Clacton.\n\nYouGov used a technique known as multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) to model the outcome of the election in every constituency across Britain.\n\nIt said the estimated seat projections were based on modelled responses from 36,161 adults in England and Wales and 3,818 in Scotland between June 11 and 18.", "source": {"uri": "itv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ITV Hub"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type":

Although wagering is permitted in the UK, wagers made with the benefit of insider knowledge may be prohibited.\n\n\"The matter was immediately referred to officers in the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards, who opened an investigation, and the officer was also removed from operational duties,\" the Met Police was quoted by the BBC as saying.\n\n\"The officer was subsequently arrested on Monday 17 June on suspicion of misconduct in public office. He was taken into custody and bailed pending further enquiries,\" the Met Police said.\n\nThree days before Sunak shocked the nation by calling a summer election rather than the more anticipated fall date later in the year, Sunak's close parliamentary aide Craig Williams placed a GBP 100 bet with Ladbrokes at a five to one odds. This information was reported by the newspaper The Guardian last week.\n\nThe 39-year-old Williams is the Tory nominee for Glyndwr in Wales and Montgomeryshire. He said he would \"fully cooperate with these\" and that his \"flutter\" on the election had triggered some \"routine inquiries\" in a statement.\n\n\"I don't want it to be a distraction from the campaign. I should have thought through how it looks,\" he said.\n\nSince then, it has come to light that a second Conservative candidate is also under investigation for allegedly placing bets on the general election's schedule. This candidate is married to the party's director of campaigns, who is presumed to be knowledgeable about election affairs. Although the Gambling Commission is purportedly investigating Laura Saunders, the Tory candidate for Bristol North West, her husband Tony Lee is alleged to have taken \"a leave of absence\" from his position.\n\n\"The Gambling Commission regulates gambling in the interests of consumers and the wider public,\" a commission spokesperson said.\n\n\"The Gambling Commission regulates gambling in the interests of consumers and the wider public,\" a commission spokesperson said.\n\nIt is illegal to cheat at gambling or to do any action that encourages someone else to cheat, according to Section 42 of the UK's Gambling Act 2005. According to the Conservative Party, it would not be \"proper to comment further, until any process is concluded,\" because the Gambling Commission is an independent regulating organization.\n\nBut Sunak is under increasing pressure from the opposition Labour Party, whose leader Keir Starmer demanded that Saunders be suspended and called it \"very telling\" that nothing had been done.\n\n\"If it was one of my candidates, they'd be gone and their feet would not have touched the floor,\" he said.\n\nWhen questioned about the initial accusation against Craig Williams last week during the G7 Summit in Italy, Sunak said that it was \"very disappointing news\" and that it \"wouldn't be appropriate for me to comment\" while the Gambling Commission continued its investigation.\n\nIt happens as the beleaguered Conservatives continue to suffer setbacks in the pre-election polls, with nearly every analysis predicting steep losses for the ruling party.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com",

to lead the investigation into the alleged betting offences, and our investigation is running in parallel to that.\"\n\nLabour's campaign chief, Pat McFadden, has written to Sunak urging the Conservatives to withdraw support from Saunders and Williams while they are being looked into.\n\nIn a letter to the prime minister, McFadden said: \"Can I ask you very simply why you think that a

It comes after a police officer in his close protection team was arrested and suspended from duty for allegedly betting on the date of the poll.\n\nThe PM is facing calls to suspend the two candidates, with the situation described as being an example of \"corruption\". The Tories have been told to come clean about whether there are other people connected to the party who are being looked into by the regulator. Labour said \"no one is above the law\", as it emphasised that cheats can be jailed for up to two years under the Gambling Act.\n\nThe Mirror has broken down what's going on as the Conservatives face fresh turmoil.\n\nTory campaign director - and his wife\n\nThe betting scandal, which began last week, has erupted again today after it emerged the Tory campaign chief is being probed by the Gambling Commission - as well as a Tory candidate who is understood to be his wife.\n\nTony Lee is being investigated by the gambling regulator alongside Laura Saunders, who is believed to be his wife. The Tories confirmed Mr Lee took \"a leave of absence\" from Party HQ on Wednesday, leaving the Conservatives without a campaigning director two weeks before polling day\n\nMs Saunders, who is the Tory candidate for Bristol North West, is understood to have most recently worked in the party's International Division - a department of the Tory campaign headquarters which communicates with other centre right parties worldwide. Between 2015 and 2019, she reportedly worked in the operations and tours department organising campaign visits by successive Prime Ministers and Chancellors.\n\nRishi Sunak's parliamentary aide\n\nRishi Sunak's parliamentary aide Craig Williams was the first Tory to be publicly accused of putting a bet on the General Election date. Last week he admitted he was being looked at by the Gambling Commission after he put a \u00a3100 bet on a General Election being held in July.\n\nLast week, he said: \"I put a flutter on the general election some weeks ago. This has resulted in some routine inquiries and I confirm I will fully cooperate with these. I don't want to be a distraction from the campaign, I should have thought through how it looked.\" He apologised and said he had made a \"huge error of judgement\" over the alleged bet.\n\nPM's close protection police officer\n\nA police officer in Mr Sunak's close protection team has been arrested over an alleged bet on the timing of the General Election. The male officer was suspended from his role before being arrested by police \"on suspicion of misconduct in public office\" on Monday. He was taken into custody and bailed pending further enquiries.\n\nThe Gambling Commission last Friday informed the Metropolitan Police that it was investigating alleged bets made by a police constable from its royalty and specialist protection command in relation to the timing of the General Election. Police referred the matter to the Met's Professional Standards directorate, as well as to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.\n\nA Met Police spokesman told the Mirror: \"The matter was immediately referred to officers in the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards, who opened an investigation, and the officer was also removed from operational duties. The Gambling Commission continues to lead the investigation into the alleged betting offences, and our investigation is running in parallel to that.\"\n\nWhat is the law when it comes to gambling?\n\nIf confidential information is used to get an unfair advantage when betting, it may constitute an offence of cheating under section 42 of the Gambling Act, which is a criminal offence. The Football Association, for example, has strict rules on using insider information for betting.\n\nUnder the Gambling Act, cheats can be jailed for up to two years. The prevention of illegal gambling is a key priority for the Gambling Commission. The regulator, under the Act, has the power to investigate whether an offence has been committed and may commence criminal proceedings. In cases where a serious criminal offence may have been committed, the Commission may pass information to the police or another body.\n\nThe Mirror understands the Gambling Commission are taking the lead in the election betting investigations, with the Met Police running a parallel investigation in relation to its serving officer, which is being led by its directorate of professional standards.\n\nWhat are Labour saying?\n\nLabour called for the two Conservative candidates to be suspended. Asked about Mr Lee taking a leave of absence, Keir Starmer told the Mirror: \"It's astonishing that we're in this place. However many people have already been identified as potentially involved in this. I'm hearing the news that there may be more.\n\n\"Rishi Sunak just needs to take action, he needs to account for exactly who knew what. But also when you've got a candidate standing for election in two weeks who was involved, they've got to go. They've got to be suspended and I don't know why he hasn't done that. I think it is a real measure of his leadership, or lack of leadership.\"\n\nIn a letter to the Prime Minister, the party's campaign co-ordinator Pat McFadden said it \"looks as though there is one rule for members of the Tory Party, and another rule for everyone else\" as he pointed out that a police officer has been suspended for the same offence, while the party's candidates have not.\n\n\"I urge you to gain a sense of urgency and decency about this matter, and do what is necessary both to establish how wide this scandal goes, and take immediate action against all those implicated,\" he wrote. \"It will speak volumes if you choose to stay silent and do nothing instead.\"\n\nWhat are the Lib Dems saying?\n\nThe Lib Dems have also called for both Ms Saunders and Mr Williams to be suspended. Leader Sir Ed Davey said the situation appeared to be an example of \"corruption\". \"The idea that you bet on something when you know the result, that is immoral, it is illegal, and I can't believe people at the top of the Conservative Party are doing this and have allowed this to happen, he said. \"This is corruption, frankly, and it needs to have a heavy hand from the top.\"\n\nSir Ed added: \"We think there should be a Cabinet Office inquiry. I think the Gambling Commission will rightly look at this. I hope they come down heavy on those people who look like - I haven't seen the details but they look like - they've acted illegally and immorally.\"\n\nWhat's the Tory response?\n\nCommunities Secretary Michael Gove said it would be \"reprehensible\" if people were using insider information to place bets. \"What I can't do is sort of get too much into the detail of the case while an investigation is going on,\" he said. \"But I can talk about the broad principle and you're absolutely right, it's reprehensible.\"\n\nHe admitted it \"doesn't look great\" for Mr Lee and his wife to be facing a Gambling Commission investigation, adding: \"But I don't know all the facts at the moment. I'd be loath to condemn without there being an investigation that's been concluded.\"\n\nMeanwhile the Conservative Party X/ Twitter deleted an attack post on Labour which featured a video of a roulette wheel with the tabs reading \"more tax\" and \"more debt\". The caption read: \"If you bet on Labour, you can never win.\"\n\nAsked about Ms Saunders's case, a Conservative spokesman said: \"We have been contacted by the Gambling Commission about a small number of individuals. As the Gambling Commission is an independent body, it wouldn't be proper to comment further, until any process is concluded.\" It added on Mr Lee: \"The Director of Campaigning took a leave of absence from CCHQ yesterday.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sophie_huskisson@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Sophie Huskisson", "type": "author",

An inquiry is needed to understand who knew what and when.\"\n\nThe police officer, who has been removed from operational duties, was bailed pending further inquiries after they were taken into custody on Monday on suspicion of misconduct in a public office.\n\nThe matter has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which said it will \"make a decision on the level of IOPC involvement in due course\".\n\nThe Gambling Commission said in response to the officer's arrest: \"Currently the commission is investigating the possibility of offences concerning the date of the election.\n\n\"This is an ongoing investigation, and the commission cannot provide any further details at this time.\"\n\nMr Sunak previously said it was \"very disappointing\" that Mr Williams had allegedly placed a bet on the date of the General Election.\n\nMr Williams, who was the Tory MP for Montgomery until the election was called, is alleged to have placed a \u00a3100 bet on a July polling day some three days before Mr Sunak named the date as July 4, at a Ladbrokes in his constituency.\n\nHe previously said he had clearly made a \"huge error of judgment\" but refused to say whether he placed a bet on the basis of insider information.\n\nElsewhere on Thursday, Mr Sunak will join three other party leaders in taking part in a BBC Question Time special.\n\nThe two-hour programme will see each leader appear one by one to face questions from the audience.\n\nLabour's Sir Keir Starmer will also take part along with Scotland's First Minister John Swinney for the SNP and Sir Ed Davey for the Liberal Democrats.\n\nThe latest televised election event comes after YouGov said the Conservatives are projected to slump to their \"lowest seat tally in the party's almost 200-year history\" at the election.\n\nYouGov said its latest study projects Labour to secure 425 seats, the Tories 108, the Liberal Democrats 67, the SNP 20, Reform UK five, Plaid Cymru four and the Green Party two.\n\nIt noted such a scenario would hand Sir Keir a 200-seat majority while it added Reform UK leader Nigel Farage is \"likely\" to win in Clacton.\n\nYouGov used a technique known as multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) to model the outcome of the election in every constituency across Britain.\n\nIt said the estimated seat projections were based on modelled

They are literally stealing the lightbulbs on the way out the door. This is another shocking scandal.\"\n\nGallows humour among Tory MPs was summed up by former leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, who is facing defeat in his Chingford and Woodford Green seat. He told the News Agents podcast: \"They say it is Armageddon, but I Armageddon on with it here in this constituency.\"\n\nThe scandal, which also involves one of the police officers on Mr Sunak's close protection team, and his chief parliamentary aide Craig Williams, broken as postal voters are already completing and returning their ballots.\n\nTory candidates and MPs have told The Independent that the scandal, coming after anger over Mr Sunak leaving D-Day commemorations early, is \"absolutely killing\" their hopes of getting elected.\n\nSome are even understood to be discussing publicly disowning the prime minister as a group before the election in a bid to survive while dozens have privately confessed they are already disowning him in conversations with voters on the doorsteps.\n\nSuspicion has been heightened after a data search carried out by the Financial Times appeared to show a surge in bets on a July election in the 24 hours before Mr Sunak made his surprise announcement, with up to \u00a35,900 wagered just before 20 May.\n\nMetropolitan Police have suspended and arrested the unnamed protection officer who is alleged to have bet on the election date before it was announced.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer has led calls for those involved - including Ms Saunders, who is the Bristol North East candidate and worked for the party since 2015 - to be investigated by police.\n\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross urged Mr Sunak to disown those involved. He said: \"The investigation has been set up to look at these allegations, and if anyone is guilty of using [information] that they were privy to, to place bets, to financially benefit from that, it is completely unacceptable, it is completely wrong and they should no longer have the support.\n\n\"But there is an independent process and I think it's right that due process is allowed to continue.\"\n\nTory grandee Sir Charles Walker, who is stepping down as an MP, insisted the scandal will not affect the election result.\n\nHe said: \"Nobody is going to change their vote off the back of this.\"\n\nMichael Gove said it would be \"reprehensible\" for someone to use inside information to bet on the date of the General Election.\n\n\"If people have used inside information to place bets, that is deeply wrong,\" he said. \"What I can't do is sort of get too much into the details of the case while an investigation is going on. But I can talk about the broad principle and you're absolutely right, it's reprehensible.\"\n\nLabour's campaign director Pat McFadden said about the alleged betting: \"What does it say about today's Tory party that once again their first instinct was to fill their boots?\"\n\nLiberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: \"Rishi Sunak must find his backbone and suspend Laura Saunders from the Conservative party whilst this investigation is ongoing. It would be an utter disgrace if Conservative politicians were shown to be more focussed on turning a quick buck rather than the needs of the country. Voters are sick to the back teeth of this endless carousel of chaos, sleaze and scandal.\"\n\nA Conservative Party spokesman said: \"We have been contacted by the Gambling Commission about a small number of individuals. As the Gambling Commission is an independent body, it wouldn't be proper to comment further, until any process is concluded. The director of campaigning took a leave of absence from CCHQ yesterday.\"\n\nA spokesman for the Gambling Commission said it was \"investigating the possibility of offences concerning the date of the election,\" adding: \"This is an ongoing investigation, and the Commission cannot provide any further details at this time. We are not confirming or denying the identity of any individuals involved in this investigation.\"\n\nA Met spokesperson said: \"We can confirm that on Friday, 14 June, the Met were contacted by the Gambling Commission who informed us that they were investigating alleged bets made by a police constable from the Met's Royalty and Specialist Protection Command, which were related to the timing of the General Election.\n\n\"The matter was immediately referred to officers in the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards, who opened an investigation, and the officer was also removed from operational duties.\n\n\"the officer was subsequently arrested on Monday, 17 June on suspicion of misconduct in public office. He was taken into custody and bailed pending further enquiries. The matter has also been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.\n\n\"The Gambling Commission continues to lead the investigation into the alleged betting offences, and our investigation is running in parallel to that.\n\n\"The Met is not currently carrying out any other criminal investigations for misconduct in public office relating to alleged betting offences linked to the election.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_maddox@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "David Maddox", "type":

She is considering legal action against the BBC and any other publishers who infringe her privacy rights.\"\n\nNews of the investigation into Bristol North West candidate Ms Saunders emerged after the arrest of one of the Prime Minister's police protection officers and the previous revelation of a Gambling Commission investigation into his parliamentary aide Craig Williams over betting allegations.\n\nBetfair data appears to show a flurry of bets on a July poll placed on May 21, the day before Mr Sunak called the election, adding to concerns about political insiders gambling on its timing.\n\nFollowing a few months of people wagering a few pounds on a summer poll, betting spiked on the day prior to the announcement, including some in the hundreds of pounds at odds that would have delivered handsome profits in the thousands.\n\nCabinet minister Michael Gove admitted the situation \"doesn't look great\" for the Tories.\n\nFormer Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said figures being looked into over the claims were \"incredibly stupid and venal\", telling The News Agents podcast that their behaviour was \"unacceptable and whatever happens to them wouldn't be hard enough in my book\".\n\nA Conservative spokesman said: \"We have been contacted by the Gambling Commission about a small number of individuals.\n\n\"As the Gambling Commission is an independent body, it wouldn't be proper to comment further, until any process is concluded.\"\n\nThe Gambling Commission said: \"Currently, the commission is investigating the possibility of offences concerning the date of the election.\n\n\"This is an ongoing investigation, and the commission cannot provide any further details at this time.\n\n\"We are not confirming or denying the identity of any individuals involved in this investigation.\"\n\nLabour and the Liberal Democrats called for the Tories to suspend both Ms Saunders and Mr Williams.\n\nSir Keir Starmer said: \"If it was one of my candidates, they'd be gone and their feet would not have touched the floor.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the Metropolitan Police said they were informed by the Gambling Commission that a police constable from the force's Royalty and Specialist Protection Command was being investigated over the alleged bets.\n\nThe police officer, who has been removed from operational duties, was bailed pending further inquiries after they were taken into custody on Monday on suspicion of misconduct in a public office.\n\nThe revelations about Mr Williams emerged last week, and he admitted it was a \"huge error of judgment\" to have a \"flutter\" on the election.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Sunak's woes deepened as former Tory minister Chris Skidmore became the most senior figure yet to switch his support to Labour.\n\n\"For the first time, I cannot vote for a party that has boasted of new oil and gas licences in its manifesto or that now argues that net zero is a burden and not a benefit,\" the Conservatives' ex-net zero tsar wrote in the Guardian.\n\n\"Net zero is one of its five key priorities, and for this reason I will be voting Labour at this election.\"\n\nResponding to Ms Saunders' threat of legal action against the BBC, a spokesperson for the broadcaster said: \"We are confident in our journalism.\n\n\"As Laura Saunders is a candidate standing for election, it is clearly in the public interest to report allegations made against her.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak",

of absence from his role as director of campaigning, after his wife - a Tory candidate - was named as being under investigation for alleged betting offences, the BBC reports.\n\nLaura Saunders, the Conservative candidate in Bristol North West, is under investigation by the Gambling Commission.\n\nIt comes after the arrest of one of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's police protection officers and a Gambling Commission investigation into his parliamentary aide Craig Williams over betting allegations.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Housing Secretary Michael Gove (above) said it would be \"deeply wrong\" for people to use inside information to place bets.\n\nHe told the BBC: \"What I can't do is sort of get too much into the detail of the case while an investigation is going on.\n\n\"But I can talk about the broad principle and you're absolutely right, it's reprehensible.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Three major polls predict winners of every UK constituency at General Election\n\nIn response to the latest

possibility of offences concerning the date of the election.\n\n\"This is an ongoing investigation, and the commission cannot provide any further details at this time.\"\n\nSaunders was the head of the international department at the Conservative Party, working with London embassies and the Tories' sister parties overseas.\n\nSaunders had previously worked on organising campaign visits in the 2017 and 2019 elections.\n\nLiberal Democrats deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: \"Rishi Sunak must find his backbone and suspend Laura Saunders from the Conservative party whilst this investigation is ongoing.\"\n\n(Image: Archive.)\n\nIt emerged last week that Williams (above), who served as Sunak's parliamentary private secretary and is the Conservative candidate for Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr, was under investigation after he \"put a flutter\" on when the election would take place.\n\nOn Wednesday the Metropolitan Police said they were informed by the Gambling Commission that a police constable from the force's Royalty and Specialist Protection Command was being investigated over the alleged bets.\n\nThe police officer, who has been removed from operational duties, was bailed pending further inquiries after they were taken into custody on Monday on suspicion of misconduct in a public office.\n\nREAD MORE: 30 jobs to go as historic firm shuts Fife site and moves production to England\n\nThe matter has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which said it will \"make a decision on the level of IOPC involvement in due course\".\n\nSunak previously said it was \"very disappointing\" that Mr Williams had allegedly placed a bet on the date of the General Election.\n\nWilliams is alleged to have placed a \u00a3100 bet on a July polling day three days before Sunak named the date as July 4, at a Ladbrokes in his constituency.\n\nHe previously said he had clearly made a \"huge error of judgment\" but refused to say whether he placed a bet on the basis of insider information.\n\nSunak will on Thursday night join three other party leaders in taking part in a BBC Question Time special.\n\nThe two-hour programme will see each leader appear one by one to face questions from the audience.\n\nLabour's Keir Starmer will also take part along with Scotland's First Minister John Swinney (above) for the SNP and Ed Davey for the Liberal Democrats.\n\nThe latest televised election event comes after YouGov said the Conservatives are projected to slump to their \"lowest seat tally in the party's almost 200-year history\" at the election.\n\nREAD MORE: England fans slammed for displaying anti-refugee flag in Germany\n\nYouGov said its latest study projects Labour to secure 425 seats, the Tories 108, the Liberal Democrats 67, the SNP 20, Reform UK five, Plaid Cymru four and the Green Party two.\n\nIt noted such a scenario would hand Starmer a 200-seat majority while it added Reform UK leader Nigel Farage is \"likely\" to win in Clacton.\n\nYouGov used a technique known as multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) to model the outcome of the election in every constituency across Britain.\n\nIt said the estimated seat projections were based on modelled responses from 36,161 adults in England and Wales and 3,818 in Scotland between June 11 and 18.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType":

While betting is legal in the UK, any bets placed with the advantage of insider information could fall within the purview of illegality.\n\n\"The matter was immediately referred to officers in the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards, who opened an investigation, and the officer was also removed from operational duties,\" the Met Police was quoted by the BBC as saying.\n\n\"The officer was subsequently arrested on Monday 17 June on suspicion of misconduct in public office. He was taken into custody and bailed pending further enquiries,\" the Met Police said.\n\nLast week, the 'Guardian' newspaper reported that Sunak's close parliamentary aide, Craig Williams, placed a GBP 100 bet with Ladbrokes at a five to one odds on a July election just three days before the British Indian leader had surprised the country with a summer election, as opposed to a widely expected autumn date later in the year. Williams, 39, is the Tory candidate for Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr in Wales. In a statement, he said his \"flutter\" on the election had prompted some \"routine inquiries\" and that he would \"fully cooperate with these\".\n\n\"I don't want it to be a distraction from the campaign. I should have thought through how it looks,\" he said.\n\nIt has since emerged that a second Conservative candidate, who is married to the party's Director of Campaigns - who would be expected to have knowledge of election matters, is also facing an investigation over allegedly betting on the timing of the general election. While Laura Saunders, the Tory candidate for Bristol North West, is reportedly among those being looked into by the Gambling Commission, her husband Tony Lee is said to have taken \"a leave of absence\" from his role.\n\n\"The Gambling Commission regulates gambling in the interests of consumers and the wider public,\" a commission spokesperson said.\n\n\"Currently, the commission is investigating the possibility of offences concerning the date of the election. This is an ongoing investigation, and the commission cannot provide any further details at this time. We are not confirming or denying the identity of any individuals involved in this investigation,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nUnder Section 42 of the UK's Gambling Act 2005, it is an offence to cheat at gambling or to do anything that allows someone else to cheat. The Conservative Party has said that the Gambling Commission being an independent regulatory body, it would not be \"proper to comment further, until any process is concluded\".\n\nHowever, the Opposition Labour Party has mounted pressure on Sunak, with leader Keir Starmer calling for Saunders to be suspended and said it is \"very telling\" that action had not been taken.\n\n\"If it was one of my candidates, they'd be gone and their feet would not have touched the floor,\" he said.\n\nSunak was asked about the first allegation involving Craig Williams on the sidelines of the G7 Summit in Italy last week, when he described it as \"very disappointing news\" but added that it \"wouldn't be appropriate for me to comment\" while the Gambling Commission's inquiries are ongoing.\n\nIt comes as the embattled Tories continue to be hammered in the pre-election surveys, with almost all analyses forecasting heavy losses for the governing party.

informed by the Gambling Commission that a police constable from the force's Royalty and Specialist Protection Command was being investigated over the alleged bets.\n\nThe police officer, who has been removed from operational duties, was bailed pending further inquiries after they were taken into custody on Monday on suspicion of misconduct in a public office.\n\nThe matter has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which said it will \"make a decision on the level of IOPC involvement in due course\".\n\nLabour's campaign co-ordinator Pat McFadden has written to the Prime Minister calling for the candidates' suspension and questioning \"how wide this scandal goes\".\n\nHe said that given the police officer had been removed from their duties, \"surely you can understand that - yet again - this looks as though there is one rule for members of the Tory party, and another rule for everyone else\".\n\n\"If you can see how wrong that is, will you now at the very least remove your support for Mr Williams and Ms Saunders as Conservative election candidates?\n\n\"The other major question to be addressed is how wide this scandal goes.\n\n\"If some of your most senior colleagues felt they had carte blanche to misuse the inside information they had on the election in order to make a profit, we must ask how many others had advance access to the same information, and placed bets either by themselves, or through their friends and family?\"\n\nLiberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: \"It would be an utter disgrace if Conservative politicians were shown to be more focused on turning a quick buck rather than the needs of the country.\"", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening

While betting is legal in the UK, any bets placed with the advantage of insider information could fall within the purview of illegality.\n\n\"The matter was immediately referred to officers in the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards, who opened an investigation, and the officer was also removed from operational duties,\" the Met Police was quoted by the BBC as saying.\n\nAlso Read | Malaysia Airlines Flight Carrying 138 Passengers Make Emergency Landing at Hyderabad Airport After Takeoff Due to Technical Snag Mid-Air (Watch Video).\n\n\"The officer was subsequently arrested on Monday 17 June on suspicion of misconduct in public office. He was taken into custody and bailed pending further enquiries,\" the Met Police said.\n\nLast week, the 'Guardian' newspaper reported that Sunak's close parliamentary aide, Craig Williams, placed a GBP 100 bet with Ladbrokes at a five to one odds on a July election just three days before the British Indian leader had surprised the country with a summer election, as opposed to a widely expected autumn date later in the year.\n\nWilliams, 39, is the Tory candidate for Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr in Wales. In a statement, he said his \"flutter\" on the election had prompted some \"routine inquiries\" and that he would \"fully cooperate with these\".\n\n\"I don't want it to be a distraction from the campaign. I should have thought through how it looks,\" he said.\n\nIt has since emerged that a second Conservative candidate, who is married to the party's Director of Campaigns - who would be expected to have knowledge of election matters, is also facing an investigation over allegedly betting on the timing of the general election. While Laura Saunders, the Tory candidate for Bristol North West, is reportedly among those being looked into by the Gambling Commission, her husband Tony Lee is said to have taken \"a leave of absence\" from his role.\n\n\"The Gambling Commission regulates gambling in the interests of consumers and the wider public,\" a commission spokesperson said.\n\n\"Currently, the commission is investigating the possibility of offences concerning the date of the election. This is an ongoing investigation, and the commission cannot provide any further details at this time. We are not confirming or denying the identity of any individuals involved in this investigation,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nUnder Section 42 of the UK's Gambling Act 2005, it is an offence to cheat at gambling or to do anything that allows someone else to cheat. The Conservative Party has said that the Gambling Commission being an independent regulatory body, it would not be \"proper to comment further, until any process is concluded\".\n\nHowever, the Opposition Labour Party has mounted pressure on Sunak, with leader Keir Starmer calling for Saunders to be suspended and said it is \"very telling\" that action had not been taken.\n\n\"If it was one of my candidates, they'd be gone and their feet would not have touched the floor,\" he said.\n\nSunak was asked about the first allegation involving Craig Williams on the sidelines of the G7 Summit in Italy last week, when he described it as \"very disappointing news\" but added that it \"wouldn't be appropriate for me to comment\" while the Gambling Commission's inquiries are ongoing.\n\nIt comes as the embattled Tories continue to be hammered in the pre-election surveys, with almost all analyses forecasting heavy losses for the governing party.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType":

But it said in a statement that Lee took a leave of absence from the party on Wednesday.\n\nGove said he could not discuss the details about the allegations because investigations are ongoing.\n\n\"But I can talk about the broad principle and you're absolutely right, it's reprehensible,\" he told the BBC.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak announced May 22 that parliamentary elections would be held on July 4. The date had been a closely guarded secret and many, even those in Sunak's governing Conservative Party, were taken by surprise as a vote had been expected in the fall.\n\nThe broadening scandal came after reports Wednesday that one of Sunak's police bodyguards was arrested over alleged bets on the date of Britain's national election made before it was announced. The constable in the Royalty and Specialist Protection Command was arrested Monday on suspicion of misconduct in public office, the Metropolitan Police force said.\n\nLast week, Sunak aide Craig Williams, who is running to be reelected to Parliament, acknowledged he was being investigated by the Gambling Commission for placing a $128 bet on a July election before the date had been announced.\n\nBetting is popular in the U.K., with bookies offering odds on everything from sports to elections.

Now his odds for winning are getting even longer thanks to a betting scandal that just cost him the guy running the entire campaign.\n\nOne of the Conservative Party candidates running for a parliamentary seat is being probed by the U.K.'s gambling regulator over allegedly using inside information to place a bet on the timing of the upcoming general election, the BBC reported Thursday.\n\nAdding intrigue to the report is the fact that the candidate in question is married to the Tories' director of campaigns -- who is also now reportedly being looked into by the regulator. That shock revelation means the Conservatives' director of campaigning has taken a leave of absence with just two weeks left of the campaign, which was already going absolutely terribly.\n\nPolls released in recent days show that the Conservative Party is on course for its worst result in more than 100 years. They may be reduced to around 70 lawmakers in the 650-seat parliament, with many people claiming that this is the worst campaign in living memory.\n\nSunak caught analysts by surprise last month when he announced that the election would take place on July 4. His team had done a great job keeping the snap election plans hidden from the public.\n\nThe PM was not legally obligated to face the electorate until next January and with polls making grim reading for the Conservatives, some believed a later election would make more strategic sense by affording him more time to close the gap on the leading opposition Labour Party.\n\nJust weeks before Sunak revealed the date, bookmakers had considered November the most likely month that the vote would come, with some reportedly offering odds of up to 6-1 for July.\n\nNow Laura Saunders, the Tory candidate running for the Bristol North West constituency in southwest England, is reportedly being investigated by Britain's Gambling Commission over a bet on the timing of the election (details about the bet, including its value, when it was placed, and the date it backed for the election, have not been revealed).\n\nSaunders' husband Tony Lee, the director of campaigning at the Conservative Party, left the campaign trail on Wednesday, according to the BBC. He, too, is now also facing scrutiny around an alleged election timing bet -- though information on his supposed gamble have also not been disclosed.\n\n\"We have been contacted by the Gambling Commission about a small number of individuals,\" a Conservative Party spokesman told the BBC. \"As the Gambling Commission is an independent body, it wouldn't be proper to comment further, until any process is concluded.\"\n\nSaunders isn't the only aspiring Tory lawmaker to come under scrutiny over betting on the secret snap election. Craig Williams, described in the U.K. press as Sunak's closest aide who is also seeking re-election to his parliamentary seat in Wales, has also apologized after The Guardian revealed he placed a bet worth around $127 backing a July election just three days before Sunak confirmed the date to the nation.\n\nWilliams was accused of placing the bet at a bookies in his own constituency at odds of 5-1, and he released a statement admitting that he \"put a flutter\" on the election. Asked by the BBC last week if he'd had inside information when he took the gamble, Williams evaded the question and said the matter was being dealt with as part of an \"independent process with the Gambling Commission.\" \"I've clearly made a huge error of judgment,\" he added. \"That's for sure. And I apologize.\"\n\nIncredibly, the election betting brouhaha doesn't stop there.\n\nA police officer working in Sunak's close protection team has also been suspended from duty and arrested on Monday over more allegations about bets on the timing of the election. The gambling commission reportedly told Scotland Yard last week it was investigating alleged bets placed by a police constable from the Metropolitan Police's Royalty and Specialist Protection Command, which is tasked with protecting government officials and members of the British Royal Family.\n\nThe officer was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office, according to the BBC. \"The matter was immediately referred to officers in the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards, who opened an investigation, and the officer was also removed from operational duties,\" a Met spokesperson told the broadcaster.\n\nThe bombshell betting allegations are the latest headache for Sunak and his ruling party. His announcement calling the election was a humiliating start as an umbrella-less Sunak was soaked standing in the rain outside Downing Street as he delivered the momentous news. He's since made other unforced campaigning errors, most notably with his inexplicable decision to leave D-Day commemoration events in France early in order to fly back to the U.K. to tape a television interview.", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person",

An inquiry is needed to understand who knew what and when.\"\n\nThe police officer, who has been removed from operational duties, was bailed pending further inquiries after they were taken into custody on Monday on suspicion of misconduct in a public office.\n\nThe matter has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which said it will \"make a decision on the level of IOPC involvement in due course\".\n\nThe Gambling Commission said in response to the officer's arrest: \"Currently the commission is investigating the possibility of offences concerning the date of the election.\n\n\"This is an ongoing investigation, and the commission cannot provide any further details at this time.\"\n\nMr Sunak previously said it was \"very disappointing\" that Mr Williams had allegedly placed a bet on the date of the General Election.\n\nLabour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer and shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves face questions from journalists during a visit to Morrisons in Swindon (Stefan Rousseau/PA)\n\nMr Williams, who was the Tory MP for Montgomery until the election was called, is alleged to have placed a \u00a3100 bet on a July polling day some three days before Mr Sunak named the date as July 4, at a Ladbrokes in his constituency.\n\nHe previously said he had clearly made a \"huge error of judgment\" but refused to say whether he placed a bet on the basis of insider information.\n\nElsewhere on Thursday, Mr Sunak will join three other party leaders in taking part in a BBC Question Time special.\n\nThe two-hour programme will see each leader appear one by one to face questions from the audience.\n\nLabour's Sir Keir Starmer will also take part along with Scotland's First Minister John Swinney for the SNP and Sir Ed Davey for the Liberal Democrats.\n\nThe latest televised election event comes after YouGov said the Conservatives are projected to slump to their \"lowest seat tally in the party's almost 200-year history\" at the election.\n\nYouGov said its latest study projects Labour to secure 425 seats, the Tories 108, the Liberal Democrats 67, the SNP 20, Reform UK five, Plaid Cymru four and the Green Party two.\n\nIt noted such a scenario would hand Sir Keir a 200-seat majority while it added Reform UK leader Nigel Farage is \"likely\" to win in Clacton.\n\nLiberal Democrats leader Sir Ed Davey (Lucy North/PA)\n\nYouGov used a technique known as multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) to model the outcome of the election in every constituency across Britain.\n\nIt said the estimated seat projections were based on modelled responses from 36,161 adults in England and Wales and 3,818 in Scotland between June 11 and 18.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

Craig Williams apologised for making the bet, telling the BBC: \"I clearly made a huge error of judgment that's for sure and I apologize.\"\n\nThe police spokesperson said the country's Gambling Commission continues to lead its probe into \"alleged betting offenses, and our investigation is running in parallel to that.\"\n\nWhen asked for comment, the prime minister's press office told CNN they had nothing to add to the Met police statement.\n\nMeanwhile, on Wednesday afternoon shortly before the police released their statement, Sunak's Conservative Party posted a campaign ad on social media that said, \"If you bet on Labour, you can never win,\" alongside a video of a roulette wheel.\n\nMany people in the comments have since reacted by highlighting the news of the police constable's arrest for allegedly betting on the election.\n\nThe U.K. general election will take place on July 4. Sunak is down around 20 points in opinion polls, which also suggest the opposition Labour Party is on course to win for the first time since 2005.\n\nSunak's floundering campaign was further derailed at the start of June when he apologized for leaving the 80th anniversary commemorations of D-Day early in order to film a TV interview, a decision that prompted anger and disbelief in Britain.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constable", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Constable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protection Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gambling Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Williams_(British_politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Craig Williams (British politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roulette", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roulette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Normandy landings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/6/19/u-k--prime-minister-rishi-sunak-1-6933312-1718830196172.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665618", "eventUri": "eng-9665618", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 372, "textEnd": 379}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 1926, "textEnd": 1932}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The date had been a closely guarded secret and many, even those in Sunak's governing Conservative Party, were taken by surprise as a vote had been expected in the fall.\n\nAlso Read | Germany's Habeck Navigates Delicate China Mission.\n\nBritish media including the PA news agency and the BBC reported Thursday that Tory candidate Laura Saunders, who is married to the Conservative Party's director of campaigning, Tony Lee, is facing a commission investigation into alleged betting offences.\n\nSaunders' attorney, Nama Zarroug, of Astraea Linskills, said she would be co-operating with the commission investigation and that she had nothing further to add.\n\n\"It is inappropriate to conduct any investigation of this kind via the media, and doing so risks jeopardising the work of the Gambling Commission and the integrity of its investigation,\" the statement said.\n\n\"The publication of the BBC's story is premature and is a clear infringement of Ms Saunders' privacy rights. She is considering legal action against the BBC and any other publishers who infringe her privacy rights,\" it added.\n\nThe Conservative Party said Britain's Gambling Commission contacted it over a \"small number of individuals\" in connection with the investigation.\n\nThe party declined to immediately comment on the fresh allegation pending the commission investigation. But it said in a statement that Lee took a leave of absence from the party on Wednesday.\n\nThe broadening scandal came after reports Wednesday that one of Sunak's police bodyguards was arrested over alleged bets on the date of Britain's national election made before it was announced. The constable in the Royalty and Specialist Protection Command was arrested Monday on suspicion of misconduct in public office, the Metropolitan Police force said.\n\nLast week, Sunak aide Craig Williams, who is running to be reelected to Parliament, acknowledged he was being investigated by the Gambling Commission for placing a 100 pound ($128) bet on a July election before the date had been announced.\n\nBetting is popular in the UK, with bookies offering odds on everything from sports to elections.

Now his odds for winning are getting even longer thanks to a betting scandal that just cost him the guy running the entire campaign.\n\nOne of the Conservative Party candidates running for a parliamentary seat is being probed by the U.K.'s gambling regulator over allegedly using inside information to place a bet on the timing of the upcoming general election, the BBC reported Thursday.\n\nAdding intrigue to the report is the fact that the candidate in question is married to the Tories' director of campaigns -- who is also now reportedly being looked into by the regulator. That shock revelation means the Conservatives' director of campaigning has taken a leave of absence with just two weeks left of the campaign, which was already going absolutely terribly.\n\nPolls released in recent days show that the Conservative Party is on course for its worst result in more than 100 years. They may be reduced to around 70 lawmakers in the 650-seat parliament, with many people claiming that this is the worst campaign in living memory.\n\nSunak caught analysts by surprise last month when he announced that the election would take place on July 4. His team had done a great job keeping the snap election plans hidden from the public.\n\nThe PM was not legally obligated to face the electorate until next January and with polls making grim reading for the Conservatives, some believed a later election would make more strategic sense by affording him more time to close the gap on the leading opposition Labour Party.\n\nJust weeks before Sunak revealed the date, bookmakers had considered November the most likely month that the vote would come, with some reportedly offering odds of up to 6-1 for July.\n\nNow Laura Saunders, the Tory candidate running for the Bristol North West constituency in southwest England, is reportedly being investigated by Britain's Gambling Commission over a bet on the timing of the election (details about the bet, including its value, when it was placed, and the date it backed for the election, have not been revealed).\n\nSaunders' husband Tony Lee, the director of campaigning at the Conservative Party, left the campaign trail on Wednesday, according to the BBC. He, too, is now also facing scrutiny around an alleged election timing bet -- though information on his supposed gamble have also not been disclosed.\n\nWorld's Most Successful Political Party Facing Extinction\n\n\"We have been contacted by the Gambling Commission about a small number of individuals,\" a Conservative Party spokesman told the BBC. \"As the Gambling Commission is an independent body, it wouldn't be proper to comment further, until any process is concluded.\"\n\nSaunders isn't the only aspiring Tory lawmaker to come under scrutiny over betting on the secret snap election. Craig Williams, described in the U.K. press as Sunak's closest aide who is also seeking re-election to his parliamentary seat in Wales, has also apologized after The Guardian revealed he placed a bet worth around $127 backing a July election just three days before Sunak confirmed the date to the nation.\n\nWilliams was accused of placing the bet at a bookies in his own constituency at odds of 5-1, and he released a statement admitting that he \"put a flutter\" on the election. Asked by the BBC last week if he'd had inside information when he took the gamble, Williams evaded the question and said the matter was being dealt with as part of an \"independent process with the Gambling Commission.\" \"I've clearly made a huge error of judgment,\" he added. \"That's for sure. And I apologize.\"\n\nIncredibly, the election betting brouhaha doesn't stop there.\n\nA police officer working in Sunak's close protection team has also been suspended from duty and arrested on Monday over more allegations about bets on the timing of the election. The gambling commission reportedly told Scotland Yard last week it was investigating alleged bets placed by a police constable from the Metropolitan Police's Royalty and Specialist Protection Command, which is tasked with protecting government officials and members of the British Royal Family.\n\nThe officer was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office, according to the BBC. \"The matter was immediately referred to officers in the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards, who opened an investigation, and the officer was also removed from operational duties,\" a Met spokesperson told the broadcaster.\n\nThe bombshell betting allegations are the latest headache for Sunak and his ruling party. His announcement calling the election was a humiliating start as an umbrella-less Sunak was soaked standing in the rain outside Downing Street as he delivered the momentous news. He's since made other unforced campaigning errors, most notably with his inexplicable decision to leave D-Day commemoration events in France early in order to fly back to the U.K. to tape a television interview.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said: \"This candidate should be suspended and it's very telling that Rishi Sunak has not already done that. If it was one of my candidates, they'd be gone and their feet would not have touched the floor.\"\n\nThe Liberal Democrats called for a Cabinet Office inquiry. The party's leader, Ed Davey, said: \"I think it's quite awful. It needs a heavy hand from the top.\"\n\nThe cabinet minister Michael Gove said the situation \"doesn't look great\" for the Conservatives but said the commission had to get on with its investigation.\n\nA Tory spokesperson said the party had been contacted by the watchdog about \"a small number of individuals\" who had allegedly placed bets on a July election. A party insider said they were not aware of any more cases beyond those already in the public domain.\n\nLast week the Guardian revealed that the prime minister's closest parliamentary aide, Craig Williams, placed a \u00a3100 bet with Ladbrokes at 5/1 on a July poll, three days before Sunak announced the date.\n\nThe Guardian later revealed that the Gambling Commission asked bookmakers to trawl through all substantial bets placed on a July election.\n\nThe watchdog wrote to all licensed bookmakers requesting information on anyone who stood to gain more than \u00a3199 by betting on a July election in the UK.\n\nSaunders, who has worked for the Tories since 2015, is standing as the party's candidate in Bristol North West, which Labour held on the old boundaries with a 5,700 majority. She has not yet commented on the allegations.\n\nWilliams, 39, is the Tory candidate for Montgomeryshire and Glynd\u0175r in mid-Wales. He had a majority of 12,000 before the boundary change.\n\nAfter the Guardian's revelation, he apologised for placing the bet three days before Sunak announced the date, saying he had made a \"huge error of judgment\". The prime minister said he was \"disappointed\".\n\nThe Guardian understands the Tory party opened a formal HR process when they were notified of the watchdog's inquiries, but has now put that on hold. Lee is on a leave of absence from party headquarters.\n\nThe Tories on Thursday deleted a campaign video that showed a roulette table spinning with the words: \"If you bet on Labour, you can never win.\"\n\nSeparately, one of Sunak's close protection officers was arrested on Monday over alleged bets about the timing of the election, on suspicion of misconduct in public office.\n\nThe Metropolitan police said they were contacted last Friday by the commission, which informed the force that it was looking into alleged bets related to the timing of an election by a constable from the Met's royalty and specialist protection command.\n\n\"The matter was immediately referred to officers in the Met's directorate of professional standards, who opened an investigation, and the officer was also removed from operational duties,\" the force said.\n\nThe matter has also been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), the watchdog responsible for overseeing the system for handling complaints made against police forces in England and Wales.\n\nThe Met added: \"The Gambling Commission continues to lead the investigation into the alleged betting offences, and our investigation is running in parallel to that.\"\n\nThe commission said: \"Currently the commission is investigating the possibility of offences concerning the date of the election.\n\n\"This is an ongoing investigation, and the commission cannot provide any further details at this time. We are not confirming or denying the identity of any individuals involved in this investigation.\"\n\nLabour's campaign chief, Pat McFadden, who has written to Sunak urging the Tories to withdraw support from Saunders and Williams while they are being looked into, said the Tories needed to say \"how wide this scandal goes\".\n\nHe added: \"This looks as though there is one rule for members of the Tory party, and another rule for everyone else, specifically on this occasion a serving police officer.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"},

As the Gambling Commission is an independent body, it wouldn't be proper to comment further, until any process is concluded.\"\n\nThe candidate has been approached for comment by the PA news agency.\n\nLiberal Democrats deputy leader Daisy Cooper, responding to news of the police officer's arrest, said: \"Rishi Sunak must call a Cabinet Office inquiry into what is shaping up to be yet another scandal at the heart of Government.\n\n\"This stinks of yet more sleaze and answers are needed. An inquiry is needed to understand who knew what and when.\"\n\nThe officer, who has been removed from operational duties, was bailed pending further inquiries after they were taken into custody on Monday on suspicion of misconduct in a public office, according to the Met.\n\nThe matter has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which said it will \"make a decision on the level of IOPC involvement in due course.\"\n\nAccording to the Crown Prosecution Service's website, misconduct in a public office \"concerns serious wilful abuse or neglect of the power or responsibilities\".\n\nThose who can be accused of the offence include judges, bishops, MPs, civil servants, army officers, prison staff and police constables.\n\nThe Gambling Commission said in response to the officer's arrest: \"Currently the commission is investigating the possibility of offences concerning the date of the election.\n\n\"This is an ongoing investigation, and the commission cannot provide any further details at this time.\"\n\nMr Sunak previously said it was \"very disappointing\" that Mr Williams had allegedly placed a bet on the date of the General Election.\n\nMr Williams, who was the Tory MP for Montgomery until the election was called, is alleged to have placed a \u00a3100 bet on a July polling day some three days before Mr Sunak named the date as July 4th, at a Ladbrokes in his constituency.\n\nHe previously said he had clearly made a \"huge error of judgment\" but refused to say whether he placed a bet on the basis of insider information.\n\nElsewhere on Thursday, Mr Sunak will join three other party leaders in taking part in a BBC Question Time special.\n\nThe two-hour programme will see each leader appear one by one to face questions from the audience.\n\nLabour's Sir Keir Starmer will also take part along with Scotland's First Minister John Swinney for the SNP and Sir Ed Davey for the Liberal Democrats.\n\nThe latest televised election event comes after YouGov said the Conservatives are projected to slump to their \"lowest seat tally in the party's almost 200-year history\" at the election.\n\nYouGov said its latest study projects Labour to secure 425 seats, the Tories 108, the Liberal Democrats 67, SNP 20, Reform UK five, Plaid Cymru four and the Green Party two.\n\nIt noted such a scenario would hand Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer a 200-seat majority while it added Reform UK leader Nigel Farage is \"likely\" to win in Clacton.\n\nYouGov used a technique known as multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) to model the outcome of the election in every constituency across Britain.\n\nIt said the estimated seat projections were based on modelled responses from 36,161 adults in England and Wales and 3,818 in Scotland between June 11th and 18th.\n\nHousing policy will also be a focus on Thursday, with Communities Secretary Michael Gove leading the attack on Labour's approach to the issue.\n\nThe Tories claim that Labour not matching their commitments will amount to a \"first-time buyer tax\" for those trying to get on the property ladder.\n\nLabour countered by saying: \"This reeks of desperation from the Tories.\"\n\nThe party added that it intends to \"get Britain building\" and help working families onto the housing ladder.\n\nThe Lib Dems will warn about the \"pothole postcode lottery\", as they insist \u00a3300 million should be spent over the next parliament to fill 1.2 million potholes a year.", "source": {"uri": "breakingnews.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breaking News.ie"},

Craig Williams apologised for making the bet, telling the BBC: \"I clearly made a huge error of judgment that's for sure and I apologize.\"\n\nThe police spokesperson said the country's Gambling Commission continues to lead its probe into \"alleged betting offenses, and our investigation is running in parallel to that.\"\n\nWhen asked for comment, the prime minister's press office told CNN they had nothing to add to the Met police statement.\n\nMeanwhile, on Wednesday afternoon shortly before the police released their statement, Sunak's Conservative Party posted a campaign ad on social media that said, \"If you bet on Labour, you can never win,\" alongside a video of a roulette wheel.\n\nMany people in the comments have since reacted by highlighting the news of the police constable's arrest for allegedly betting on the election.\n\nThe UK general election will take place on July 4. Sunak is down around 20 points in opinion polls, which also suggest the opposition Labour Party is on course to win for the first time since 2005.\n\nSunak's floundering campaign was further derailed at the start of June when he apologized for leaving the 80th anniversary commemorations of D-Day early in order to film a TV interview, a decision that prompted anger and disbelief in Britain.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The date had been a closely guarded secret and many, even those in Sunak's governing Conservative Party, were taken by surprise as a vote had been expected in the fall.\n\nBritish media including the PA news agency and the BBC reported Thursday that Tory candidate Laura Saunders, who is married to the Conservative Party's director of campaigning, Tony Lee, is facing a commission investigation into alleged betting offences.\n\nSaunders' attorney, Nama Zarroug, of Astraea Linskills, said she would be co-operating with the commission investigation and that she had nothing further to add.\n\n\"It is inappropriate to conduct any investigation of this kind via the media, and doing so risks jeopardizing the work of the Gambling Commission and the integrity of its investigation,'' the statement said.\n\n\"The publication of the BBC's story is premature and is a clear infringement of Ms Saunders' privacy rights. She is considering legal action against the BBC and any other publishers who infringe her privacy rights,\" it added.\n\nThe Conservative Party said Britain's Gambling Commission contacted it over a \"small number of individuals'' in connection with the investigation.\n\nThe party declined to immediately comment on the fresh allegation pending the commission investigation. But it said in a statement that Lee took a leave of absence from the party on Wednesday.\n\nThe broadening scandal came after reports Wednesday that one of Sunak's police bodyguards was arrested over alleged bets on the date of Britain's national election made before it was announced. The constable in the Royalty and Specialist Protection Command was arrested Monday on suspicion of misconduct in public office, the Metropolitan Police force said.\n\nLast week, Sunak aide Craig Williams, who is running to be reelected to Parliament, acknowledged he was being investigated by the Gambling Commission for placing a 100 pound ($128) bet on a July election before the date had been announced.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBetting is popular in the U.K., with bookies offering odds on everything from sports to elections.

He should also suspend this candidate. As a candidate of mine, they'd be gone - their feet wouldn't have touched the floor. And it's very telling of Rishi Sunak that he hasn't taken that action. But there is a bigger picture here.\"\n\nDescribing the most recent reports as \"astonishing\", Sir Keir added: \"The Government and Rishi Sunak just need to take action. He needs to account for exactly who knew what, but when you've got a candidate standing for election in two weeks who's involved, they've got to go - they've got to be suspended.\n\n\"I don't know why he hasn't done that. I think it is a real measure of his leadership, or lack of leadership.\"\n\nMr Lee has taken a break from his role after it emerged that Ms Sanders is facing an inquiry by the Gambling Commission. She previously worked at Conservative Party headquarters.\n\nThe BBC reported on Thursday morning that she is married to Mr Lee. The latter's LinkedIn page now appears to have been taken down. A summary on Google shows he was listed as the party's director of campaigning.\n\nMr Williams, who is standing for re-election in Montgomeryshire, has not disputed reports in The Guardian last week that he bet on the election being held in July three days before the announcement was made by Mr Sunak. He admitted to having a \"flutter\" and went on to apologise for a \"huge error of judgment\".\n\nApproached about Ms Saunders' case, a Conservative Party spokesman: \"We have been contacted by the Gambling Commission about a small number of individuals.

It is not known when the alleged bet was placed or for how much money.\n\nMs Saunders is understood to have most recently worked in the party's International Division - a department of the Tory campaign headquarters which communicates with other centre right parties worldwide. Between 2015 and 2019 she reportedly worked in the operations and tours department organising campaign visits by successive Prime Ministers and Chancellors.\n\nAsked about Ms Saunders's case, a Conservative spokesman said: \"We have been contacted by the Gambling Commission about a small number of individuals. As the Gambling Commission is an independent body, it wouldn't be proper to comment further, until any process is concluded.\"\n\nCommunities Secretary Michael Gove said reports people were being investigated over General Election bets was \"deeply disappointing and upsetting\". He said: \"I don't know all the details but obviously it is not something anyone should be doing, should've done. It's wrong but there's a process now.

In a statement last week, he conceded he had \"put a flutter\" on the date and should have \"thought through how it looks\". He apologised and said he had made a \"huge error of judgement\" over an alleged bet on the timing of the general election.\n\nSeparately a police officer in Mr Sunak's close protection team has been arrested over an alleged bet on the timing of the General Election. The male officer was suspended from his role before being arrested by police \"on suspicion of misconduct in public office\" on Monday. He was taken into custody and bailed pending further enquiries.\n\nIn a statement, a Met spokesman told the Mirror: \"The matter was immediately referred to officers in the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards, who opened an investigation, and the officer was also removed from operational duties.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sophie_huskisson@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Sophie Huskisson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_North_West_(UK_Parliament_constituency)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bristol North West (UK Parliament constituency)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gambling Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Levelling_Up,_Housing_and_Communities", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Gove", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Gove"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Williams_(British_politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Craig Williams (British politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33068421.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screenshot-2024-06-20-at-073324.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665618", "eventUri": "eng-9665618", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper\n\nIt emerged last week that Craig Williams, who served as Mr Sunak's parliamentary private secretary and is the Conservative candidate for Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr, was under investigation after he \"put a flutter\" on when the election would take place.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, the BBC reported a second Conservative candidate was being examined by the Gambling Commission over an alleged bet also connected to the timing of the election.\n\nA Conservative Party spokesman told the BBC: \"We have been contacted by the Gambling Commission about a small number of individuals. As the Gambling Commission is an independent body, it wouldn't be proper to comment further, until any process is concluded.\"\n\nThe candidate has been approached for comment by the PA news agency.\n\nLiberal Democrats deputy leader Daisy Cooper, responding to news of the police officer's arrest, said: \"Rishi Sunak must call a Cabinet Office inquiry into what is shaping up to be yet another scandal at the heart of Government.\n\n\"This stinks of yet more sleaze and answers are needed. An inquiry is needed to understand who knew what and when.\"\n\nThe officer, who has been removed from operational duties, was bailed pending further inquiries after they were taken into custody on Monday on suspicion of misconduct in a public office, according to the Met.\n\nCurrently the commission is investigating the possibility of offences concerning the date of the election. Gabling Commission\n\nThe matter has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which said it will \"make a decision on the level of IOPC involvement in due course.\"\n\nAccording to the Crown Prosecution Service's website, misconduct in a public office \"concerns serious wilful abuse or neglect of the power or responsibilities\".\n\nThose who can be accused of the offence include judges, bishops, MPs, civil servants, army officers, prison staff and police constables.\n\nThe Gambling Commission said in response to the officer's arrest: \"Currently the commission is investigating the possibility of offences concerning the date of the election.\n\n\"This is an ongoing investigation, and the commission cannot provide any further details at this time.\"\n\nMr Sunak previously said it was \"very disappointing\" that Mr Williams had allegedly placed a bet on the date of the General Election.\n\nLabour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer and shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves face questions from journalists during a visit to Morrisons in Swindon (Stefan Rousseau/PA)\n\nMr Williams, who was the Tory MP for Montgomery until the election was called, is alleged to have placed a \u00a3100 bet on a July polling day some three days before Mr Sunak named the date as July 4, at a Ladbrokes in his constituency.\n\nHe previously said he had clearly made a \"huge error of judgment\" but refused to say whether he placed a bet on the basis of insider information.\n\nElsewhere on Thursday, Mr Sunak will join three other party leaders in taking part in a BBC Question Time special.\n\nThe two-hour programme will see each leader appear one by one to face questions from the audience.\n\nLabour's Sir Keir Starmer will also take part along with Scotland's First Minister John Swinney for the SNP and Sir Ed Davey for the Liberal Democrats.\n\nThe latest televised election event comes after YouGov said the Conservatives are projected to slump to their \"lowest seat tally in the party's almost 200-year history\" at the election.\n\nYouGov said its latest study projects Labour to secure 425 seats, the Tories 108, the Liberal Democrats 67, SNP 20, Reform UK five, Plaid Cymru four and the Green Party two.\n\nIt noted such a scenario would hand Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer a 200-seat majority while it added Reform UK leader Nigel Farage is \"likely\" to win in Clacton.\n\nLiberal Democrats leader Sir Ed Davey (Lucy North/PA)\n\nYouGov used a technique known as multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) to model the outcome of the election in every constituency across Britain.\n\nIt said the estimated seat projections were based on modelled responses from 36,161 adults in England and Wales and 3,818 in Scotland between June 11 and 18.\n\nHousing policy will also be a focus on Thursday, with Communities Secretary Michael Gove leading the attack on Labour's approach to the issue.\n\nThe Tories claim that Labour not matching their commitments will amount to a \"first-time buyer tax\" for those trying to get on the property ladder.\n\nLabour countered by saying: \"This reeks of desperation from the Tories.\"\n\nThe party added that it intends to \"get Britain building\" and help working families onto the housing ladder.\n\nThe Lib Dems will warn about the \"pothole postcode lottery\", as they insist \u00a3300 million should be spent over the next parliament to fill 1.2 million potholes a year.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"},

The rapidly escalating gambling scandal is the latest misfortune to unfold for Sunak, who is forecast to lose power on July 4 after a campaign characterised by gaffes that followed his surprise announcement of an early vote.\n\nThe Conservative Party confirmed that campaign director Tony Lee had taken a leave of absence. The statement followed news reports that the Gambling Commission was looking into allegations of improper betting by Lee and his wife Laura Saunders, a candidate for parliament in Bristol. British bookmakers allow bets on politics, and the timing of an election is a popular bet. But placing bets with insider knowledge is a crime.\n\n\"We have been contacted by the Gambling Commission about a small number of individuals. As the Gambling Commission is an independent body, it wouldn't be proper to comment further, until any process is concluded,\" a Conservative spokesperson said. The scandal has already engulfed another Conservative parliamentary candidate, Craig Williams, a close aide to Sunak, who apologised last week for placing a bet on when the election would happen.\n\nLondon police said on Wednesday that they had arrested a police officer working in a special protection unit over alleged bets made on the timing of the election. The BBC reported the officer worked as one of Sunak's bodyguards. A spokesperson for the Gambling Commission said it was investigating \"the possibility of offences concerning the date of the election\" but could not provide further details at this stage.\n\n\"We are not confirming or denying the identity of any individuals involved in this investigation,\" the spokesperson added. Senior Conservative minister Michael Gove told LBC Radio it was \"beyond bad to use insider information like that to secure an advantage\".\n\nPolls forecast the Conservatives are set to lose the July 4 election, potentially in an historic wipeout. Sunak's party was already far behind in the polls when he announced the election, and has failed to narrow the gap after a campaign marred by blunders, including a decision by Sunak to leave early from a ceremony for the anniversary of D-Day.

As the Gambling Commission is an independent body, it wouldn't be proper to comment further, until any process is concluded.\"\n\nThe candidate has been approached for comment by the PA news agency.\n\nLiberal Democrats deputy leader Daisy Cooper, responding to news of the police officer's arrest, said: \"Rishi Sunak must call a Cabinet Office inquiry into what is shaping up to be yet another scandal at the heart of Government.\n\n\"This stinks of yet more sleaze and answers are needed. An inquiry is needed to understand who knew what and when.\"\n\nThe officer, who has been removed from operational duties, was bailed pending further inquiries after they were taken into custody on Monday on suspicion of misconduct in a public office, according to the Met.\n\nAccording to the Crown Prosecution Service's website, misconduct in a public office \"concerns serious wilful abuse or neglect of the power or responsibilities\".\n\nThose who can be accused of the offence include judges, bishops, MPs, civil servants, army officers, prison staff and police constables.\n\nThe Gambling Commission said in response to the officer's arrest: \"Currently the commission is investigating the possibility of offences concerning the date of the election.\n\n\"This is an ongoing investigation, and the commission cannot provide any further details at this time.\"\n\nMr Sunak previously said it was \"very disappointing\" that Mr Williams had allegedly placed a bet on the date of the General Election.\n\nHe previously said he had clearly made a \"huge error of judgment\" but refused to say whether he placed a bet on the basis of insider information.\n\nElsewhere on Thursday, Mr Sunak will join three other party leaders in taking part in a BBC Question Time special.\n\nThe two-hour programme will see each leader appear one by one to face questions from the audience.\n\nLabour's Sir Keir Starmer will also take part along with Scotland's First Minister John Swinney for the SNP and Sir Ed Davey for the Liberal Democrats.\n\nThe latest televised election event comes after YouGov said the Conservatives are projected to slump to their \"lowest seat tally in the party's almost 200-year history\" at the election.\n\nYouGov said its latest study projects Labour to secure 425 seats, the Tories 108, the Liberal Democrats 67, SNP 20, Reform UK five, Plaid Cymru four and the Green Party two.\n\nIt noted such a scenario would hand Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer a 200-seat majority while it added Reform UK leader Nigel Farage is \"likely\" to win in Clacton.\n\nIt said the estimated seat projections were based on modelled responses from 36,161 adults in England and Wales and 3,818 in Scotland between June 11 and 18.\n\nHousing policy will also be a focus on Thursday, with Communities Secretary Michael Gove leading the attack on Labour's approach to the issue.\n\nThe Tories claim that Labour not matching their commitments will amount to a \"first-time buyer tax\" for those trying to get on the property ladder.\n\nLabour countered by saying: \"This reeks of desperation from the Tories.\"\n\nThe party added that it intends to \"get Britain building\" and help working families onto the housing ladder.\n\nThe Lib Dems will warn about the \"pothole postcode lottery\", as they insist \u00a3300 million should be spent over the next parliament to fill 1.2 million potholes a year.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"},

An inquiry is needed to understand who knew what and when,\" she added.\n\nSunak announced that a general election would be held on July 4, taking his own party by surprise as he still had six months to call a vote.\n\nThe Tories are expected to be dumped out of office after 14 years in office, with polls consistently putting the main opposition Labour party some 20 points ahead.\n\nTwo polls published on Wednesday predicted a record win for Labour, eclipsing even the landslide win for former leader Tony Blair in 1997, and a historic drubbing for the Tories.\n\nPollsters YouGov said the Conservatives -- the party of Margaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill -- could slump to their \"lowest seat tally in the party's almost 200-year history.\"\n\nAs well as criticism of Sunak's decision to go early, the Tory campaign has been widely criticized for a series of gaffes, including a photocall in Belfast near where the doomed Titanic was built.\n\nSunak's own already dire personal ratings were also hit after he left an international event to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day early.\n\nThe Met said the officer, a member of the force's Royalty and Specialist Protection Command, was no longer on operational duties.\n\nThe officer was taken into custody on Monday on suspicion of misconduct in a public office, then released on bail pending further inquiries.\n\nA referral has been made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, the watchdog confirmed.\n\nThe allegations against Williams came to light last week. He is alleged to have placed a \u00a3100 ($127) bet on a July date for the election three days before Sunak called the vote.\n\nSunak and other party leaders, including Labour's Keir Starmer, take part in another pre-election television grilling later on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "arab.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@arab.news", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gambling Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Williams_(British_politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Craig Williams (British politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisy_Cooper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daisy Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_1974_United_Kingdom_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "February 1974 United Kingdom general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Democrats (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Gove", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Gove"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Office_for_Police_Conduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent Office for Police Conduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Margaret Thatcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Normandy landings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winston Churchill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouGov", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouGov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tony Blair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x371_watermarksaudi/public/main-image/2024/06/20/4425971-252778000.jpg?itok=jmMPYzkJ", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665618", "eventUri": "eng-9665618", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 1575, "textEnd": 1581}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Mr Lee has since taken a leave of absence after it came to light he was also being probed by the GC.\n\nAccording to the BBC, which first named Ms Saunders as the candidate under investigation, she worked most recently at the party's international division at Conservative Campaign Headquarters, which works with other centre-right parties around the world.\n\nWhat are the rules for MPs and others on betting with inside knowledge?\n\nUsing confidential information to gain an unfair advantage when betting may constitute a criminal offence.\n\nGamblers are not allowed to use inside information to place a bet or to instruct someone else to do so on their behalf.\n\nThey are also not allowed to pass inside information on to someone else which they use for betting.\n\nAdditionally, the MPs' code of conduct bars members from \"causing significant damage to the reputation and integrity of the house\".\n\nAn MP placing a bet with inside knowledge is likely to cross this threshold.\n\nWho else is being investigated?\n\nMs Saunders became the second Tory candidate to be investigated by the Gambling Commission over claims of having insider knowledge about the 4 July poll.\n\nCraig Williams, the PM's parliamentary private secretary, admitted placing a bet on the election prior to Mr Sunak's announcement after he was approached by a journalist.\n\nThe 39-year-old Tory candidate for Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr placed a \u00a3100 bet with 5-1 odds at Ladbrokes, meaning he would have won \u00a3500, but his name was raised as potentially a \"politically exposed person\", so the wager was not registered.\n\nThe bookmaker is believed to be particularly cautious over \"novelty\" betting markets such as the general election.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, which first reported the story, the bet was placed via an online account that would have required Mr Williams to provide personal details, including his date of birth and debit card. The bookmaker also knows the location of the bet.\n\nLadbrokes declined to comment on the incident but the Gambling Commission issued a statement confirming that it was investigating.\n\nMr Williams apologised after admiting that he had placed a wager on the bet, but refused to comment further while the GC carried out its probe.\n\n\"I clearly made a huge error of judgment, that's for sure, and I apologise,\" he told. \"I will not be expanding on my statement because it's an independent process.\"\n\nClose protection officer arrested\n\nA police officer in Mr Sunak's close protection team was arrested and suspended over alleged bets about the timing of the general election.\n\nThe police constable from the Met's Royalty and Specialist Protection Command was arrested on 17 June on suspicion of misconduct in public office after the betting watchdog contacted the force last Friday.\n\nThe officer was taken into custody and bailed pending further enquiries, with the case being referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, according to the Met.\n\nWhat have senior Tories said about the scandal?\n\nMr Sunak said it was \"very disappointing\" news that Mr Williams was being investigated by the GC.\n\n\"Well, it's very disappointing news and you would have seen Craig Williams say that it was a huge error of judgement,\" he told broadcasters at the G7 summit earlier in June.\n\nMichael Gove, the outgoing cabinet minister, said it would be \"reprehensible\" to use inside information to bet on the general election date.\n\n\"If people have used inside information to place bets, that is deeply wrong,\" he told the BBC on Thursday morning after Ms Saunders's case came to light.\n\n\"What I can't do is sort of get too much into the detail of the case while an investigation is going on.\n\n\"But I can talk about the broad principle and you're absolutely right, it's reprehensible.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo

specifically on whether others are involved in the scandal.\n\nIn a letter to the PM, Pat McFadden, the party's national campaign co-ordinator, said: \"If some of your most senior colleagues felt they had carte blanche to misuse the inside information they had on the election in order to make a profit, we must ask how many others had advance access to the same information, and placed bets either by themselves, or through their friends and family?\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gambling Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Williams_(British_politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Craig Williams (British politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomeryshire_(UK_Parliament_constituency)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Montgomeryshire (UK Parliament constituency)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_McFadden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat McFadden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_Time_(TV_programme)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Question Time (TV programme)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/huffpost_uk_744/4d42b6195b645733f2eebc60d00853dd", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665618", "eventUri": "eng-9665618", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

This follows a similar probe into another candidate, Craig Williams. The ongoing investigations have raised concerns ahead of the election, which forecasts predict will be challenging for the party.\n\nBritain's gambling regulator is investigating a second candidate from Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Conservative Party over an alleged bet relating to the timing of the July 4 election, according to local media reports on Thursday. The reports named the candidate as Laura Saunders, who is running for a seat in the southwest English city of Bristol. The BBC said she is married to the party's campaign director.\n\nSaunders did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. A spokesperson for the Gambling Commission said it was investigating \"the possibility of offences concerning the date of the election,\" when asked about the reports.\n\nFurther details could not be provided given the ongoing investigation, the spokesperson added. It comes after another Conservative candidate and close aide to Sunak, Craig Williams, last week apologised after he placed a bet on when the election would happen, also triggering an investigation by the gambling regulator.\n\n\"We have been contacted by the Gambling Commission about a small number of individuals. As the Gambling Commission is an independent body, it wouldn't be proper to comment further, until any process is concluded,\" a Conservative Party spokesman told the BBC. The Conservative Party declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.\n\nSunak's announcement last month that the election, which polls forecast the Conservatives are set to lose, would be held on July 4 took most lawmakers and voters by surprise. London police said on Wednesday that they had arrested a police officer working in a special protection unit over alleged bets made on the timing of the election. The BBC reported the officer worked as part of Sunak's close protection team.

With only weeks until polling day, the Conservatives' director of campaigning Tony Lee was forced to take a leave of absence last night amid reports both he and his wife Laura Saunders, candidate for North West Bristol, are being investigated by the Gambling Commission.\n\nIt is understood a bet had been placed on the timing of the General Election. Ms Saunders and Mr Lee are the latest people with links to the Tory party or No 10 caught up in allegations about betting on the date of the July 4 contest, after Rishi Sunak's aide Craig Williams last week apologised for putting a \u00a3100 bet on a July election three days before it was announced. Elsewhere, one of the Prime Minister's police protection officers has been arrested by the Met for a bet on the election.\n\nSpeaking to reporters this morning, Levelling Up minister Michael Gove admitted the situation \"doesn't look great\" for the Conservatives. On the Tory campaign battle bus in London, he told broadcasters: \"Obviously, it doesn't look great. And, obviously, the conclusions lots of people are drawing are not at all great. But I don't know all the facts at the moment. I'd be loath to condemn without there being an investigation that's been concluded.\"\n\nLabour and the Liberal Democrats have called for the Tories to suspend both Ms Saunders and Mr Williams. Asked about the Tory director of campaigns taking a leave of absence, Keir Starmer told The Mirror: \"It's astonishing that we're in this place. However many people have already been identified as potentially involved in this. Rishi Sunak just needs to take action, he needs to account for exactly who knew what.\n\n\"But also when you've got a candidate standing for election in two weeks who was involved, they've got to go. They've got to be suspended and I don't know why he hasn't done that.

The BBC reported that Saunders in being investigated for placing a bet on the timing of the general election, which is due to take place on July 4.\n\nPrior to standing as a candidate, Saunders worked for the Conservative Party. UK media outlets also reported that she is married to Tony Lee, the Conservative Party's director of campaigning. Lee is now taking a leave of absence from his role, with just two weeks until the vote, according to the BBC.\n\nSaunders has declined to comment on the matter. A Conservative spokesperson told CNN in a statement: \"We have been contacted by the Gambling Commission about a small number of individuals. As the Gambling Commission is an independent body, it wouldn't be proper to comment further, until any process is concluded.\"\n\nSaunders is the second Conservative candidate being looked into by the UK's Gambling Commission.\n\nCraig Williams, who worked as an aide to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in parliament, is alleged to have placed \u00a3100 ($127) on the election taking place in July just three days before the prime minister officially made the announcement.\n\nWilliams told the BBC last week: \"I clearly made a huge error of judgement that's for sure and I apologize... I will not be expanding on (my) statement because it's an independent process ... The Gambling Commission are looking at it now.\"\n\nThe story became worse for Sunak on Wednesday, after it was reported that a police officer working on the prime minister's security staff was also being looked into.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said in a statement: \"The matter was immediately referred to officers in the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards, who opened an investigation, and the officer was also removed from operational duties.\"\n\nThe official opposition Labour Party has said the scandal is just the latest example of the Conservative Party's pattern of cronyism, in reference to the way that lucrative government contracts were handed to people associated with the Conservative Party during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\"It stinks. And the public will come to their own conclusions. It's not a good look,\" a Labour source told CNN.\n\nSunak and the Conservatives have been polling behind Labour since November 2021 and as things stand the Conservatives are expected to suffer a historic defeat on July 4. It would be the first time Labour has entered power from opposition since 1997 and would end 14 years of controversial government by the Conservative Party.\n\nFinal results will not be known until July 5. If Sunak does lose the election, he will leave office the same day.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

The BBC reported that Saunders in being investigated for placing a bet on the timing of the general election, which is due to take place on July 4.\n\nPrior to standing as a candidate, Saunders worked for the Conservative Party. UK media outlets also reported that she is married to Tony Lee, the Conservative Party's director of campaigning.

A Conservative spokesperson told CNN in a statement: \"We have been contacted by the Gambling Commission about a small number of individuals. As the Gambling Commission is an independent body, it wouldn't be proper to comment further, until any process is concluded.\"\n\nSaunders is the second Conservative candidate being looked into by the UK's Gambling Commission.\n\nCraig Williams, who worked as an aide to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in parliament, is alleged to have placed \u00a3100 ($127) on the election taking place in July just three days before the prime minister officially made the announcement.\n\nWilliams told the BBC last week: \"I clearly made a huge error of judgement that's for sure and I apologize...

And the public will come to their own conclusions. It's not a good look,\" a Labour source told CNN.\n\nSunak and the Conservatives have been polling behind Labour since November 2021 and as things stand the Conservatives are expected to suffer a historic defeat on July 4. It would be the first time Labour has entered power from opposition since 1997 and would end 14 years of controversial government by the Conservative Party.\n\nFinal results will not be known until July 5.

The government, Rishi Sunak, just needs to take action. He needs to account for exactly who knew what,\" he said.\n\nLabour's campaign co-ordinator Pat McFadden separately wrote to Sunak and said the claims were \"a pattern of behaviour\" in the Tories focused on making \"a quick profit\".\n\nEd Davey, who leads the smaller Liberal Democrats, said the allegations smacked of \"corruption\". \"It needs to have a heavy hand from the top,\" he added.\n\nWipe-out?\n\nSunak announced the date of the election on May 22, in a rain-soaked statement outside Downing Street, taking his own party by surprise as he still had six months to call a vote.\n\nCritics lambasted him for not using an umbrella and the campaign has hardly shifted the dial in his favour since then, even with indications the British economy has turned a corner.\n\nOne reporter asked him if he was the captain of a sinking ship at a photocall in Belfast, near where the doomed Titanic was built.\n\nThis week, he was ignored by a flock of sheep as he tried to feed them in southwest England while personally his ratings have suffered after he left early from a D-Day 80th anniversary commemoration event.\n\nTwo polls published on Wednesday predicted a record win for Labour, eclipsing even the landslide victory for former leader Tony Blair in 1997, and a historic drubbing for the Tories.\n\nPollsters YouGov said the Conservatives could slump to their \"lowest seat tally in the party's almost 200-year history\".\n\nSunak could even become the first sitting prime minister to lose his own seat, according to a Savanta survey.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said its officer, a member of the Royalty and Specialist Protection Command, was held on Monday on suspicion of misconduct in a public office, then released on bail.\n\nThe force has referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.\n\nPromoted\n\nListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nThe allegations against Williams came to light last week.

According to a statement issued by the Metropolitan Police, which covers London, the officer has been relieved from operational duties and was arrested on Monday \"on suspicion of misconduct in public office.\" The force clarified that the officer, who has not been named, has been released on bail \"pending further enquiries.\"\n\nNews of the arrest surfaced a week after Craig Williams, a Conservative lawmaker and parliamentary aide to Sunak, publicly admitted placing a bet on the election date before July 4 was formally announced. \"I put a flutter on the general election some weeks ago,\" Williams acknowledged on social media, expressing willingness to fully cooperate with inquiries by the Gambling Commission, the regulatory body overseeing the betting industry in Britain, according to the NYT report. \"I don't want it to be a distraction from the campaign,\" Williams stated, reflecting on his actions. \"I should have thought through how it looks.\"\n\nUnder British election regulations, Prime Minister Sunak had the authority to choose the election date, as long as it fell before late January next year. Despite earlier indications that the election would occur in the latter half of the year, Sunak opted for July 4, a decision that caught many political analysts off guard. The Metropolitan Police revealed in their statement that they were alerted by the Gambling Commission on Friday regarding allegations involving an officer from the Royalty and Specialist Protection Command placing a bet. This command, a division of the Metropolitan Police, includes officers responsible for close protection duties for high-profile figures such as the prime minister and members of the royal family, requiring utmost discretion, as reported by NYT.\n\nThe matter has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), the oversight body responsible for investigating serious allegations against officers in England and Wales. In response to inquiries, the Metropolitan Police reiterated their commitment to ensuring transparency and accountability within their ranks. The incident has raised concerns about the conduct of officers in sensitive roles and underscores the importance of upholding public trust and integrity in law enforcement.\n\nPrime Minister Sunak's surprise election announcement and the subsequent fallout from the betting allegations have added a new dimension to the political landscape, prompting scrutiny and calls for clarity regarding the ethical standards expected of those in positions of public trust. As the investigation progresses, both the Metropolitan Police and the IOPC are expected to conduct thorough inquiries to determine the extent of any misconduct and to uphold the principles of impartiality and professionalism in policing, The New York Times reported.

They are literally stealing the lightbulbs on the way out the door. This is another shocking scandal.\"\n\nGallows humour among Tory MPs was summed up by former leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, who is facing defeat in his Chingford and Woodford Green seat. He told the News Agents podcast: \"They say it is Armageddon, but I Armageddon on with it here in this constituency.\"\n\nThe scandal, which also involves one of the police officers on Mr Sunak's close protection team, and his chief parliamentary aide Craig Williams, broken as postal voters are already completing and returning their ballots.\n\nTory candidates and MPs have told The Independent that the scandal, coming after anger over Mr Sunak leaving D-Day commemorations early, is \"absolutely killing\" their hopes of getting elected.\n\nSome are even understood to be discussing publicly disowning the prime minister as a group before the election in a bid to survive while dozens have privately confessed they are already disowning him in conversations with voters on the doorsteps.\n\nSuspicion has been heightened after a data search carried out by the Financial Times appeared to show a surge in bets on a July election in the 24 hours before Mr Sunak made his surprise announcement, with up to \u00a35,900 wagered just before 20 May.\n\nMetropolitan Police have suspended and arrested the unnamed protection officer who is alleged to have bet on the election date before it was announced.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer has led calls for those involved - including Ms Saunders, who is the Bristol North East candidate and worked for the party since 2015 - to be investigated by police.\n\nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross urged Mr Sunak to disown those involved. He said: \"The investigation has been set up to look at these allegations, and if anyone is guilty of using [information] that they were privy to, to place bets, to financially benefit from that, it is completely unacceptable, it is completely wrong and they should no longer have the support.\n\n\"But there is an independent process and I think it's right that due process is allowed to continue.\"\n\nTory grandee Sir Charles Walker, who is stepping down as an MP, insisted the scandal will not affect the election result.\n\nHe said: \"Nobody is going to change their vote off the back of this.\"\n\nMichael Gove said it would be \"reprehensible\" for someone to use inside information to bet on the date of the General Election.\n\n\"If people have used inside information to place bets, that is deeply wrong,\" he said. \"What I can't do is sort of get too much into the details of the case while an investigation is going on.

It would be an utter disgrace if Conservative politicians were shown to be more focused on turning a quick buck rather than the needs of the country.\"\n\nMr Williams has acknowledged making a \"huge error of judgment\" and said he would \"fully co-operate\" with the Gambling Commission's inquiry.\n\nMs Saunders was approached for comment. A Conservative spokesman said: \"We have been contacted by the Gambling Commission about a small number of individuals.\"\n\nThe commission said it could not comment further on an ongoing investigation.

The prime minister announced the early vote on May 22, surprising most Westminster observers, who had expected a general election in the autumn. On Thursday, Sunak's cabinet colleague, Michael Gove, confirmed the probe into the three individuals, telling LBC that the allegations are \"beyond embarrassing.\"\n\nIf the allegations are proved, \"it's beyond bad to use insider information like that to secure an advantage,\" Gove said. \"It's not just a betrayal of trust in the prime minister, which is very bad. It also means that other punters are losing out because of insider information. And that means that the system isn't operating fairly.\"\n\nThe Gambling Commission told Bloomberg it's \"investigating the possibility of offenses concerning the date of the election,\" though wouldn't comment on the identity of individuals involved. It said the probe is \"ongoing\" and that it couldn't provide further details.\n\nLondon's Metropolitan Police said in a statement that the Gambling Commission contacted the force last week to say \"they were investigating alleged bets made by a police constable from the Met's Royalty and Specialist Protection Command, which were related to the timing of the general election.\" The matter was referred to the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards, which began its own investigation, and the officer concerned was arrested on Monday \"on suspicion of misconduct in public office,\" it said.\n\nA succession of polls using seat-by-seat analysis suggest the Tories are heading toward a historic defeat, potentially their worst ever, with cabinet ministers including Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt, Defense Secretary Grant Shapps, Education Secretary Gillian Keegan -- and even Sunak himself -- at risk of losing their seats. The premier's party is moving election campaign resources out of areas it no longer thinks are winnable, instead prioritizing shoring up support in areas that would normally be considered a Tory stronghold, Bloomberg reported on Thursday.\n\nBoth Labour Party leader Keir Starmer -- who's on track to become prime minister next month -- and Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey called for an inquiry into the betting allegations.\n\n\"This candidate should be suspended and it's very telling that Rishi Sunak has not already done that,\" Starmer told reporters on a campaign visit in York on Thursday. \"If it was one of my candidates, they'd be gone and their feet would not have even touched the floor.\"\n\nLabour's campaign coordinator, Pat McFadden, wrote to the prime minister on Thursday to urge him to \"gain a sense of urgency and decency about this matter, and do what is necessary both to establish how wide this scandal goes, and take immediate action against all those implicated. It will speak volumes if you choose to stay silent and do nothing instead.\"\n\nSpeaking before the latest allegations, Sunak told reporters at the Group of Seven summit in Italy last week that he was \"very disappointed\" by Williams's alleged actions.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This prompted an investigation by the UK Gambling Commission over political betting. Allegations against Williams claim he put a \u00a3100 bet on the upcoming elections to take place in July, just before Sunak's announcement that the election will be held on July 4.\n\nNow, a second Conservative candidate is reportedly under investigation by the Gambling Commission due to a wager about the date of the upcoming general elections. As reported by BBC, Laura Saunders, Bristol North West candidate for the party, allegedly placed a bet concerning the timing of the election. The latest report did not disclose when the wager was placed and what sum it involved.\n\nIn an interview for the BBC, a spokesperson for the Conservative Party commented on the topic. They revealed that the Party was contacted by the gambling regulator in the country \"about a small number of individuals.\" The spokesperson explained further: \"As the Gambling Commission is an independent body, it wouldn't be proper to comment further, until any process is concluded.\"\n\nReportedly, Saunders was involved with the Conservative Party for nearly a decade. She started working for the Party back in 2015. Saunders' most recent responsibilities were with the Party's International Division. In that role, she collaborated with center-right formations in other countries across the globe.\n\nSunak's aide, Williams took it to his personal page via X, formerly Twitter, to acknowledge the recent allegations against him. He said that he was contacted by a journalist regarding a query by the Gambling Commission. As a result, Williams said that he wanted to be \"totally transparent.\"\n\nThe MP wrote: \"I put a flutter on the general election some weeks ago.

Despite earlier indications that the election would occur in the latter half of the year, Sunak opted for July 4, a decision that caught many political analysts off guard.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police revealed in their statement that they were alerted by the Gambling Commission on Friday regarding allegations involving an officer from the Royalty and Specialist Protection Command placing a bet. This command, a division of the Metropolitan Police, includes officers responsible for close protection duties for high-profile figures such as the prime minister and members of the royal family, requiring utmost discretion, as reported by NYT.\n\nThe matter has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), the oversight body responsible for investigating serious allegations against officers in England and Wales.\n\nIn response to inquiries, the Metropolitan Police reiterated their commitment to ensuring transparency and accountability within their ranks. The incident has raised concerns about the conduct of officers in sensitive roles and underscores the importance of upholding public trust and integrity in law enforcement.\n\nPrime Minister Sunak's surprise election announcement and the subsequent fallout from the betting allegations have added a new dimension to the political landscape, prompting scrutiny and calls for clarity regarding the ethical standards expected of those in positions of public trust.\n\nAs the investigation progresses, both the Metropolitan Police and the IOPC are expected to conduct thorough inquiries to determine the extent of any misconduct and to uphold the principles of impartiality and professionalism in policing, The New York Times reported.

Tony Lee, who has been at the helm of the Conservative Campaign Headquarters, took a leave of absence on Wednesday, as confirmed by party officials. The Gambling Commission is currently investigating several individuals in connection with this matter.\n\nWhile the Gambling Commission has not disclosed any identities, the BBC has reported that both Tony Lee and his wife, Laura Saunders, are under scrutiny. Saunders, who is standing as a candidate in the upcoming July 4 poll, has stated through her lawyers that she will fully cooperate with the investigation, despite concerns about privacy infringements.\n\nThe scandal extends beyond the Lee household. Another parliamentary candidate, Craig Williams, who previously served as an aide to Prime Minister Sunak, is also implicated. Reports suggest that Williams placed a \u00a3100 bet on the election date before it was publicly announced.\n\nIn a further twist, the Metropolitan Police have confirmed that a member of Sunak's security detail has been arrested for allegedly placing a bet on the election date. This officer, part of the Royalty and Specialist Protection Command, was detained on Monday on suspicion of misconduct in a public office and subsequently released on bail. The case has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.\n\nThe allegations have placed additional pressure on Prime Minister Sunak and his already beleaguered Conservative Party. The party has been trailing Labour by a substantial margin in the polls for nearly two years, raising the stakes of this latest controversy.\n\nOn the campaign trail, senior Conservative minister Michael Gove acknowledged the damaging optics of the situation, though he refrained from commenting on the specifics. He did, however, condemn the use of insider information for personal gain as \"reprehensible.\"\n\nLabour leader Keir Starmer has called for decisive action from Sunak, urging the Prime Minister to withdraw his support for those implicated in the scandal. Starmer expressed astonishment at the situation and emphasized the need for accountability within the government.\n\nPat McFadden, Labour's campaign coordinator, characterized the allegations as indicative of a broader pattern of unethical behavior within the Conservative Party, focused on profiteering. Meanwhile, Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, described the situation as reeking of corruption and called for stringent measures from the top levels of government.\n\nAlso Read: U.S. Central Command Airstrike In Syria Kills Senior ISIS Official\n\nThe controversy comes at a critical juncture for Sunak, who announced the election date on May 22 in a rain-soaked statement outside Downing Street. The timing surprised many within his own party, as he still had six months to call for a vote. Despite positive economic indicators, the announcement has not significantly improved the Conservatives' standing in the polls.\n\nSunak's campaign has faced a series of missteps, including awkward public appearances that have done little to endear him to the electorate. A recent incident where he was ignored by a flock of sheep during a photo opportunity has been emblematic of his campaign's struggles.\n\nRecent polls predict a historic defeat for the Conservative Party, potentially surpassing the scale of Labour's landslide victory in 1997. A YouGov poll suggests that the Conservatives could fall to their lowest seat count in nearly 200 years, and a Savanta survey indicates that Sunak could become the first sitting Prime Minister to lose his own seat.", "source": {"uri": "newsx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsX"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 5,

Despite earlier indications that the election would occur in the latter half of the year, Sunak opted for July 4, a decision that caught many political analysts off guard.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police revealed in their statement that they were alerted by the Gambling Commission on Friday regarding allegations involving an officer from the Royalty and Specialist Protection Command placing a bet. This command, a division of the Metropolitan Police, includes officers responsible for close protection duties for high-profile figures such as the prime minister and members of the royal family, requiring utmost discretion, as reported by NYT.\n\nThe matter has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), the oversight body responsible for investigating serious allegations against officers in England and Wales.\n\nIn response to inquiries, the Metropolitan Police reiterated their commitment to ensuring transparency and accountability within their ranks. The incident has raised concerns about the conduct of officers in sensitive roles and underscores the importance of upholding public trust and integrity in law enforcement.\n\nPrime Minister Sunak's surprise election announcement and the subsequent fallout from the betting allegations have added a new dimension to the political landscape, prompting scrutiny and calls for clarity regarding the ethical standards expected of those in positions of public trust.\n\nAs the investigation progresses, both the Metropolitan Police and the IOPC are expected to conduct thorough inquiries to determine the extent of any misconduct and to uphold the principles of impartiality and professionalism in policing, The New York Times reported.

It comes after a police officer in Mr Sunak's close protection team was arrested and suspended from duty for allegedly betting on the date of the July 4 poll. Labour called for the two Conservative candidates to be suspended, and fury has been swirling amongst voters over the probe.\n\nNow Vorderman has shared her white-hot outrage over the fiasco. Taking to X, formerly Twitter, the presenter and author shared an image of Mr Sunak making a speech, standing in front of a lectern plastered with his Rwanda scheme slogan 'stop the boats'.\n\nVorderman's post shows the word 'boats' crossed out in the image and replaced with bets. She accompanied the edited photo with three simple words: \"STOP THE BETS\".\n\nThe tongue-in-cheek message has set Twitter alight, as the phrase 'stop the bets' is now trending. Hundreds of commenters flocked to the post to share their disdain, as one wrote: \"I'm enjoying how the Tory Party in its entirety seems to be further torpedoing their seat numbers daily. They can't put one foot right without tripping over the further right one.\"\n\nAnother furious commenter said: \"'This government will have integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level'. Sunak outside No 10 when he was 'installed' as PM\" with an angry emoji. Meanwhile, a third X user jibed: \"Is it D-Day for stop the bets? 'We will fight them at the bookies....\"\n\nThe betting scandal surfaced last week but erupted again today after it emerged the Tony Lee, the Tory campaign chief, is being questioned by the Gambling Commission - as well as a Tory candidate Laura Saunders, who is understood to be his wife.\n\nThe Tories confirmed Mr Lee took \"a leave of absence\" from Party HQ on Wednesday, leaving the party without a campaigning director two weeks before polling day.\n\nA statement released by Ms Saunders' solicitors said: \"As the Conservative Party has already stated, investigations are ongoing. Ms Saunders will be co-operating with the Gambling Commission and has nothing further to add.\" The statement said it was \"inappropriate to conduct any investigation of this kind via the media\" said she was considering legal action for infringement of privacy rights.\n\nThe Mirror exclusively revealed earlier that a flurry of bets were placed on the likelihood of a July election with a major betting exchange the week before Mr Sunak announced the date. Data from Smarkets, the industry leader for political betting, shows thousands of pounds being wagered either for and against the election being in July between May 14th and May 18th. Mr Sunak announced on May 22nd that the election would take place on July 4th.\n\nThe chaos comes as Mr Sunak is set to face a grilling from the public in tonight's Question Time election special. The two-hour panel will see Tory PM Rishi Sunak, Labour leader Keir Starmer, John Swinney for the Scottish National Party and Ed Davey for the Liberal Democrats all set to face the live studio audience.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ellie_fry@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Ellie Fry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Vorderman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carol Vorderman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gambling Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue-in-cheek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tongue-in-cheek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Normandy landings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwanda", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rwanda"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Rwanda"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_Time_(TV_programme)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Question Time (TV programme)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Democrats (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Davey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ed Davey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right to privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solicitor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31128287.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_hig3JPG.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665618", "eventUri": "eng-9665618", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "dateEnd": "2024-05-18", "textStart": 3059, "textEnd": 3080}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 683, "textEnd": 689, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-22", "textStart": 3104, "textEnd": 3112}], "sentiment": -0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Most political observers assumed that he would opt to call an election in the autumn.\n\nThe betting scandal enveloping Sunak's struggling campaign intensified on Thursday when the party confirmed that Tony Lee, the Conservative director of campaigning, had taken a leave of absence.\n\nHis wife Laura Saunders, the Tory candidate for Bristol North West, is under investigation by the Gambling Commission over gambling on the timing of the election.\n\nLabour is seeking to capitalise on the scandal, with Sir Keir Starmer, the party's leader, calling for Saunders to be suspended as a candidate.\n\n\"It's very telling that Rishi Sunak has not already done that. If it was one of my candidates they'd be gone and their feet not have touched the floor,\" Starmer said on Thursday.\n\nCraig Williams, Sunak's closest parliamentary aide, has already acknowledged placing a \u00a3100 bet on the election date three days before it was announced.\n\nA police officer assigned to protect the prime minister was arrested on Monday for allegedly making a similar bet.\n\nThe UK's major bookmakers declined to comment on the issue, citing a Gambling Commission probe into potential misconduct.\n\nThe commission says it is \"investigating the possibility of offences concerning the date of the election\", but has declined to give further details.\n\nUsing the Betfair Exchange data, the FT found that \u00a35,900 had been bet on a July election prior to May 20, two days before the shock announcement by Sunak.\n\nOn May 20 itself, a further \u00a3689 was wagered, with \u00a3398 coming in one bet, posted in the mid-afternoon at odds that would have netted the unknown punter a \u00a32,784 profit.\n\nOn the morning of May 21, Lord Daniel Finkelstein, a Conservative peer, told Times Radio he had picked up \"a bit of talk in government circles\" that a July election could be on the cards, though he still believed it would happen in the autumn.\n\nA further \u00a35,483 was wagered that day, including some large bets.\n\nAt midday, a bet was placed for \u00a3830 at odds that should deliver a \u00a35,800 profit. An \u00a3850 bet, made at 4pm, should deliver an expected \u00a32,562 profit.\n\nThese were the largest bets placed on the market to that point, and were twice as large as the next largest. Before May 20, only two bets had come in above \u00a3200.\n\nAnyone who had been able to get in ahead of the crowd stood to make handsome profits from less privileged punters: the odds on the morning of May 21 implied that there was only a one-in-eight chance of a July election.\n\nBy the next morning on May 22, it had drifted up to one in five as rumours started to swirl through Westminster. By midday, the implied chance had soared to 50 per cent and closed in on 98 per cent by 5pm, when Sunak made his rain-soaked election announcement.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betfair", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Betfair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_United_Kingdom_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2015 United Kingdom general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gambling Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Williams_(British_politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Craig Williams (British politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_North_West_(UK_Parliament_constituency)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bristol North West (UK Parliament constituency)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Times Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Finkelstein", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Finkelstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peerage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peerage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252F0ab3a326-e861-4acd-9883-3a4286fa0e41.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665618", "eventUri": "eng-9665618", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 302, "textEnd": 308}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-22", "textStart": 388, "textEnd": 394, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 2040, "textEnd": 2046, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-21", "textStart": 2290, "textEnd": 2296, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Mr Sunak announced on May 22nd that the election would take place on July 4th.\n\nAnd the market probability of the election taking place in May - based on movements in the betting market - increased dramatically between May 17th and the evening of May 21st. A spokesperson for Smarkets confirmed that in April there had only been a \"few small trades\" on a July poll, putting the probability up to 12% - where it stayed mostly steady for two weeks.\n\nBut in mid-May the probability rocketed from 13% on May 17th to 29% on the evening of the 21st.\n\nSmarkets said the betting pool for political issues is not as \"liquid\" as it is for major sporting events - meaning relatively small things, like a Tweet or newspaper article - can prompt activity. But the first real indication a July election was on the cards was a May 18th tweet from the Financial Times' Lucy Fisher - who reported there had been a \"contingency planning\" meeting at CCHQ the previous Monday - May 13th.\n\nThe flurry of bets began on May 14th.\n\nRishi Sunak's already beleaguered General Election campaign has been thrown into fresh turmoil over allegations of staff betting on the date of the election before it was announced.\n\nWith only weeks until polling day, the Conservatives' director of campaigning Tony Lee was forced to take a leave of absence last night amid reports both he and his wife Laura Saunders, candidate for North West Bristol, are being investigated by the Gambling Commission.\n\nIt is understood a bet had been placed on the timing of the General Election. Ms Saunders and Mr Lee are the latest people with links to the Tory party or No 10 caught up in allegations about betting on the date of the July 4 contest, after Rishi Sunak's aide Craig Williams last week apologised for putting a \u00a3100 bet on a July election three days before it was announced. Elsewhere, one of the Prime Minister's police protection officers has been arrested by the Met for a bet on the election.\n\nSpeaking to reporters this morning, Levelling Up minister Michael Gove admitted the situation \"doesn't look great\" for the Conservatives. On the Tory campaign battle bus in London, he told broadcasters: \"Obviously, it doesn't look great. And, obviously, the conclusions lots of people are drawing are not at all great. But I don't know all the facts at the moment. I'd be loath to condemn without there being an investigation that's been concluded.\"\n\nLabour and the Liberal Democrats have called for the Tories to suspend both Ms Saunders and Mr Williams. Asked about the Tory director of campaigns taking a leave of absence, Keir Starmer told The Mirror : \"It's astonishing that we're in this place. However many people have already been identified as potentially involved in this.

While the body typically investigates issues such as match-fixing in sports, its remit covers any wagers that turn out to have been placed by people with inside information.\n\nThe commission's investigation into betting on the UK election date appears to have started after bookmakers alerted it to a flurry of interest in a July election in the days before the announcement on May 22.\n\nOn June 12, Williams announced he was facing some \"routine inquiries\" after what he described as \"a flutter\" on the general election date. The Gambling Commission says it is now \"investigating the possibility of offences concerning the date of the election\", but has declined to say how many people it is investigating or questioning.\n\nThe UK's main bookmakers have said they are co-operating with the probe.\n\nBetting using inside information is potentially a breach of Section 42 of the Gambling Act, which covers the offence of \"cheating\" and can carry a penalty of up to two years in prison, legal experts say.\n\nThe section says it is an offence if someone \"cheats at gambling\" or \"does anything for the purpose of enabling or assisting another person to cheat at gambling\".\n\nThere has been \"a lot of debate\" about what \"cheating\" actually means, according to Christopher Bamford, a barrister specialising in gambling law.\n\nThe main legal precedent on the issue -- a 2017 case involving a gambler who arranged for cards at a London casino to be shuffled in a certain way -- is that is does not matter if people did not intend to cheat, but only if they appear to have cheated.\n\nHowever, despite high-profile cases of gambling on sporting events over the years, there are few clear precedents for how the courts would treat the act of betting on the basis of inside information in politics.\n\nSunak's former bodyguard was arrested on Monday on suspicion of \"misconduct in public office\", which criminal barrister Quentin Hunt described as a \"common-law offence\" -- meaning its definition has evolved through past cases rather than being set out in statute.\n\nHistorical cases show the offence, which in theory carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, has been used to cover a wide variety of misconduct.\n\nIt was used against a former Bishop of Gloucester who formed sexual relationships with young priests. In another case, it was used to prosecute a police officer and community support officer in Bristol who ignored the pleas for help of a man who was subsequently tortured to death by his neighbours.\n\nTo launch an investigation during an election campaign is to invite accusation of interference -- such as in the US 2016 election campaign, when the FBI's decision to reopen an investigation into Hillary Clinton happened weeks before Donald Trump's victory.\n\nHowever, Dal Babu, a former senior Metropolitan Police officer, said it was the \"appropriate course of action\" for the Met to arrest the protection officer, despite the potentially difficult timing.\n\n\"I worked at the House of Commons in 1997 and recall a Cabinet meeting taking place at the weekend before the election was announced,\" Babu said. \"But all the officers knew they kept these matters confidential.\"\n\nRick Muir, director of the Police Foundation think-tank, agreed.\n\n\"They would always act upon it if it involved one of their officers and they were presented with information that met the threshold for a criminal investigation,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news",

The date was a well-guarded secret and took many by surprise, including members of Sunak's governing Conservative Party who were expecting the election to be organized in the fall.\n\nThe UK allows betting with bookmakers that offer odds on a variety of bets ranging from sports to elections.\n\nHowever, wagering on elections using inside information is a form of cheating and is punished as a criminal offense.\n\nAccording to a spokesperson for the Gambling Commission, the commission that \"regulates gambling in the interests of consumers and the wider public\" was still investigating the possibility of the respective offenses and was unable to offer additional details.\n\nAfter he was put under arrest at the start of the week, the police officer was taken out of custody on bail. Currently, he is waiting for further inquiries.\n\nLiberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper commented on the matter, asking PM Sunak to \"call a Cabinet Office inquiry into what is shaping up to be yet another scandal at the heart of Government.\"\n\nCooper added an inquiry was necessary \"to understand who knew what and when.\"", "source": {"uri": "gamblingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GamblingNews"}, "authors": [{"uri": "melanie_porter@gamblingnews.com", "name": "Melanie Porter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gambling Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constable", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directorate_of_Professional_Standards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Directorate of Professional Standards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daisy_Cooper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daisy Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Democrats (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insider_trading", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insider trading"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crime"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Dating", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Dating", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Cyber_Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Cyber Relationships", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.gamblingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/rishi-sunak-uk-news.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665618", "eventUri": "eng-9665618", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 277, "textEnd": 284}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-22", "textStart": 765, "textEnd": 771}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 803, "textEnd": 809}], "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

Despite earlier indications that the election would occur in the latter half of the year, Sunak opted for July 4, a decision that caught many political analysts off guard.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police revealed in their statement that they were alerted by the Gambling Commission on Friday regarding allegations involving an officer from the Royalty and Specialist Protection Command placing a bet. This command, a division of the Metropolitan Police, includes officers responsible for close protection duties for high-profile figures such as the prime minister and members of the royal family, requiring utmost discretion, as reported by NYT.\n\nThe matter has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), the oversight body responsible for investigating serious allegations against officers in England and Wales.\n\nIn response to inquiries, the Metropolitan Police reiterated their commitment to ensuring transparency and accountability within their ranks. The incident has raised concerns about the conduct of officers in sensitive roles and underscores the importance of upholding public trust and integrity in law enforcement.\n\nPrime Minister Sunak's surprise election announcement and the subsequent fallout from the betting allegations have added a new dimension to the political landscape, prompting scrutiny and calls for clarity regarding the ethical standards expected of those in positions of public trust.\n\nAs the investigation progresses, both the Metropolitan Police and the IOPC are expected to conduct thorough inquiries to determine the extent of any misconduct and to uphold the principles of impartiality and professionalism in policing, The New York Times reported.

An inquiry is needed to understand who knew what and when,\" she added.\n\nThe Tories are expected to be dumped out of office after 14 years in office, with polls consistently putting the main opposition Labour party some 20 points ahead.\n\nTwo polls published on Wednesday predicted a record win for Labour, eclipsing even the landslide win for former leader Tony Blair in 1997, and a historic drubbing for the Tories.\n\nPollsters YouGov said the Conservatives -- the party of Margaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill -- could slump to their \"lowest seat tally in the party's almost 200-year history\".\n\nAs well as criticism of Sunak's decision to go early, the Tory campaign has been widely criticised for a series of gaffes, including a photocall in Belfast near where the doomed Titanic was built.\n\nSunak's own already dire personal ratings were also hit after he left an international event to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day early.\n\nThe Met said the officer, a member of the force's Royalty and Specialist Protection Command, was no longer on operational duties.\n\nThe officer was taken into custody on Monday on suspicion of misconduct in a public office, then released

Betting on politics is not illegal in the United Kingdom, but using confidential information to cheat is.\n\nIt is reported the Gambling Commission, the UK's gambling regulator, is investigating a rash of bets on the date of the UK general election which were allegedly made by political insiders shortly before the election was called. The BBC reports the Commission as having said: \"Currently the Commission is investigating the possibility of offences concerning the date of the election. This is an ongoing investigation, and the Commission cannot provide any further details at this time.\n\n\"We are not confirming or denying the identity of any individuals involved in this investigation.\"\n\nBrexit leader Nigel Farage shared betting industry data on Thursday afternoon showing a surge of betting on the general election the day before it was made public, and opined: \"The corrupt Tories are now fully exposed by this betting data. Reform must replace them.\"\n\nTony Lee's exact involvement or otherwise in the scope of the Commission probe has not been revealed but it had been earlier claimed that his wife Laura Saunders, who is a Conservative candidate running for election, had allegedly place a bet.\n\nThese developments follow another earlier this week where a VIP protection police officer who may have been in a position to overhear ministerial discussions was arrested after placing \"several\" political bets.\n\nThe Conservative Party has aggressively centralised in recent years, running down local associations to concentrate more power with the London Conservative Central Office.

Allegations surround his bodyguard and aides, leading to suspensions, arrests, and investigations by the Metropolitan Police and the UK's Gambling Commission. Opposition pressures grow as the party deals with poor pre-election forecasts.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Conservative Party is embroiled in controversy as betting allegations swirl around the scheduled July 4 general election date. The scandal involves Sunak's personal bodyguard and top aides, with the Metropolitan Police suspending and arresting an officer on the prime minister's security detail for alleged misconduct.\n\nThe UK's Gambling Commission has launched its own probe into individuals tied to the Tories who reportedly placed bets on the election's timing. While gambling is legal in the UK, insider information could make such actions illegal, intensifying the scrutiny.\n\nCraig Williams, a close parliamentary aide to Sunak, sparked further controversy after betting on a July election shortly before the official announcement, asserting he would cooperate fully with the investigation. The Conservative Party faces mounting pressure from the Labour opposition, amid ongoing probes and plummeting pre-election polls.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gambling Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Williams_(British_politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Craig Williams (British politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/05_06_2024_23_01_15_8457935.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665618", "eventUri": "eng-9665618", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 502, "textEnd": 508}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

As the BBC notes this morning, Saunders is married to the Conservative party's director of campaigns, Tony Lee.

The Conservative candidate for Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr placed a bet with Ladbrokes on Sunday 19 May and with odds of 5/1, Williams was set to receive \u00a3500. Yet after the bet was placed, Steerpike understands that Williams was subsequently flagged up as a 'politically exposed person' by the bookmaker, which was keeping tabs on 'novelty' markets.\n\nUsing confidential information to one's advantage when placing a bet may constitute a criminal offence and neither the Conservative party nor the Gambling Commission will comment much more on the detail.

It could get ... pretty rough.\n\nNo really, timing is everything: The revelation from BBC Pol Ed Chris Mason this morning that a second Conservative candidate who allegedly placed a bet on the timing of the election is married to the *checks notes* CCHQ director of campaigns will no doubt come up during the Beeb's Question Time special, set to air from 8 p.m.\n\nThe format: The show will revolve around questions from the audience to the four main party leaders, with Sunak at the end. But if a member of the public fails to ask the PM about the gambling thing, there's zero chance host Fiona Bruce will let it slide. We'll be covering every beat and doing snap analysis on our election live blog.\n\nOut of the shadows: It will be the first time Sunak has had to respond to the scandal since a bunch of new twists. He's been behind closed doors for more than 24-hours preparing for the event.\n\nAnd that means: Whatever line he takes on the issue will be a vital news moment, clipped up, written up and shared far and wide on social media.\n\nSorry did we mention that timing is everything? It also means members of the public who tune in at 8 p.m. (that's prime time TV) and who might not have heard about the scandal, now will do. The ITV debate between Sunak and Keir Starmer earlier in the campaign attracted average viewing figures of almost 5 million, don't forget. A good number of viewers tonight should be well across it already, though, after the BBC News app push-alerted its scoop this morning, ensuring millions read about Bristol North West candidate Laura Saunders being probed by the Gambling Commission.\n\nNo, that is indeed not good: With two weeks to go until polling day, and with postal votes stuffing themselves into letterboxes right now, the Conservatives announced late morning Lee had taken a leave of absence. Which means Rishi Sunak has lost a senior campaign director in the middle of an election campaign, in which the Tories are fighting to avoid oblivion. \"For f*ck's sake,\" one Conservative minister said when Playbook PM mentioned Lee's departure. \"That is not good.\"\n\nBetting man? The fate of Saunders and Lee should center on the moment the alleged bets were placed -- details are still to be made public. One of Lee's allies suggested he might not have known the timing of the election date until it was called, seeing as the circle of knowledge around it was so tight, and that it would not be the \"cautious\" campaigner's style to take such a risk even if he was aware.\n\nFilling the void: It's now been almost 24 hours since Lee took his leave of absence. The lack of front foot from the Tories on all this allowed Lib Dem leader Ed Davey to urge the authorities to \"come down heavily on the people who look like they've acted illegally and immorally.\"\n\nLabour twists the knife: The Tories appear to be making the problem worse for themselves with hesitation over Saunders' fate. \"If it was one of my candidates, they would be gone and their feet would not have touched the floor,\" Keir Starmer said in a national broadcast interview. Labour campaign co-ordinator Pat McFadden twisted the knife with a punchy letter about the failure to act on candidates, despite fast action against Sunak's close protection officer over similar allegations. Housing Secretary Michael Gove said on the morning round that the situation was \"regrettable\" but that it's right that those involved get the \"benefit of whatever doubt there is.\"\n\nNot just the opposition: Angry Conservatives are also filling the void. Conservative former leader Iain Duncan Smith told the News Agents podcast this afternoon those being investigated are \"stupid and venal\" and \"whatever happens to them wouldn't be hard enough in my book.\" Nigel Farage got in on the act too, branding it \"corruption.\"\n\nSo, yeah, in politics timing is everything: This scandal has grown in power because it has dripped out over time. It was a week ago that Sunak's top MP aide Craig Williams admitted placing his own bet on the election date days before it was called -- without being clear whether he knew about the plan at the time or not. Last night the arrest and suspension of the police officer drove the issue up the news agenda again. And then a succession of bombshells on a quiet morning in the campaign mean there's now real momentum to this story.\n\nTwo years feels like ages ago: Sunak, of course, promised on the steps of Downing Street to lead a government with \"integrity, professionalism, and accountability at every level.\" That came after the endless abuses of the Boris Johnson era, as well as the Liz Truss financial stinkbomb. That's all fed public mistrust in politics, and a fresh scandal two weeks before the election, dredging it all back up, is the last thing the PM needs. Our Rosa Prince has more on that theme here.\n\nWhoops: One excellent irony of all this is that bets being placed in the run-up to the election announcement, and a subsequent surge in the markets, might have tipped Labour mastermind Morgan McSweeney off that a summer poll was coming -- helping the opposition avoid an ambush. See here from Gabriel Pogrund. And the FT's Chris Cook has been digging into the \"unusual\" betting data.\n\nThe internet never forgets: Another great irony is that the Tories shared a gambling themed attack ad against Labour just ... last night. It has now been deleted, of course.\n\nThanks, Andrew Bailey: In another timing headache for Sunak, the Bank of England announced at noon it will keep interest rates the same, despite inflation hitting the target 2 percent this week. Tories had been hoping for a cut during the election campaign, to feed into the narrative about turning some kind of corner. See former Downing Street aide Guto Harri making the case on Good Morning Britain. But that hope didn't deliver, and it could in fact be a Starmer government that gets to claim credit in August for the first interest rate reduction since 2020.\n\nOkay one more time, we promise, but timing really is everything: That has sparked off a fresh round of questioning about what exactly possessed Sunak to call the election now, rather than waiting until *after* interest rates had been reduced, as well as *after* the first deportation flight to Rwanda might have taken off. One Conservative aide said: \"These continued issues show how foolish the PM was to call an election for July.\"\n\nNow read this: HuffPost's Kevin Schofield has a piece asking whether the Tories are running \"the worst general election campaign of all time,\" which includes this glorious quote from a senior Conservative: \"If I woke up on the morning of July 5 to find out that it had been an elaborate performance art piece instead of a genuine campaign, I would not be surprised.\" Add to the list moving resources once more to ultra safe seats, including the PM's own, as Bloomberg's Alex Wickham revealed this morning.\n\n**Please complete this quick survey to help us understand the political and policy issues you most care about and how you use this information professionally. Your participation is greatly appreciated and will only take a few minutes.**\n\nDRIVETIME DEBRIEF\n\nTODAY IN SCAREMONGERING: The Tories want to talk about the green belt and Labour wants to talk about Liz Truss -- both based on campaign slips from their opponents. Michael Gove and Rishi Sunak were straight out the blocks on Radio 4 and Twitter this morning, quoting our morning Playbook tour line from a Labour aide about not caring \"if we flatten the whole green belt; we just need more houses.\" Gove said it was an example of \"vibes politics with a nasty edge\" while the PM said it was \"good to finally get Labour's real views on Britain's green belt.\"\n\nBut but but: Speaking to hacks on the campaign trail, Keir Starmer insisted it was not Labour policy and that the quote did not come from Labour officials. POLITICO's Stefan Boscia, who reported the line as part of his tour dispatch from Aylesbury, stands by his reporting, of course. More on our liveblog.\n\nAnd on the Labour attack side ... the opposition pounced on comments from Chancellor Jeremy Hunt at the Times CEO summit this morning that it was unfair to claim the Liz Truss maxi-budget caused \"sustained economic scarring.\" A Labour spokesperson said the comments were \"insulting to the millions of people\" whose mortgages have gone up, and pointed to costings holes in the Conservative manifesto. (Not that the Labour manifesto is much better.)\n\nACTUAL FEAR: It's badgers who have reason to be frightened, with the i's Arj Singh reporting a Labout government would continue their cull.\n\nHEALTHY DEBATE: Health Secretary Victoria Atkins blasted junior doctors, who are still planning to strike during the election campaign, in a letter posted to Twitter. She noted the government can't actually make offers to settle the ongoing dispute until the election is done, after the British Medical Association offered the prime minister a final chance to make a deal before action late next week.\n\nHealth scare: The Tories meanwhile seized on new figures in Wales showing its NHS waiting lists (under a Labour administration) hitting a new record high of 775,031 in April. \"This is what happens when Labour are in power without a plan, and with unchecked power, Keir Starmer would do exactly the same in England,\" a Conservative spokesperson said. Bear in mind that's what the Conservatives have done in England too.\n\nDANCING AROUND THE MAPLE: With a Conservative wipeout looking likely, numerous comparisons have been made with Canada in 1993, when the Progressive Conservatives fell from 156 seats to just two -- in part due to a surging populist movement named ... Reform. In truth, the comparisons don't quite work, because Reform was a regional party based on grievances about specific industrial policies, and was one half of a geographic sandwich that squeezed the conservatives from two sides.\n\nNevertheless: The Conservatives in Britain could learn something from the 1993 defeat, according to Andrew MacDougall, a former top aide to Canadian PM Stephen Harper: how to build back afterwards. Harper was a senior figure in the Reform movement that helped decimate the Progressive Conservatives but later merged with them, before entering government in 2006 as leader of the Conservative Party of Canada.\n\nSo ... what's the advice? \"The Conservatives have to get back to ideas,\" MacDougall told Playbook PM, and avoid the siren calls of Nigel Farage. \"You're never going to out-rage or out-media Farage. But ultimately, his bravado and persona don't fix problems,\" MacDougall said. Conservative minister Steve Baker agreed that Farage should be kept out, telling the Sun he \"toxifies\" debates.\n\nFixing things: MacDougall argued the modern Conservatives in Canada built public support by focusing on practical solutions to internal national problems, rather than pointing blame outside. Having a fight about who can out-right-wing each other post-Rishi Sunak won't work, he said, arguing the Tories will need to \"get out of vibe mode,\" take a step back from reactive media soundbites and think deeper.\n\nProblem is: The chance of a return straight to solution politics is slim, with the Tories poised to plunge into civil war in the wake of the election and with Farage stoking the flames. But MacDougall notes the Tories will still have a campaign structure and more practical mechanics than Reform will, and a quick return to pragmatic politics could turn things back around before the next election. \"Nothing concentrates the mind like the prospect of a hanging,\" he said. \"Well, that hanging is here.\"\n\nFARAGE MARCHES ON: More people want Reform to become the official opposition than the Conservatives if Labour wins the election, according to research from Redfield and Wilton. Some 27 percent of poll respondents picked Reform as their preferred opposition, compared with 22 percent who said the Conservatives and 21 percent who said the Lib Dems. Shunning those Farage siren calls is going to be difficult.\n\nMore amusing public preferences: Labour and Conservative England supporters would prefer to see their parties win the election rather than see Harry Kane and co lift the Euros cup, Savanta polling reveals. Some 70 percent of Labour-voting England fans would prefer to see Labour win the election over England winning the competition, while 64 percent of Conservative-voting England supporters said the same about their own side. Nerds, the lot of you.\n\nOverall: Labour holds a 24-point lead over the Tories among football fans -- with 45 percent support compared with 21 percent. But the public overall reckons Rishi Sunak would make a better PM than Gareth Southgate (35 percent to 28 percent) ... so it's not all doom and gloom for the PM.\n\nSpeaking of polls: YouGov noted an uptick in Conservative support and a slip for both Labour and Reform. The poll was done a few days before the gambling row properly erupted.\n\nChoose your own polling: Just to complicate everything, the latest from Redfield and Wilton shows ... Reform up and the Tories down.\n\nVITAL LISTENING: The latest episode of Radio 4 show More or Less debunks a long list of recent nonsensical election claims.

Alleged election betting shows real dedication", "body": "Break out the comedy air quotes, because Tony Lee, the Conservative party's director of campaigning, has taken a \"leave of absence\". A development to which one's immediate response is: wait, this Conservative campaign has a director??? Does he work in the snuff genre? If not, this is surely the Heaven's Gate of general election campaigns - and you have to remember that fabled cinematic flop collapsed not simply an entire genre (the western), nor simply an entire legacy movie studio (United Artists), but the entire promise-filled era of film-making known as the New Hollywood.\n\nRighto: metaphors. In the weeks leading up to Rishi Sunak's general election announcement, you would think the one thing the party who'd been in charge for the past 14 years wasn't short of was metaphors. Britain was now a country whose own excrement was literally lapping at its shores.\n\nBritain was now a country whose prime minister travelled from central London to Manchester to announce that the government's flagship central-London-to-Manchester rail project would no longer be going to Manchester - or indeed to central London. The list went on.\n\nRelated: Gambling watchdog looks into second Tory candidate over alleged election bet\n\nSay what you will about recent administrations, but you absolutely could not question the commitment to creating their own metaphors. It was quite possibly our last manufacturing success story.\n\nWhich brings us to the revelation that two Tory parliamentary candidates are under investigation by the Gambling Commission for placing bets on the election date before it was formally announced by Sunak.\n\nLast week the Guardian revealed that Sunak's closest parliamentary aide, Craig Williams, had placed a \u00a3100 bet on the date. Yesterday evening, the BBC revealed that a police officer in Sunak's protection detail had been arrested and suspended over an election timing bet. Hours later, the BBC revealed that a second Conservative candidate, named as Bristol North West hopeful Laura Saunders, was also being probed for allegedly placing a bet on the election date. Then this morning, the Beeb revealed that someone else - oh do look, it's campaigns director Tony Lee himself! - was being looked into over an alleged bet related to the timing of the election.\n\nPlease take a moment to create a fantasy scenario as to how on earth this hugely unfortunate series of events occurred. Did someone - perhaps the director of Conservative campaigns - take a look at the party's prospects and spot a gap in the metaphor market? Did Tony Lee issue some form of APB, perhaps along the lines of: \"Guys, we can see that Labour is just short of one metaphor - specifically something to illustrate the idea that we gambled with the country to enrich ourselves. For the love of God, can anyone help them out?\" I want to say: look, if you want a job doing, etc. But I think that legally, I am required to say: if allegedly you want an alleged job allegedly doing, etc.\n\nAs for what precisely we're dealing with - you always see the bookies' publicists press-releasing odds on things like the next election date, or who killed a Coronation Street character or something. When I worked on this paper's Diary column, we'd sometimes ring those PRs and claim we wanted to place a bet on these supposed markets, in the interests of seeing if they actually existed in the real world, or were just a publicity trick. There would always be an incredible amount of waffle in reply. The fact is, the bookmakers watch these novelty markets incredibly closely, as they are so vulnerable to punters with inside information. So what is being alleged here is not just irregular betting, but intense stupidity.\n\nHow many stupids are there? By lunch, the Conservative campaign HQ had issued a statement saying \"it wouldn't be proper to comment\", adding that they had been contacted about \"a small number of individuals\". Why not say three? Oh man - it's not more than three ... is it?\n\nThis was not a question answered by the various Conservatives on the campaign trail today. Touring the breakfast studios was Michael Gove, who regretted being unable to discuss an ongoing investigation, before waltzing onwards and breezing of the party's electoral prospects: \"We're not in Fergie time yet!\"\n\nOnce again, we can only salute a senior politician's unique understanding of football terminology. But in the interests of accuracy: Michael, it would be good for the Conservatives if you were in Fergie time, because it would mean you might be about to pull off an astonishing late-stage winner with the clock arguably running on till you did. An alternative analogy for this particular general election campaign might be the infamous Nigerian match in which Akurba FC lost 79-0 to Plateau United Feeders, with the Feeders scoring a goal every 37 seconds in the second half. The Nigerian Football Association called it \"a mind-boggling show of shame\". And lifetime bans ensued.\n\nElsewhere, Jeremy Hunt already seemed to be on the memoir circuit. This morning the guy who is still actually chancellor of the exchequer told a story to something called the Times CEO Summit - big campaigning stop, apparently - about how he got his job.\n\n\"I got that rather unexpected call from Liz Truss asking me to be chancellor,\" reflected Hunt. \"Which I thought was a hoax and refused to take the call and could not imagine any situation ever where Liz Truss would actually ask me to be chancellor, so that was a bit surreal, and then in that first week literally I'm picking the entire mini-budget!\"\n\nSorry - is it not still the election? Why is he reminding people of this lunacy? Is there a point at which play becomes so remarkably atrocious that it could even amount to alleged election-throwing? Perhaps the Nigerian Football Federation could investigate.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

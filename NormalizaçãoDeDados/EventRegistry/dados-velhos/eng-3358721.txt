They arrived at the al-Ma'wa reserve in northern Jordan on Friday.\n\nDr. Amir Khalil, a vet who accompanied the animals, said Sunday that he had been worried during the transport that Dana would give birth while in a cage. In such a case, it's unlikely the cub would have survived, he said.\n\nThe lion cub named Hajar, Arabic for \"the immigrant,\" was born sometime in the night from Friday to Saturday, in the tranquility of the wooded reserve. Staff at the reserve discovered the cub when they checked on Dana on Saturday morning.\n\nKhalil said he believes the lioness waited for a safe space to give birth.\n\n\"She is a mom, she had the instinct,\" he said. \"It's a miracle.\"\n\nThe cub is white, a color that might change later, and weighs an estimated 1.5 to 2 kilograms (3.3 to 4.4 pounds), said Khalil who hasn't been able yet to examine Hajar. The gender is still unknown.\n\nOn Sunday, the cub was mostly sleeping next to the mother in a cage in the reserve.

The 30-year-old woman died several days after the June 12 incident inside the Palms Casino Resort, sources said. On Friday afternoon, Jason Kendall turned himself in to police at Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Headquarters where officers booked him on charges of open murder and sexual assault, a source with knowledge of the investigation said. Las Vegas Metro police initially responded to the call for an assault or battery at the hotel, records said. The woman later died at the hospital. Her cause and manner of death were not immediately available Friday, however, an open murder charge indicates her manner of death was likely homicide. While Metro police issue press releases for every homicide, the department does not release ones for delayed deaths. The victim, whose name was known to the 8 News Now Investigators, appeared online on various escorting websites. 8 News Now was waiting for the coroner\u2019s confirmation to identify her publicly.

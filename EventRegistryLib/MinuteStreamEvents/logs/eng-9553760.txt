Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost opened an investigation into the matter at STRS.\n\n\"Recently, we learned that Aon is severing its contract with STRS,\" DeWine said in the release. \"This is a huge red flag, calling into question how STRS is operating and providing oversight. The unstated implication is that the governance issues at STRS are so concerning that Aon could not continue its contract in good faith. STRS may now be out of compliance with portions of audit recommendations due to Aon ending the contract.\"\n\nIn his statement, DeWine also said \"disturbing allegations\" have been made against the STRS board. The governor called for an investigation into the matter. In an interview with local outlet NBC 4i, DeWine said that the board of STRS Ohio was under a hostile takeover by private interests, according to an anonymous letter.\n\n\"My office has received documents containing some other disturbing allegations regarding the STRS board. I have directed my staff to forward these documents to a number of relevant offices, including the Ohio Ethics Commission, the Ohio Retirement Study Council, Attorney General Yost, Auditor Faber, Treasurer Sprague, Secretary of State LaRose, and relevant members of the Ohio General Assembly. I encourage them to review the document and take any action that may be appropriate under any jurisdiction they may have,\" DeWine said in his press release.\n\nLast month, STRS Ohio Board Member Wade Steen was reinstated to the pensions board by a state appeals court. Last year, DeWine had removed Steen from his seat, alleging that Steen had a poor attendance record at the pension's board meetings. Ohio's 10th District Court of Appeals had determined that DeWine did not have the authority to remove Steen.\n\nSteen, a certified public accountant, was first appointed to the STRS Ohio board in 2016 by then-Governor Jim Kasich as an investment expert and was reappointed in 2020 by current Governor Mike DeWine. Steen's term was set to expire in September 2024. In 2023, DeWine announced Steen's removal from the board, replacing him with G. Brent Bishop, a managing partner at Scioto Capital Partners. The governor appoints one of the 11 members of the board.\n\nWhen Steen sued seeking his return to the board, DeWine said he agreed with retired teachers who had expressed anger over certain investment and benefits decisions made by STRS.\n\n\"I am in favor of retired teachers getting a cost-of-living adjustment from STRS,\" DeWine said in May 2023 statement. \"I've questioned how staff have received raises and bonuses when the retirees they serve got nothing. I believe STRS should consider investment strategies to increase returns. And I believe that changes to investment vendors should be made through a competitive and transparent public process.\"\n\nThe reappointment of Steen in April resulted in what was reported as a disorderly board meeting, which was quickly adjourned following Steen's return. \"When it became apparent that I was unable to conduct the meeting in an efficient and effective manner, I decided to conduct the necessary business and adjourn the meeting.

Voting by phone, internet and mail closes at 4:30 p.m. May 6.\n\nThe meeting in April was filled with drama.\n\nIn the middle of the meeting, the 10th District Court of Appeals issued a decision reinstating Wade Steen to the STRS board. Gov. Mike DeWine removed Steen a year ago, prompting Steen to sue. Steen made a triumphant return, entering an executive session and announcing that the governor's other appointee had to leave.\n\nSteen is aligned with the Ohio Retirement for Teachers Association, which has been pushing for wholesale changes.\n\nThe Ohio Retirement for Teachers Association held fundraisers to pay Steen's legal fees as he fought to get back on the board. That arrangement could conflict with Ohio ethics laws, said Ohio Ethics Commission Director Paul Nick. A previous ethics opinion said outside entities can't pay the legal defense fund for public officeholders.\n\nSteen is chief financial officer for Cleveland Metro Parks and the former Franklin County treasurer. Former Gov. John Kasich first appointed him to the STRS board and DeWine reappointed him before replacing Steen later.\n\nThe Ohio Retirement for Teachers Association and its allies on the board are pushing for several changes. They want to reinstate regular cost of living adjustments for retirees, cut down on administrative expenses and staff bonuses, dial back on higher-risk investments such as private equity funds, and increase transparency.\n\nSome have lost confidence in William Neville, who has been the STRS executive director since 2020. In November, an anonymous letter purporting to be from STRS staff accused Neville of harassment and unprofessional behavior. An outside law firm hired to investigate the claims said in February that it couldn't find evidence to substantiate most of the allegations.\n\nRather than reinstate Neville, who hired an attorney, the board voted to keep him on leave through mid-May and ordered him to take professional development. He is paid $318,000 a year and his contract runs through June 2027.\n\nA few years ago, Steen and another STRS board member, Rudy Fichtenbaum, said they've listened to an investment pitch made by Jonathan Tremmel and Seth Metcalf, a former top aide in the state treasurer's office under Republican Josh Mandel.\n\nMetcalf registered QED Management and OhioAI with the Ohio Secretary of State on Oct. 6, 2020. Tremmel registered QED Technologies on March 19, 2019.\n\nIn November 2021, Fichtenbaum, Steen and former board member Bob Stein suggested that STRS Ohio explore going into business with QED Management LLC and name the partnership Ohio AI. But board members at the time rejected the idea as untested and too risky.\n\nMetcalf later accused the STRS management of misdeed and running a smear campaign against QED.\n\nLaura Bischoff is a reporter for the USA TODAY Network Ohio Bureau, which serves the Columbus Dispatch, Cincinnati Enquirer, Akron Beacon Journal and 18 other affiliated news organizations across Ohio.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

But he referenced a state law that grants him the authority to seek a civil action against state pension board members who breach their fiduciary duty and that could result in their removal.\n\nREAD MORE: DeWine raises 'red flag' about Ohio teachers pension after new board takes over and consultant leaves\n\nThe $94 billion State Teachers Retirement System board has been in turmoil for years. Most recently, the Ohio 10th District Court of Appeals ruled that Wade Steen, a member of the board who Gov. Mike DeWine had ousted a year ago, should be reinstated.\n\nSteen, along with several new board members, were considering big changes to the management of the pension. Many retirees had turned against the board after receiving no cost-of-living raise between 2017 and 2022, which they said caused hardship because their pensions were based off their modest salaries in the classroom. No other state pension had as similarly severe austerity measures.\n\nBut DeWine, who had removed Steen last year from the board, announced late Wednesday afternoon that he had forwarded over a dozen documents to Yost and other state officials, including one that said Steen and some other board members appeared to have been influenced by leaders of a relatively new company with no pension investment experience. Such a \"hostile takeover by private interests\" was referenced in an unsigned memo that was part of those documents.\n\nOne of the leaders of the relatively new company, QED, was Seth Metcalf, Ohio's former deputy treasurer under Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel.\n\nThe company told STRS officials in 2020 they would deploy AI investment strategies, according to an anonymous letter DeWine's staff believes several STRS employees sent to his office to notify him of problems. The letter is among the documents sent to Yost.\n\nIn 2020, Metcalf requested $25 billion to $45 billion in STRS assets. In 2021, Metcalf and his partner told the STRS executive director and another leader that they needed $65 billion in assets to fully implement their strategy.\n\nThis occurred during the austerity measures the board had imposed, and board members such as Steen were trying to restore the COLA. The anonymous letter claimed Steen was using QED's charts about the fund's performance, which were inaccurate.\n\nCleveland.com / The Plain Dealer reached out to Steen for comment.\n\nA group of former retirees called the Ohio Retirement for Teachers Association, which has long been critical of STRS actions and helped raise money to help cover Steen's legal fees in his fight to claw back the seat on the STRS board, said in a statement Wednesday night that this battle is about the direction of the pension plan.\n\nWith Steen's return to the STRS board, the majority of the board is made up of reformers, according to Pension & Investments.\n\n\"Reformers won the battle of ideas through a fair and democratic process over the last six elections,\" Teachers voted for reform because reform is desperately needed. Our actions in support of reform have been legal, ethical and necessary. This anonymous letter is nothing more than sour grapes from those who have lost.\"", "source": {"uri": "cleveland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cleveland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Yost", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dave Yost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiduciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fiduciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_DeWine", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike DeWine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeover", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Takeover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York's_10th_congressional_district", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York's 10th congressional district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasurer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Treasurer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austerity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austerity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retirement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Retirement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Treasurer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Treasurer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Mandel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Mandel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Plain_Dealer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Plain Dealer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Executive director"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/ZI6WDNUQBRCOHJJUPDUJDMVGZU.jpg?auth=94217d8b95e5b13fcf728bbace28651d88fb2ec24b7c84b1405030fa6bd1e1bb&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553760", "eventUri": "eng-9553760", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

Mike DeWine has forwarded the letter sent to him to Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and other state officials. In a May 8 news release, DeWine called the allegations \"disturbing\" and said he \"encourages them to review the document and take any action that may be appropriate under any jurisdiction they have.\"\n\nThe letter obtained by Pensions & Investments, titled \"Summary of Concerns,\" alleges former Ohio Deputy Treasurer Seth Metcalf and his colleague Jonathan Tremmel have been leading the charge of a self-proclaimed reform movement for the past four years in order to take control of tens of billions of dollars of pension fund assets.\n\nAccording to the summary, the two men founded an investment firm called QED Management LLC and pitched a strategy in 2020 they called \"OhioAI\" to then-board member Bob Stein. The strategy, which purports to utilize AI-based trading strategies to generate outsized returns, was pitched to Stein as a way to fix the pension fund's \"problems,\" according to the summary of concerns. The pitch proposed investing between $25 billion and $45 billion in the strategy, the letter said. The pension fund currently has about $94 billion in assets.\n\nAt the time, according to the summary, STRS Chief Investment Officer Matt Worley dismissed the idea, saying the investment did not meet the pension fund's standards. QED Management LLC was not registered as an investment adviser, had no clients or track record and did not own any of the technology they said they had in order to utilize their alleged strategy. After Cliffwater, the pension fund's alternatives consultant, strongly recommended in February 2021 against considering the strategy, the board decided not to pursue the investment.\n\nTrustee Stein then resigned from the board that May, just one month after winning reelection and explained the resignation by citing his desire in a letter to the Ohio Ethics Commission to \"further explore the QED strategy,\" according to the summary of concerns.\n\nSince then, the summary alleges, a campaign by Metcalf and Tremmel in league with the advocacy organization Ohio Retirement for Teachers Association has been led in order to call the investment management of the pension fund into question and create a majority of board members through carefully orchestrated campaigns that would eventually approve the enormous investment with QED Management.\n\nThe summary of concerns also alleges Trustee Wade Steen plays a key role in the efforts. Steen reclaimed his seat at the pension fund's April 18 board meeting after the 10th District Court of Appeals earlier that day ruled that DeWine did not have the authority in May 2023 to remove Steen as his appointed investment expert on the STRS board before the completion of his four-year term.\n\nDeWine originally appointed Steen for a term beginning Nov. 25, 2020, and ending on Sept. 27, 2024.\n\nSteen and other reform-minded trustees have been vocal supporters of an apparently grassroots movement of retirees and active Ohio teachers angry about reduced or eliminated annual COLAs.\n\nAfter DeWine appointed G. Brent Bishop as Steen's replacement, Steen filed suit in June and stated in his complaint that Bishop \"has wrongfully taken and is acting in, the position of the Governor's appointed 'investment expert' to the STRS Board, the public office position to which Mr. Steen is legally entitled and from which Mr. Steen has been wrongfully removed.\"\n\nSteen's restoration to the board creates a 6-5 majority in favor of the reformers.\n\nRetired and active teachers, represented by the Ohio Retirement for Teachers Association, have run an aggressive social media campaign since 2021 and filed a class-action lawsuit that year lambasting the system's investment staff for its compensation structure and investment performance.\n\nThe root of the conflict is the retirement system's board voting to eliminate the COLA every year between 2017 and 2022, after previously cutting the COLA to 2% from 3% for five years beginning in 2012.\n\nPrior to 2012, retirees received an automatic COLA of 3%. It was that year when then-Gov. John Kasich signed into law five pension reform bills each covering one of the state's five retirement systems.\n\nFor Ohio STRS, employee contributions were raised to 14% from 10% and workers gave its board the authority to change the cost-of-living adjustment annually from the previous automatic 3% annual increase. Notably, the employer contribution remained unchanged at 14%, another source of angst among teachers.\n\nFollowing stock market declines in 2008 and 2009, the amortization period for the retirement system's unfunded pension liabilities under the STRS defined benefit plan became infinite, according to legislation passed and now on the books.\n\nAs a result, the law modified the COLA, noting in the uncodified section that modifying future COLAs was \"the most effective means for restoring the long-term solvency\" of the defined benefit plan.\n\nIn their campaigns, the so-called reformers have blamed external management fees, investment staff performance compensation and other costs such as an employee cafeteria for the lack of a permanent COLA.\n\nAccording to STRS documents, the entire annual operating budget of the pension fund is $116 million, while a STRS spokesperson in May 2023 said the cost of a one-time approved 1% COLA for fiscal year 2023 was $1.6 billion.\n\nIn an interview, Robin Rayfield, executive director of the Ohio Retirement for Teachers Association, denied any coordination with QED Management, saying he and his adminstrative assistant are the only staff at the organization.\n\n\"When there's $90 billion at stake, whoever's going to lose that argument, they're not going to go quietly,\" said Rayfield. \"Wall Street is not going to allow Ohio retired teachers to have their money. Wall Street wants to keep it.\"\n\n\"Recent audits demonstrate that STRS Ohio is well-run and that the pension fund is in sound financial position,\" said Dale Price, STRS chairman of the board, in a May 9 statement. \"Questions raised involve board governance. Teachers in the classroom and retired educators should know their pension is safe and secure. STRS Ohio will continue to protect the stability and integrity of the organization and will fully cooperate with all offices in their review of the pension system.\"\n\nMetcalf, Tremmel, Steen and

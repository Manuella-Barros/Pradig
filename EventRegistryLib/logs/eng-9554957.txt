The name of the experience comes from Psalm 148.\n\n\"The idea of All Creation Sings is that often people refer to worship as the 20-25 minutes of the songs being sung at Sunday service, but what we really wanted to do was open people's eyes to see that worship is far more than that,\" said Dylan Thomas, CEO and co-founder of CREATR. \"In fact, worship, when directed at God, can be anything from art or dancing to the way we live our lives - it's far more than just music.\"\n\nThe exhibit takes guests on a journey through four acts, each of which encourages reflection on a different aspect of worship. Act One chronicles the creation story, showing the beauty of divine creativity and how humanity has a role to play. Act Two explores the development of the art of worship and its expression through numerous media. Act Three shows the power of the Bible to shape individual lives and entire societies. The final act, Act Four, imagines the future reality where all creation participates in joyful worship.\n\nThe powerful experience fills 6,500 square feet and employs innovative technology to create a truly interactive experience for guests. LiDAR Scanning technology, state-of-the-art projectors, fully immersive audio, and real-time responsive software enable guests to experience worship in a unique way.\n\nNow open, All Creation Sings has been designed for families and people of any age.\n\nMuseum of the Bible's partnership with CREATR offers two additional facets.

The topic was worship. I have always believed that worship is not what we do on Sunday mornings as we sing. It is a part of worship but by far not the extent of it. Worship is a part of the totality of what we do every minute of our lives if we are believers. We have come to know that everything we do, we do, as unto the Lord. Well, Ben affirmed my belief, and it is always more fun to be affirmed than corrected though both play a part in my growth. It is also a sign in that I have always felt a bit guilty because I am not moved by music, especially contemporary music.\n\nTo understand worship, Ben posed two questions. \"What does worship mean?\" And...\"How do we show worship? In most cases in the Old Testament the word for worship is Shachah, which means to bow down in reverence to something or someone. One verse reads this way. \"Come let us bow down in worship (in reverence), let us kneel before the Lord our maker.\" Psalm 96:6. Jesus declared some people hypocrites. \"These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me, They worship me in vain.\" They are not being honest when they go to church and sing a song and believe they have completed their act of worship. So, we define worship, per scripture, as living in a state of reverence for our King every minute of our lives.\n\nUnderstanding what worship means, leads to the second question, \"How do we show God reverence?\" The Bible indicates in the life of Jesus Christ, that we show reverence by serving them. Paul says, \"Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God - this is your spiritual act of worship.\" Romans 12:1. And then Paul tells us how. \"Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is - His good, pleasing, and perfect will.\" Romans 12:2. So, we see worship is showing God reverence by obeying Him.\n\nJesus used this idea when He said, \"If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. Matthew 16:24. Paul added some clarity when he said, \"Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires, and greed, which is idolatry.\" Colossians 3:5.\n\nFor me, it takes a bit of introspection. I ask myself specific questions. How did I do in serving and showing adoration for my wife today? How is my relationship with my children? How did I relate to a friend, as one wanting something or someone desiring to serve? What were my attitudes when dealing with other drivers on the road or people I pass in the market? What do I allow myself to see that is wrong according to my morality? The questions go on and on. These are a few that I must watch because my earthly nature creates a life that is not kind or beneficial to others except when I can benefit from them.\n\nThe practicality I have discovered in my life, is that my world has far less chaos in it and my mind deals with much less anxiety. I have high confidence that the Lord knows best how to run my life than me. So, every day, in every moment, I must surrender in small ways to what I think I need or want and trust God to bring into my life what will be truly fulfilling.\n\nIf you do not have a church, you attend regularly, consider joining us for a time of fellowship, music, and teaching. Be assured you will never be made to feel you do not fit in because everyone has their own mess to deal with. So, come as you are. You will be welcome.

{"id": 231294668, "title": "Unfinished schooner landlocked in Trabuco Canyon seeks its next adventurer", "text": "The home-built vessel crafted by a blind man in Garden Grove was to sail from California to the Great Lakes, traveling more than 7,000 miles through open and inland waters. Instead, the hull of the schooner named Visions sits landlocked amid a cluster of canyon oak trees, covered in dust, dry leaves and dead branches. The original quest began miles from the ocean, as Don Baumea shaped the boat\u2019s keel and watertight bottom by feel in his backyard. When he died, Robert Heerdt \u2014 an accountant turned fishing lake manager \u2014 bought the unfinished craft, vowing to complete the work and fulfill his predecessor\u2019s dream of sailing it through the Panama Canal to the Great Lakes and beyond. In April, however, Heerdt died without finishing the boat, leaving the watercraft marooned in the front yard of his Trabuco Canyon home. Now, Visions is awaiting its next adventurer willing to carry the dream forward. \u201cI don\u2019t want to destroy it. I want it to live on,\u201d said Tracey Marcyan, the real estate agent tasked with finding a new owner for the 50-foot-long, blue and white hull fashioned from fiberglass planks. \u201cIf someone were to take it, that would be a really happy ending for me \u2026 and (for) the family.\u201d To sell the property, Marcyan must dispose of boats, motor homes, rusting farm implements and a collection of personal treasures Heerdt, 89, left behind on his rambling 6-acre estate. So, she\u2019s offering the dry-docked craft to anyone willing to haul it away, perhaps to convert it into an Airbnb, perhaps to fulfill its destiny of sailing it around the world. The story of Visions is just one more tale about a legion of aspiring mariners who build their \u201cdream boats\u201d in suburban backyards far from the ocean \u2014 with the majority of them failing to ever see water. But it\u2019s also a story about a poetry-loving adventurer who embraced Trabuco Canyon\u2019s freethinking lifestyle in the mid-1960s and later ran the Oso Reservoir fishing club, which introduced thousands of youths to the sport. His adventures included sailing another boat to Mexico, then up the East Coast to visit his son\u2019s family in Maryland. He skied the Swiss Alps, floated down rivers in the Yukon and backpacked through the High Sierras in waist-deep snow, one son recalled. He also was a member of the Vagabundos, a Baja California travel club, and was a regular at the Trabuco General Store\u2019s Chicken Lips Coffee Club. At home, he hunted ducks, rode motorcycles with his twin sons and steeped himself in cowboy culture, voraciously reading Western novels by authors like Louis L\u2019Amour. \u201cHe was \u2026 a cowboy-mariner. He loved adventure,\u201d his son, Kevin Heerdt, 65, reminisced last week in the outdoor cantina his father built. \u201cHe thought he was invincible. \u2026 The world was his oyster.\u201d Seafaring dream Heerdt\u2019s seafaring dream began in the 1970s with Baumea, a boat builder and craftsman who lost his sight to diabetes. He didn\u2019t let his disability stop him from building a boat in his backyard. Using an intricate system of ropes, and aided by his wife, Baumea used the Lapstrake method to construct his hull, overlapping planks made from fiberglass instead of wood to create a watertight bottom. He named his craft Visions. \u201cA person who is really blind is the one who doesn\u2019t think,\u201d the Los Angeles Times quoted Baumea as saying at the time. But Baumea died in 1976 before he could finish his boat. Kevin Heerdt thinks his father learned about Baumea\u2019s story from the newspaper accounts at the time and decided to carry the dream forward. He paid $14,000 or $15,000 to buy the hull from Baumea\u2019s widow in 1978. Heerdt\u2019s dream was even bigger than his Garden Grove peer. In addition to traveling through the Panama Canal to the Caribbean and then up to the Great Lakes, he fantasized about sailing up the Mississippi River, following Lewis and Clark, then crossing the Atlantic and sailing through the Dutch canals and on to the Mediterranean. He moved Visions to a Costa Mesa boatyard and worked on it there. Kevin, attending USC at the time, would come down from college on weekends to help his dad work on the boat. They installed bulkheads, a cabin and portions of the deck. He acquired a diesel engine, but \u201che never got the motor in,\u201d Kevin Heerdt said. Heerdt moved the boat to the front yard of his home about 15 to 20 years ago because he couldn\u2019t afford to continue paying rent at the boat yard. But progress was slow, his son said. The boat was one of many projects Heerdt had going on. \u201cMy dad was the consummate dreamer,\u201d he said. \u201cHe always had five or six projects. He\u2019d work on it, (move on to something else), and come back to it.\u201d Kevin estimates his dad spent an additional $20,000 to $30,000 on the project. Meanwhile, it became something of a local landmark. Occasionally, Heerdt would find wedding parties sneaking onto his property to get pictures of the bride and groom next to the vessel. \u201cThe longer it was here, the more of a fixture it became,\u201d Kevin Heerdt said. About 10 years ago, Heerdt\u2019s plans for the boat changed from a seagoing vessel to converting it into a cabin or guest house. He failed to make that plan happen as well. Backyard builders Baumea and Heerdt were, by no means, alone. Newspaper stories abound of home-built boats over the past several decades. In 1991, Leonard James hired a 150-ton crane to pluck a 45-foot, home-built boat from his backyard in Costa Mesa and onto a trailer. He\u2019d been working on the \u201cConnilen\u201d for 20 years. Six years later, Bill McPherson finished working on \u201cSweet Thang\u201d after 5 \u00bd years, hiring a crane to move the 30-foot wooden trawler from his backyard in Anaheim and onto a truck. In 2005, Tom Dale completed 26 years of work on his classic Galway Hooker, an Irish work boat, and had a crane move it from his backyard in Fullerton out to the street. Unfortunately, Dale crashed the boat onto a sandbar during its maiden voyage, demolishing a quarter-century of labor and dreams. The boat\u2019s name: \u201cAstray.\u201d In 2014, Dillon Griffith was trying to come up with the money to move the \u201cMystic Rose,\u201d another home-built craft, from his Sun Valley backyard to the water after working on it for 37 years. \u201cWe have over a million (dollars) in that boat, and that\u2019s without labor,\u201d Griffith told the Los Angeles Daily News at the time. What motivates such an obsession? Why do people build boats in their backyards? \u201cUsually, it\u2019s the only way they could afford it,\u201d said Jerry Wetzler of San Clemente, who built his own 40-foot catamaran in Newport Beach in the early 1970s. \u201cOr they are craftsmen and, instead of a house, they want to build a boat.\u201d In 1972, Wetzler and a friend spent $248 to buy a set of plans from an Australian boat designer. They then spent $20,000 and the next four years building their craft on a vacant lot near the Mariner\u2019s Mile in Newport Beach while living in a converted bread van. \u201cI was a fireman,\u201d Wetzler said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the money for a 40-foot sailboat.\u201d Forty-eight years later, the retired fire captain still is sailing that catamaran, named Freestyle, and has taken part in the Newport to Ensenada race 47 times. During the 1960s and early 1970s, Costa Mesa was a hotbed of boat building, both for production boats and home-built boats, Wetzler said. \u201cMost boat builders at that time never finished their boats,\u201d he said. \u201cAll these things came up, a change (in their) life. Things like losing your job or having a baby or all that. They didn\u2019t realize how long it would take to build or finish a boat.\u201d These days, it\u2019s unusual for people to build their own boats, said Jonathan Ide of Torrance, a semi-retired marine surveyor who conducts boat safety inspections in Redondo Beach and Long Beach. \u201cThere are people who are inclined to do their own thing and will build their own boat,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s very rare because the time and, of course, the money that you have to invest in it is significant.\u201d A lot of times, they never finish, Ide said. \u201cThey either run out of time or run out of money. Or sometimes, I\u2019ve had cases where the person\u2019s health has deteriorated and they just can\u2019t continue,\u201d he said. In cases where the builder dies before finishing, the family \u201cjust wants to get rid of it.\u201d Sometimes, families are successful in selling those boats, Ide said. And \u201csometimes they end up in the scrapyard.\u201d Oso Bob To many, Heerdt is known as \u201cOso Bob\u201d because of the 15 years he spent running a fishing club at Upper Oso Reservoir, located east of Mission Viejo and about a 10-minute drive from his home. To qualify as members of the Heerdt\u2019s Oso Sportsman Organization, anglers had to take five to 10 youths fishing each year. Heerdt encouraged members to take inner-city kids and residents of the Joplin Boys Ranch, a nearby youth detention facility. Many said Oso Bob had turned their lives around by teaching them to fish, Kevin Heerdt said. Heerdt is survived by his twin sons and a daughter, eight grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. His home goes on the market on June 21, listing agent Marcyan said. The property consists of a 4.5-acre parcel listed for $2.05 million, and a separate 1.4-acre parcel listed for $400,000. In addition to the three-bedroom, 2 \u00bd-bath house, the property includes several cabins. Meanwhile, Marcyan said she\u2019s gotten some nibbles from her offer to give Visions away. But nothing definite yet. \u201cWe have it listed as, \u2018Come take it for free,\u2019 \u201c Marcyan said. Kevin Heerdt said the hull definitely could be seaworthy, although he couldn\u2019t guess how much it would cost to finish the boat. \u201cI would rather buy a boat\u201d than finish building Visions, he said. \u201cBut if you want to build a boat,\u201d he added, \u201cthat\u2019s a great way to start.\u201d", "summary": "Robert Heerdt, known as Oso Bob, tried to complete a blind boat builder's \"Visions,\" only to die before finishing the job.", "url": "https://www.ocregister.com/2024/06/08/unfinished-schooner-landlocked-in-trabuco-canyon-seeks-its-next-adventurer/", "image": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/OCR-L-DREAM-BOAT-0609-JG-01_e325b1.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:00:43", "author": "Jeff Collins", "authors": ["Jeff Collins"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.334}

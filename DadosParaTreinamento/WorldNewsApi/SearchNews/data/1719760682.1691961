The ITV daytime show returned with Kaye as host and Denise Welch, Brenda Edwards and Janet on the panel. They kicked off the programme by talking about modern slang and abbreviations. Kaye reeled off modern terms such as Platty Joobs for the Platinum Jubilee and Gen Elec for the general election. The four stars were not impressed with the new words as they started to share old slang and terms, which they argued were better and made more sense. However, at the end of the debate Janet cheekily asked: \"Can I say t*ts up?\" The audience erupted into laughter as a stern Kaye told her: \"Janet, the answer to that you asked me a question and no.\" They then cut to an ad break but didn't apologise for the swear word. As they returned from the break, they discussed Brenda's fashion choices as she revealed she is a fan of wearing a jumpsuit. She was tasked with wearing a dress as she shared her reasons for why she doesn't like wearing them. Yet her panellists didn't like her reasons for not liking her knees as Kaye urged her to give a dress a go. She got so passionate, she said: \"Well, I mean lets see these b****y...\" Kaye managed to stop herself at the end of the word as she gasped at what she just said. Brenda quipped: \"Everybody is naughty on this panel today, you lot are naughty.\" Denise pointed out: \"It's half term Kaye Adams.\" Kaye said: \"Can I apologise for the language I am sorry for any offence that has been caused.\" Viewers were confused at her apology as some didn't think it was a swear word. One said: \"Why did Kaye apologise for the word b***dy? That's not a bad word #loosewomen.\" Another added: \"#loosewomen B****y isn't really a swear word, for goodness sake.\" Someone else commented: \"lol Kaye #loosewomen.\" Just last week Loose Women star Nadia Sawalha swore live on air. The hit ITV chat show celebrated the 40th anniversary of Cilla Black's hit show, Surprise Surprise, by giving the panel their own surprises. Nadia's surprise was when she spoke about her friendship group before they appeared live in the studio. Nadia was left in tears over the surprise before dropping a hilarious swear word, where she had to apologise for the blunder. Recalling how they met and their friendship, Nadia then revealed her nickname for one of her friends as she said: \"It's so weird the way you keep calling her Helen because we only call her t**s!\" This resulted in loud gasps in the studio as Nadia suddenly realised her error as she covered her mouth in shock while her amused friends added: \"You can't say that, you're going to be in trouble!\" as they all apologised.

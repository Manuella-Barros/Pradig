{"id": 231330392, "title": "Teachers selected for BMC schools await appointment letters", "text": "The new academic year is set to begin within a week, but close to 750 new teachers selected for civic schools in Mumbai are still awaiting their appointment letters. These are from approximately 20,000 qualified candidates selected for vacant teaching positions across government schools in the state run by Zilla Parishad (ZP), multiple civic bodies among others. According to the selected teachers, all other selected candidates have received their appointment letters from respective local administrations, but Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has yet not given them any clarity. One of the candidates, a resident of Pune, said, \u201cI have been selected for teaching position in a BMC school, but with no appointment letter, I am unable to take a decision on shifting. All others waiting for appointment letters are facing the same issue as most are likely to relocate to Mumbai for this job and that is not an easy process.\" These are teaching candidates selected through Pavitra Portal-a technology-based centralised platform used for state-wide teacher recruitment drive held by Maharashtra government\u2019s school education department. The state launched teacher recruitment drive in February for close to 22,000 positions in government schools across the state. Even as candidates were selected, their appointment was initially stalled due to model code of conduct because of general elections. \u201cBut following required permission from the Election Commission, the appointment process also was started and accordingly local administrations in the state issued appointment letters to close to 15,000 candidates selected for vacant positions in schools. But BMC\u2019s education department is yet to declare the process causing anxiety among us,\" said another candidate, adding that they plan to hold agitation outside the BMC education department office to seek clarity. According to candidates, appointment letters will also include directives of other formalities, \"such as medical examination etc, which will take another month or so forcing school to continue with limited teachers,\" said a candidate. Education officer at BMC, Rajesh Kankal, however said this is only a procedural delay and by next week candidates will get information on the next step. \u201cWe are trying to complete the process as soon as possible so that there will be new teachers in BMC schools as the new academic year begins next week,\u201d he said.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/teachers-selected-for-bmc-schools-await-appointment-letters-9380420/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/Left-to-right-2024-06-08T211132.944.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:20:10", "author": "Pallavi Smart", "authors": ["Pallavi Smart"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.462}

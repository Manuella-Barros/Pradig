They also were up 16% to ZAR595.00 in Johannesburg.\n\nBHP was down 3.4% at 2,283.00p in London for a market cap of GBP115.31 billion. They were down 3.5% to ZAR545.52 in Johannesburg. They had closed down 0.6% at AUD45.23 in Sydney on Thursday.\n\nMelbourne-based BHP said its unsolicited, non-binding and conditional offer will see Anglo American shareholders receive 0.7097 of a BHP share for every share share they hold in Anglo American. BHP tabled the offer to the Anglo American board on Tuesday last week, it said.\n\nAs part of the proposed deal, BHP wants Anglo American to split off Anglo American Platinum Ltd and Kumba Iron Ore Ltd in South Africa.\n\nBased on closing market prices on Tuesday this week, being the last trading day prior to press reports of the deal, the offer represents a total value of about GBP25.08 per Anglo American share, including GBP4.86 in Anglo American Platinum shares and GP3.40 in Kumba shares, valuing Anglo American at GBP31.1 billion, BHP said. The premium on the implied market value of Anglo American's unlisted assets is around 31%.\n\nThe proposal merger is subject to due diligence by BHP on Anglo American, which has been offered reciprocal due diligence on BHP.\n\n\"In addition to allowing Anglo American shareholders to realise an immediate and substantial premium over the current value of their Anglo American shares, the combination would deliver further ongoing value for Anglo American shareholders,\" BHP said.\n\nThe combination would bring together the strengths of BHP and Anglo American in an optimal structure, BHP said.\n\nThe combined entity would focus on iron ore and metallurgical coal and future facing commodities, including potash and copper.\n\nBy Artwell Dlamini, Alliance News reporter\n\nComments and questions to newsroom@alliancenews.com\n\nCopyright 2024 Alliance News Ltd.

The two parts of the proposal would be inter-conditional,\" it said.\n\n\"The Board is currently reviewing this proposal with its advisers.\"\n\nThis is effectively a copper play and BHP has no interest in being exposed to South Africa's risky political, social and economic environment -- with the exception of diamonds and De Beers. The proposed merger would see BHP absorb De Beers as well as Anglo's nickel and steelmaking coal assets, its Brazilian iron ore operations and its UK fertiliser project.\n\nAll of the world's major mining companies are on the hunt for copper, an old metal which now has a green sheen as it is seen playing a crucial role in the new low-carbon economy.\n\nIf the deal goes ahead, Anglo will likely spin off Amplats and Kumba the same way that it unbundled its South African coal assets into Thungela.\n\n\"BHP just seems to not want to manage assets in South Africa,\" Bruce Williamson, a mining analyst with Integral Asset Management, told Daily Maverick.\n\n\"Anglo could do what they did with Thungela. They said here are the Anglo coal shares, we are going to put it into a new company, so Anglo shareholders you now have shares in Thungela. If you don't want the coal, sell, if you want it, keep it.\"\n\nBut copper is the magnet at a time when new finds and new mines are tough to come by.\n\n\"The big thing that they are telling the market is that we have looked all over and to find new ore bodies and get a new entity into production is a long hard slog. If you replace the copper that Anglo has got with new copper, you need new exploration, new permitting, new funding, and you will never find the skills,\" Williamson said.\n\nThere has been speculation for some time that Anglo could be a take-over target.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, before Thursday's surge, Anglo's share price had dropped 12% over the last 12 months. That gave the London and JSE-listed company a market value of \u00a327-billion compared to BHP's towering valuation of $149-billion. Anglo's share price shot up 16% this morning.\n\nIf the deal goes through, it will be the biggest in the mining sector in over a decade and could be a harbinger of more mega-mergers as the scramble for copper and other \"green metals\" heats up.

This includes \u00a34.86 in Anglo American Platinum shares and \u00a33.40 in Kumba Iron Ore shares.\n\nThrough the merger, BHP aims to create an entity with a portfolio of large, low-cost, long-life Tier 1 assets centred on iron ore and metallurgical coal, alongside forward-looking commodities such as potash and copper.\n\nThese assets are anticipated to yield substantial cash flows, enabling the combined entity to finance value-enhancing growth initiatives at the optimal time, said BHP.\n\nBesides, the deal is expected to boost BHP's exposure to future facing commodities through Anglo American's copper assets.\n\nAccording to BHP, the transaction will complement its iron ore and metallurgical coal portfolios with Anglo American's iron ore operations in Brazil and metallurgical coal assets in Queensland, Australia.\n\nThe acquisition will also deliver synergies as well as value adding copper growth options and increased geographic diversification of the operating footprint, said BHP.\n\nThe proposal is non-binding and contingent upon customary conditions, including the completion of satisfactory due diligence by BHP. Anglo American has been granted reciprocal due diligence rights from BHP.\n\nBoth parties said there are no guarantees that any formal offer will be made in this regard.\n\nAnglo American stated that the proposal is \"unsolicited, non-binding and highly conditional\". The company's board is presently studying the proposal with its advisers.\n\nLast year, BHP acquired its rival Australian mining company OZ Minerals through a scheme implementation deed (SID) in a deal worth A$9.6bn.", "source": {"uri": "nsenergybusiness.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NS Business"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BHP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumba_Iron_Ore", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kumba Iron Ore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo_American_Platinum", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anglo American Platinum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo_American_plc", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anglo American plc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Common stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallurgical_coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metallurgical coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_ore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iron ore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potash", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Potash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queensland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Queensland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Mineral_Exploration_and_Extraction", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Mineral Exploration and Extraction", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Associations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Native_American", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Native American", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/cut-8-mogalakwena-mine-e1714027678746.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9510508", "eventUri": "eng-9510508", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

It has seen a fall in demand for most of the metals it mines and took a $1.6 billion impairment charge on its De Beers diamond business.\n\nThe global mining sector has seen a recent slew of merger and acquisitions despite rising concerns around the economic outlook of one of the world's largest metals buyer, China.\n\nMore broadly, M&A activity has registered an uptick in the first few months of this year, including mega deals.\n\nBoth of the mining firms have recently identified potash as an important business which would complement their mining operations as food demand grows.\n\nBHP is

The prospective all-share offer from BHP, which is based in the U.K. and Australia, values each Anglo share at 25.08 pounds.\n\nAnglo American, which owns a majority stake in the world-famous De Beers diamond company, said its board was reviewing the approach from BHP.\n\nBHP said the deal would boost its presence in the copper market, which is seeing demand soar amid the shift towards clean energy, as well as giving it greater access to potash, and coking coal in Australia. Copper is particularly sought after as the metal is used widely in electric vehicles, batteries and charging stations.\n\nAnglo, which has big copper plants in Chile and Peru, said that under the deal being proposed by BHP, it would have to spin off two units -- its platinum arm, Anglo American Platinum, and Kumba Iron Ore, which are both listed in South Africa.\n\nBHP added that following any deal, Anglo's other \"high quality operations, including its diamond business\" would be subject to a strategic review.\n\n\"The combination would bring together the strengths of BHP and Anglo American in an optimal structure,\" it said.\n\nUnder U.K. takeover rules, BHP has until May 22 to make a formal offer.\n\n\"The deal would represent the biggest shakeup of the global mining industry in more than a decade,\" said James Whiteside, metals and mining corporate research director at Wood Mackenzie in London.\n\nHowever, he said other companies may look to buy Anglo American themselves, especially if the company's shareholders hold out for a higher price.\n\nThe prospective deal, Whiteside added, \"is all about copper.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The London-based miner confirmed that its board is currently poring over the proposal with its financial advisers.\n\nShould the deal proceed, it would strike another blow to the London stock exchange by stripping it of one of its heavyweight listings as Anglo American would depart the premier league of shares. BHP has proposed a bid of \u00a325.08 per share, which breaks down into \u00a34.86 worth of Anglo Platinum shares and \u00a33.40 in shares of Kumba Iron Ore.\n\nThe acquisition would catapult the combined entity to the position of the world's top copper producer, commanding about 10% of the global market. This move would significantly enhance BHP's footprint in the booming copper sector, which is experiencing heightened demand due to the transition to green energy, while also expanding its reach into potash and Australian coking coal.\n\nCopper's importance is on the rise, given its critical role in renewable energy infrastructure and electric vehicles. A merger between these two giants would represent one of the most significant transactions in the mining industry in years, harking back to the Glencore-Xstrata merger completed in 2013.\n\nAnglo revealed that under BHP's proposed deal, it would need to spin off two of its entities - its platinum business, Anglo American Platinum and Kumba Iron Ore, both listed in South Africa. BHP noted that after the agreement, a strategic review would be conducted on other \"high quality operations, including its diamond business\".\n\nBHP stated: \"The combination would bring together the strengths of BHP and Anglo American in an optimal structure. Anglo American would bring its assets and long-term growth potential.\"\n\n\"BHP would bring its higher margin cash generative assets and growth projects along with its larger free cash flows and stronger balance sheet. Anglo American has a deep pool of talented people who would continue to make a valuable contribution to the successful operation of Anglo American's assets within the combined group.\"\n\nInvestment platform AJ Bell remarked that the London market was \"shrinking fast\", as this possible mining deal marked the second FTSE takeover proposal this year, following the buyout agreement of packaging group DS Smith by a US rival.\n\nDan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said: \"It's crisis time for the London Stock Exchange as it fights to preserve the integrity of the UK market.\"\n\nChief market analyst at Finalto, Neil Wilson pointed out that this follows a heavy tumble of Anglo shares. \"Anglo has not had a great year the rally this morning has erased the losses of the last 12 months, just,\" he said. \"Clearly, competition authorities would take note due to the position in copper a combined company would have. If BHP doesn't make it work, others may try.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "holly_williams@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Holly Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "lawrence_matheson@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Lawrence Matheson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BHP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo_American_plc", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anglo American plc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumba_Iron_Ore", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kumba Iron Ore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo_American_Platinum", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anglo American Platinum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potash", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Potash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_spin-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporate spin-off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coke_(fuel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coke (fuel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Platinum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DS_Smith", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DS Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diamond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTSE_100_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FTSE 100 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Mineral_Exploration_and_Extraction", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Mineral Exploration and Extraction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/money/article32668990.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_anglo-american-shares-surged-after-receiving-a-\u00a3311-billion-takeover-approach-from-rival-bhp-billiton-anglo-americanpa.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9510508", "eventUri": "eng-9510508", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

Anglo is obviously very much in play now and there's probably room for others to interlope. This is going to set the whole sector on fire,\" Cleary said of the BHP offer.\n\nThe proposal comes after Anglo, which had a market capitalisation of $37.7 billion as of Wednesday's close, began a review of its assets in February in response to a 94% plunge in annual profit and a series of writedowns due to a fall in demand for most of the metals it mines.\n\nBHP, the world's biggest listed miner and best-known for mining iron ore, copper, coking coal, potash and nickel, had a market capitalisation of about $149 billion as of Wednesday.\n\nCOPPER FOCUS\n\nThe deal, if agreed, would give BHP access to more copper, one of the most sought after metals for the clean energy transition, and potash, which are its key strategic commodities, as well as more coking coal in Australia.\n\nTechnological developments such as artificial intelligence and automation, and the energy transition, which includes electric vehicles and renewable energy, have driven up demand prospects for copper cable used to conduct electricity.\n\nAnglo has copper mines in Chile and Peru, where BHP also has operations, and their combined output would amount to around 2.6 million metric tons a year, pushing it well ahead of U.S.-based Freeport-McMoRan and Chilean state miner Codelco.\n\nCopper prices on the London Metal Exchange have surged 15% this year, approaching $10,000 a ton and two-year highs on demand hopes sparked by encouraging macroeconomic data, U.S. rate cut bets and speculative trading.\n\nSupply bottlenecks driven by the forced December shutdown of Cobre Panama, one of the world's largest open-pit copper mines, are also fuelling the gains.\n\nAnglo's 2024 copper production guidance is 730,000 to 790,000 tons. BHP is targeting copper production of between 1.7 million and 1.9 million tons for the 12 months ending in June.\n\nAnglo said the proposal would be conditional on being preceded by separate distribution of its entire stakes in Anglo American Platinum and Kumba Iron Ore to its shareholders, which would significantly lower its exposure to South Africa.\n\nAnglo's stakes in the platinum and iron ore miners are worth $7.44 billion and $5.4 billion respectively, according to LSEG data based on Wednesday's close of trade.\n\n\"Anglo would be a good strategic fit for BHP or another major miner due to potential synergies, asset quality, and commodity exposure (especially copper),\" Jefferies analysts said.\n\n\"Anglo consists of an undervalued portfolio of multiple tier-1 assets... Anglo could be a compelling fit,\" they said in a note, adding it could take a premium of around 28% above Anglo's most recent share price to get the deal across the line.\n\nAnalysts expected the deal could also trigger a wave of transactions for any other unwanted assets such as nickel, manganese and diamonds, where Anglo owns 85% of industry giant De Beers.\n\nAnglo said its board was reviewing the proposal. Under UK takeover rules, BHP has until May 22 to make a firm offer.\n\nThe combined coking coal assets of the two miners, both in Australia's Queensland state, could also be subject to regulatory scrutiny given the deal would merge two of the biggest producers in the global seaborne market.\n\nIf the Anglo deal came to fruition, it would be the second major acquisition for BHP in about a year after its 2023 purchase of copper miner Oz Minerals and adds to a frenzy of global M&A activity.\n\nRecent mega-deals in the mining sector include gold giant Newmont's $16.8 billion buyout of Australia-based Newcrest Mining late last year.\n\nIf completed, the deal would likely be among the 10 biggest-ever mining deals by value and has the potential to delist Anglo from the London market, a fresh blow to an exchange that is struggling to retain big companies and attract IPOs.

billion.\n\nIts longtime rival Anglo American has a market value of about $36 billion.\n\nBHP's offer would first hinge on Anglo American splitting off its platinum and iron ore holdings in South Africa.\n\nAnglo American announced this year plans to cut thousands of jobs across its platinum business, which was hit hard by low metal prices.\n\nBHP has signaled in recent years its growing appetite for copper, an increasingly in-demand metal that is poised to play a key role in global energy transitions.\n\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) lists copper, commonly used in electrical wiring as of \"high importance\" for the development of solar panels, electricity networks, electric vehicles and rechargeable batteries.\n\nBHP completed the $6 billion acquisition of Australian copper miner Oz Minerals in May last year.\n\nAustralian renewable energy finance expert Tim Buckley was not convinced the takeover bid was a wise move.\n\n\"I question what the takeover brings aside from complexity,\" he told Agence France-Presse (AFP) before the bid was confirmed.\n\nBoth BHP and Anglo American have been hit by global downturns in nickel, which is essential for the manufacture of stainless steel and rechargeable batteries.\n\nBHP reported an 86% slump in its half-year net profit this year, caused by a write-down of its nickel assets and costs related to a 2015 Brazilian mining disaster.\n\nNickel prices have dropped about 40% in the past year as new refining techniques enabled low-quality metal from Indonesia to be used instead for batteries.", "source": {"uri":

Anglo could be a compelling fit,\" they said in a note, adding it could take a premium of around 28% above Anglo's most recent share price to get the deal across the line.\n\nAnalysts expected the deal could also trigger a wave of transactions for any other unwanted assets such as nickel, manganese and diamonds, where Anglo owns 85% of industry giant De Beers.\n\nAnglo said its board was reviewing the proposal. Under UK takeover rules, BHP has until May 22 to make a firm offer.\n\nThe combined coking coal assets of the two miners, both in Australia's Queensland state, could also be subject to regulatory scrutiny given the deal would merge two of the biggest producers in the global seaborne market.\n\nIf the Anglo deal came to fruition, it would be the second major acquisition for BHP in about a year after its 2023 purchase of copper miner Oz Minerals and adds to a frenzy of global M&A activity.\n\nRecent mega-deals in the mining sector include gold giant Newmont's $16.8 billion buyout of Australia-based Newcrest Mining late last year.\n\nIf completed, the deal would likely be among the 10 biggest-ever mining deals by value and has the potential to delist Anglo from the London market, a fresh blow to an exchange that is struggling to retain big companies and attract IPOs.", "source": {"uri": "sabcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SABC News - Breaking news, special reports, world, business, sport coverage of all South African current events.

The total per-share value of the non-binding proposal was about \u00a325.08, BHP said, a 14 per cent premium to Anglo's closing share price on Wednesday.\n\nA tie-up with Anglo would give BHP roughly 10 per cent of global copper mine supply ahead of an expected shortage that many market watchers have predicted will send prices soaring. If successful, the transaction would mark a return to large-scale dealmaking for BHP, while potentially flushing out other suitors aiming to boost their exposure to the metal that's closely linked to the global energy transition.\n\nAnglo shares jumped 14 per cent in London on Thursday to \u00a325.07 apiece, for a market value of \u00a330.7 billion. The company said in a statement late Wednesday that its board was reviewing the proposal, which it confirmed after Bloomberg first reported BHP's interest. BHP, which has a value of about $146 billion, fell 2.6 per cent.\n\nAnglo American has long been viewed as a potential target among the largest miners, particularly because it owns attractive South American copper operations at a time when most of the industry is eager to add reserves and production. However, suitors have been put off by its complicated structure and mix of other commodities from platinum to diamonds, and especially its deep exposure to South Africa.\n\nAnglo has faced a series of major setbacks over the past year as prices for some of its key products plunged, while operational difficulties have forced the company to slash its production targets -- driving down its valuation and leaving the company vulnerable to potential bidders.\n\nStill, analysts suggested that BHP may need to raise its offer -- Anglo shares were trading above \u00a330 early last year.\n\n\"We would be surprised if this is BHP's final offer,\" analysts from Jefferies LLC led by Christopher LaFemina said in an emailed note. \"We estimate that a price of at least \u00a328/sh would be necessary for serious discussions to take place, and a takeout price of well above \u00a330 per share would be the outcome if other bidders were to get involved.\"\n\nA successful takeover would represent the first mega deal among the world's biggest diversified miners in more than a decade. BHP and its rivals spent years on the sidelines after a series of disastrous transactions, but there has been a growing expectation that the industry is heading for a wave of M&A as companies are flush with cash and management teams have worked hard to reassure investors that they have learned from past mistakes.\n\nBHP last year bought copper producer OZ Minerals Ltd. for about $6.4 billion in its first major purchase in years, but has otherwise focused until now on selling assets such as oil, gas and coal.\n\nThe clear lure here would be Anglo's South American copper business, long eyed by bigger players in the industry -- even though it has recently faced setbacks and has had to reduce its production forecasts.\n\nWhile BHP said that Anglo's non-South African iron ore business and its coking coal mines in Australia would fit well with its existing operations, the future of Anglo's De Beers diamond unit was less certain.\n\nBHP -- which was once a major diamond producer itself -- said that business would be put on a strategic review, along with other Anglo assets, which would likely include its nickel operations in Brazil. Anglo itself has already been reviewing the future of its business units including De Beers.\n\nBoth companies are also investing in new fertilizer businesses -- BHP is building a massive potash mine in Canada, while Anglo is developing a polyhalite mine on the east coast of England.\n\nThe combination proposed by BHP would be likely to draw antitrust scrutiny, particularly given the large percentage of global copper production that would be concentrated into a single company. Governments around the world are increasingly viewing copper as a strategic mineral, given its central role in the energy transition.\n\nBHP produced about 1.2 million tons of copper in 2023 on an equity basis, while Anglo's output was 826,000 tons.\n\nIt's also possible that the proposal for Anglo could now prompt others to make a move. No. 2 miner Rio Tinto Group has also been investing in copper production, while Glencore Plc last year made an unsuccessful offer for Teck Resources Ltd., which has a coveted copper business, before eventually reaching a deal for the Canadian company's coal assets.\n\nThe bid comes with copper prices trading around two-year highs near $10,000 a ton, and many prominent figures in the industry calling for further gains as a supply crisis deepens. Along with the closure of a giant mine in Panama, major production setbacks at Anglo American have contributed to an unexpected squeeze on mined supplies, and added urgency to long-running warnings that the market could see historic deficits as demand accelerates during the energy transition.\n\nAnglo's valuation may make it more attractive, but it remains a highly complicated business. The company owns majority stakes in two South African-listed miners -- Anglo American Platinum Ltd. and Kumba Iron ore Ltd. It also has a long and complicated relationship with South Africa, where the state pension fund manager is its biggest shareholder.\n\nSouth Africa's Public Investment Corp. said it will assess any offers that are presented to shareholders, but reiterated that \"the mining sector remains a critical part of the South African economy, impacting a wide variety of stakeholders, therefore, new opportunities that may arise in the sector need to take these factors and long-term sustainability into account.\"\n\nCenterview Partners, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley are advising

Anglo is obviously very much in play now and there's probably room for others to interlope. This is going to set the whole sector on fire.\"\n\nThe proposal comes after Anglo, which had a market capitalisation of $37.7bn as of Wednesday's close, began a review of its assets in February after a 94% plunge in annual profit and a series of writedowns due to a fall in demand for most of the metals it mines.\n\nAnglo owns mines in countries including Chile, SA, Brazil and Australia.\n\nBHP, the world's biggest listed miner and best-known for mining iron ore, copper, coking coal, potash and nickel, had a market capitalisation of about $149bn as of Wednesday.\n\nCopper in focus\n\nThe deal, if agreed, would give BHP access to more copper, one of the most sought after metals for the clean energy transition, and potash, which are its key strategic commodities, as well as more coking coal in Australia.\n\nTechnological developments such as artificial intelligence and automation, and the energy transition, which includes electric vehicles and renewable energy, have driven up demand prospects for copper cable used to conduct electricity.\n\nAnglo has copper mines in Chile and Peru, countries in which BHP also has operations, and their combined output would amount to around 2.6-million metric tons a year, or about 10% of global production, pushing it well ahead of US-based Freeport-McMoRan and Chilean state miner Codelco.\n\nCopper prices on the London Metal Exchange have surged 15% this year, approaching $10,000 a ton and two-year highs on demand hopes sparked by encouraging macroeconomic data, US rate cut bets and speculative trading.\n\nSupply bottlenecks driven by the forced December shutdown of Cobre Panama, one of the world's largest open-pit copper mines, are also fuelling the gains.\n\nAnglo's 2024 copper production guidance is 730,000 to 790,000 tonnes. BHP is targeting copper production of between 1.7-million and 1.9-million tonnes for the 12 months ending in June.\n\nAsset carve-outs\n\nAnglo said the proposal would be conditional on being preceded by separate distribution of its entire stakes in Anglo American Platinum and Kumba Iron Ore to its shareholders, which would significantly lower its exposure to SA.\n\nAnglo's stakes in the platinum and iron ore miners are worth $7.44bn and $5.4bn respectively, according to LSEG data based on Wednesday's close of trade.\n\n\"Anglo is hurt due to its poor South African asset so ripe to be acquired,\" said Nicolas Van Broekhoven, CrossASEAN Research analyst who publishes on Smartkarma.\n\nThe deal could also trigger a wave of transactions for any other unwanted assets such as nickel, manganese and diamonds, where Anglo owns 85% of industry giant De Beers.\n\n\"There can be no certainty that any offer will be made nor as to the terms on which any such offer might be made,\" Anglo American said in a statement, adding the unsolicited proposal is non-binding and highly conditional.\n\nThe company said its board was reviewing the proposal and did not disclose the share ratio on offer. Under UK takeover rules, BHP has until May 22 to make a firm offer.\n\nBHP declined to comment when asked about preliminary talks with Anglo, first reported by Bloomberg. The Australian market is closed on Thursday for a public holiday.\n\nJefferies analysts said it could take a premium of around 28% above Anglo's most recent share price to get the deal across the line, adding the increased copper market concentration could raise antitrust concerns.\n\nTheir combined coking coal assets, both in Australia's Queensland state, could also be subject to regulatory scrutiny given the deal would merge two of the biggest producers in the global seaborne market.\n\nIf the Anglo American deal came to fruition, it would be the second major acquisition for BHP in about a year after its 2023 purchase of copper miner Oz Minerals and adds to a frenzy of global M&A activity.\n\nRecent mega-deals in the mining sector include gold giant Newmont's $16.8bn buyout of Australia-based Newcrest Mining late last year.\n\nOnce the deal is completed, it would likely be among the 10 biggest-ever mining deals by value and has the potential to delist Anglo from the London market, a fresh blow to an exchange that is struggling to retain big companies and to attract new share offerings.\n\nReuters", "source": {"uri": "businesslive.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title":

That would give the combined group roughly a 10% share of global mine supply.\n\nJefferies said antitrust issues \"would likely be a problem\" for the deal since governments consider copper a critical mineral.\n\nAnglo has faced a series of major setbacks over the past year as prices for some of its key products plunged, while operational difficulties have forced the company to slash its production targets -- driving down its valuation and leaving the company vulnerable to potential bidders.\n\nIt said in its statement that its board was reviewing the proposal, and there was no certainty an offer would be made.\n\nAnglo's shares have dropped 12% over the last 12 months, giving the company a market value of \u00a327 billion ($34 billion). BHP, which trades in London and Sydney, has a market value of about $149 billion.\n\nBig Deals\n\nA successful takeover would represent the first mega-deal among the world's biggest diversified miners in over a decade. BHP and its biggest rivals spent years on the sidelines after a series of disastrous transactions but have warmed up to the prospect of dealmaking after reassuring investors that they have learned from past mistakes.\n\n\"We would need to see the price BHP had in mind in order to form a better view,\" Adrian Prendergast, senior analyst at Morgans Financial, said in an emailed note.\n\nA takeover of Anglo would be \"material but not transformative\" for BHP given the size of the target, he said.\n\nBHP last year bought copper producer OZ Minerals Ltd. for about $6.4 billion in its first major purchase in years, but has otherwise focused until now on selling assets such as oil, gas and coal.\n\nThe clear lure here would be Anglo's South American copper business, long-eyed by bigger players in the industry -- even though it has recently faced setbacks and has had to reduce its copper production forecasts.\n\nIt's also possible that the proposal for Anglo could now prompt others to make a move. No. 2 miner Rio Tinto Group has also been investing in copper production, while Glencore last year made an unsuccessful offer for Teck Resources, which has a coveted copper business, before eventually reaching a deal for the Canadian company's coal assets.\n\nAnglo's valuation may make it more attractive, but it remains a highly complicated business. The company owns majority stakes in two South African-listed miners -- Anglo American Platinum and Kumba Iron ore -- and is the majority owner of diamond miner De Beers.\n\nIt also has a long and complicated relationship with South Africa, where the state pension fund manager is its biggest shareholder.\n\nBHP's proposal was to first hand Anglo's stakes in the two South African businesses to the smaller company's investors before proceeding with a takeover, Anglo said. The two parts of the proposal would be \"inter-conditional,\" it said.\n\nAnglo's other operations include copper, nickel, steelmaking coal, Brazilian iron ore, and the iconic De Beers business.\n\nBoth companies are also investing in new fertilizer businesses -- BHP is building a massive potash mine in Canada, while Anglo is developing a polyhalite mine on the east coast of England.", "source": {"uri": "businesstech.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessTech"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BHP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo_American_plc", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anglo American plc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_ore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iron ore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Platinum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferies_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jefferies Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mineral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Tinto_(corporation)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rio Tinto (corporation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glencore", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glencore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Beers", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "De Beers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potash", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Potash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Copper demand is forecast to grow rapidly in the coming years, due to electrification, and with big greenfield projects thin on the ground, this could be BHP's best chance to increase its footprint.\n\nBHP's lack of interest in Kumba and Amplats is unsurprising. The businesses have been a drag on Anglo American over the last year, hit hard by logistical and power issues in South Africa, and with both businesses implementing job cuts.\n\nBHP also heavily hinted that De Beers, the diamond arm, would remain up for sale.\n\nAnd the fact that Anglo has already been seeking a buyer for De Beers is unlikely to deter BHP, as diamond mining is hardly driving profits at the moment.\n\nThe tie up would also tilt the BHP commodity basket even more strongly toward fertilizer. In addition to its massive project in Saskatchewan, Canada, the company would take over the troubled Woodsmith polyhalite mine in North Yorkshire, UK.\n\nAnglo has previously signalled that it is looking for a partner at Woodsmith, which has proved a money sink for the company.\n\nAn enlarged BHP would certainly have the capital to forge ahead at Woodsmith, but skeptics might prefer to see Jansen in production, and measure the effect on potash prices, before they commit even more billions to another mine, particularly one producing a relatively obscure variety of potash.\n\nIf BHP does succeed in swallowing up Anglo American, it would be a massive blow to the LSE's reputation as mining jurisdiction. BHP delisted in London in 2022, moving its main listing to the ASX.\n\nWith Anglo gone, that would leave just two large diversified miners in London, Glencore and Rio Tinto. Rio Tinto is already duel listed, in London and the ASX.\n\nAnd Glencore is currently in the middle of a shakeup that is likely to result in its coal business, at least, leaving London, while activist shareholders are agitating for the entire company to shift its listing to Australia, or New York.\n\nSuch an exodus of miners, over just a few years, would be a dismal advertisement for new listings, and could lead London investors to slash their mining research spend.", "source": {"uri": "mining-journal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mining Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

If successful, it would be the biggest takeover since Glencore's US$90-billion merger with Xstrata, owner of Canada's Falconbridge nickel miner, in 2013.\n\nBased in Melbourne, BHP is the world's biggest mining company and is led by Mike Henry, who is Canadian and has been the CEO since the start of 2020. If BHP's offer is accepted, the company would emerge as the world's top producer of copper, up from third-largest, according to RBC Capital Markets.\n\nThe enlarged BHP would control about 10 per cent of the global supply of copper, a metal that essential for electric vehicles, wind turbines, electrical grids and residential and commercial-property wiring. Demand for the metal is surging, driving up the price and creating shortages as fewer big mines are developed.\n\nAnglo said it was reviewing the proposal, and made no comment about its value. Under U.K. takeover rules, Anglo has until May 22 to convert its proposal into a firm offer.\n\nBHP said on Thursday that it had offered 0.7097 BHP shares for each Anglo share, valuing Anglo shares at pounds 25.08 apiece. In midday trading on the London exchange, Anglo shares had climbed 13 per cent to pounds 24.96, giving the company a market value of pounds 30-billion and reversing a losing year on the stock market. BHP shares fell about 2 per cent.\n\nBen Cleary, portfolio manager at Australia's Tribeca Investment Partners, which holds stakes in BHP and Anglo, said competing bids could emerge for Anglo, given the high demand for copper. \"I think it's a good deal for BHP. Anglo is obviously very much in play now and there's probably room for others to interloper,\" he told Reuters, \"This is going to set the whole sector on fire.\"\n\nBHP said its goal was to boost its \"exposure to future facing commodities through Anglo American's world class copper assets.\" Copper produces about 40 per cent of Anglo's profits; the company has substantial ownership, or joint ventures, in five big copper mines in Chile and Peru. Collectively, they give Anglo about 760,000 tonnes of copper production a year.\n\nBut BHP's bid is complicated, and has been compared to buying a six-bedroom house in order to get the garage. Mr. Henry does not want all of Anglo, whose conglomerate structure includes diamonds, through the De Beers subsidiary, nickel, platinum, iron ore, manganese and crop nutrients through its troubled Woodsmith potash mine in England.\n\nBHP's offer is conditional on Anglo demerging its entire holdings in Anglo American Platinum (known as Amplats) and Kumba Iron Ore, two divisions that BHP does not want. Were the spinoffs to happen, Anglo would be focused largely on copper and diamonds. BHP said De Beers, along with other assets, such as Anglo's nickel business in Brazil, would be subject to a \"strategic review post-completion,\" suggesting they might be put on the auction block.\n\nAnalysts said they doubted that BHP's opening proposal would succeed. In a note, Jefferies & Co. of New York said a \"price of at least \u00a328 [per share] would be necessary for serious discussions to take place, and a takeout price of well above \u00a330 per share would be the outcome if other bidders were to get involved.\"\n\nMost of the big mining companies are trying to bulk up in copper. Last year, Glencore made a hostile, US$22.5-billion takeover offer for copper-heavy Teck Resources of Vancouver. The bid was rejected, but Teck later agreed to sell its metallurgical coal operations to Glencore. A year earlier Rio Tinto completed its purchase of Turquoise Hill Resources for US$3.1-billion, giving it 66 per cent of the enormous Oyu Tolgoi copper project in Mongolia.\n\nBHP did not make a rival bid for Teck but has expressed interest in buying Glencore's copper assets in recent years, specifically the Collahuasi copper mine in northern Chile, which is a joint venture with Anglo, and the Antamina mine in Peru, a joint venture with BHP and Teck.\n\nGlencore has always been aggressive and opportunistic on the mergers and acquisitions front. But given its agreement to buy 77 per cent of Teck's coal division for almost US$7-billion - a deal that has yet to receive Canadian regulatory approval - it may decide that it cannot take on another big acquisition so soon. Rio Tinto seems better placed to mount a rival offer.\n\nPolitical dimensions make any bid for Anglo complicated. The company's biggest shareholder is South Africa's state-owned Public Investment Corp. (PIC). While PIC did not comment on BHP's offer price, it did say \"The mining sector remains a critical part of the South African economy, impacting a wide variety of stakeholders, therefore, new opportunities that may arise in the sector need to take these factors and long-term sustainability into account.\"\n\nLater on Thursday, South Africa's mineral resources minister, Gwede Mantashe, told the Financial Times that he was not in favour of the BHP proposal because the country's previous experience with BHP was \"not positive.\"", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType":

And the reason why BHP is particularly interested in Anglo American is because it has some pretty vast copper operations and copper is seen as crucial in the green transition.\"\n\nAnd if agreed, this deal would forge a copper mining group with about 10% of global output.\n\nIt could also trigger further transactions in the sector, which has seen a rush of mergers and acquisitions as companies review portfolios to raise exposure to metals considered critical to the global energy transition.\n\nA takeover of Anglo by BHP would likely be among the 10 biggest-ever mining deals by value.\n\nIt has the potential to delist Anglo from the London market - a fresh blow to an exchange that is struggling to retain big companies and attract IPOs.\n\nBut some said BHP would need to offer more to get a deal.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

It is also counting on huge demand from the urbanisation of ten of millions of people across China and India, as well as in electrification of energy and transportation.\n\nLondon-listed Anglo American confirmed the all-scrip offer from BHP on Thursday.\n\nA successful deal would push BHP ahead of its rivals as the world's biggest copper producer, increase its footprint in coking coal mining in Queensland's Bowen Basin and boost its iron ore presence in Brazil.\n\nMr Henry has made no secret of the company's desire to bet big on copper, warning last year that there was a $300 billion shortfall in investment in the commodity.\n\nAhead of any transaction, Anglo American would spin off the South African iron ore and platinum businesses that make up a big chunk of its earnings.\n\nAnglo American said the offer from BHP was unsolicited and non-binding.\n\n\"There is no certainty that any offer will be made nor as the terms on which any such offer might be made,\" said Anglo American, which is reviewing the proposal.\n\nJefferies analysts suggested BHP might face competition in its quest for Anglo American. The broker said the takeover target was a good strategic fit for BHP and other major miners because of potential synergies, asset quality and commodity exposure - particularly in copper.\n\n\"Our analysis suggests that Anglo consists of an undervalued portfolio of multiple tier 1 assets several of which are in low-risk jurisdictions (Australia, Chile, Peru and Brazil),\" Jefferies said.\n\nAnglo American, a major copper producer in South America, mines coal used in steel-making adjacent to BHP mines in the Bowen Basin and also mines manganese in Australia. It produces nickel, diamonds, iron ore and platinum from mines in Brazil, China, Peru and South Africa.\n\nShares of Anglo American have fallen 12 per cent over the past 12 months, giving the company a market value of \u00a327 billion on Wednesday's price. BHP has a market value of about $230 billion.\n\nIt is understood that BHP also identified synergies in the Australian coking coal operations - specifically the Moranbah, Dawson, Grosvenor and Aquila mines - and in Anglo American's iron ore business in Brazil that was boosted by an acquisition and infrastructure access deal with Vale.\n\nAnglo American's majority-owned platinum business, known as Amplats, and Kumba iron operations are already listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, providing an avenue for a spin-off.\n\nBHP confirmed the terms of its offer are predicated on Anglo Platinum and Kumba being split out of Anglo American as a pro rata distribution.\n\nKumba is the world's fifth-largest iron ore producer with a market capitalisation of about $11.9 billion. Iron ore contributed $US4 billion to Anglo American's underlying earnings of $US10 billion last year, followed by copper ($US3.23 billion), coking coal ($US1.32 billion) and platinum ($US1.2 billion).\n\nA demerger of Kumba would help overcome any antitrust barriers to BHP's acquisition of Anglo American and may suit BHP, given it exited South Africa by spinning off non-core assets into South32 in 2015 and selling its stake in Richards Bay Minerals to Rio Tinto.\n\nAnglo American last week reported an 11 per cent jump in its copper production in the March quarter to 198,000 tonnes. It outlined plans to boost copper production to a million tonnes a year in the 2030s and for growth in iron ore amid flagging shareholder support.\n\nBHP is poised to overtake Chile's state-owned Codelco as the world's biggest copper producer and reported last week that it was on track to produce up to 1.91 million tonnes in 2023-24.\n\nCodelco is in talks with Anglo American about a Chilean mining tie-up.\n\nRio also has big ambitions in copper but has said there is more value in developing new mines than buying existing assets.\n\nRio executive Bold Baatar said on the sidelines of the CRU World Copper Conference in Santiago on April 17: \"Just bringing one and one together doesn't add more copper.\"\n\nAnglo American just reported a steep fall in profit and lowered its dividend after a slump in key commodities it produces. It has written down the value of its De Beers diamond unit and dramatically slashed its copper production goals.\n\nThe company has also proposed cutting 3700 jobs across its South African platinum operations and took a writedown on its nickel business.\n\nBHP and Anglo American have common ground in fertiliser, where BHP is forging ahead with its potash venture in Canada. Anglo American paid \u00a3405 million for Gina Rinehart-backed Sirius Minerals in 2020 in a deal that rescued the North Yorkshire potash project from the brink of collapse.", "source": {"uri":

A bid that values Anglo at $42.6 billion -- a 28% premium based on its latest share price -- might get a deal \"across the finish line,\" they said.\n\nAnglo American has long been viewed as a potential target among the largest miners, particularly because it owns big South American copper operations at a time when most of the industry is eager to add reserves and production.\n\nHowever, suitors have been put off by its complicated structure and mix of commodities, and especially its deep exposure to South Africa.\n\nBHP produced about 1.2 million tons of copper in 2023 on an equity basis, while Anglo's output was 826,000 tons. That would give the combined group roughly a 10% share of global mine supply.\n\nJefferies said antitrust issues \"would likely be a problem\" for the deal since governments consider copper a critical mineral.\n\nAnglo has faced a series of major setbacks over the past year as prices for some of its key products plunged, while operational difficulties have forced the company to slash its production targets -- driving down its valuation and leaving the company vulnerable to potential bidders.\n\nIt said in its statement that its board was reviewing the proposal and there was no certainty an offer would be made.\n\nAnglo's shares have dropped 12% over the last 12 months, giving the company a market value of \u00a327 billion ($34 billion). BHP, which trades in London and Sydney, has a market value of about $149 billion.\n\nBig Deals\n\nA successful takeover would represent the first mega deal among the world's biggest diversified miners in over a decade. BHP and its biggest rivals spent years on the sidelines after a series of disastrous transactions, but have warmed up to the prospect of dealmaking after reassuring investors that they have learned from past mistakes.\n\n\"We would need to see the price BHP had in mind in order to form a better view,\" Adrian Prendergast, senior analyst at Morgans Financial Ltd. said in an emailed note.\n\nA takeover of Anglo would be \"material but not transformative\" for BHP given the size of the target, he said.\n\nBHP last year bought copper producer OZ Minerals Ltd. for about $6.4 billion in its first major purchase in years, but has otherwise focused until now on selling assets such as oil, gas and coal.\n\nThe clear lure here would be Anglo's South American copper business, long eyed by bigger players in the industry -- even though it has recently faced setbacks and has had to reduce its copper production forecasts.\n\nIt's also possible that the proposal for Anglo could now prompt others to make a move. No. 2 miner Rio Tinto Group has also been investing in copper production, while Glencore last year made an unsuccessful offer for Teck Resources, which has a coveted copper business, before eventually reaching a deal for the Canadian company's coal assets.\n\nAnglo's valuation may make it more attractive, but it remains a highly complicated business. The company owns majority stakes in two South African-listed miners -- Anglo American Platinum Ltd. and Kumba Iron ore Ltd. -- and is the majority owner of diamond miner De Beers.\n\nIt also has a long and complicated relationship with South Africa, where the state pension fund manager is its biggest shareholder.\n\nBHP's proposal was to first hand Anglo's stakes in the two South African businesses to the smaller company's investors before proceeding with a takeover, Anglo said. The two parts of the proposal would be \"interconditional,\" it said.\n\nAnglo's other operations include copper, nickel, steelmaking coal, Brazilian iron ore, and the iconic De Beers business.\n\nBoth companies are also investing in new fertilizer businesses -- BHP is building a massive potash mine in Canada, while Anglo is developing a polyhalite mine on the east coast of England.", "source": {"uri": "dailyinvestor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "dailyinvestor.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BHP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo_American_plc", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anglo American plc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Platinum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_ore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iron ore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mineral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Tinto_(corporation)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rio Tinto (corporation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glencore", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glencore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Beers", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "De Beers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potash", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Potash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Check out their Stories!\n\nAustralian mining giant BHP confirmed on Thursday a $38.8 billion takeover bid for British rival Anglo American, a colossal deal with the potential to fundamentally reshape the sector.\n\nBoth companies have been wrestling with the transition away from traditional money makers such as gas and coal, increasingly eyeing opportunities to mine metals and critical minerals.\n\nBHP confirmed in a statement to the London Stock Exchange it interested in Anglo American's \"world class copper assets\", which include operations in Peru and Chile.\n\n\"The combination would bring together the strengths of BHP and Anglo American in an optimal structure,\" the statement said.\n\nLondon-based Anglo American earlier confirmed that its board was \"reviewing\" an offer from BHP but did not disclose the price.\n\n\"There can be no certainty that any offer will be made nor as to the terms on which any such offer might be made,\" Anglo American said in a statement.\n\n\"Pending any further announcements Anglo American shareholders should take no action.\"\n\nAnglo American stocks were up almost 12 percent in early London trading. Market reaction was muted in Australia due to a public holiday.\n\nNicknamed the \"Big Australian\", BHP claims to be the largest mining company in the world with a market value of around $148 billion.\n\nIts longtime rival Anglo American has a market value of about $36 billion.\n\nBHP's offer would first hinge on Anglo American splitting off its platinum and iron ore holdings in South Africa.\n\nAnglo American announced this year plans to cut thousands of jobs across its platinum business, which was hit hard by low metal prices.\n\nBHP has signalled in recent years its growing appetite for copper, an increasingly in-demand metal that is poised to play a key role in global energy transitions.\n\nThe International Energy Agency lists copper -- commonly used in electrical wiring -- as of \"high importance\" for the development of solar panels, electricity networks, electric vehicles and rechargeable batteries.\n\nBHP completed the $6 billion acquisition of Australian copper miner Oz Minerals in May last year.\n\nAustralian renewable energy finance expert Tim Buckley was not convinced the takeover bid was a wise move.\n\n\"I question what the takeover brings aside from complexity,\" he told AFP before the bid was confirmed.\n\nBoth BHP and Anglo American have been hit by global downturns in nickel, which is essential for the manufacture of stainless steel and rechargeable batteries.\n\nBHP reported an 86 percent slump in its half-year net profit this year, caused by a write-down of its nickel assets and costs related to a 2015 Brazilian mining disaster.\n\nNickel prices have dropped about 40 percent in the past year as new refining techniques enabled low-quality metal from Indonesia to be used instead for batteries.", "source": {"uri":

The project already employs more than 1,650 people at its sites in Whitby, Teesside and Scarborough.\n\nUK-headquartered Anglo American's shares shot up by as much as 14 per cent in morning trading on Thursday after revealing overnight that Australia's BHP - the world's biggest miner - had put forward the \"unsolicited\" and \"highly conditional\" takeover proposal.\n\nAnglo said its board was reviewing the approach with its advisers.\n\nUnder the potential deal, BHP said it would offer \u00a325.08 a share, including \u00a34.86 a share in Anglo Platinum stock and \u00a33.40 in Kumba Iron Ore company shares.\n\nThe takeover would create the world's biggest copper miner, with around 10 per cent of global output.\n\nDon't miss out on the latest news and stories.

clean energy, as well as giving it greater access to potash, and coking coal in Australia.\n\nCopper is particularly sought after, as the metal is used in renewable energy projects and electric vehicles.\n\nA tie-up between the pair would be one of the biggest deals in the sector in recent years - since the Glencore buyout of Xstrata in 2013.\n\nAnglo said that under the deal being proposed by BHP, it would have to spin off two Anglo units - its platinum arm Anglo American Platinum and Kumba Iron Ore, which are both listed in South Africa.\n\nBHP added that following any deal, Anglo's other \"high quality operations, including its diamond business\" would be subject to a strategic review.\n\nBHP said: \"The combination would bring together the strengths of BHP and Anglo American in an optimal structure.\n\n\"Anglo American would bring its assets and long-term growth potential.\n\n\"BHP would bring its higher margin cash generative assets and growth projects along with its larger

Market reaction was muted in Australia due to a public holiday.\n\n- 'Big Australian' -\n\nNicknamed the \"Big Australian\", BHP claims to be the largest mining company in the world with a market value of around $148 billion.\n\nIts longtime rival Anglo American has a market value of about $36 billion.\n\nBHP's offer would first hinge on Anglo American splitting off its platinum and iron ore holdings in South Africa.\n\nAnglo American announced this year plans to cut thousands of jobs across its platinum business, which was hit hard by low metal prices.\n\nBHP has signalled in recent years its growing appetite for copper, an increasingly in-demand metal that is poised to play a key role in global energy transitions.\n\nThe International Energy Agency lists copper -- commonly used in electrical wiring -- as of \"high importance\" for the development of solar panels, electricity networks, electric vehicles and rechargeable batteries.\n\nBHP completed the $6 billion acquisition of Australian copper miner Oz Minerals in May last year.\n\n- Crucial copper -\n\nAustralian renewable energy finance expert Tim Buckley was not convinced the takeover bid was a wise move.\n\n\"I question what the takeover brings aside from complexity,\" he told AFP before the bid was confirmed.\n\nBoth BHP and Anglo American have been hit by global downturns in nickel, which is essential for the manufacture of stainless steel and rechargeable batteries.\n\nBHP reported an 86 percent slump in its half-year net profit this year, caused by a write-down of its nickel assets and costs related to a 2015 Brazilian mining disaster.\n\nNickel prices have dropped about 40 percent in the past year as new refining techniques enabled low-quality metal from Indonesia to be used instead for batteries.\n\nsft/pbt\n\nMore from this section\n\nOn Volunteer Recognition Day, the Church of Scientology Nashville Thanks Volunteers Everywhere Whose Help Makes Life Better for Us All California IVF

The total per-share value of the non-binding proposal is about \u00a325.08, BHP said, which is a 14% premium to Anglo's closing share price on Wednesday.\n\nAnglo shares jumped 13% in London on Thursday morning to \u00a324.91 apiece, for a market value of \u00a330.5 billion. BHP, which has a value of about $144 billion, fell 3.7%.\n\nA tie-up with Anglo would give BHP roughly 10% of global copper mine supply ahead of an expected supply shortage that many market watchers have predicted will send prices soaring. If successful, the transaction would mark a return to large-scale dealmaking for BHP, while potentially flushing out other suitors also aiming to boost their exposure to the metal that is closely linked to the global energy transition.\n\nAnglo American has long been viewed as a potential target among the largest miners, particularly because it owns attractive South American copper operations at a time when most of the industry is eager to add reserves and production. However, suitors have been put off by its complicated structure and mix of other commodities from platinum to diamonds, and especially its deep exposure to South Africa.\n\nAnglo has faced a series of major setbacks over the past year as prices for some of its key products plunged, while operational difficulties have forced the company to slash its production targets -- driving down its valuation and leaving the company vulnerable to potential bidders.\n\nThe company said in a statement late Wednesday that its board was reviewing the proposal, which it confirmed after Bloomberg first reported BHP's interest.\n\nRead: Anglo American Posts Steep Profit Fall and Lowers Dividend\n\nBig Deals\n\nA successful takeover would represent the first mega deal among the world's biggest diversified miners in over a decade. BHP and its biggest rivals spent years on the sidelines after a series of disastrous transactions, but there has been a growing expectation that the industry is heading for a wave of M&A as companies are flush with cash and management teams have worked hard to reassure investors that they have learned from past mistakes.\n\n\"If BHP does indeed continue to pursue this deal, we would be surprised if other bidders do not emerge,\" analysts from Jefferies LLC led by Christopher LaFemina said in an emailed note. A bid that values Anglo at $42.6 billion -- a 28% premium based on its latest share price -- might get a deal \"across the finish line,\" they said.\n\nBHP last year bought copper producer OZ Minerals Ltd. for about $6.4 billion in its first major purchase in years, but has otherwise focused until now on selling assets such as oil, gas and coal.\n\nThe clear lure here would be Anglo's South American copper business, long eyed by bigger players in the industry -- even though it has recently faced setbacks and has had to reduce its copper production forecasts.\n\nBHP produced about 1.2 million tons of copper in 2023 on an equity basis, while Anglo's output was 826,000 tons. That would give the combined group roughly a 10% share of global mine supply. Jefferies said antitrust issues \"would likely be a problem\" for the deal since governments consider copper a strategic mineral.\n\nIt's also possible that the proposal for Anglo could now prompt others to make a move. No. 2 miner Rio Tinto Group has also been investing in copper production, while Glencore Plc last year made an unsuccessful offer for Teck Resources Ltd., which has a coveted copper business, before eventually reaching a deal for the Canadian company's coal assets.\n\nRead: BHP Revives Appetite for Deals With Biggest Rivals in Sights\n\nAnglo's valuation may make it more attractive, but it remains a highly complicated business. The company owns majority stakes in two South African-listed miners -- Anglo American Platinum Ltd. and Kumba Iron ore Ltd. -- and is the majority owner of diamond miner De Beers. It also has a long and complicated relationship with South Africa, where the state pension fund manager is its biggest shareholder.\n\nBHP's proposal was to first hand Anglo's stakes in the two South African businesses to the smaller company's investors before proceeding with a takeover, Anglo said. The two parts of the proposal would be \"interconditional,\" it said.\n\nAnglo's other operations include copper, nickel, steelmaking coal and Brazilian iron ore, as well as the iconic De Beers business.\n\nBoth companies are also investing in new fertilizer businesses -- BHP is building a massive potash mine in Canada, while Anglo is developing a polyhalite mine on the east coast of England.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

(AP Photo/Scott Barbour, File)LONDON (AP) - Shares in U.K.-based mining giant Anglo American surged Thursday after it received a 31 billion-pound ($39 billion) takeover approach from rival BHP Billiton, a deal that would create the world's biggest copper miner, with around 10% of global output - a hugely lucrative market in the transition to clean energy. Anglo American's share price closed up 16% in London after revealing that BHP, the world's biggest miner, had put forward the \"unsolicited\"\u009d and \"highly conditional\"\u009d takeover proposal. The prospective all-share offer from BHP, which is based in the U.K. and Australia, values each Anglo share at 25.08 pounds. Anglo American, which owns a majority stake in the world-famous De Beers diamond company, said its board was reviewing the approach from BHP. BHP said the deal would boost its presence in the copper market, which is seeing demand soar amid the shift towards clean energy, as well as giving it greater access to potash, and coking coal in Australia. Copper is particularly sought after as the metal is used widely in electric vehicles, batteries and charging stations. Anglo, which has big copper plants in Chile and Peru, said that under the deal being proposed by BHP, it would have to spin off two units - its platinum arm, Anglo American Platinum, and Kumba Iron Ore, which are both listed in South Africa. BHP added that following any deal, Anglo's other \"high quality operations, including its diamond business\"\u009d would be subject to a strategic review. \"The combination would bring together the strengths of BHP and Anglo American in an optimal structure,\" it said. Under U.K. takeover rules, BHP has until May 22 to make a formal offer. \"The deal would represent the biggest shakeup of the global mining industry in more than a decade,\"\u009d said James Whiteside, metals and mining corporate research director at Wood Mackenzie in London. However, he said other companies may look to buy Anglo American themselves, especially if the company's shareholders hold out for a higher price. The prospective deal, Whiteside added, \"is all about copper.\"\u009d", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "canadian_press@medicinehatnews.com", "name": "Canadian Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BHP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo_American_plc", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anglo American plc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper_extraction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Copper extraction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Beers", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "De Beers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diamond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo_American_Platinum", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anglo American Platinum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potash", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Potash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_ore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iron ore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coke_(fuel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coke (fuel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Platinum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peru"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Peru"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Mineral_Exploration_and_Extraction", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Mineral Exploration and Extraction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://medicinehatnews.com/wp-content/uploads/cp/2024042514044-662a9ba33bf11053aa54d1f3jpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9510508", "eventUri": "eng-9510508", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2008-11-27", "textStart": 114, "textEnd": 127}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-22", "textStart": 2156, "textEnd": 2162}], "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

Market reaction was muted in Australia due to a public holiday.\n\n\"Anglo has not had a great year -- the rally ... has erased the losses of the last 12 months,\" Wilson said.\n\nAnglo American confirmed that its board was \"reviewing\" an offer from BHP but did not disclose the price.\n\n\"There can be no certainty that any offer will be made nor as to the terms on which any such offer might be made,\" Anglo American said in a statement.\n\n\"Pending any further announcements Anglo American shareholders should take no action.\"\n\nBHP's offer would first hinge on Anglo American splitting off its platinum and iron ore holdings in South Africa.\n\nSuch a move \"could be politically sensitive\", Wilson said.\n\nAnglo American announced this year plans to cut thousands of jobs across its platinum business, which was hit hard by low metal prices.\n\nDan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said Anglo American was \"a sitting duck\" after its shares sharply fell last year.\n\n\"That provided an opportunity for a larger rival to pounce on the business, taking a long-term view that its assets have considerable value and any short-term operational issues can be fixed,\" he said.\n\nBHP has signalled in recent years its growing appetite for copper, an increasingly in-demand metal that is playing a key role in global energy transitions.\n\nThe International Energy Agency lists copper -- commonly used in electrical wiring -- as of \"high importance\" for the development of solar panels, electricity networks, electric vehicles and rechargeable batteries.\n\nAustralian renewable energy finance expert Tim Buckley was not convinced the takeover bid was a wise move.\n\n\"I question what the takeover brings aside from complexity,\" he told AFP before the bid was confirmed.\n\nBoth BHP and Anglo American have been hit by global downturns in nickel, which is essential for the manufacture of stainless steel and rechargeable batteries.\n\nBHP reported an 86 percent slump in its half-year net profit this year, caused by a write-down of its nickel assets and costs related to a 2015 Brazilian mining disaster.", "source": {"uri":

Its share price has lagged behind that of other big miners and successive efforts to sharpen a sprawling portfolio have underwhelmed. The last news, at the end of 2023, was production delays that sent the shares down 20% in a day.\n\nIn practice, the same complexities, plus deep entanglement in South African politics, have served as a deterrent to a bid. Anglo was seen as too fiddly. But here comes BHP, the Australian giant of the sector, with a proposal to cut through the noise and get to the assets it would like to own, primarily Anglo's copper mines in Peru and Chile and, to a lesser extent, its iron ore projects in Brazil and metallurgical coal in Queensland.\n\nThe takeover idea is certainly clever. Anglo would have to demerge its two major South African units that already have separate listings in Johannesburg, Anglo American Platinum and the local iron ore producer Kumba, by distributing the shares to its own shareholders. Then BHP would buy the rest of Anglo via an all-share offer. Add it all up and BHP presented its \u00a331bn proposal as being pitched at a 31% premium for the Anglo assets that don't have their own listings.\n\nIn reality, few will look at the numbers that way. BHP's own description of the \"total value\" of its proposal as being \u00a325.08 a share (with the listed parts included at \u00a38.26) implied only a 13% premium to Anglo's closing share price on Wednesday of \u00a322-ish. Indeed, the offer was a bit less than \u00a325 because BHP's own shares fell slightly.\n\nThus the many Anglo shareholders, including Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM) and Abrdn, who called BHP's offer \"opportunistic\" are correct. A \u00a325 offer is clearly too mean. For all its calamitous recent history, Anglo should be able to get back \u00a330 under its own steam via self-improvement. Its shares stood at \u00a336 as recently as January last year. Note, too, that BHP has made its move when the price of diamonds (Anglo owns 85% of De Beers) and platinum are at cyclical lows.\n\nOne must assume BHP expected such a reaction from the ranks of Anglo shareholders, so its first shot was probably a sighter. It will need to go higher if it wants to continue the pursuit. But, if the target is up for grabs, all sorts of possibilities come into play. There's nothing to stop Anglo breaking itself up, for example. And, if it were prepared to let go of the prized copper mines on their own, there'd be a queue of potential bidders. BHP couldn't be surprised by such a development either: if you make a proposal that amounts to \"we'd like to buy you, except for the bits we don't like\", others are free to riff on the idea.\n\nThe other consideration here is the non-financial one: would a BHP purchase of two-thirds of Anglo be desirable for the rest of us? That is really a copper question since the metal is critical to electrification, and thus to the transition of the world's energy system towards lower-carbon generation. \"The [mining] industry is extremely concentrated today, and further consolidating it will not contribute to accelerating investment in the way we believe is needed,\" said LGIM.\n\nAgain, that's a fair point. BHP is currently number three in copper globally and would become number one with the addition of Anglo's mines. A global market share of 10%-ish may not sound enormous, but a BHP-Anglo deal would probably spark consolidation elsewhere. In the end, you get fewer but larger miners - especially of the type that are western-facing and can be vaguely held to account by virtue of having a stock market listing.\n\nThat competition question, though, is the one after the current one.

The UK-based firm confirmed to shareholders on the London Stock Exchange that it had received the unsolicited and \"highly conditional\" proposal from Australia's BHP, the world's largest mining company.\n\nShares in Anglo American soared on news of the potential deal - which would be one of the sector's largest - in which BHP said it would offer \u00a325.08 a share, including \u00a34.86 a share in Anglo Platinum stock and \u00a33.40 in Kumba Iron Ore company shares.

Copper is experiencing high global demand amid the energy transition given its use in renewable energy projects and electric vehicles.\n\nEarlier this year Anglo told of progress at the Woodsmith project on which it has staked considerable resources. The firm said it has spent around \u00a3505m ($641m) on infrastructure for the mine near Whitby, including the sinking of two deep shafts, a service shaft and a production shaft. It is also the majority of the way through the 37km conveyor tunnel that will move the extracted polyhalite fertiliser to Teesside, where it will be processed into granules for use by farming customers.\n\nDespite the huge sums already spent on the project, Anglo has indicated it is yet to fully decide the future of the project, with a board approval decision only due to come in the first half of 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, Anglo said that under the deal being proposed by BHP, it would have to spin off two Anglo units - its platinum arm Anglo American Platinum and Kumba Iron Ore, which are both listed in South Africa. BHP added that following any deal, Anglo's other \"high quality operations, including its diamond business\" would be subject to a strategic review.\n\nBHP said: \"The combination would bring together the strengths of BHP and Anglo American in an optimal structure. Anglo American would bring its assets and long-term growth potential.\n\n\"BHP would bring its higher margin cash generative assets and growth projects along with its larger free cash flows and stronger balance sheet. Anglo American has a deep pool of talented people who would continue to make a valuable contribution to the successful operation of Anglo American's assets within the combined group.\"", "source":

The total per-share value of the non-binding proposal is about \u00a325.08 (S$42.68), BHP said, which is a 14 per cent premium to Anglo's closing share price on Wednesday.\n\nAnglo shares jumped 13 per cent in London on Thursday morning to \u00a324.91 apiece, for a market value of \u00a330.5 billion. BHP, which has a value of about US$144 billion, fell 3.7 per cent.\n\nA tie-up with Anglo would give BHP roughly 10 per cent of global copper mine supply ahead of an expected supply shortage that many market watchers have predicted will send prices soaring. If successful, the transaction would mark a return to large-scale dealmaking for BHP, while potentially flushing out other suitors also aiming to boost their exposure to the metal that is closely linked to the global energy transition.\n\nAnglo American has long been viewed as a potential target among the largest miners, particularly because it owns attractive South American copper operations at a time when most of the industry is eager to add reserves and production. However, suitors have been put off by its complicated structure and mix of other commodities from platinum to diamonds, and especially its deep exposure to South Africa.\n\nAnglo has faced a series of major setbacks over the past year as prices for some of its key products plunged, while operational difficulties have forced the company to slash its production targets - driving down its valuation and leaving the company vulnerable to potential bidders.\n\nThe company said in a statement late Wednesday (Apr 24) that its board was reviewing the proposal, which it confirmed after Bloomberg first reported BHP's interest.\n\nA successful takeover would represent the first mega deal among the world's biggest diversified miners in over a decade. BHP and its biggest rivals spent years on the sidelines after a series of disastrous transactions, but there has been a growing expectation that the industry is heading for a wave of M&A as companies are flush with cash and management teams have worked hard to reassure investors that they have learned from past mistakes.\n\n\"If BHP does indeed continue to pursue this deal, we would be surprised if other bidders do not emerge,\" analysts from Jefferies led by Christopher LaFemina said in an emailed note. A bid that values Anglo at US$42.6 billion - a 28 per cent premium based on its latest share price - might get a deal \"across the finish line,\" they said.\n\nBHP last year bought copper producer OZ Minerals for about US$6.4 billion in its first major purchase in years, but has otherwise focused until now on selling assets such as oil, gas and coal.\n\nThe clear lure here would be Anglo's South American copper business, long eyed by bigger players in the industry - even though it has recently faced setbacks and has had to reduce its copper production forecasts.\n\nBHP produced about 1.2 million tons of copper in 2023 on an equity basis, while Anglo's output was 826,000 tons. That would give the combined group roughly a 10 per cent share of global mine supply. Jefferies said antitrust issues \"would likely be a problem\" for the deal since governments consider copper a strategic mineral.\n\nIt's also possible that the proposal for Anglo could now prompt others to make a move. No 2 miner Rio Tinto Group has also been investing in copper production, while Glencore last year made an unsuccessful offer for Teck Resources, which has a coveted copper business, before eventually reaching a deal for the Canadian company's coal assets.\n\nAnglo's valuation may make it more attractive, but it remains a highly complicated business. The company owns majority stakes in two South African-listed miners - Anglo American Platinum and Kumba Iron ore - and is the majority owner of diamond miner De Beers. It also has a long and complicated relationship with South Africa, where the state pension fund manager is its biggest shareholder.\n\nBHP's proposal was to first hand Anglo's stakes in the two South African businesses to the smaller company's investors before proceeding with a takeover, Anglo said.

"body": "In a strategic play set to reshape the global mining industry, BHP, the world's largest mining firm, has launched a $39 billion acquisition bid for its competitor, Anglo American.\n\nThis move positions BHP to potentially dominate the mining sector worldwide.\n\nThis proposition, if successful, would not only merge two industry giants but also create the world's preeminent mining entity.\n\nAs news of the bid broke, Anglo American's stock soared by 12% on Thursday morning.\n\nBloomberg sources revealed that Anglo American, valued at approximately \u20ac27 billion ($34 billion), received an all-stock merger proposal from BHP.\n\nThis bid hinges on the condition that Anglo American divests its platinum and iron ore sectors in South Africa.\n\nSuch a divestiture aims to streamline operations and focus on core business strengths.\n\nThis acquisition signals BHP's ambitious return to major market moves, a clear shift driven by CEO Mike Henry's vision over the past two years.\n\nDespite vast resources, Anglo American's recent underperformance, relative to peers like BHP, presents an opportunity for expansion.\n\nBHP, with a $149 billion market cap, has proposed a strategic merger with Anglo American to enhance their position in South America's booming copper sector.\n\nThis proposal positions them to capitalize on the increasing demand in this key industry.\n\nHistorically, Anglo's complex structure and varied commodities, along with its significant presence in volatile South Africa, have deterred suitors.\n\nIn 2023, BHP produced roughly 1.2 million tons of copper, whereas Anglo managed 826,000 tons.\n\nTheir combined forces would command about 10% of the global copper supply, bolstering their market standing significantly.\n\nAnglo American faced a tough year with falling commodity prices and operational issues, leading to lower production forecasts and weakened investor confidence.\n\nShould this deal conclude successfully, it would mark the first monumental agreement among the titan mining firms in over a decade.\n\nAfter a history of challenging deals, BHP and its competitors have tread cautiously.\n\nRevitalized by new strategies and past lessons, they are now ready to embark on lucrative ventures, reshaping the industry's future.", "source": {"uri": "riotimesonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Rio

statement said.\n\nLondon-based Anglo American earlier confirmed that its board was \"reviewing\" an offer from BHP but did not disclose the price.\n\n\"There can be no certainty that any offer will be made nor as to the terms on which any such offer might be made,\" Anglo American said in a statement.\n\n\"Pending any further announcements Anglo American shareholders should take no action.\"\n\nBHP's offer would first hinge on Anglo American splitting off its platinum and iron ore holdings in South Africa.\n\nBHP has signalled in recent years its growing appetite for copper, an increasingly in-demand metal that is poised to play a key role in global energy transitions.\n\nThe International Energy Agency lists copper -- commonly used in electrical wiring -- as of \"high importance\" for the development of solar panels, electricity networks, electric vehicles and rechargeable batteries.\n\nAustralian renewable energy finance expert Tim Buckley was not convinced the takeover bid was a wise move.\n\n\"I question what the takeover brings aside from complexity,\" he told AFP before the bid was confirmed.\n\nBoth BHP and Anglo American have been hit by global downturns in nickel, which is essential for the manufacture of stainless steel and rechargeable batteries.\n\nBHP reported an 86 percent slump in its half-year net profit this year, caused by a write-down of its nickel assets and costs related to a 2015 Brazilian mining disaster.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

potentially creating the world's biggest copper miner\n\nFTSE 100-listed Anglo American - the world's largest platinum producer - said BHP, its much larger Australian rival, made an 'unsolicited, non-binding and highly conditional' all-share bid for the group.\n\nUnder the proposal, Anglo American would divest the stakes in its platinum and Kumba iron ore businesses to its shareholders, who will receive \u00a325.08 per share, a premium of around 31 per cent to the firm's closing share price on Tuesday.\n\nThe enlarged business would be responsible for churning out around 10 per cent of global copper output.\n\nAcquisition deal: Anglo American - the world's largest platinum producer - has received a takeover offer worth \u00a331billion from fellow mining giant BHP, its much larger Australian rival\n\nFor BHP, the takeover would grant it greater exposure to copper, a crucial element in the energy transition, given its use in technologies like electric vehicles, solar panels and wind turbines.\n\nIt also said the tie-up would combine the strengths of the two companies in an 'optimal structure' and deliver 'meaningful synergies' that bolster value and profits for shareholders.\n\nThe Melbourne-headquartered firm, which is listed in both London and Australia, believes the deal would be 'attractive to communities where greater financial strength could support further development'.\n\nBHP now has until 5pm on 22 May to make a concrete acquisition bid in line with City rules or walk away.\n\n'This announcement does not amount to a firm intention to make an offer and there can be no certainty that an offer will be made,' it told investors.\n\nPotential deal 'will send a fresh chill through the City of London'\n\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said a takeover of Anglo American 'won't just shake up the mining industry, but will send a fresh chill through the City of London'.\n\n'There are concerns that if the deal goes through, it could be the tip of the iceberg, and more giants could leave the exchange.'\n\nInvestors in Paddy Power owner Flutter Entertainment will vote on 1 May whether to switch its primary listing from London to New York.\n\nShould they approve, Flutter would join building materials supplier CRH, plumbing products specialist Ferguson, and mining group AngloAshanti Gold, which have all recently moved stateside.\n\nOil supermajor Shell, Britain's largest listed company by market capitalisation, is also reportedly considering a move to Wall Street just two years after abandoning its dual listing structure.\n\nAnglo American shares shot up 12.7 per cent to \u00a324.85 on Thursday morning, taking their gains since the year started to around a quarter, while BHP Group shares slid 2.3 per cent to \u00a323.09.\n\nTough 2023 for mining sector\n\nBoth BHP and Anglo American's revenues and profits fell significantly during the last financial year owing to declining commodity prices amid slowing global economic growth.\n\nBHP saw its underlying attributable profit plunge to $13.4billion for the year ending June 2023, having made a record $23.8billion in the previous 12 months.\n\nTrading was hit by reduced copper, iron ore, and metallurgical coal prices, as well as higher diesel and electricity costs, and the development of Western Australia's South Flank mine.\n\nMeanwhile, Anglo American launched a review into its assets after the firm's annual profits plunged by 94 per cent to $283million in 2023 following a drop in demand for palladium and rhodium.\n\nThe London-headquartered group also wrote down $2.4billion on its diamonds and nickel units, including $1.6billion on the value of De Beers.", "source": {"uri": "todayheadline.co",

A tie-up would give the mining giant about 10% of the global copper production.\n\nIt would also boost its presence in the world's top copper producing countries Chile and Peru, as with the acquisition of Anglo American, BHP would gain access to three of the world's largest copper mines -- Collahuasi (with ownership of 44%), Los Bronces (50.1%), El Soldado (50.1%) and Quellaveco (60%). This would improve the company's exposure to copper by about 40%.\n\nBHP's proposal is valued at \u00a325.08 per Anglo share, a 14% premium to the target company's closing price on Wednesday. According to analysts, the offer is not as sweet as it seems and they believe Anglo American is well-positioned to push for a better deal.\n\nGiven its conglomerate nature, finding a knockout price isn't a simple task.\n\n\"Anglo American is an established conglomerate with a complex structure, featuring numerous partial ownership stakes and various defensive mechanisms, most of which are concentrated in its South African assets,\" Jefferies' Christopher LaFemina wrote in a note to clients.\n\nThe expert believes that \"a price of at least \u00a328 per share would be necessary for serious discussions to take place, and a takeout price of well above \u00a330 per share would be the outcome if other bidders were to get involved\".\n\n\"If we include our estimate of synergies on an after-tax present value basis, we estimate Anglo fair value to be 2824p per share, which equates to a $42.6 billion equity value. That is 28% above the most recent Anglo share price, and we believe it is a reasonable starting point.\"\n\nAnglo American has been a takeover target in recent years after output fell and costs mounted.\n\n\"It became a potential target for BHP as Anglo continued to post a weak top-line, even as its total debt kept increasing since 2021 as a result of the poor performance of platinum group metals (PGMs) and diamonds due to price fluctuations, geopolitical and economic situations, and other operational constraints,\" Sathiya Narayanan Jalapathy, Business Fundamentals Analyst at GlobalData, wrote in an emailed statement.\n\n\"Amidst this, the company has reported a growth of 31.5% in copper sales from $5,599 million in 2022 to $7,360 million in 2023 (...) Operationally, the combined entity could have a top line of over $84 billion, EBITDA of over $34 billion, and a workforce of close to 100,000, reinforcing its position as one the largest global players in the mining sector,\" he noted.\n\nBerenberg analyst Richard Hatch is not convinced that Anglo presents significant turnaround opportunities.\n\n\"BHP is potentially buying a group of assets that need some care and attention,\" Hatch wrote, referring to Anglo's operations in South Africa. \"This, in our view, offers limited upside at this point with current valuation multiples that would also imply a slightly dilutive deal for BHP.\"\n\n\"BHP is likely drawn by the company's low valuation (stock down 12% over the LTM), with the company going through a multi-year operational restructuring,\" Fitch Group said. \"From a strategic standpoint, bigger is always better in the metals and mining sector.\"\n\nEarlier on Thursday one of Anglo's 20 largest shareholders, Legal & General Investment Management, said BHP's approach was \"highly opportunistic\" and \"unattractive\".\n\n\"As with many other UK-listed companies, we believe the valuation of Anglo American to be depressed and regard the proposed exchange ratio as an unattractive proposition for long-term investors,\" Nick Stansbury, head of climate solutions at Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM), said in an emailed statement.\n\n\"The industry is extremely concentrated today, and further consolidating it will not contribute to accelerating investment in the way we believe is needed,\" Stansbury said.\n\nAnglo American did not respond to a request for comments but in a statement it said it was reviewing the proposal, which would require it to separate its majority holdings of Anglo American Platinum (JSE: AMS) and Kumba Iron Ore (JSE: KIO) beforehand.\n\nTop miners are all about copper these days. BHP itself bought copper producer OZ Minerals last year for about $6.4 billion. Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO; LSE: RIO; ASX: RIO), the world's second largest miner, has been investing in copper mines in Utah and Arizona.\n\nBMO Capital analyst Alexander Pearce highlighted that the deal to combine both miners would be subject to significant anti-trust/competition scrutiny, particularly when it comes to the copper assets.\n\nThe Anglo-owned Quellaveco and BHP-owned Antamina mines are key to Peru's economy. If the merger is successful, both operations would be under the same ownership, raising questions of a potential market concentration issue or even a major political concern.\n\nThe deal could face government and local opposition due to the scale and influence of the combined company. Depending on the nature of the perceived problem, the antitrust solution may involve selectively selling off parts of the business that are deemed non-essential, in order to address concentration issues, while preserving the core copper assets that both companies view as strategically important.\n\nThis is in South America. The issues the merged company could face in South Africa are equally or more difficult. The nation's minerals resources minister is not a big fan of BHP and has already voiced his opposition to BHP's bid for Anglo.\n\nGwede Mantashe told the Financial Times that he was not in favour of BHP's bid given the country's previous \"not positive\" experience with the company. He was referencing to the 2001 merger between BHP and Billiton that created the world's largest mining company.\n\nWhile he clarified this was his personal opinion and not the government official position on the matter, Mantashe said that BHP Billiton \"never did much for South Africa\" and led to \"capital leaving the country.\"\n\nBHP in 2015 created and spinned off South32 (ASX, LON, JSE:S32), a company that inherited the South African assets and operations.Through this demerger, BHP effectively reduce its exposure to the country in a move interpreted as many as BHP's attempt to limit its involvement in the country.\n\nAnglo American, in contrast, embodies the mining tradition of South Africa. Being born in the country in 1917, it holds the fourth-largest position in the FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index, accounting for 4.3% of the index.\n\nAnglo has controlling interests in two other mining companies listed on the South African stock exchange -- Anglo American Platinum Ltd., also known as Amplats, and Kumba Iron Ore.\n\nThe company also owns another South African emblematic company: Diamond giant De Beers, which Anglo acquired more than a decade ago.", "source": {"uri": "mining.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MINING.COM"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The big prize: Anglo's production of copper, a key metal for the energy transition, used in everything from batteries to electrical wiring.\n\n\"Given the market dynamics and the increasing demand for copper linked to the energy transition, it's plausible to anticipate a potential 'bump' in interest around Anglo American's assets,\" said Gregory Lafitte, a sales analyst at Churchill Capital.\n\nThe calculation of the deal value to Anglo American shareholders doesn't account for any dividends.\n\nThe growing demand for copper has pushed prices of the metal to a two-year high this week as investors bet that miners will struggle to service a surge in demand.\n\n\"BHP would have to offer more for this business we think mainly because it wants the copper and copper companies trade at a premium,\" said Richard Hatch, an analyst at Berenberg. \"BHP is going to have to pay up for it and if they do it's going to be an expensive deal.\"", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BHP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo_American_plc", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anglo American plc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Penny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_spin-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporate spin-off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Tinto_(corporation)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rio Tinto (corporation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glencore", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glencore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_transition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Energy transition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winston Churchill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/img/tsn/logos/tsn-logo.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9510508", "eventUri": "eng-9510508", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Under UK takeover rules, BHP has until May 22 to make a firm offer.\n\nShares in Anglo were up 13.7% at 25.06 pounds at 1123 GMT.\n\nA deal would create a group with around 10% of the global output of copper, now one of the most sought-after metals.\n\nIt could also trigger further consolidation in a sector which has seen a rush of mergers and acquisitions as companies attempt to raise their exposure to metals which, like copper, are seen as critical to the global energy transition.\n\n\"Any deal, if agreed, would keep regulators super-busy as there is so much to unpick and there will be concerns about the extent of the concentration in the copper industry,\" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\nThe bid comes after Anglo, which had a market value of $37.7 billion at Wednesday's close, began a review of its assets in February in response to a 94% fall in annual profit and a series of writedowns due to a drop in demand for most of its metals.\n\nBHP, best-known for mining iron ore, copper, coking coal, potash and nickel, was valued at about $149 billion.\n\nAn Anglo deal would be the second major acquisition by BHP in about a year after its 2023 purchase of copper miner Oz Minerals. Its bid adds to a frenzy of global M&A activity, including gold giant Newmont's (NEM.N), opens new tab $16.8 billion buyout of Australia-based Newcrest Mining late last year.\n\n\"It's a good deal for BHP. Anglo is obviously very much in play now and there's probably room for others to interlope. This is going to set the whole sector on fire,\" Ben Cleary, portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners, which holds shares in both companies, said of the proposal.\n\nA takeover of Anglo would likely be among the 10 biggest-ever mining deals by value and could involve delisting Anglo from the London market, a potential blow to an exchange that is struggling to retain big companies and attract IPOs.\n\nSome said BHP would need to offer more to get a deal done.\n\n\"There is ... almost no way ... that the premium being offered by BHP is going to be enough to entice Anglo management to transact,\" said Mark Kelly of advisory firm MKP.\n\nSouth Africa's Public Investment Corporation (PIC), which holds 6.99% of Anglo American according to LSEG data, said it would assess any offer \"to ensure value creation\".\n\n\"The mining sector remains a critical part of the South African economy, impacting a wide variety of stakeholders, therefore, new opportunities that may arise in the sector need to take these factors and long-term sustainability into account,\" it added in a statement.\n\nCOPPER\n\nBHP would gain more copper and potash, which are its key strategic commodities, and more coking coal in Australia.\n\nAnglo has copper mines in Chile and Peru, where BHP also has operations, and their combined output would amount to around 2.6 million metric tons a year, pushing it well ahead of U.S.-based Freeport-McMoRan (FCX.N), opens new tab and Chilean state miner Codelco.\n\nDevelopments such as artificial intelligence and automation - and the energy transition, which includes electric vehicles and renewable energy - have driven up demand prospects for copper cable used to conduct electricity.\n\nCopper prices on the London Metal Exchange have surged 15% this year on expectations of higher demand given encouraging economic data, U.S. rate cut bets, speculative trading and supply bottlenecks driven by the December shutdown of one of the world's largest open-pit copper mines.\n\nBHP is targeting copper production of between 1.7 million and 1.9 million tons for the 12 months ending in June, while Anglo's 2024 production guidance is 730,000 to 790,000 tons.\n\nCARVE-OUTS\n\nA condition of BHP's proposal is that Anglo first distributes its stakes in Anglo American Platinum (AMSJ.J), opens new tab and Kumba Iron Ore (KIOJ.J), opens new tab to shareholders.\n\nAnglo's holdings in the platinum and iron ore miners are worth $7.44 billion and $5.4 billion respectively, according to LSEG data based on Wednesday's close of trade.\n\nIt also owns 85% of diamond giant De Beers and BHP said its other high quality operations, including diamonds, would undergo a strategic review after a deal was done.\n\nSouth Africa's biggest mining investors are halting new projects in response to a slump in profits due to local challenges and weakening prices of commodities such as platinum.\n\nMeanwhile, the combined coking coal assets of the two miners, both in Australia's Queensland state, could come under regulatory scrutiny given a deal would merge two of the biggest producers in the global seaborne market.", "source": {"uri": "dtnext.in",

A tie-up would give the mining giant about 10% of the global copper production. It would also boost its presence in the world's top copper producing countries Chile and Peru, as with the acquisition of Anglo American, BHP would gain access to three of the world's largest copper mines -- Collahuasi (with ownership of 44%), Los Bronces (50.1%), El Soldado (50.1%) and Quellaveco (60%). This would improve the company's exposure to copper by about 40%.\n\nBHP's proposal is valued at \u00a325.08 per Anglo share, a 14% premium to the target company's closing price on Wednesday. According to analysts, the offer is not as sweet as it seems and they believe Anglo American is well-positioned to push for a better deal.\n\nGiven its conglomerate nature, finding a knockout price isn't a simple task.\n\n\"Anglo American is an established conglomerate with a complex structure, featuring numerous partial ownership stakes and various defensive mechanisms, most of which are concentrated in its South African assets,\" Jefferies' Christopher LaFemina wrote in a note to clients.\n\nThe expert believes that \"a price of at least \u00a328 per share would be necessary for serious discussions to take place, and a takeout price of well above \u00a330 per share would be the outcome if other bidders were to get involved\".\n\n\"If we include our estimate of synergies on an after-tax present value basis, we estimate Anglo fair value to be 2824p per share, which equates to a $42.6 billion equity value. That is 28% above the most recent Anglo share price, and we believe it is a reasonable starting point.\"\n\nAnglo American has been a takeover target in recent years after output fell and costs mounted.\n\n\"It became a potential target for BHP as Anglo continued to post a weak top-line, even as its total debt kept increasing since 2021 as a result of the poor performance of platinum group metals (PGMs) and diamonds due to price fluctuations, geopolitical and economic situations, and other operational constraints,\" Sathiya Narayanan Jalapathy, Business Fundamentals Analyst at GlobalData, wrote in an emailed statement.\n\n\"Amidst this, the company has reported a growth of 31.5% in copper sales from $5,599 million in 2022 to $7,360 million in 2023 ... Operationally, the combined entity could have a top line of over $84 billion, EBITDA of over $34 billion, and a workforce of close to 100,000, reinforcing its position as one the largest global players in the mining sector,\" he noted.\n\n\"The deal would represent the biggest shakeup of the global mining industry in more than a decade,\" says James Whiteside, metals and mining research director at Wood Mackenzie. \"But Anglo American shareholders may consider fair value closer to the share price in 2023 before operational issues emerged and other suitors may be compelled to act at this price\".\n\nBerenberg analyst Richard Hatch is not convinced that Anglo presents significant turnaround opportunities.\n\n\"BHP is potentially buying a group of assets that need some care and attention,\" Hatch wrote, referring to Anglo's operations in South Africa. \"This, in our view, offers limited upside at this point with current valuation multiples that would also imply a slightly dilutive deal for BHP.\"\n\n\"BHP is likely drawn by the company's low valuation (stock down 12% over the LTM), with the company going through a multi-year operational restructuring,\" Fitch Group said. \"From a strategic standpoint, bigger is always better in the metals and mining sector.\"\n\nEarlier on Thursday one of Anglo's 20 largest shareholders, Legal & General Investment Management, said BHP's approach was \"highly opportunistic\" and \"unattractive\".\n\n\"As with many other UK-listed companies, we believe the valuation of Anglo American to be depressed and regard the proposed exchange ratio as an unattractive proposition for long-term investors,\" Nick Stansbury, head of climate solutions at Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM), said in an emailed statement.\n\n\"The industry is extremely concentrated today, and further consolidating it will not contribute to accelerating investment in the way we believe is needed,\" Stansbury said.\n\nAnglo American did not respond to a request for comments but in a statement it said it was reviewing the proposal, which would require it to separate its majority holdings of Anglo American Platinum (JSE: AMS) and Kumba Iron Ore (JSE: KIO) beforehand.\n\nTop miners are all about copper these days. BHP itself bought copper producer OZ Minerals last year for about $6.4 billion. Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO; LSE: RIO; ASX: RIO), the world's second largest miner, has been investing in copper mines in Utah and Arizona.\n\nBMO Capital analyst Alexander Pearce highlighted that the deal to combine both miners would be subject to significant anti-trust/competition scrutiny, particularly when it comes to the copper assets.\n\nThe Anglo-owned Quellaveco and BHP-owned Antamina mines are key to Peru's economy. If the merger is successful, both operations would be under the same ownership, raising questions of a potential market concentration issue or even a major political concern.\n\nThe deal could face government and local opposition due to the scale and influence of the combined company. Depending on the nature of the perceived problem, the antitrust solution may involve selectively selling off parts of the business that are deemed non-essential, in order to address concentration issues, while preserving the core copper assets that both companies view as strategically important.\n\nThis is in South America. The issues the merged company could face in South Africa are equally or more difficult. The nation's minerals resources minister is not a big fan of BHP and has already voiced his opposition to BHP's bid for Anglo.\n\nGwede Mantashe told the Financial Times that he was not in favour of BHP's bid given the country's previous \"not positive\" experience with the company. He was referencing to the 2001 merger between BHP and Billiton that created the world's largest mining company.\n\nWhile he clarified this was his personal opinion and not the government official position on the matter, Mantashe said that BHP Billiton \"never did much for South Africa\" and led to \"capital leaving the country.\"\n\nBHP in 2015 created and spinned off South32 (ASX, LON, JSE:S32), a company that inherited the South African assets and operations.Through this demerger, BHP effectively reduce its exposure to the country in a move interpreted as many as BHP's attempt to limit its involvement in the country.\n\nAnglo American, in contrast, embodies the mining tradition of South Africa. Being born in the country in 1917, it holds the fourth-largest position in the FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index, accounting for 4.3% of the index.\n\nAnglo has controlling interests in two other mining companies listed on the South African stock exchange -- Anglo American Platinum Ltd., also known as Amplats, and Kumba Iron Ore.\n\nThe company also owns another South African emblematic company: Diamond giant De Beers, which Anglo acquired more than a decade ago.", "source": {"uri": "canadianminingjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Canadian Mining Journal"}, "authors": [],

Anglo American shares are up 13% to 2 498.00 pence, about 4% above the implied potential bid price.\n\nWhile that premium isn't huge, it's a clear sign of traders' expectations: Takeover targets typically trade at a discount to an offer price, even when there's a firm proposal agreed to by both sides, to reflect the risk that a deal won't go through, or that it will take a long time to be completed.\n\nA quick poll of nine analysts and risk-arbitrage traders in Europe shows they expect a miner such as Rio Tinto and Glencore to step in, or BHP to boost its offer.

Nonetheless \"there is a strategic rationale to this approach and structure\", said the investment bank.\n\nJefferies stated: \"Anglo would be a good strategic fit for BHP or another major miner due to potential synergies, asset quality, and commodity exposure (especially copper).\n\n\"Our analysis indicates that Anglo consists of an undervalued portfolio of multiple tier-1\n\nassets, several of which are in relatively low-risk jurisdictions (Chile, Peru, Australia, Brazil).\n\n\"There is a scarcity value to tier-1 mining assets that is not reflected in equity valuations. Hence, Anglo could be a compelling fit at the right price.\"\n\nBHP's initial offer puts a 2,508p per share valuation on Anglo, while Jefferies suggests a higher valuation of 2,824p.\n\nSouth Africa's minerals resources minister Gwede Mantashe has now come out as a vocal opponent of BHP's attempted takeover.\n\nAnglo American was founded in Johannesburg in 1917 and retains a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.\n\nMatashe said the country's previous interactions with BHP were \"not positive\" after the Aussies merged with South African miner Billiton in 2001.\n\n\"What we saw is that it dumped coal and then created a small company called South32, which is now marginal,\" Mantashe told the Financial Times. It is unclear how much this could affect the deal, but it could prove a headache nonetheless.\n\nUnder UK takeover rules, BHP has until 22 May to put up a formal offer or shut up.\n\n\"If BHP does indeed continue to pursue this deal, we would be surprised if other bidders do not emerge. It is of course also possible that BHP walks away if Anglo is unwilling to engage. Let the games begin,\" said Jefferies.", "source": {"uri": "proactiveinvestors.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Proactiveinvestors UK"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The deal will also strengthen BHP's iron ore market and provide exposure to diamond markets.\n\n\"Additionally, the acquisition will help BHP to access the mining industry in South America, where the company currently does not have significant presence. If the deal goes through, BHP will gain access to three of the world's largest copper mines - Collahuasi (with ownership of 44%), Los Bronces (50.1%), El Soldado (50.1%) and Quellaveco (60%).\n\n\"The news of the potential acquisition has created interest among investors, with the stock value of Anglo American spiking by 12.3%, and its combination with BHP may well see the emergence of a mining giant with about $200 billion in market value.\n\n\"Anglo American became a potential target for BHP as the former continued to post a weak top-line, even as its total debt kept increasing since 2021 as a result of the poor performance of platinum group metals (PGMs) and diamonds due to price fluctuations, geopolitical and economic situations, and other operational constraints. Amidst this, the company has reported a growth of 31.5% in copper sales from $5,599 million in 2022 to $7,360 million in 2023.\n\n\"Also, at the end of Q1 2024, Anglo American's copper production increased by 11% to 198,100 tonnes, driven by a 21% increase in output from its Quellaveco site in Peru and a 6% increase in production from Chile. Operationally, the combined entity could have a top line of over $84 billion, EBITDA of over $34 billion, and a workforce of close to 100,000, reinforcing its position as one the largest global players in the mining sector.\"", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BHP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo_American_plc", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anglo American plc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diamond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Platinum group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_ore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iron ore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peru"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Peru"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Mineral_Exploration_and_Extraction", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Mineral Exploration and Extraction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9510508", "eventUri": "eng-9510508", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

BHP recently made an informal approach to Anglo American to gauge its interest in a deal, the people said.\n\nIf successful, a takeover would mark a return to large-scale dealmaking for BHP, which has revived its appetite for transformational acquisitions in the past couple of years under Chief Executive Officer Mike Henry.\n\nAnglo American has long been viewed as a potential target among the largest miners, particularly because it owns big South American copper operations at a time when most of the industry is seeking to grow in that business. However, suitors have been put off by its complicated structure and mix of commodities, and especially its deep exposure to South Africa.\n\nAnglo has faced a series of major setbacks over the past year, as prices for some of its key products plunged, while operational difficulties have forced the company to slash its production targets -- driving down its valuation and leaving the company vulnerable to potential bidders.\n\nAnglo's shares have dropped 12% over the last 12 months, giving the company a market value of \u00a327 billion ($34 billion). BHP, which trades in London and Sydney, has a market value of about $149 billion.\n\nDeliberations are at an early stage and there's no certainty that BHP will decide to proceed with a deal, the people said. Representatives for BHP and Anglo American declined to comment.\n\nA deal for Anglo American would likely rank as the world's biggest takeover globally this year, surpassing Capital One Financial Corp.'s $35 billion acquisition of Discover Financial Services, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nIt would also represent the first mega deal among the world's biggest diversified miners in over a decade. BHP and its biggest rivals spent years on the sidelines after a series of disastrous transactions, but have warmed up to the prospect of dealmaking after reassuring investors that they have learned from past mistakes.\n\nBHP last year bought copper producer OZ Minerals Ltd. for about $6.4 billion in its first major purchase in years, but has until now focused on selling assets such as oil, gas and coal.\n\nWhile Anglo's valuation may make it more attractive, it remains a highly complicated business. The company owns majority stakes in two South African-listed miners -- Anglo American Platinum Ltd. and Kumba Iron ore Ltd. -- and is the majority owner of diamond miner De Beers.\n\nIt also has a long and complicated relationship with South Africa, where the state pension fund manager is its biggest shareholder.\n\nFor BHP, the lure for any deal would be Anglo's copper business. The world's biggest miners are all seeking to expand their copper production in anticipation of rising prices as demand for electrification rises while future supplies look constrained.\n\nAnglo's South American copper business has long been sought after by bigger players in the industry, although it has recently faced setbacks and had to reduce its copper production forecasts.\n\nA bid for the whole of Anglo American would likely raise antitrust issues in several of the company's key markets, while Anglo's production of platinum-group metals and diamonds doesn't present an obvious fit with BHP's strategy or commodity mix.", "source": {"uri": "mining.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MINING.COM"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP", "type": "org",

Anglo American earlier today said it had received an unsolicited, non-binding and highly conditional combination proposal from BHP, which it was currently reviewing. The company is considering a sale of De Beers to release cash as part of its defence, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIf the deal goes through, it would give BHP access to more copper, one of the most sought-after metals for the clean energy transition, and potash, which are its key strategic commodities, as well as more coking coal in Australia.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Anglo's board is reviewing the proposal and it cautioned that there is no certainty an offer will be made. Anglo said BHP's proposal was conditional on the company first splitting off its South African platinum and iron ore units.\n\nIf successful, a takeover would mark a return to large-scale dealmaking for BHP, which has revived its appetite for transformational acquisitions in the past couple of years under Chief Executive Officer Mike Henry.\n\nAnglo American has long been viewed as a potential target among the largest miners, particularly because it owns big South American copper operations at a time when most of the industry is seeking to expand in copper. However, suitors have been put off by its complicated structure and mix of commodities, and especially its deep exposure to South Africa.\n\nAnglo has faced a series of major setbacks over the past year, as prices for some of its key products plunged, while operational difficulties have forced the company to slash its production targets -- driving down its valuation and leaving the company vulnerable to potential bidders.\n\nAnglo's shares have dropped 12% over the last 12 months, giving the company a market value of \u00a327 billion ($34 billion). BHP, which trades in London and Sydney, has a market value of about $149 billion.\n\nA successful takeover would represent the first mega deal among the world's biggest diversified miners in over a decade. BHP and its biggest rivals spent years on the sidelines after a series of disastrous transactions, but have warmed up to the prospect of dealmaking after reassuring investors that they have learned from past mistakes.\n\nBHP last year bought copper producer OZ Minerals Ltd. for about $6.4 billion in its first major purchase in years, but has otherwise focused until now on selling assets such as oil, gas and coal.\n\nFor BHP, the clear lure for any deal would be Anglo's copper assets. The world's biggest miners are all seeking to expand their copper production in anticipation of rising prices as demand for electrification rises while future supplies look constrained.\n\nAnglo's South American copper business has long been sought after by bigger players in the industry, although it has recently faced setbacks and had to reduce its copper production forecasts.\n\nIt's also possible that the now-public proposal for Anglo could draw out other potential bidders. No. 2 miner Rio Tinto Group has also been investing in copper production, while Glencore Plc last year made an unsuccessful offer for Teck Resources Ltd., which has a coveted copper business, before eventually reaching a deal for the Canadian company's coal assets.\n\nWhile Anglo's valuation may make it more attractive, it remains a highly complicated business. The company owns majority stakes in two South African-listed miners -- Anglo American Platinum Ltd. and Kumba Iron ore Ltd. -- and is the majority owner of diamond miner De Beers. It also has a long and complicated relationship with South Africa, where the state pension fund manager is its biggest shareholder.\n\nBHP's proposal was to first hand Anglo's stakes in the two South African businesses to the smaller company's investors before proceeding with a takeover, Anglo said. The two parts of the proposal would be \"interconditional,\" it said.\n\nAnglo's other operations include copper, nickel, steelmaking coal and Brazilian iron ore, as well as the iconic De Beers business.\n\nBoth companies are also investing in new fertilizer businesses -- BHP is building a massive potash mine in Canada, while Anglo is developing a polyhalite mine on the east coast of England.", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoneyControl"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP", "type": "org", "score": 5,

The price of the metal has also been on a steady rise since the start of the year, reaching an 11-month high last month following reports that Chinese smelters would cut production at loss-making plants.\n\nBoth companies produce the majority of their copper out of huge mines in Chile, though BHP's global output of the metal at 1.8m t in 2023 was more than double that of its rival.\n\nChristopher LaFemina, an analyst at Jeffries, said the merger would be a good strategic fit for BHP though thinks that some of Anglo American's assets might be undervalued. LaFemina said he would be \"surprised if this is BHP's final offer as the price is clearly too low to succeed\".\n\nAnglo American released a statement earlier today saying that the board is reviewing the non-binding proposal, noting that BHP has until 22 May to make a formal bid. BHP's proposal includes selling off Anglo American's platinum business and Kumba Iron Ore which supplies the steel industry in South Africa.\n\nAside from copper, both have large interests in iron ore (BHP's output was 257m t in 2023 compared to Anglo's 60m t); coal (BHP's 29m t vs Anglo's 16m t) and nickel (BHP's 80,000 t vs Anglo's 40,000 t). Both also have interest in fertilisers, with BHP building a large potash mine in Canada and Anglo American developing a polyhalite mine in northeast England.\n\nBHP said in a statement that the benefit of the bid to shareholders includes increased exposure to copper through Anglo American's world-class copper assets, while it would complement BHP's iron ore and metallurgical coal portfolios with Anglo American's iron ore operations in Brazil and metallurgical coal assets in Queensland, Australia.\n\nAnglo American also produces platinum group metals which are used in catalysts and owns the De Beers diamond company, though BHP has said the iconic business would be subject to a strategic review once the deal is completed, hinting at a sale.", "source": {"uri":

It is also a key player in diamonds, with world leader De Beers under its umbrella.\n\nIn proposing the acquisition, BHP is after Anglo's copper mines in Chile and other countries. Copper is a big business for the latter company, accounting for 20% of sales.\n\nCopper demand is expected to soar as decarbonization progresses. Offshore wind power generation requires 8,000 kilograms of copper per megawatt, about seven times as much as coal-fired power generation, according to the International Energy Agency. Solar power requires 2.5 times as much copper as coal.\n\nElectric vehicles can contain around 53 kg of copper per vehicle, more than double the amount for combustion vehicles. Although sales are slowing, the IEA expects EVs to account for more than 50% of global new vehicle sales in 2035.\n\nBut copper supply has struggled to keep up. Good mines are being depleted, while environmental regulations and other factors are hampering approval for new ones. The copper industry faces what has been described as the \"30-40-50 problem,\" where, compared with the past 10 years, the average new project is 30% smaller, costs 40% more and takes 50% longer to develop.\n\nFor companies like BHP, it makes more sense to acquire existing assets than to spend money developing new mines. BHP acquired Australian copper company OZ Minerals in May 2023 for 9.6 billion Australian dollars ($6.2 billion at today's rates). The Anglo acquisition proposal is an extension of this strategy.\n\nMeanwhile, Anglo has been struggling, lowering some production forecasts due to falling prices for precious metals. With its stock price falling by more than 10% in the past year, BHP may have deemed now a good opportunity to propose an acquisition.\n\nBHP has been reviewing its asset structure amid the decarbonization trend. It spun off a portion of its metals business in 2015, including aluminum, and sold the oil and gas division to an Australian energy major in 2022.\n\nAs part of its proposal, BHP is calling for Anglo to spin off its precious metals and iron ore businesses, which has become unprofitable. Anglo is a major producer of platinum and palladium, which are used in exhaust gas catalysts for diesel and gasoline vehicles, but prices have slumped in recent years due to the spread of EVs.\n\nRestructuring of assets is a common challenge in the resource industry. British-Australian giant Rio Tinto sold all coal interests and acquired an Argentinian lithium-related business in 2022 to tap into EV-related demand.\n\nU.S. gold miner Newmont last year acquired Newcrest Mining, an Australian company with copper assets.\n\n\"The industry is at a turning point as it faces the end of the era of chasing volume in response to China's rapid growth, as well as the depletion of resources,\" said Takayuki Homma, chief economist at Sumitomo Corp. Global Research. \"It's possible that industry consolidation through mergers and acquisitions will continue in the future.\"\n\nBHP has proposed major acquisitions in the past that never materialized. It made a takeover bid for Rio Tinto in 2007 but abandoned the offer after a sharp decline in commodity prices.\n\nAnglo shares began Thursday trading around 10% above the previous day's close as the market reacted positively to news of the proposal.\n\nHowever, a deal between the companies would give them an outsized influence in the copper market, which could make it subject to approval by regulators.", "source": {"uri": "asia.nikkei.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nikkei Asia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP", "type": "org", "score": 5,

During the apartheid era, Anglo American controlled around 40% of stocks on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange by value. Fast forward 30 years and there is now a very good chance it will disappear entirely.\n\nIf BHP's bid for Anglo announced this morning succeeds, and honestly I don't see any reason why it or another like it won't, it will constitute a very big mining deal in today's landscape.\n\nBut in historic terms, it means something different. For one, it will represent the end of the Oppenheimer empire, although it should be noted that the remaining members of the Oppenheimer family themselves have already left the building. The family owns perhaps 2% of the company today. So it is arguable that to talk about Anglo as the \"Oppenheimer empire\" is a bit dated anyway.\n\nBut if you believe in corporate empires, where did Anglo go wrong?\n\nLet's start with the deal itself. BHP now towers over Anglo in scale, so although it might be an important potential acquisition for BHP, it's by no means a game-changer. Anglo's market cap is about $24-billion compared to BHP's $255-billion, so depressingly Anglo is something of a snack for BHP -- no more.\n\nIs the bid fair? It's probably a bit light, as you would expect going into a bidding process. As I write, if you take into account the jettisoning of Amplats and Kumba, the deal values Anglo at about 2,400 pence a share, Anglo's shares are trading about 4% above the implied potential bid price. That can only mean two things: shareholders think that BHP will up its bid and/or that either Rio Tinto or Glencore will make a competing bid. You can bet a bunch of corporate finance teams are frantically hauling out their rulers right around now.\n\nBut let's look back a bit because I think this is instructive. In discussion with colleagues and friends, we came up with five crossroads events in Anglo's recent history where the company took the wrong turn which has led to its possible demise. You could call them places where the company \"went wrong\", but in some ways that might be too harsh; there were reasons the company made the decisions it did at the time and it might have turned out very differently.\n\nErnest Oppenheimer, a Jewish German \u00e9migr\u00e9, founded Anglo American 1917 in Johannesburg with the backing of American bank JP Morgan and a collection of UK banks; the name of the company reflected that debt. In a way, in that decision to capitalise itself, the company betrayed its core strategy; aggressive growth. The company's history from then on for the next 50 years reflected its facility at both corporate acquisition and building mines from the ground up. Three pivotal moments were consolidating the diamond industry, discovering and exploiting the Free State gold fields, and essentially creating the Zambian copper fields. Underpinned by massively exploited local labour and boosted by huge ambition, Anglo's first half-century was a powerhouse.\n\nAnd then the company ran smack dab into politics. First in Zambia, where Anglo's copper mines were nationalised, and then in SA, where the apartheid regime complicated the company's ability to expand outside the country. By the time Harry Oppenheimer took over in late 1950, these effects were beginning to show. Unable to expand at pace outside SA, Anglo began its diversification inside SA, becoming a domestic mining/industrial complex.\n\nOutside of SA, Anglo used the little it was paid for its Zambian copper interests to start Minorco, but here was perhaps one of the company's missteps. Minorco was not unsuccessful but it certainly didn't become a great stand-alone mining company. It was eventually unceremoniously absorbed into Anglo when the parent company listed in London. Perhaps it's an unfair comparison, but just contrast what the Rembrandt group did with its, at first, tiny international interest; Richemont. The difference is stark. Minorco was treated as an afterthought and performed likewise.\n\nThe second wrong turn was the decision to list in London, as I have written often before. But you know, if I had been at that pivotal meeting in the Brenthurst library just as the century was turning, I bet I would have voted in favour too. Funny old thing, life. The theory was that Anglo would join the biggest mining companies in the world there, BHP and Rio Tinto, cementing the London Stock Exchange as the global centre of mining. The cost of capital would be lower, Anglo would at last be free of all the constrictions of its birthplace, and it would be able to spread its wings to achieve its full potential. At the time, incredibly, Anglo was only a little smaller than BHP, despite its recent merger with Billiton, so expectations were high.\n\nBut instead, the London market did the opposite. For the first decade, London investors looked at Anglo with distrust and suspicion, found its complex structure with cross-holdings into De Beers and Anglo-Gold unwieldy, and its industrial interests weak and uninteresting. Anglo spent an enormous amount of time and effort creating an entity that was investable from the point of view of retirees from Shrewsbury. The idea of Anglo being a growth company was off the agenda while all that got sorted out.\n\nIt wasn't as though Anglo didn't try. The company made bids in exactly the right area: big Australian iron ore companies. But as a newcomer to the London market, Anglo was anxious to not overpay and thereby irritate London's old-fashioned pin-stripe brigade even more than it was already. But the irony is that if Anglo's bids for the Australian iron ore companies had succeeded, history would be very different because even at the highest bid price, they would have paid off in just a few years. Instead, the upside went to Anglo's Australian competitors, BHP and Rio, who have made an absolute fortune from assets they were more or less forced to buy because of Anglo's bids. So this too goes down as a fork in the rutty road that ended badly.\n\nThe next fork in that road, another fork missed rather than taken, was the emergence of China, which industrialised at a speed never seen before in history. Anglo, fooling around with its portfolio of odd interests, just kinda missed the boat. And that boat was boarded with vigour by BHP and Rio. In order to achieve its aims, China needed iron ore, and Australia had plenty. The geographical proximity, I'm sure, played into it, and the fact that the Chinese were always big customers.\n\nSo, having missed the commodity boom boat in the early 2000s, Anglo redoubled its efforts to catch up and ended up taking yet another wrong turn in the late 2000s. The company took a huge bet on Brazilian iron ore, buying the Minas Rio prospect in 2007 but building the mine, paying off title deeds holders for 500km between the mine and the sea, and just the enormity of the project, were frankly disastrous. As it happens, Anglo's competitors made much bigger mistakes, but they were earning so much at this stage from iron ore, it just didn't matter as much.\n\nAt last, Anglo chose a fork in the road that did pay off: it bought several South American copper mines that have turned out to be spectacular winners. More on this in a bit.\n\nAnd finally, I have a potentially contentious suggestion about a road not taken: the fact that the Oppenheimer family lost interest in the company. I'm sure they had excellent reasons, and god knows, when you are that rich, ultimately what is the point in the exhausting, grinding job of running a global mining company? Nicky Oppenheimer bought De Beers from Anglo and then sold it back to Anglo, in two spectacular deals, absolutely securing the family's financial legacy. But in the process, I think the company lost its soul.\n\nIs that really important in this day and age? In some ways, we live in the era of professional managers, not corporate empires. Yet, particularly in the huge corporations of our day, having some relatable character and expertise with deep vested interests in the company can be a huge advantage. Just think of the value of Tesla compared to other car companies around the world, and what it might be worth if Elon Musk weren't there.\n\nAnyway, back to the copper interests. In its stumbling around, Anglo's copper mines have hit a niche: copper will be crucial to a whole bunch of modern endeavours, including a host of new industrial efforts like electric cars and products to alleviate climate change. BHP have pretty much made it clear that this is essentially why they are making a bid for the company. BHP, which earns the vast majority of its profits from iron ore, is not even interested in Anglo's iron ore businesses, or for that matter, its South African businesses as a whole; Kumba and Amplats will be unbundled and De Beers sold. What's left? Copper.\n\nSo is Ernest Oppenheimer rolling in his grave at the thought of his empire possibly reaching its expiry date? I don't know. But if he is, he is rolling very comfortably. And Anglo might still survive this intact.", "source": {"uri": "dailymaverick.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Maverick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_cohen@dailymaverick.co.za", "name": "Tim Cohen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BHP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J.

Anglo's board is reviewing the proposal and it cautioned that there is no certainty an offer will be made. Anglo said BHP's proposal was conditional on the company first splitting off its South African platinum and iron ore units.\n\nIf successful, a takeover would mark a return to large-scale dealmaking for BHP, which has revived its appetite for transformational acquisitions in the past couple of years under CEO Mike Henry.\n\nAnglo American has long been viewed as a potential target among the largest miners, particularly because it owns big South American copper operations at a time when most of the industry is seeking to expand in copper. However, suitors have been put off by its complicated structure and mix of commodities, and especially its deep exposure to South Africa.\n\nAnglo has faced a series of major setbacks over the past year, as prices for some of its key products plunged, while operational difficulties have forced the company to slash its production targets -- driving down its valuation and leaving the company vulnerable to potential bidders.\n\nRead: Anglo American Posts Steep Profit Fall and Lowers Dividend\n\nAnglo's shares have dropped 12% over the last 12 months, giving the company a market value of \u00a327-billion. BHP, which trades in London and Sydney, has a market value of about $149-billion.\n\nA successful takeover would represent the first mega deal among the world's biggest diversified miners in over a decade. BHP and its biggest rivals spent years on the sidelines after a series of disastrous transactions, but have warmed up to the prospect of dealmaking after reassuring investors that they have learned from past mistakes.\n\nBHP last year bought copper producer OZ Minerals for about $6.4-billion in its first major purchase in years, but has otherwise focused until now on selling assets such as oil, gas and coal.\n\nFor BHP, the clear lure for any deal would be Anglo's copper assets. The world's biggest miners are all seeking to expand their copper production in anticipation of rising prices as demand for electrification rises while future supplies look constrained.\n\nAnglo's South American copper business has long been sought after by bigger players in the industry, although it has recently faced setbacks and had to reduce its copper production forecasts.\n\nIt's also possible that the now-public proposal for Anglo could draw out other potential bidders. No. 2 miner Rio Tinto Group has also been investing in copper production, while Glencore Plc last year made an unsuccessful offer for Teck Resources Ltd., which has a coveted copper business, before eventually reaching a deal for the Canadian company's coal assets.\n\nRead: BHP Revives Appetite for Deals With Biggest Rivals in Sights\n\nWhile Anglo's valuation may make it more attractive, it remains a highly complicated business. The company owns majority stakes in two South African-listed miners -- Anglo American Platinum Ltd. and Kumba Iron ore Ltd. -- and is the majority owner of diamond miner De Beers. It also has a long and complicated relationship with South Africa, where the state pension fund manager is its biggest shareholder.\n\nBHP's proposal was to first hand Anglo's stakes in the two South African businesses to the smaller company's investors before proceeding with a takeover, Anglo said. The two parts of the proposal would be \"inter conditional,\" it said.\n\nAnglo's other operations include copper, nickel, steelmaking coal and Brazilian iron ore, as well as the iconic De Beers business.", "source": {"uri": "dailymaverick.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Maverick"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP", "type": "org", "score": 5,

Anglo is obviously very much in play now and there's probably room for others to interlope. This is going to set the whole sector on fire,\" the news agency quoted Cleary as saying.\n\nCopper currently represents 30% of Anlgo's total production, with the business strategically positioned to capitalise on major demand themes, supported by several organic growth options.

The deal, if agreed, would give BHP access to more copper, one of the most sought after metals for the clean energy transition, and potash, which are its key strategic commodities, as well as more coking coal in Australia. Here are details on the assets and projects held by each company: ANGLO AMERICAN Anglo, headquartered in London, is a major producer of copper, nickel, iron ore, coking coal, platinum and diamonds. The BHP deal would be conditional on being preceded by separate distribution of its entire stakes in Anglo American Platinum and Kumba Iron Ore to its shareholders, which would significantly lower its exposure to South Africa. Anglo's copper mines include Quellaveco in Peru and Los Bronces, El Soldado and Collahuasi in Chile. The company's assets also include iron ore and nickel mines in Brazil, coking coal mines in Australia, manganese mines in South Africa and a potash project in Britain. Anglo operates in the diamond business through its 85% stake in industry giant De Beers. BHP BHP, headquartered in Melbourne, produces commodities including iron ore, coking coal, copper and nickel, and is moving into production of potash. Iron ore and copper are its top revenue-generating metals, with its Escondida mine in Chile and Antamina mine in Peru ranking among the top 10 copper mines in the world by capacity in 2023, according to International Copper Study Group. BHP is now working towards potash production, with first production planned at its Jansen project in Canada in late 2026.

According to people familiar with the matter, the company has held conversations with potential buyers, including luxury houses and Gulf sovereign-wealth funds.\n\nMARKET REACTION: Anglo American shares soared 12% earlier on Thursday, while BHP slipped about 3%. Shares in the former are now trading up 16% at 2,551.00 pence, while BHP's London shares are currently down 2.2% at 2,311.00 pence.\n\nANALYSTS' COMMENTS: Anglo American's copper assets are seen as the main driver of BHP's offer, according to RBC Capital Markets analysts. The tie-up would create the world's largest copper mining company, accounting for around 10% of global output. Peruvian and Chilean copper assets are particularly in focus, RBC said, with the Collahuasi and Los Bronces mines in Chile seen as an opportunity to expand and potentially lower costs. Both have large copper reserves, with Los Bronces accounting for around 2% of the world's known copper resources.\n\nA potential deal could however spark competition concerns as the combined entity would consolidate control of key commodities, SP Angel analysts say. BHP's approach could in fact be the start of a long road, especially if regulators and competition authorities are drawn into the process. SP Angel said a potential consolidation of the industry giants wouldn't necessarily increase the output of key commodities or encourage exploration to replenish depleting mineral-resource inventories.\n\nAccording to Jefferies, unless Anglo American proves unwilling to engage, other bidders could emerge. The company is a good fit for BHP or other mining majors due to potential synergies, asset quality and commodity exposure, especially copper. It is likely that Anglo American will push BHP for a higher premium on the all-share offer of 25.08 pounds a share ($29.19) as the valuation seems low, Berenberg analysts say.\n\nThe takeover offer also shows the London stock market is shrinking fast, according to AJ Bell. The firm's investment analyst Dan Coatsworth said London Stock Exchange Group Chief Executive David Schwimmer needs to find ways to replenish the pot of companies on the London market, as the takeover spree has now shifted to large, top-tier companies.\n\nCONTEXT: The offer comes after Anglo American shares experienced a sharp decline, creating a value opportunity. The firm saw its market value shrinking last year due to operational setbacks and downgraded production guidance.\n\nSpeculation that the British company could be a target for takeover emerged late last year, after the miner cut its production guidance for coming years, shaking the market. The company cited operational issues at a key copper mine in Chile and persistent logistical woes at its iron-ore operations in South Africa. Meanwhile, slumping platinum-metals and diamond prices further added to its headwinds.\n\nSince Chief Executive Duncan Wanblad took the reins in April 2022, Anglo American's market capitalization has diminished from around $72 billion to around $34 billion today. Its shares have declined roughly 41% since then.\n\nBHP's offer also comes at a time when copper prices are up 15% this year so far, boosted by expectations of tight global supplies and an optimistic demand outlook. Three-month copper is currently at $9,879.00 a metric ton. The prospect of shortages in copper concentrate is driving the rise, with the Cobre mine in Panama coming offline and producers in Latin America struggling to ramp up output.\n\nAccording to market watchers, prices are set to rise sustainably, driven by the expansion of clean-energy technologies and anticipated looser monetary policy in the U.S. and Europe. According to financial-services group MUFG, copper is forecast to reach $12,000 a ton by the end of next year as scarcity pressures intensify.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT: BHP's proposal is still in the early stages and could potentially trigger rival bids, according to analysts.\n\n\"If BHP does indeed continue to pursue this deal, we would be surprised if other bidders do not emerge,\" Jefferies analysts wrote in a research note. According to SP Angel analysts, alternative offers could come from a Chinese or Indian firm.\n\n\"The initial approach by BHP could be the start of a protracted process, which may possibly draw in other suitors and which could see Anglo American either lose its independence or reinvigorate it as a stand-alone force in the industry,\" they said.\n\nUnder U.K. takeover rules, BHP has until May 22 to make a formal offer for Anglo American. The deadline can be postponed.\n\nWrite to Barcelona editors at barcelonaeditors@dowjones.com", "source": {"uri": "morningstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Morningstar"}, "authors": [],

The proposal values Anglo American at \u00a331.1 billion ($38.8 billion)\n\n\"I wouldn't support it,\" Mantashe said by phone on Thursday. \"I don't think Anglo will agree to that.

Buybacks were a way to improve production per share without actually improving production.\n\nThe charts below, from Jefferies, are a little old but show the trend:\n\nDigging a new mine takes a long time, is very expensive, and annoys a lot of people. When labour and materials costs are rising, there's not much sense in making ten-year bets on commodity prices doing the same. And when mining stocks are trading at below replacement cost, it's much easier to buy than build. The pay-off is immediate.\n\nAnd mining stocks are currently below replacement value?\n\nMostly, yes. But it's largely on concern about Chinese iron ore demand, whereas copper specialists have been doing fine. But even though copper is providing about 40 per cent of Anglo's earnings this year, a profit warning in December deepened the perception that it's a bit lost strategically.\n\nWhy does BHP want to own Anglo American?\n\nIt doesn't, it wants to own some of Anglo American, specifically the bits that don't need fixing. Anglo's an old-fashioned conglomerate full of poison pills, most of which are South African. Here's an ownership structure chart from Jefferies:\n\nBHP's proposal involves getting rid of Anglo's majority stakes in two South Africa-listed miners, with its proposal conditional on Anglo demerging Kumba Iron Ore and Anglo Platinum.\n\nIf that happens, Anglo be recentred on Chilean and Peruvian copper with output of about 760,000 tonnes a year. Buying that would improve BHP's copper exposure by c40%\n\nThere's also Australian coking coal, Brazilian iron ore, plus a not-too-significant diamonds subsidiary, and a long-dated polyhalite project in the North York Moors National Park that defies rational explanation. Some of these assets are below world-class, such as the Brazilian mines, but none is considered high risk either politically or geologically. South Africa's wildcat strikes and rolling power outages would be someone else's problem.\n\nIt's also important that Anglo without South Africa is approximately the shape of BHP's existing operations. Sticking them together would make BHP usefully bigger but it wouldn't really change the investment case, nor the corporate structure. Charts from JPMorgan:\n\nSo BHP's the obvious bidder?\n\nGood gracious, no. BHP completed the purchase of copper and nickel miner Oz Minerals less than a year ago, and its liabilities from the Samarco mine dam disaster are not yet known. It's also no friend of South Africa, having created and demerged South32 to get rid of all exposure.\n\nRio Tinto (which bought a South African business, Richards Bay Minerals, off BHP) is probably better placed to consider big M&A right now. Glencore is probably not, given everything else it has going on, but that's not always stopped it. There's also the likelihood that bits of the conglomerate will be of interest to peers like Vale, already a partner in Brazil, which has former Anglo boss Mark Cutifani charing its base metals business.\n\nGiven the risk of interlopers, has BHP offered a knockout price?\n\nAgain, no. Not even close. The offer is 0.7097 BHP shares and shares in Johannesburg-listed Kumba and Amplats. At the open that valued Anglo at \u00a331.1bn at the open, or \u00a325.08 per share, but with BHP shares down 2.4 per cent at pixel time it's now slightly less.\n\nBut given Anglo's conglomerate nature, finding a knockout price isn't easy. It's generally agreed that Anglo trades at a discount to its sum of the parts, but that's been true for at least 20 years. If there was a quick and easy fix it would've happened by now.\n\nJefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina, a veteran in the field of mining megamergers, thinks \"price of at least \u00a328/sh would be necessary for serious discussions to take place, and a takeout price of well above \u00a330 per share would be the outcome if other bidders were to get involved\".\n\nHere's his working:\n\nWhile significant diligence would be required to estimate the substantial synergies of this combination, we assume as an initial base case that synergies would equate to 5% of Anglo's total operating costs (excluding Kumba and Amplats). This is not inconsistent with what we have seen with large mergers in mining historically. This implies an average annual EBITDA benefit of ~$750m, which compares to our 2025 EBITDA estimate of $7.6bn for Anglo (ex Kumba and Amplats). This synergy estimate is likely to be conservative. If we include our estimate of synergies on an after-tax present value basis ($4.1bn), we estimate Anglo fair value to be 2824p/sh, which equates to a US$42.6bn equity value. That is 28% above the most recent Anglo share price, and we believe it is a reasonable starting point in estimating what price might be enough to get a deal across the finish line.\n\nWill this get through competition regulators?\n\nAccording to the sellside, probably, though there are a few potential sticking points in copper and individual approvals will take a while.\n\nThe thing about mines is that they're often natural monopolies in the areas they operate, yet are selling into a global market. The Anglo-owned Quellaveco and BHP-owned Antamina mines are important to Peru, for example, but represent a tiny fraction of global copper production. If they were to be brought under the same ownership does it represent a market concentration problem or a political one? And if it's seen as a political problem, could the antitrust remedies be sales of non-core assets while copper is retained?\n\nAre things going to kick off in South Africa?\n\nMaybe, not least because there are national elections on May 29. But there the proposal to demerge Anglo's listed subsidiaries isn't an obviously hostile one, and it wouldn't be a completely clean break given BHP would inherit Anglo's South African diamonds and a majority stake in the Samancor chrome operations. (Ironically, the Samancor stake was previously owned by BHP and found its way to Anglo via the South32 spin-off.)\n\nRemind me, what's the point of all this?\n\nCost cutting. Berenberg analyst Richard Hatch isn't convinced that Anglo offers turnaround potential but there's plenty of jobs that can go at head office:\n\nIn terms of synergies, there are limited clear operational synergies to us, maybe some incountry synergies in Chile, Peru, Australia and Brazil, but the main saving would be through corporate G&A.\n\nAnd Anglo's reputation is for paying higher than the industry average, particularly for management jobs. Its 2023 annual report has a useful map to indicate where the headcount cuts can happen:\n\nBack to Berenberg:\n\nOverall, we can see the sense in the deal for the copper assets, but BHP is potentially buying a group of assets that need some care and attention, which, in our view, offer limited upside at this point. Current valuation multiples would also imply a slightly dilutive deal for BHP. It would also have to assume a net debt position of USD10.6bn, which would increase post-closing of deal, we think, as both Kumba and Anglo Platinum, which are consolidated, are net cash. Overall, we expect Anglo to push for a higher premium.\n\nWhat does this mean for North Yorkshire?\n\nThe crucial question, and it's likely to be mixed news for the residents of Sneatonthorpe. Anglo rescued UK-quoted Sirius Minerals in 2020 so took on Woodside, its hugely ambitious project to dig fertiliser out of the Yorkshire Moors. BHP also has a fertiliser project, the Jansen potash mine in Saskatchewan, Canada.\n\nBHP's project is much further along than the Yorkshire pit, which has yet to receive a final investment decision and is unlikely to progress quickly under Anglo's ownership without outside investment. Berenberg says BHP \"can probably delay the Woodsmith project given it is already growing substantially in potash via Jansen in Canada.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

He added: \"If I was a BHP shareholder and I was still capable of doing a cartwheel I'd do two if I got it at this price.\"\n\nBHP's takeover offer for Anglo would bring together two global mining companies and rank as one of the industry's largest transactions in years.

The orange metal is currently significantly under-supplied and is forecast to become even more so thanks to closure of mines globally, delays from the coronavirus pandemic and mooted production cuts from China.\n\nBHP already owns and operates the world's largest copper mine in Chile's Atacama region, but would gain Anglo American's own copper operations in Peru and Chile, despite the shaky production forecasts the company put forward at the tail-end of last year.\n\nWhat's more, BHP is only one year removed from completing a \u00a35bn takeover of fellow Australian copper miner Oz Minerals.\n\nAndy Forster, senior investment officer from Argo Investments, which holds shares in BHP, said that the move \"makes sense for copper, but as always with large complex transactions, it is hard to complete without destroying value along the way\".\n\nThe deal is contingent on Anglo divesting two of its South Africa-based problem children; the platinum division, known as Amplats, and Kumba Irone Ore.\n\nThe former suffered a 71 per cent profit plunge last year and responded by announcing plans to cut thousands of job cuts across its mines in February.\n\nKumba, meanwhile, announced a scheduled three-year cut in production in December to align output to constrained capacity to transport minerals via rail to port.\n\nThe unit has been hamstrung by South Africa's state-run railway operator Transnet, with cable theft and vandalism causing paused or delayed cargo transits and resulting in billions of rand in revenue lost.\n\nOne peculiar nugget in the deal is that BHP apparently wants to keep Anglo American's De Beers diamond division, a unit that has arguably been one of the most embattled parts of the business at the hands of slumped demand from China and a growing cubic zirconia market.\n\nAJ Bell's investment analyst Dan Coatsworth said: \"There were already murmurings that Anglo might demerge its stake in De Beers, and that also seems a logical route for BHP if it becomes the (short-term) owner.\"\n\nIn a wider sense, the move has heightened existing fears about an exodus from the London Stock Exchange.\n\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets for Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ''The buyout offer won't just shake up the mining industry, but will send a fresh chill through the City of London.\"\n\nAJ Bell's Coatsworth, meanwhile, believes that the buy could shrink the UK-listed large cap mining sector even further, but that could in fact be a good thing.\n\n\"There is a positive effect if that happens as it could change the way the London market is perceived from an industry breakdown,\" he said.\n\n\"Currently, there is a misconception that the FTSE 100 is full of old economy industries and is stuffed with miners - this is no longer the case. BHP gobbling up Anglo American would leave Rio Tinto and Glencore as the only diversified miners left in the FTSE 100.\"\n\nThe deal is up in the air until Anglo American responds but Andrew Keen of investment and research consultancy firm Edison Group, said that the company's share price jump adds credence to the possibility of the deal going through.\n\n\"Premiums for successful mergers and acquisitions in large cap mining are often in the order of 30 per cent and Anglo's announcement indicates that the approach has been made on an all-share basis, but cash components can be used as sweeteners and initial offers are often improved,\" he said.\n\n\"Anglo has had a spate of operational issues recently and now needs to argue it is the best owner of its assets and if an alternative bidder emerges, its likely the debate will switch to the value of the competing offers.\"\n\nJefferies' Christopher LaFemina added in an emailed note that it would be surprising if this were BHP's final offer.\n\n\"We estimate that a price of at least \u00a328 per share would be necessary for serious discussions to take place, and a takeout price of well above \u00a330 per share would be the outcome if other bidders were to get involved,\" he said.\n\nPerhaps the bid could also force other world-leading miners such as Rio Tinto or Glencore to enter the ring with bids of their own.\n\nThe latter could especially be one to watch, having recently shown an appetite for megadeals with its \u00a35.5bn buy of Canadian Teck Resources coking coal portfolio, a talked down offer from the initial proposal Glencore submitted to buy Teck in its entirety.", "source": {"uri": "oilprice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OilPrice.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The orange metal is currently significantly under-supplied and is forecast to become even more so thanks to closure of mines globally, delays from the coronavirus pandemic and mooted production cuts from China.\n\nBHP already owns and operates the world's largest copper mine in Chile's Atacama region, but would gain Anglo American's own copper operations in Peru and Chile, despite the shaky production forecasts the company put forward at the tail-end of last year.\n\nWhat's more, BHP is only one year removed from completing a \u00a35bn takeover of fellow Australian copper miner Oz Minerals.\n\nAndy Forster, senior investment officer from Argo Investments, which holds shares in BHP, said that the move \"makes sense for copper, but as always with large complex transactions, it is hard to complete without destroying value along the way\".\n\nThe deal is contingent on Anglo divesting two of its South Africa-based problem children; the platinum division, known as Amplats, and Kumba Irone Ore.\n\nThe former suffered a 71 per cent profit plunge last year and responded by announcing plans to cut thousands of job cuts across its mines in February.\n\nKumba, meanwhile, announced a scheduled three-year cut in production in December to align output to constrained capacity to transport minerals via rail to port.\n\nThe unit has been hamstrung by South Africa's state-run railway operator Transnet, with cable theft and vandalism causing paused or delayed cargo transits and resulting in billions of rand in revenue lost.\n\nOne peculiar nugget in the deal is that BHP apparently wants to keep Anglo American's De Beers diamond division, a unit that has arguably been one of the most embattled parts of the business at the hands of slumped demand from China and a growing cubic zirconia market.\n\nAJ Bell's investment analyst Dan Coatsworth said: \"There were already murmurings that Anglo might demerge its stake in De Beers, and that also seems a logical route for BHP if it becomes the (short-term) owner.\"\n\nIn a wider sense, the move has heightened existing fears about an exodus from the London Stock Exchange.\n\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets for Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ''The buyout offer won't just shake up the mining industry, but will send a fresh chill through the City of London.\"\n\nAJ Bell's Coatsworth, meanwhile, believes that the buy could shrink the UK-listed large cap mining sector even further, but that could in fact be a good thing.\n\n\"There is a positive effect if that happens as it could change the way the London market is perceived from an industry breakdown,\" he said.\n\n\"Currently, there is a misconception that the FTSE 100 is full of old economy industries and is stuffed with miners - this is no longer the case. BHP gobbling up Anglo American would leave Rio Tinto and Glencore as the only diversified miners left in the FTSE 100.\"\n\nThe deal is up in the air until Anglo American responds but Andrew Keen of investment and research consultancy firm Edison Group, said that the company's share price jump adds credence to the possibility of the deal going through.\n\n\"Premiums for successful mergers and acquisitions in large cap mining are often in the order of 30 per cent and Anglo's announcement indicates that the approach has been made on an all-share basis, but cash components can be used as sweeteners and initial offers are often improved,\" he said.\n\n\"Anglo has had a spate of operational issues recently and now needs to argue it is the best owner of its assets and if an alternative bidder emerges, its likely the debate will switch to the value of the competing offers.\"\n\nJefferies' Christopher LaFemina added in an emailed note that it would be surprising if this were BHP's final offer.\n\n\"We estimate that a price of at least \u00a328 per share would be necessary for serious discussions to take place, and a takeout price of well above \u00a330 per share would be the outcome if other bidders were to get involved,\" he said.\n\nPerhaps the bid could also force other world-leading miners such as Rio Tinto or Glencore to enter the ring with bids of their own.\n\nThe latter could especially be one to watch, having recently shown an appetite for megadeals with its \u00a35.5bn buy of Canadian Teck Resources coking coal portfolio, a talked down offer from the initial proposal Glencore submitted to buy Teck in its entirety.\n\nUntil more updates are announced, London's mining sector, and the wider stock exchange, will watch with baited breath.", "source": {"uri":

His capital allocation discipline has also won him plenty of plaudits from investors, as BHP has transformed into one of the world's largest dividend payers. But it may need to draw on those reserves of faith for this tilt at Anglo.\n\nSo, why does this deal make sense for BHP? The answer lies mainly in the world's hottest commodity: copper.\n\nBHP is already on track to overtake Chile's Codelco as the world's biggest copper miner following its acquisition of OZ Minerals last year for about $10 billion, and strong production from its Escondida and Spence projects in Chile, and Olympic Dam in South Australia.\n\nBut like every resources company in the world, it wants more of the commodity crucial to both the energy transition and the artificial intelligence boom. Rising demand, falling output from the world's ageing fleet of existing copper mines, and a dearth of new mines and discoveries means the copper market will drift into a deficit this year, and stay there; the copper price has surged 25 per cent in two months as a result.\n\nAnglo knows the supply squeeze only too well. The Quellaveco mine in Peru, in which it owns a 60 per cent stake, is one of the world's newest mines. But its Los Bronces mine in Chile is over 100 years old, and Anglo is now struggling to process harder ore that contains less copper; it has now curtailed output to keep costs down.\n\nAccording to Anglo's production guidance, released this week, it expects to produce about 750,000 tonnes of copper this calendar year; that would boost BHP's annual production by more than 40 per cent to about 2.5 million tonnes.\n\nThe only question is whether competition regulators, or an increasingly nationalistic government somewhere around the world, decides BHP is gaining too much control of the copper market.\n\nThe takeover would deliver other wins, too.\n\nAnglo's metallurgical coal mines (which supply steel makers) are located near BHP's Queensland mines, creating obvious synergies and the opportunity for BHP to create one of the resource basin plays that it so loves - think the Pilbara in Western Australia, and the developing copper basin around Olympic Dam.\n\nAnglo's annual iron ore production is about 60 million tonnes, compared with about 255 million for BHP. While BHP would demerge the South African iron ore business which accounts for about two-thirds of Anglo's production, the remaining Minas-Rio mine in Brazil produces high-quality product that could eventually help BHP compete with the similarly high-grade ore that will eventually come out of the giant Simandou mine in Guinea.\n\nThere's a lot of water to go under the bridge here; Anglo has given BHP until May 22 to firm up a deal. At \u00a325.08, the bid is priced 16 per cent above Anglo's last close, but BHP is betting that frustrated Anglo investors see the benefits of a better-together pitch\n\nBut in many ways, the trade-off is simple: if BHP and its investors can stomach a few years of complexity - and inherent the risks that brings - then this deal could deliver a big copper win, and important gains in coal and iron ore.", "source": {"uri": "afr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Financial Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP", "type": "org",

It would take over Anglo after a spin-off of two assets.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity because the matter is private, one of the sources said the offer did not address the complexities of demerging the Anglo American Platinum and Kumba Iron Ore businesses in South Africa.\n\nBHP has until May 22 to come back with a binding bid.\n\nAnglo, which has a market value of $36.7 billion, said it would be reviewing the offer, without elaborating.\n\nThe proposed tie-up would create a group with around one tenth of the global output of copper, which is in demand for its use in electric vehicles and new technologies, such as automation and artificial intelligence.\n\nBHP has made the offer as Anglo continues a strategic review of its assets started in February in response to a 94% fall in annual profit and a series of writedowns caused by to lower commodity demand.\n\nOne of the sources said Anglo's management was continuing \"full steam ahead\" with the review.\n\nThe company has also been looked for other ways to strengthen its position.\n\nTwo sources close to the matter said Anglo American in March picked investment bank RBC Capital Markets to begin a syndication process for its costly Woodsmith fertiliser project in northeast England, accelerating the search for an investor to share the $9 billion capital cost.\n\nRBC was not immediately available to comment.\n\nAnother source said Anglo American was looking for partners for its diamonds De Beers business, which is among the assets BHP has said it would review after completion of any deal.\n\nAnalysts, meanwhile, also said the offer was probably not enough and that Anglo American's assets could be a better fit for othe major mining companies.\n\n\"This (BHP's) offer isn't enough to get either the board or the shareholders over the line,\" Liberum analyst Ben Davis said.\n\nAnalysts at Deutsche Bank said the \"strategic rationale\" of a merger could be as strong for Rio Tinto and Glencore.\n\n\"The proposed offer by BHP could potentially spur alternative bidders to enter the frame,\" they said.\n\nRio Tinto and Glencore both declined to comment on any possible interest and BHP declined to give any additional details beyond its offer.\n\nNichola Stein, portfolio manager at Coronation Fund Managers, which holds Anglo American shares, was also dismissive.\n\n\"The offer price appears quite opportunistic, especially when they say: get rid of the stuff we don't want before it ...even goes through, making it conditional on that,\" Stein said.\n\n(Reporting by Clara Denina, Pratima Desai, Amy-Jo Crowley, Anousha Sakoui; additional reporting by Felix Njini.

If completed, the acquisition would increase BHP's access to copper reserves, it added.\n\nThe potential deal would have a higher value than the $38.3 billion acquisition of Switzerland's Xstrata by commodities company Glencore in 2012, according to Dealogic data. It would also be the biggest merger or acquisition in the mining industry by value since Dealogic began collecting the data in 2004.\n\nAnglo American's board is \"currently reviewing this proposal,\" the company said in a statement, adding that there was \"no certainty\" a formal offer would be made by BHP, or the terms of that potential offer.\n\nBHP has until May 22 to make a formal offer.\n\nShares in Anglo American soared as much as 13.8% on the news. By 5.47 a.m. ET, they were trading at \u00a324.55 ($30.72). Shares in BHP closed 0.6% down in Australia.\n\nCopper is an essential component in some renewable energy technologies, including solar panels and electric vehicles. And it is in high demand: The price of the metal on the London Metals Exchange has risen more than 13% so far this year to almost $10,000 a metric ton, its highest level in about two years.\n\nA year ago, BHP acquired Australian rival Oz Minerals to widen its access to copper and nickel. The buyout was part of BHP's strategy to \"meet increasing demand for the critical minerals needed for electric vehicles, wind turbines and solar panels,\" company CEO Mike Henry said in a statement at the time.\n\nThe approach by BHP may also fuel concerns about some of the United Kingdom's biggest companies leaving the London Stock Exchange.\n\nThe buyout offer \"will send a fresh chill through the City of London,\" Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, wrote in a note Thursday. \"There are concerns that, if the deal goes through, it could be the tip of the iceberg and more giants could leave the exchange.\"\n\nRob North contributed reporting.

Under BHP's proposal, the London-listed miner would be broken up, spinning off its South African-based platinum metals and iron ore divisions. All other units, such as De Beers diamonds, would undergo a strategic view.\n\nThe world's largest miners have made it no secret that they want to grow in copper. The highly conductive metal is predicted to have massive shortages in the coming years as demand surges for renewables, power grids and electrical cars. Yet prices are too low for miners to develop new mines. The industry's top executives are all betting on a price surge in the years ahead.\n\nBHP seeks to get ahead of that price boom. It said that the deal would boost its exposure to Anglo's copper assets, which are located in Chile and Peru.\n\nMeanwhile, the mining sector is flush with cash after bumper profits from higher commodity prices in recent years. That has primed industry leaders for M&A after a decade of discipline, following disastrous overspending on deals during the last price boom over a decade ago.\n\nThe timing also makes sense as Anglo has been on a torrid run under chief executive Duncan Wanblad, who took over in April 2022. Its shares suffered their worst one-day fall in 15 years in December because of bumper downgrades to its production forecasts, making Anglo cheap relative to its rivals.\n\nAnalysts say the value of its copper business is masked by the rest of its sprawling business. In particular, De Beers and the platinum metals division have been misfiring, partly because of structural threats to demand from lab-grown diamonds and declining combustion engine car sales.\n\n\"The timing is not surprising considering Anglo is reviewing its business,\" said one large shareholder in BHP and Anglo American. \"Anglo will need to create a compelling alternative if they're going to defend this.\"\n\nBHP's largest rivals, which include Rio Tinto, Glencore and Vale, are unlikely to sit on the sidelines, since copper growth is a strategic priority for all of them.\n\nKaan Peker, analyst at RBC, singled out Glencore and Vale as two potential suitors because of the potential to cut costs by combining the Swiss group's copper mines with Anglo's. Meanwhile, Anglo's former chief executive, Mark Cutifani, has joined a Saudi-backed arm of Vale as chair.\n\nOthers say that Chinese mining groups -- hungry to secure copper and better positioned to handle the tricky situation with the South African government -- should not be ruled out.\n\n\"The die is cast for China to come in and trump BHP's offer with relatively little resistance from the South African authorities,\" said John Meyer, a mining analyst at S&P Angel.\n\nAnglo could also go on the offensive by proposing a merger with the second rung of mining groups such as Teck Resources, Freeport-McMoRan or South32, as it seeks to sell other assets.\n\nWanblad has told the market that there are \"no sacred cows\" in the portfolio as he undertakes a review of its mines that span copper, metallurgical coal, platinum metals, diamonds and fertiliser.\n\n\"We find it hard to believe at first glance that [Anglo] simply won't argue that there is plenty more they can do themselves rather than simply folding for BHP paper,\" said Mark Kelly, chief executive at MKP Advisors.\n\nBHP has signalled that the deal could deliver \"meaningful synergies\" by sharing procurements and eliminating duplication at mine sites.\n\nMining M&A only tends to generate large cost savings when the two companies' operations are in close geographical proximity to one another.\n\nBoth BHP and Anglo have copper mines in Chile and Peru, metallurgical coal mines in Queensland and iron ore operations in Brazil, where some savings could be targeted.\n\nChris LaFemina, analyst at Jefferies, estimates that $750mn of annual savings could be made on Anglo's $7.6bn forecast earnings for 2025 excluding the two South African divisions that could be demerged.\n\nHowever, Richard Hatch, analyst at Berenberg, cast doubt on the extent to which they could be achieved.\n\n\"There are limited clear operational synergies to us,\" he said. \"But the main saving would be through corporate general and administrative\".\n\nBankers say Anglo's complex history and sprawling portfolio make any deal fraught.\n\nOne of the most challenging elements will be the response of the South African government -- often described as Anglo's \"poison pill\" -- to BHP's proposal to spin off the two local divisions. The country's Public Investment Corporation is Anglo's biggest shareholder.\n\nAnglo is one of South Africa's showcase global companies and is one of the country's largest employers, which makes a break-up a bitter blow to Pretoria during an election year.\n\nSouth Africa's minerals resources minister Gwede Mantashe has already voiced his opposition to the deal, saying that BHP \"never did much\" for the country.\n\nAnother possible hurdle is antitrust scrutiny. The biggest resistance is likely to come from China, consumer of more than half of the world's copper, to the creation of a behemoth that could soon produce just shy of 15 per cent of global supply.\n\nIron ore and metallurgical coal are other areas that could face opposition from jurisdictions including the EU and Japan.\n\nUK antitrust issues are expected to be of less concern, though the Competition and Markets Authority does not comment on deals until there is a formal announcement.\n\n\"This deal would produce the world's largest copper producer, and they are also significant producers of iron ore and coal,\" said Tom Smith, a former CMA director now at Geradin Partners. \"Two companies of this size would normally trigger merger filings in a large number of countries, and we should expect these regulatory processes to drag out for many months at least.\"\n\nBHP has until May 22 to lodge a formal bid for Anglo.\n\nAnglo could start to pursue asset disposals but some shareholders believe the company is unlikely to pull up the draw bridge, given chair Stuart Chamber's record of selling UK businesses such as Pilkington and Arm.\n\nBut attention will also be cast on what BHP does next. LaFemina at Jefferies said that BHP was going to have to raise its bid to at least \u00a328 per share to be taken seriously by Anglo's management team and \u00a330 if other bidders became involved, up from the Melbourne-based company's opening shot of \u00a325.08.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The bet is based on the thesis that the world's power grids need a major overhaul and that the electrification of the economy will unleash new demand for base metals. This also comes as market observers have warned about an impending shortfall of global copper mining supply.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, BHP proposed an all-share deal valued at \u00a331.1 billion ($38.9 billion). The transaction depends on Anglo spinning off its South African iron ore and platinum businesses to its shareholders. The offer is conditional and non-binding at \u00a325.08 a share, or about a 14% premium to Anglo's closing share price on Wednesday.\n\nAnglo shares in London jumped 13% to \u00a324.89, giving the company a market capitalization of about \u00a330.5 billion.\n\nBHP's proposed acquisition of Anglo would dwarf its 2023 takeover of Australian copper producer OZ Minerals. The top miner believes copper demand will double over the next three decades.\n\nCopper is a critical base metal for infrastructure and renewable energy. BHP bets that the world's power grids must be upgraded as fossil fuel demand slides and the global economy's electrification ramps up.\n\nIf the deal closes, BHP will become the world's biggest copper producer (controlling roughly 10% of the global copper mining supply), which comes as some market observers are warning about supply shortfalls.\n\nAbout a year ago, billionaire mining investor Robert Friedland explained to Bloomberg TV in an interview that copper prices are set to soar because the mining industry is failing to increase supply ahead of 'accelerating demand.' He warned:\n\n\"We're heading for a train wreck here.\"\n\nFriedland is the founder of Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. He continued, \"My fear is that when push finally comes to shove,\" copper prices might explode ten times.\n\nJefferies' commodity desk recently warned, \"Disruptions have significantly increased, and a market deficit is now increasingly likely. We could be at the foothills of the next copper cycle.\"\n\nBofA recently warned, \"The copper supply crisis is here.\"\n\nLet's not forget about our note titled \"The Next AI Trade,\" which explains the investment opportunities in upgrading the nation's grid as generative AI data centers increase power demand.\n\nAnd Jefferies is on it: \"Copper Demand in Data Centers.\"\n\nBack to BHP, the company said in a statement to London Stock Exchange that the takeover would increase its \"exposure to future-facing commodities through Anglo American's world-class copper assets\" as well as \"complementing BHP's iron ore and metallurgical coal portfolios.\"\n\nJefferies analysts commented on the proposed takeover, indicating BHP might face competition in its pursuit of Anglo.\n\n\"Our analysis suggests that Anglo consists of an undervalued portfolio of multiple tier 1 assets several of which are in low-risk jurisdictions (Australia, Chile, Peru and Brazil),\" Jefferies said.\n\nJefferies Christopher LaFemina said:\n\n\"We would be surprised if this is BHP's final offer,\" adding, \"We estimate that a price of at least \u00a328/sh would be necessary for serious discussions to take place, and a takeout price of well above \u00a330 per share would be the outcome if other bidders were to get involved.\"\n\nA successful takeover would mark the first mega mining deal in more than a decade and signify the importance of critical metals and their use in upgrading the world's power grid.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero

The combined entity's value could surpass $200-billion, positioning it as a mining powerhouse.\n\nNarayanan attributed BHP's interest in Anglo to the company's weak financial performance, driven by challenges in platinum group metals and diamond sectors due to price fluctuations, geopolitical and economic situations, as well as operational constraints.\n\nAt the same time , the company has reported growth of 31.5% in copper sales to $7.36-billion in 2023.\n\nAnglo's first-quarter 2024 results revealed an 11% increase in copper production to 198 100 t, fuelled by significant output boosts in Peru and Chile.\n\nNarayanan projected operational synergies, foreseeing a combined entity with a to line of more than $84-billion, an Ebtida of more than $34-billion, and a workforce nearing 100 000, reinforcing its status as a major player in the global mining sector.", "source": {"uri": "miningweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mining Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mariaan_webb@miningweekly.com", "name": "Mariaan Webb", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BHP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo_American_plc", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anglo American plc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper_extraction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copper extraction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield_land", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenfield land"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mergers and acquisitions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Platinum group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diamond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peru"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Peru"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Mineral_Exploration_and_Extraction", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Mineral Exploration and Extraction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn.creamermedia.com/assets/articles/images/resized/0001128088_resized_angloamericanperu1022.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9510508", "eventUri": "eng-9510508", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

The number of cars built was 59,467, down by 27% compared with a year ago, said the Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders. It was the first fall since August last year but the trade body said it was in line with expectations for a variable year, as manufacturers adjust factories to produce the next generation of cars, notably electric. Volumes for the UK fell by 0.3% to 19,995 units, while production for export was down by 36% to 39,472 units, although more than six in 10 cars made in March were shipped overseas.\n\nJefferies raises Anglo American price target to 3,000 (2,600) pence - 'buy'\n\nBarclays raises Reckitt price target to 6,100 (6,000) pence - 'overweight'\n\nMiner Anglo American confirmed Thursday it is \"reviewing\" a takeover bid from its larger Australian rival BHP Group, in what would rank as one of the sector's biggest deals in years. Anglo American did not disclose the price of the \"unsolicited\" offer, which must be sewn up before a deadline of May 22. However, BHP subsequently said the offer values Anglo American's share capital at GBP31.1 billion. Australian-based BHP has a market value of around USD148 billion, while London-based Anglo American has a market value of about USD36 billion. BHP's offer would first hinge on Anglo American splitting off its platinum and iron ore operations in South Africa. Anglo's platinum operations are listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange under Anglo American Platinum, as are its iron ore operations under Kumba Iron Ore.\n\n----------\n\nSainsbury reported that revenue edged up 3.8% to GBP32.70 billion in the financial year ended March 2, from GBP35.16 billion a year earlier. Pretax profit fell by 15% to GBP277 million from GBP327 million. Sainsbury left its dividend unchanged at 13.1 pence. Looking ahead, the company said it is confident of delivering strong profit growth in the year ahead. Chief Executive Simon Roberts said: \"We said we'd put food back at the heart of Sainsbury's and that's what we've done. Our food business is firing on all cylinders. We have the best combination of value and quality in the market and that's winning us customers from all our key competitors, driving consistent volume market share growth as more customers choose us for their weekly shop and all their special occasions.\"\n\n----------\n\nAstraZeneca reported that revenue rose to USD12.68 billion in the first quarter of 2024, up 17% from USD10.88 billion a year earlier. Pretax profit jumped to USD2.80 billion from USD2.62 billion On the back of the results, Astra upped its dividend to USD3.10 from USD2.90. \"AstraZeneca had a very strong start in 2024 with substantial Total Revenue growth of 19% in the first quarter,\" said CEO Pascal Soriot. \"Our strong pipeline momentum continued and already this year we announced positive trial results for Imfinzi and Tagrisso that were unprecedented in lung cancer, the data from both of these studies will be presented during the ASCO plenary in June. We are also looking forward to seeing the results of several other important trials throughout the year.\"\n\n----------\n\nBarclays reported that total income fell to GBP6.95 billion in the first quarter of the year, from GBP7.24 billion a year earlier. It explained that the fall was due to \"higher structural hedge income, strong performance in Equities and balance growth in USCB were more than offset by lower FICC income in IB, lower inflation linked income as well as adverse product dynamics in Barclays UK deposits and mortgages.\" Pretax profit fell to GBP2.28 billion from GBP2.60 billion. Barclays said that its common equity tier 1 ratio fell to 13.5% from 13.8%.\n\n----------\n\nPersimmon reported that home completions in the first quarter of 2024 fell to 1,027 from 1,136 a year earlier. This included 852 private homes and 175 Partnership homes. The housebuilder said that this was in line with expectations. Looking ahead, Persimmon said it continues to expect growth in full year completions to between 10,000 and 10,500 completions with an operating margin in line with the prior year. Chief Executive Dean Finch said: \"Our first quarter performance was in line with expectations, and we saw an improvement in sales rates alongside firm pricing. Trading over recent weeks has been encouraging with robust visitor numbers and enquiries, giving us confidence for the remainder of the year.\"\n\nPureTech Health reported that total revenue in 2023 fell to USD3.3 million from USD15.6 million. Its pretax loss narrowed to USD36.1 million from USD92.8 million. \"2023 was a landmark year for PureTech, in which we made strong strategic and clinical progress. We've carried this momentum into 2024, with our hub-and-spoke R&D model continuing to deliver value for both patients and shareholders. Through this model we are able to ambitiously pursue our mission of giving life to science by developing therapies that make a meaningful difference to patients with devastating diseases,\" said CEO Bharatt Chowrira.\n\nPPHE Hotel reported that revenue in the first quarter of 2024 rose by 12% annually to GBP77.9 million. It explained that this was \"driven by growth in occupancy as room rates continued to normalise across both leisure, corporate and meetings and events segments, as well as an increase in operational days in the Croatian portfolio, particularly Grand Hotel Brioni, and the leap year benefit across all markets.\" Looking ahead, PPHE said booking activity remains healthy, with overall forward booking levels consistent with 2023 levels. It added that it remains confident in delivering full year performance in line with market expectations. CEO Boris Ivesha said: \"While still early in the year, leisure trends remain supportive and interest in our brands and assets in key European capital cities continues to support our confidence in our future prospects.\"\n\nComments and questions to newsroom@alliancenews.com\n\nCopyright 2024 Alliance News Ltd.

The company owns majority stakes in two South African-listed miners -- Anglo American Platinum Ltd. and Kumba Iron ore Ltd. -- and is the majority owner of diamond miner De Beers. It also has a long and complicated relationship with South Africa, where the state pension fund manager is its biggest shareholder.\n\nBHP's proposal was to first hand Anglo's stakes in the two South African businesses to the smaller company's investors before proceeding with a takeover, Anglo said. The two parts of the proposal would be \"interconditional,\" it said.\n\nAnglo's other operations include copper, nickel, steelmaking coal and Brazilian iron ore, as well as the iconic De Beers business.\n\nBoth companies are also investing in new fertilizer businesses -- BHP is building a massive potash mine in Canada, while Anglo is developing a polyhalite mine on the east coast of England.", "source": {"uri": "financialpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BHP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Tinto_(corporation)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rio Tinto (corporation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glencore", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glencore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mineral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teck_Resources", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Teck Resources"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo_American_Platinum", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anglo American Platinum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Beers", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "De Beers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potash", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Potash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steelmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steelmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_ore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iron ore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diamond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilizer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fertilizer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nickel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Mineral_Exploration_and_Extraction", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Mineral Exploration and Extraction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/financialpost/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/bhp-merger-with-anglo-would-create-worlds-top-copper-miner-.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9510508", "eventUri": "eng-9510508", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

The blue-chip index traded as high as 8,092.19 earlier Wednesday, its best-ever level. Selling pressure in the afternoon prevented it from achieving another closing high, however.\n\nThe Bank of England's Chief Economist Huw Pill on Tuesday said interest rate cuts are \"somewhat closer\" than last month, though he added the economic outlook has \"not changed substantially\" and there are still risks if bank policymakers reduce rates too early.\n\nAll eyes are now on US economic data. Thursday's economic calendar has a gross domestic product reading at 1330 BST.\n\nSterling was quoted at USD1.2470 early Thursday, higher than USD1.2432 at the London equities close on Wednesday.\n\nThe euro traded at USD1.0710 early Thursday, higher than USD1.0687 late Wednesday. Against the yen, the dollar was quoted at JPY155.72, higher versus JPY155.06.\n\nIn the US on Wednesday, Wall Street ended mixed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.1%. The S&P 500 closed up marginally and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.1%.\n\nIn Asia on Thursday, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo was down 2.1%. In China, the Shanghai Composite was up 0.3%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong was up 0.3%.\n\nIn Sydney, financial markets were closed for Anzac Day.\n\nIn early corporate news, miner Anglo American confirmed Thursday it was \"reviewing\" a takeover bid from its larger Australian rival BHP Group, in what would rank as one of the sector's biggest deals in years.\n\nAnglo American did not disclose the price of the \"unsolicited\" offer, which must be sewn up before a deadline of May 22.\n\nBHP's offer would first hinge on Anglo American splitting off its platinum and iron ore operations in South Africa. Anglo's platinum operations are listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange under Anglo American Platinum, as are its iron ore operations under Kumba Iron Ore.\n\nAustralian-based BHP has a market value of around USD148 billion, while London-based Anglo American has a market value of about USD36 billion.\n\n\"The buyout offer from BHP, the world's largest publicly listed miner, for Anglo American, won't just shake up the mining industry, but will send a fresh chill through the City of London. There are concerns that if the deal goes through it could be the tip of the iceberg and more giants could leave the exchange,\" said Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter.\n\nStill to come in Thursday's corporate calendar, there are first-quarter results from AstraZeneca, lender Barclays, consumer goods firm Unilever and FTSE Russell owner London Stock Exchange Group. Grocer Sainsbury's reports annual results.\n\nGold was quoted at USD2,316.90 an ounce early Thursday, lower than USD2,329.42 on Wednesday. Brent oil was trading at USD88.17 a barrel early Thursday, higher than USD88.12 late Wednesday.\n\nBy Sophie Rose, Alliance News senior reporter\n\nComments and questions to newsroom@alliancenews.com\n\nCopyright 2024 Alliance News Ltd.

BHP and its biggest rivals spent years on the sidelines after a series of disastrous transactions, but have warmed up to the prospect of dealmaking after reassuring investors that they have learned from past mistakes.\n\nRead: BHP Revives Appetite for Deals With Biggest Rivals in Sights\n\nBHP last year bought copper producer OZ Minerals Ltd. for about $6.4 billion in its first major purchase in years, but has otherwise focused until now on selling assets such as oil, gas and coal.\n\nIt's possible that the now-public proposal for Anglo could draw out other potential bidders.

Volumes for the UK fell by 0.3% to 19,995 units, while production for export was down by 36% to 39,472 units, although more than six in 10 cars made in March were shipped overseas.\n\nJefferies raises Anglo American price target to 3,000 (2,600) pence - 'buy'\n\nBarclays raises Reckitt price target to 6,100 (6,000) pence - 'overweight'\n\nMiner Anglo American confirmed Thursday it was \"reviewing\" a takeover bid from its larger Australian rival BHP Group, in what would rank as one of the sector's biggest deals in years. Anglo American did not disclose the price of the \"unsolicited\" offer, which must be sewn up before a deadline of May 22. BHP's offer would first hinge on Anglo American splitting off its platinum and iron ore operations in South Africa. Anglo's platinum operations are listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange under Anglo American Platinum, as are its iron ore operations under Kumba Iron Ore. Australian-based BHP has a market value of around USD148 billion, while London-based Anglo American has a market value of about USD36 billion.\n\n----------\n\nSainsbury reported that revenue edged up 3.8% to GBP32.70 billion in the financial year ended March 2, from GBP35.16 billion a year earlier. Pretax profit fell by 15% to GBP277 million from GBP327 million. Sainsbury left its dividend unchanged at 13.1 pence. Looking ahead, the company said it is confident of delivering strong profit growth in the year ahead. Chief Executive Simon Roberts said: \"We said we'd put food back at the heart of Sainsbury's and that's what we've done. Our food business is firing on all cylinders. We have the best combination of value and quality in the market and that's winning us customers from all our key competitors, driving consistent volume market share growth as more customers choose us for their weekly shop and all their special occasions.\"\n\n----------\n\nAstraZeneca reported that revenue rose to USD12.68 billion in the first quarter of 2024, up 17% from USD10.88 billion a year earlier. Pretax profit jumped to USD2.80 billion from USD2.62 billion On the back of the results, Astra upped its dividend to USD3.10 from USD2.90. \"AstraZeneca had a very strong start in 2024 with substantial Total Revenue growth of 19% in the first quarter,\" said CEO Pascal Soriot. \"Our strong pipeline momentum continued and already this year we announced positive trial results for Imfinzi and Tagrisso that were unprecedented in lung cancer, the data from both of these studies will be presented during the ASCO plenary in June. We are also looking forward to seeing the results of several other important trials throughout the year.\"\n\n----------\n\nBarclays reported that total income fell to GBP6.95 billion in the first quarter of the year, from GBP7.24 billion a year earlier. It explained that the fall was due to \"higher structural hedge income, strong performance in Equities and balance growth in USCB were more than offset by lower FICC income in IB, lower inflation linked income as well as adverse product dynamics in Barclays UK deposits and mortgages.\" Pretax profit fell to GBP2.28 billion from GBP2.60 billion. Barclays said that its common equity tier 1 ratio fell to 13.5% from 13.8%.\n\n----------\n\nPersimmon reported that home completions in the first quarter of 2024 fell to 1,027 from 1,136 a year earlier. This included 852 private homes and 175 Partnership homes. The housebuilder said that this was in line with expectations. Looking ahead, Persimmon said it continues to expect growth in full year completions to between 10,000 and 10,500 completions with an operating margin in line with the prior year. Chief Executive Dean Finch said: \"Our first quarter performance was in line with expectations, and we saw an improvement in sales rates alongside firm pricing. Trading over recent weeks has been encouraging with robust visitor numbers and enquiries, giving us confidence for the remainder of the year.\"\n\nPureTech Health reported that total revenue in 2023 fell to USD3.3 million from USD15.6 million. Its pretax loss narrowed to USD36.1 million from USD92.8 million. \"2023 was a landmark year for PureTech, in which we made strong strategic and clinical progress. We've carried this momentum into 2024, with our hub-and-spoke R&D model continuing to deliver value for both patients and shareholders. Through this model we are able to ambitiously pursue our mission of giving life to science by developing therapies that make a meaningful difference to patients with devastating diseases,\" said CEO Bharatt Chowrira.\n\nPPHE Hotel reported that revenue in the first quarter of 2024 rose by 12% annually to GBP77.9 million. It explained that this was \"driven by growth in occupancy as room rates continued to normalise across both leisure, corporate and meetings and events segments, as well as an increase in operational days in the Croatian portfolio, particularly Grand Hotel Brioni, and the leap year benefit across all markets.\" Looking ahead, PPHE said booking activity remains healthy, with overall forward booking levels consistent with 2023 levels. It added that it remains confident in delivering full year performance in line with market expectations. CEO Boris Ivesha said: \"While still early in the year, leisure trends remain supportive and interest in our brands and assets in key European capital cities continues to support our confidence in our future prospects.\"\n\nComments and questions to newsroom@alliancenews.com\n\nCopyright 2024 Alliance News Ltd.

Then he added: \"But with that comes great opportunity.\"\n\nFast forward seven months, and at least one of the opportunities Henry had in mind is now seemingly clearer.\n\nOn Thursday morning it was confirmed BHP had made a blockbuster \u00a331bn takeover bid for Anglo-American, its London-listed rival.\n\nObservers noted that the news happened to leak out on Wednesday evening - just before the ANZAC public holiday in Australia - ensuring that investors would have at least a day to digest the news before markets reopened.\n\nSo what's driving the deal? In a word: copper. And lots of it.\n\nSince Henry took over as BHP's chief executive in 2020, he has sought to bet big on copper as a key enabler of the green revolution, a crucial component for everything from power lines to batteries.\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, copper demand is set to rise from just over 25,000 kilotons in 2022 to just under 35,000 kilotons by 2035 and 40,000 kilotons by 2050.\n\nIn 2023, global consumption was around 27,600 kilotons, the World Bureau of Metal Statistics said.\n\nBut analysts are now predicting there will be a market deficit this year, as a squeeze on supplies pushes prices up.\n\n\"The one commodity everyone wants more of right now is copper,\" an insider at one of BHP's rivals says. \"Mike has made no secret of his desire to get hold of it.\"\n\nBHP, the world's biggest mining company, is already the largest copper producer, with an output of just over 1,300 kilotons in 2023. That puts it only slightly ahead of rivals such as Chilean state-owned Codelco and US miner Freeport-McMoRan.\n\nBut Anglo-American too is among the top five largest players, having produced around 830 kilotons last year. Its top assets are the Los Bronces and Collahuasi mines in Chile and the Quellaveco mine in Peru.\n\nIf the company were absorbed into BHP, the enlarged businesses would represent 10pc of global output at the stroke of a pen - cementing BHP's status as the undisputed leader in copper.\n\nBHP is thought to have less interest in the non-copper half of Anglo's assets, such as its diamond, platinum and iron ore mines in South Africa. That has prompted speculation that those could also be put in play.\n\n\"The proposed deal highlights miners' desperation to boost [copper] production through acquisitions, in order to reap the benefits of the growing supply gap,\" says Piotr Ortonowski, project manager at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.\n\nBHP's timing looks far from coindential. Before the takeover bid became public, Anglo's shares had been steadily declining for a year - with the company's stock price plunging by 20pc after shock cuts to its production forecasts in December.\n\nThat has piled pressure on Duncan Wanblad, Anglo's chief executive, to come up with ways to fix the crisis and boost shareholder returns. And in a remarkable coincidence, just hours after the BHP takeover became public, reports emerged on Thursday that the company was thinking about offloading diamond mining business De Beers.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Anglo's investors have branded BHP's approach opportunistic and called for the bidder to raise its offer.\n\nAt the start of this week, the London-listed miner's shares were changing hands for just under \u00a322 each, valuing it at just under \u00a329bn.\n\nBHP's offer was for just \u00a325 per share - well below the \u00a330 one person at a top 20 Anglo shareholder says would need to be on the table.\n\nOn Thursday, there were also signs that Anglo's biggest shareholder - South Africa's state-owned Public Investment Corporation - was lining up against a deal.\n\nGwede Mantashe, the South African mineral resources minister, said he was against a tie-up because his country's past experience with BHP was \"not positive\", the Financial Times reported.\n\nThe deal may also become the victim of a regulatory probe, coming so close to South African elections late next month, notes the insider at the top 20 shareholder.\n\n\"South Africa won't like it,\" the person adds. \"Anglo is behind a lot of South Africa jobs.\n\n\"There's risk attached.\"\n\nBut ultimately it may all come down to price - and responsibility for getting a good deal falls to Anglo chairman Stuart Chambers and the rest of the company's board.\n\nWithin the City, Chambers, a veteran operator who was previously chairman Travis Perkin, is perhaps best known as the man who sold the UK's then-largest technology company, Arm Holdings, to Japan's Softbank in 2016.\n\nBut in Henry, he will be up against a chief executive who has repeatedly vowed not to overpay for acquisitions following a troubled history of takeovers at BHP.\n\nOver the past four years he has consolidated BHP's structure in Australia, delisting it from London, selling off fossil fuel assets including coal and oil and gas operations and buying into minerals that he has argued will be central to the net zero transition.\n\nThe chief executive expanded his company's copper and nickel assets with a takeover of OZ Minerals in 2022 but played it cool publicly, insisting OZ was \"not a must-have\" after making an initial offer of A$8.3bn (\u00a34.3bn). He subsequently sealed the deal by upping his bid to A$9.6bn.\n\nThe \u00a331bn takeover would mark the largest UK takeover this year, dwarfing the \u00a35.5bn takeover of paper maker DS Smith. It will provide a golden opportunity for bankers in the City.\n\nBHP has hired UBS and Barclays - two European banks - to help in its pursuit while Anglo has turned to Wall Street titans Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley plus boutique investment bank Centerview Partners to defend itself.\n\nMark Sorrell, son of former WPP chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell, is advising Anglo on the deal on behalf of Goldman. It marks his third major bid defence this year after helping Direct Line against Belgian insurer Ageas and Royal Mail owner International Distribution Services in the fight with billionaire investor Daniel Kretinsky.\n\nAmong the other notable names, Morgan Stanley's top dealmaker Simon Smith, who recently gave evidence in the bank's High Court battle with Mike Ashley, is also working alongside Mr Sorrell for Anglo.\n\nOwing to the hard-charging personalities involved, mining deals often have an added sense of drama when push comes to shove.\n\nGlencore's \u00a354bn takeover of Xstrata, the industry's last major takeover in 2012, led to a high stakes battle between Glencore's Ivan Glasenberg and the Xstrata's Qatari shareholders over price.\n\nAfter the deal threatened to collapse, former prime minister Tony Blair was drafted in to broker a midnight peace deal between the two sides at a discrete meeting at London's luxury hotel Claridges.\n\nGlencore is likely to sit this one out, industry observers believe, having recently spent $7bn (\u00a35.6bn) acquiring Teck Resources.\n\nYet the merger of BHP and Anglo could yet trigger a wave of industry dealmaking as competitors look to keep up or grab some of the businesses left over.\n\nOne question in particular is whether BHP will have any interest in retaining Anglo's controversial Woodsmith mine, a major potash project in the north of England.\n\nThe group was planning to spend $1bn per year between 2024 and 2027 getting the mine ready for production.\n\nNow, everything suddenly seems in flux, says an industry colleague. \"Everyone is going to be watching this space very carefully,\" they add.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Then he added: \"But with that comes great opportunity.\"\n\nFast forward seven months, and at least one of the opportunities Henry had in mind is now seemingly clearer.\n\nOn Thursday morning it was confirmed BHP had made a blockbuster \u00a331bn takeover bid for Anglo-American, its London-listed rival.\n\nObservers noted that the news happened to leak out on Wednesday evening - just before the ANZAC public holiday in Australia - ensuring that investors would have at least a day to digest the news before markets reopened.\n\nSo what's driving the deal? In a word: copper. And lots of it.\n\nSince Henry took over as BHP's executive in 2020, he has sought to bet big on copper as a key enabler of the green revolution, a crucial component for everything from power lines to batteries.\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, copper demand is set to rise from just over 25,000 kilotons in 2022 to just under 35,000 kilotons by 2035 and 40,000 kilotons by 2050.\n\nIn 2023, global consumption was around 27,600 kilotons, the World Bureau of Metal Statistics said.\n\nBut analysts are now predicting there will be a market deficit this year, as a squeeze on supplies pushes prices up.\n\n\"The one commodity everyone wants more of right now is copper,\" an insider at one of BHP's rivals says. \"Mike has made no secret of his desire to get hold of it.\"\n\nBHP, the world's biggest mining company, is already the largest copper producer, with an output of just over 1,300 kilotons in 2023. That puts it only slightly ahead of rivals such as Chilean state-owned Codelco and US miner Freeport-McMoRan.\n\nBut Anglo-American too is among the top five largest players, having produced around 830 kilotons last year. Its top assets are the Los Bronces and Collahuasi mines in Chile and the Quellaveco mine in Peru.\n\nIf the company were absorbed into BHP, the enlarged businesses would represent 10pc of global output at the stroke of a pen - cementing BHP's status as the undisputed leader in copper.\n\nBHP is thought to have less interest in the non-copper half of Anglo's assets, such as its diamond, platinum and iron ore mines in South Africa. That has prompted speculation that those could also be put in play.\n\n\"The proposed deal highlights miners' desperation to boost [copper] production through acquisitions, in order to reap the benefits of the growing supply gap,\" says Piotr Ortonowski, project manager at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.\n\nBHP's timing looks far from coindential. Before the takeover bid became public, Anglo's shares had been steadily declining for a year - with the company's stock price plunging by 20pc after shock cuts to its production forecasts in December.\n\nThat has piled pressure on Duncan Wanblad, Anglo's chief executive, to come up with ways to fix the crisis and boost shareholder returns. And in a remarkable coincidence, just hours after the BHP takeover became public, reports emerged on Thursday that the company was thinking about offloading diamond mining business De Beers.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Anglo's investors have branded BHP's approach opportunistic and called for the bidder to raise its offer.\n\nAt the start of this week, the London-listed miner's shares were changing hands for just under \u00a322 each, valuing it at just under \u00a329bn.\n\nBHP's offer was for just \u00a325 per share - well below the \u00a330 one person at a top 20 Anglo shareholder says would need to be on the table.\n\nOn Thursday, there were also signs that Anglo's biggest shareholder - South Africa's state-owned Public Investment Corporation - was lining up against a deal.\n\nGwede Mantashe, the South African mineral resources minister, said he was against a tie-up because his country's past experience with BHP was \"not positive\", the Financial Times reported.\n\nThe deal may also become the victim of a regulatory probe, coming so close to South African elections late next month, notes the insider at the top 20 shareholder.\n\n\"South Africa won't like it,\" the person adds. \"Anglo is behind a lot of South Africa jobs.\n\n\"There's risk attached.\"\n\nBut ultimately it may all come down to price - and responsibility for getting a good deal falls to Anglo chairman Stuart Chambers and the rest of the company's board.\n\nWithin the City, Chambers, a veteran operator who was previously chairman Travis Perkin, is perhaps best known as the man who sold the UK's then-largest technology company, Arm Holdings, to Japan's Softbank in 2016.\n\nBut in Henry, he will be up against a chief executive who has repeatedly vowed not to overpay for acquisitions following a troubled history of takeovers at BHP.\n\nOver the past four years he has consolidated BHP's structure in Australia, delisting it from London, selling off fossil fuel assets including coal and oil and gas operations and buying into minerals that he has argued will be central to the net zero transition.\n\nThe chief executive expanded his company's copper and nickel assets with a takeover of OZ Minerals in 2022 but played it cool publicly, insisting OZ was \"not a must-have\" after making an initial offer of A$8.3bn (\u00a34.3bn). He subsequently sealed the deal by upping his bid to A$9.6bn.\n\nThe \u00a331bn takeover would mark the largest UK takeover this year, dwarfing the \u00a35.5bn takeover of paper maker DS Smith. It will provide a golden opportunity for bankers in the City.\n\nBHP has hired UBS and Barclays - two European banks - to help in its pursuit while Anglo has turned to Wall Street titans Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley plus boutique investment bank Centerview Partners to defend itself.\n\nMark Sorrell, son of former WPP chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell, is advising Anglo on the deal on behalf of Goldman. It marks his third major bid defence this year after helping Direct Line against Belgian insurer Ageas and Royal Mail owner International Distribution Services in the fight with billionaire investor Daniel Kretinsky.\n\nAmong the other notable names, Morgan Stanley's top dealmaker Simon Smith, who recently gave evidence in the bank's High Court battle with Mike Ashley, is also working alongside Mr Sorrell for Anglo.\n\nOwing to the hard-charging personalities involved, mining deals often have an added sense of drama when push comes to shove.\n\nGlencore's \u00a354bn takeover of Xstrata, the industry's last major takeover in 2012, led to a high stakes battle between Glencore's Ivan Glasenberg and the Xstrata's Qatari shareholders over price.\n\nAfter the deal threatened to collapse, former prime minister Tony Blair was drafted in to broker a midnight peace deal between the two sides at a discrete meeting at London's luxury hotel Claridges.\n\nGlencore is likely to sit this one out, industry observers believe, having recently spent $7bn (\u00a35.6bn) acquiring Teck Resources.\n\nYet the merger of BHP and Anglo could yet trigger a wave of industry dealmaking as competitors look to keep up or grab some of the businesses left over.\n\nOne question in particular is whether BHP will have any interest in retaining Anglo's controversial Woodsmith mine, a major potash project in the north of England.\n\nThe group was planning to spend $1bn per year between 2024 and 2027 getting the mine ready for production.\n\nNow, everything suddenly seems in flux, says an industry colleague. \"Everyone is going to be watching this space very carefully,\" they add.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Anglo issued a statement around 2300 GMT saying it had received an approach from BHP.\n\nThe late bounce before the bid proposal was revealed, which if successful would forge the world's biggest copper miner, contrasted with modest share price gains of between 0.2-0.5% at Anglo's peers Rio Tinto (LON:RIO), Glencore (LON:GLEN) and Antofagasta (LON:ANTO) in the 35 minutes before the London market closed.\n\n\"This spike in Anglo's share price before the public announcement of the BHP bid raises questions about the integrity of the UK's markets which the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) are likely to want to investigate,\" said Harvey Knight, head of the financial services regulatory group at law firm Withers LLP.\n\nBritain's FCA does not typically comment on individual trading irregularities which it investigates and declined to comment on whether it would review the activity.\n\nIn a statement emailed to Reuters, the regulator said it \"cannot comment on individual cases\".\n\nA spokesperson for Anglo American declined to comment when asked whether the company had contacted the FCA about any potential irregular trading or whether the regulator had been in touch.\n\n\"The price spiked significantly.

But despite usually having enough copper to wire an industrial city and diamonds to propose a million times over, Anglo was forced to cap production a few months back due to operational hiccups. Add in the threats facing the diamond market from lab-made rivals, and Anglo's share price steadily declined last year. That was BHP's cue to table a \u00a331.1 billion ($38.8 billion) offer - 14% higher than Anglo's valuation from before the announcement. Mind you, the dotted line is far from signed: the news could attract rival bidders, and governments might take issue with one entity controlling a tenth of the world's copper.\n\nThat deal would make BHP the world's biggest copper producer, and it's the perfect time to hold that title. The metal is essential for renewable energy projects, so now that governments and companies are switching from fossil fuels, miners are dialing up their copper plans. They haven't caught up with demand yet, though: supply is still too low, and without any sign of a sudden influx, copper's price could hit the roof.\n\nThe bigger picture: The bare commodities.\n\nThe energy transition, escalating geopolitical tensions, and demographic shifts are creating unpredictable and lasting change in the global economy - not least by nudging inflation and, in turn, interest rates upward. So with no guarantee that yesteryear's investments can hold up in tomorrow's world, investors might want to scope out commodities. They often see their prices rise as inflation does, so they may well pick up just as stocks and bonds let investors down.", "source": {"uri": "finimize.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Finimize"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephane_renevier@finimize.com", "name": "St\u00e9phane Renevier", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BHP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo_American_plc", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anglo American plc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diamond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Beers", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "De Beers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_transition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Energy transition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Mineral_Exploration_and_Extraction", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Mineral Exploration and Extraction", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Associations", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Mining", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Mining", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fbhp_-_25_Apr_copy.original.jpg?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=108d203e84d88ede40c31e0cd2c39f30", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9510508", "eventUri": "eng-9510508", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

However, Asian stock markets experienced a downturn, largely influenced by a decline in the tech sector, while the Japanese yen weakened, breaching a threshold that could prompt intervention. Meta's shares plunged over 15 per cent after announcing plans for increased spending on artificial intelligence. Oil prices eased due to concerns about US demand, despite ongoing tensions in the Middle East. Gold prices remained steady as market focus shifted towards upcoming US economic data. BHP made a significant move by proposing a takeover of Anglo American. Thursday's attention will be on the initial reading of US GDP growth for the first quarter, with investors closely monitoring tech giants such as Alphabet, Microsoft, and Intel, all scheduled to report earnings later in the day. Here are five key takeaways for your day.\n\nYen dips below \u00a5155 against US dollar, raising intervention concerns\n\nThe Japanese yen reached a milestone not seen since 1990, surpassing the \u00a5155 mark against the US dollar. This reflects its ongoing decline amidst the resilience of the US economy, despite increased borrowing costs. Conversely, the dollar saw a slight uptick of 0.1 per cent against a basket of six major currencies.\n\nSpeculation was rife about potential intervention by Japanese authorities to bolster the yen, which had hindered the dollar's progress toward the psychologically significant \u00a5155 level. Some market participants view this level as a trigger point that might prompt action from Tokyo.\n\nThis breach of the \u00a5155 yen level coincides with the Bank of Japan (BOJ) meeting to deliberate on monetary policy. However, expectations are that the central bank will maintain its short-term interest rate target unchanged, following its significant departure from negative rates last month.\n\nMeta stock tumbles 15 per cent on increased AI spending; revenue guidance disappoints\n\nShares of Meta, the US tech giant known for Facebook and Instagram, took a hit despite reporting earnings that exceeded predictions. The company indicated a significant increase in expenses for the year ahead, particularly in AI investments, leading to a more than 15 per cent drop in its stock price to $418.85 in after-hours trading.\n\nMeta's updated forecast for 2024 suggests it will spend billions more than previously anticipated. Looking ahead to April-June revenue, Meta expects to generate between $36.5 billion and $39 billion, with a midpoint of $37.8 billion. However, this projection falls short of analysts' expectations of $38.3 billion, as reported by Reuters.\n\nBHP unveils proposal for Anglo American takeover\n\nBHP has proposed a takeover bid for Anglo American, which could become one of the largest deals in the mining sector in recent years, bringing together two major players in the industry.\n\nThe offer suggests a merger between BHP, the world's largest mining company, and Anglo American, a company with a 107-year history. This move is aimed at expanding BHP's copper mining portfolio, a crucial metal in the transition towards renewable energy, as indicated by insiders familiar with the situation, the FT reported.\n\nAnglo American has acknowledged receiving the proposal from BHP, describing it as \"unsolicited, non-binding, and highly conditional.\" However, the company has emphasized that there's no certainty regarding the potential offer, including the terms on which it might be presented.\n\nWhat's on the radar\n\nInvestors are eagerly awaiting earnings reports from major players across different industries, with a keen eye on tech giants like Intel, Microsoft, and Alphabet. Microsoft's performance holds particular interest due to its significant involvement in the AI and cloud computing sectors. Companies such as Southwest Airlines, Merck&Co, T-Mobile US, and Honeywell are also under the spotlight.\n\nAcross the pond in the UK, attention is focused on AstraZeneca, London Stock Exchange, Unilever, and Barclays.\n\nApart from corporate earnings, investors are closely monitoring economic indicators. This includes the release of first-quarter US gross domestic product (GDP) data, expected on Thursday, and personal consumption expenditures for March, which serve as the Fed's preferred measure of inflation. Economists predict a growth rate of 2.5 per cent for US Q1 2024 GDP, compared to a 3.4 per cent increase in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nAdditionally, there's anticipation surrounding the publication of weekly jobless claims figures and foreign trade and pending home sales data for March.\n\nAsian equities take hit as Meta news triggers tech sell-off\n\nThe S&P 500 made a tiny gain, ending at 5,071.68 points, while the Nasdaq Composite edged up to 15,712.75. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped to 38,462.33.\n\nBoeing's shares declined after reporting its first revenue drop in seven quarters, even though it exceeded analyst predictions. On the flip side, Tesla saw a significant jump of over 10 per cent as investors responded positively to its plans for ramping up production and introducing more affordable models, which overshadowed its less-than-stellar quarterly performance.\n\nIn Asia, a sell-off in tech stocks had a significant impact, with Japan's Nikkei N225 plummeting nearly 2 per cent, and Chinese stocks, including the CSI300 index, also taking a hit, alongside a 0.5 per cent dip in Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index.\n\nTurning to commodities, oil prices experienced a slight increase as concerns about a potential economic slowdown in the US outweighed fears of escalating tensions in the Middle East. US crude saw a marginal increase to $82.86 per barrel, while Brent reached $88.11, up 0.10 per cent for the day.\n\nMeanwhile, spot gold saw a rise of 0.22 per cent to $2,320.99 per ounce.", "source":

South African state asset manager the Public Investment Corporation, which holds about 7% of Anglo's shares, said it was assessing BHP's bid \"to ensure value creation\" in a critical part of the economy.\n\nSouth Africa's government is scrutinising BHP Group's proposed deal to buy Anglo American, a spokesperson said, with the deal likely to concern officials the coming weeks before a general election where the governing party's majority is at risk. The deal worth about $39 billion would involve Anglo exiting its platinum and iron ore assets in South Africa.\n\nIt could trigger large capital outflows and further dent the country's reputation as a destination for mining investment. Anglo's potential exit would mark the end of an era for a company founded in Johannesburg over a century ago.\n\nSouth African miners have been cutting thousands of jobs, curbing investments and paying much less tax in response to weakening metals prices and a myriad of local challenges including a crisis at the state port and freight rail company. Stagnant economic growth and high unemployment are hot-button issues in the lead-up to the May 29 election, where polls suggest the African National Congress could lose its parliamentary majority for the first time since the end of apartheid.\n\nThe government will take guidance from a regulatory unit in the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE) before taking a position on BHP's bid, a DMRE spokesperson said. In comments to the Financial Times, South Africa's mining minister Gwede Mantashe said he was personally wary of BHP's proposal as the country's previous experience with BHP was \"not positive\". He did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.\n\nEND OF AN ERA? Founded by gold and diamond baron Ernest Oppenheimer at the peak of the World War One in 1917, Anglo American has been synonymous with South African mining for decades and helped lay the foundation for the country's industrial growth.\n\nIt employs roughly 45,000 people in South Africa, though its platinum unit Anglo American Platinum has announced plans to cut 3,700 jobs while another unit, Kumba Iron Ore , plans 490 job cuts. BHP's proposal is not yet a formal offer, and two sources told Reuters that Anglo's management does not consider it attractive.\n\nUnbundling Anglo's platinum and iron ore assets in South Africa could cause capital outflows because investors who hold Anglo's stock because of its diversified portfolio may choose to exit the unbundled assets. As well as its mines in South Africa, Anglo also owns platinum assets in Zimbabwe and diamond mines in Botswana and Namibia via its De Beers unit.\n\nSouth African state asset manager the Public Investment Corporation, which holds about 7% of Anglo's shares, said it was assessing BHP's bid \"to ensure value creation\" in a critical part of the economy. The bid will also be studied by South African competition authorities.\n\nAmong other issues, the competition watchdog requires companies to set out how they plan to maintain Black participation in firms, including through equity stakes, and aim to prevent job losses. When the world's largest brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev gained conditional approval for its $100 billion-plus acquisition of South Africa's SABMiller, it was prohibited from laying off any South African employees as a result of the merger, a condition which was required to endure in perpetuity.\n\n(Additional reporting by Nqobile Dludla and Bhargav Acharya; Writing by Alexander Winning and Olivia

for Anglo weeks before election", "body": "By Nelson Banya and Felix Njini\n\nApril 25 (Reuters) - South Africa's government is scrutinizing BHP Group's proposed deal to buy Anglo American, a spokesperson said, with the deal likely to concern officials the coming weeks before a general election where the governing party's majority is at risk.\n\nThe deal worth about $39 billion would involve Anglo exiting its platinum and iron ore assets in South Africa.\n\nIt could trigger large capital outflows and further dent the country's reputation as a destination for mining investment.\n\nAnglo's potential exit would mark the end of an era for a company founded in Johannesburg over a century ago.\n\nSouth African miners have been cutting thousands of jobs, curbing investments and paying much less tax in response to weakening metals prices and a myriad of local challenges including a crisis at the state port and freight rail company.\n\nStagnant economic growth and high unemployment are hot-button issues in the lead-up to the May 29 election, where polls suggest the African National Congress could lose its parliamentary majority for the first time since the end of apartheid.\n\nThe government will take guidance from a regulatory unit in the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE) before taking a position on BHP's bid, a DMRE spokesperson said.\n\nIn comments to the Financial Times, South Africa's mining minister Gwede Mantashe said he was personally wary of BHP's proposal as the country's previous experience with BHP was \"not positive.\" He did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.\n\nEND OF AN ERA?\n\nFounded by gold and diamond baron Ernest Oppenheimer at the peak of the World War One in 1917, Anglo American has been synonymous with South African mining for decades and helped lay the foundation for the country's industrial growth.\n\nIt employs roughly 45,000 people in South Africa, though its platinum unit Anglo American Platinum has announced plans to cut 3,700 jobs while another unit, Kumba Iron Ore , plans 490 job cuts.\n\nBHP's proposal is not yet a formal offer, and two sources told Reuters that Anglo's management does not consider it attractive.\n\nUnbundling Anglo's platinum and iron ore assets in South Africa could cause capital outflows because investors who hold Anglo's stock because of its diversified portfolio may choose to exit the unbundled assets.\n\nAs well as its mines in South Africa, Anglo also owns platinum assets in Zimbabwe and diamond mines in Botswana and Namibia via its De Beers unit.\n\nSouth African state asset manager the Public Investment Corporation, which holds about 7% of Anglo's shares, said it was assessing BHP's bid \"to ensure value creation\" in a critical part of the economy.\n\nThe bid will also be studied by South African competition authorities.\n\nAmong other issues, the competition watchdog requires companies to set out how they plan to maintain Black participation in firms, including through equity stakes, and aim to prevent job losses.\n\nWhen the world's largest brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev gained conditional approval for its $100 billion-plus acquisition of South Africa's SABMiller, it was prohibited from laying off any South African employees as a result of the merger, a condition which was required to endure in perpetuity.\n\n(Additional reporting by Nqobile Dludla and Bhargav Acharya; Writing by Alexander Winning and Olivia Kumwenda-Mtambo; Editing by Silvia Aloisi and David Evans)", "source": {"uri":

Anglo issued a statement around 2300 GMT saying it had received an approach from BHP.\n\nThe late bounce before the bid proposal was revealed, which if successful would forge the world's biggest copper miner, contrasted with modest share price gains of between 0.2-0.5% at Anglo's peers Rio Tinto, Glencore and Antofagasta in the 35 minutes before the London market closed.\n\n\"This spike in Anglo's share price before the public announcement of the BHP bid raises questions about the integrity of the UK's markets which the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) are likely to want to investigate,\" said Harvey Knight, head of the financial services regulatory group at law firm Withers LLP.\n\nBritain's FCA does not typically comment on individual trading irregularities which it investigates and declined to comment on whether it would review the activity.\n\nIn a statement emailed to Reuters, the regulator said it \"cannot comment on individual cases\".\n\nA spokesperson for Anglo American declined to comment when asked whether the company had contacted the FCA about any potential irregular trading or whether the regulator had been in touch.\n\n\"The price spiked significantly. Someone was either very lucky or very knowledgeable,\" said Richard Bernstein, chief investment officer of activist investor Crystal Amber.\n\nShares in miners like Anglo can move sharply following changes in commodity prices, or major currencies like sterling and the U.S. dollar.\n\nRegulated companies and individuals in Britain have an obligation to detect and report suspicious trading if there are reasonable grounds to suspect market abuse, such as insider dealing or market manipulation.\n\n\"Between private chat networks, secure texting apps, and even burner phones, there are many more ways for material, non-public information to be shared via undetected means than there ever were previously,\" Peter C. Earle, Senior Economist, The American Institute for Economic Research, told Reuters.\n\n\"The financial markets are in an information dissemination arms race.

Leaders like BHP Group, IBM, and Blackstone are engaging in transformative deals, each aimed at bolstering market influence and broadening operational boundaries.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nThese mergers and acquisitions underscore a strong interest in diversifying investments across vital sectors. For example, BHP Group's proposed $38.8 billion purchase of Anglo American could create the largest copper miner globally, aligning with copper's escalating importance in technology and electric vehicles. On another front, IBM's $6.4 billion bid for HashiCorp highlights a push to magnify cloud and AI capabilities to meet accelerating tech demands. Each transaction sheds light on industry trends, from music copyright profitability in the Hipgnosis Songs Fund battle to growth in Eastern European energy and Southeast Asian telecommunications.\n\nThese acquisitions not only reshape the firms involved but also send waves through markets impacting stock valuations, competition, and innovation.

Terms of the offer were not disclosed, though Anglo, valued at \u00a329 billion, said the deal would require the demergers of its platinum and iron ore businesses.\n\nAnglo called it an \"unsolicited, non-binding and highly conditional\" all-share buyout proposal.\n\nThe London Stock Exchange Group used a trading update to tout the benefits of the capital markets and data group's partnership with Microsoft.\n\nChief executive David Schwimmer noted \"strong progress in our Microsoft partnership, with a number of products expected to be in external pilot or general release this half\".\n\nLSEG shares, however, didn't join the party, instead dipping 0.3%.\n\nHousebuilder Persimmon saw new home completions fall slightly in the first quarter on a year-to-year comparison, though this was in line with expectations. Shares were up 0.8%, buoyed by a forward order book up 18%.\n\nOn the macroeconomic front, UK car production presented some fairly glum figures.\n\nYear-on-year production declined 27.1% to 59,467 units in March 2024, breaking six consecutive months of growth.\n\nBut that was a sideshow to the string of quality earnings prints, leading the FTSE 100 to add 40 points to 8,080 at the time of writing. This is just seven points off the all-time high achieved yesterday.\n\n8.28am: Stocks bounce higher\n\nThe FTSE 100 bounced higher in early exchanges despite opening flat at 8am.\n\nAt the time of writing, the blue-chip index was up 38 points to 8,078, nearing yesterday's all-time high.\n\nA robust set of results from FTSE 100 constituents has supported the market.\n\nTop morning risers include Anglo American (thanks to a shock bid from BHP), AstraZeneca, Unilever and Barclays.\n\n8.18am: LSEG pushes forward with Microsoft partnership\n\nCapital markets and data company London Stock Exchange Group PLC (LSE:LSEG) touted the benefits of the group's partnership with Microsoft in a Thursday trading update.\n\nChief executive David Schwimmer noted \"strong progress in our Microsoft partnership, with a number of products expected to be in external pilot or general release this half\".\n\n\"We are now picking up the pace of migrating our datasets onto the Microsoft platform, which will transform access to our data for customers. We look forward to further progress in the rest of the year,\" he added.\n\nTotal income in the first quarter grew 6.4% on an organic basis, or 7.3% when including the effects of M&A.\n\nLSEG completed \u00a3500 million in share buybacks in the first quarter and is targeting a full \u00a31 billion for the whole year.\n\nEquities returned to growth in the quarter and were up 1.6%, with gains in secondary trading partly offset by lower market activity.\n\nShares were trading flat in early exchanges.\n\n8.10am: Anglo receives 'unsolicited' offer from BHP\n\nAnglo American PLC (LSE:AAL) has confirmed a shock bid approach from BHP Ltd.\n\nTerms of the offer were not disclosed, though Anglo, valued at \u00a329 billion, said the deal would require the demergers of its platinum and iron ore businesses.\n\nAnglo called it an \"unsolicited, non-binding and highly conditional\" all-share buyout proposal.\n\n\"The board is currently reviewing this proposal with its advisers,\" investors were told, as it cautioned: \"There can be no certainty that any offer will be made nor as to the terms on which any such offer might be made.\"\n\nUnder takeover rules, BHP, which is valued at just shy of \u00a3120 billion, has until 5pm on May 22 to lodge a formal offer.\n\nIf it goes ahead, the deal would be the biggest transaction in the sector since Glencore and Xstrata's \u00a343 billion merger 11 years ago.\n\n7.59am: AstraZeneca results tick the boxes\n\nBritain's leading pharmaceuticals company AstraZeneca PLC (LSE:AZN) hit the mark in today's first-quarter earnings print.\n\nTotal revenue increased by 19% at constant exchange rates to $12.7 billion, driven by an 18% increase in product sales.\n\nThis trickled down to a 22% year-on-year increase in operating profits to $3.1 billion and a 13% increase in earnings per share to \u00a32.06.\n\nAstraZeneca's suite of oncology products was the top performer, with sales adding 26% year on year.\n\nNotable developments in the quarter included positive trial results for Imfinzi and Tagrisso in lung cancer, and several US and EU approvals for other drugs.\n\nAstraZeneca reiterated its full-year guidance of low double-digit to low teens percentage growth in both total revenues and EPS.\n\nThe group said the total dividend for the year will increase by $0.20 per share to $3.10.\n\nChief executive Pascal Soriot, whose executive remuneration has been a matter of hot debate, called it \"a very strong start in 2024\".\n\n\"Our strong pipeline momentum continued and already this year we announced positive trial results for Imfinzi and Tagrisso that were unprecedented in lung cancer, the data from both of these studies will be presented during the ASCO plenary in June.\n\n\"We are also looking forward to seeing the results of several other important trials throughout the year.\"\n\n7.32am: Barclays faces mortgage margin pressure in robust first-quarter results.\n\nBarclays posted an expectedly robust set of first-quarter results today, though mortgage pressures were evidently the fly in the ointment.\n\nFirm-wide net interest income came to \u00a31.55 billion, representing a year-on-year decrease of around 4%, while profit before tax for the group was \u00a32.27 billion, down from \u00a32.6 million last year.\n\n\"Continued structural hedge momentum was more than offset by mortgage margin pressure and adverse deposit dynamics reflecting wider market trends,\" said Barclays.\n\nNet interest margins in the UK consumer division were 3.09% compared to 3.2% in the first quarter of 2023. The UK corporate banking divisions saw NIMs fall 10 basis points to a flat 5%, while private banking and wealth management fell 11 basis points to 5.07%.\n\nFirm-wide CET1 capital stood at a healthy 13.5%. Return on tangible equity (RoTE) was down from 15% to 12.3%.\n\nBarclays does not expect to increase its total dividend for the year, instead emphasising share buybacks to support shareholder returns. \u00a310 billion is expected to be returned to shareholders by end-on-play 2026.\n\n7.09am: FTSE 100 seen flat in pre market\n\nFutures contracts have the footsie opening a couple of points lower at 8,033 when markets open today.\n\nLondon's blue-chip index closed 4.43 points lower at 8,040.38, despite spending most of the day at a record high, with Bank of England chief economist Huw Pill's warning that interest rate cuts could be some ways off spoiling the party.\n\nOn today's macroeconomic calendar, UK car production presented some fairly glum figures.\n\nYear-on-year production declined 27.1% to 59,467 units in March 2024, breaking six consecutive months of growth.\n\nExports plunged 35.9% to 39,472 units, though this accounted for at least two thirds of total production.\n\nA big day for company updates is afoot, with AstraZeneca, LSEG, Unilever, Barclays, Sainsbury's and WPP all expected to report.", "source": {"uri": "proactiveinvestors.co.uk",

If higher prices persist, the Fed will find it hard to cut rates to support growth.\"\n\nAlmost $200bn wiped of Meta's value\n\nAdding pressure on Thursday was a near 14% drop in Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META, ETR:FB2A, SWX:FB)'s share price after a first-quarter trading update on Wednesday evening disappointed.\n\nThis equated to almost US$200 billion lost from Meta's market cap, as investors appeared to flee over higher-than-expected spending on artificial intelligence and full-year guidance...

The ZEV mandate is [forcing] carmakers to have a growing EV sales mix every year,\" he said in a briefing on Thursday.\n\n\"The problem is the natural demand of the market today in the UK on EVs is half of the mandate.\"\n\nUnder the mandate, carmakers are required to ensure an increasing proportion of annual their sales are electric cars, stretching to 80% by 2030 and 100% by 2035.\n\nTavares said he had urged the government to scale back the rules in a meeting on Wednesday, with Telegraph-cited sources suggesting Stellantis may restrict UK sales.\n\n\"If your mandate is imposing on you a level of [...] sales mix that is double the natural demand of the market, and if the ZEV mandate puts me in a corner by saying, 'if you don't meet this, I'm going to kill you with fines', the consequence is that everybody will start pushing the BEV, which then totally destroys profitability,\" he added.\n\n\"You would not expect Stellantis to support a red ink business.\"\n\n1.05pm: Housebuilders climb after Persimmon sees orders pick up\n\nHousebuilders enjoyed gains on Thursday after Persimmon PLC (LSE:PSN) reported an increase in first quarter sales and indicated improving conditions ahead.\n\n\"Trading over recent weeks has been encouraging,\" chief executive Dean Finch had said, \"giving us confidence for the remainder of the year\".\n\nThis came as the housebuilder reported an 18% uptick in its forward order book, after prices improved over the first three months of the year but completions still fell...

analyst\n\nJ Sainsbury PLC (LSE:SBRY)'s results appeared to be overshadowed by a fall in general merchandise sales over the course of last year, analysts have pointed out.\n\nFTSE 100-listed Sainsbury's had said underlying profit would top \u00a31 billion this year as it hailed progress in its strategic shift toward prioritising grocery sales.\n\nHowever, shares fell 1.1% on the update, which showed pre-tax profit grew 1.6% to \u00a3701 million on stronger grocery sales, as general merchandise and clothing revenue fell 0.5% and 6.4% respectively.\n\n\"Despite the positivity, Sainsbury's does carry much higher exposure to general merchandise, which isn't faring so well,\" Hargreaves Lansdown's Sophie Lund-Yates said.\n\nThis includes through the likes of Argos, and the supermarket's clothing and homeware brands, Tu and Habitat.\n\nLund-Yates added sales had been downtrodden \"partly because of where we are on the economic merry-go-round,\" but may also have partly reflected \"specific stocking decisions\".\n\n9.08am: WH Smith falls as high street struggle eats into profit\n\nWH Smith PLC (LSE:SMWH) fell 7.8% on Thursday morning after unveiling a fall in interim operating profit.\n\nGroup pre-tax profit fell from \u00a345 million to \u00a328 million in the six months to February, the retailer announced on Thursday.\n\nThis was in spite of an 8% jump in revenue to \u00a3926 million, fueled by a 13% increase from WH Smith's travel business, which has shops in the likes of airports and train stations.\n\nTravel profit climbed 6% to \u00a350 million, but fell 8% to \u00a322 million in WH Smith's high street business as revenue declined.\n\n\"The struggle on the high street is likely to persist, with our experts forecasting continued decreases in like-for-like sales,\" Third Bridge analyst Yanmei Tang commented...

Terms of the offer were not disclosed, though Anglo, valued at \u00a329 billion, said the deal would require the demergers of its platinum and iron ore businesses.\n\nAnglo called it an \"unsolicited, non-binding and highly conditional\" all-share buyout proposal.\n\nThe London Stock Exchange Group used a trading update to tout the benefits of the capital markets and data group's partnership with Microsoft.\n\nChief executive David Schwimmer noted \"strong progress in our Microsoft partnership, with a number of products expected to be in external pilot or general release this half\".\n\nLSEG shares, however, didn't join the party, instead dipping 0.3%.\n\nHousebuilder Persimmon saw new home completions fall slightly in the first quarter on a year-to-year comparison, though this was in line with expectations. Shares were up 0.8%, buoyed by a forward order book up 18%.\n\nOn the macroeconomic front, UK car production presented some fairly glum figures.\n\nYear-on-year production declined 27.1% to 59,467 units in March 2024, breaking six consecutive months of growth.\n\nBut that was a sideshow to the string of quality earnings prints, leading the FTSE 100 to add 40 points to 8,080 at the time of writing.

The UK corporate banking divisions saw NIMs fall 10 basis points to a flat 5%, while private banking and wealth management fell 11 basis points to 5.07%.\n\nFirm-wide CET1 capital stood at a healthy 13.5%. Return on tangible equity (RoTE) was down from 15% to 12.3%.\n\nBarclays does not expect to increase its total dividend for the year, instead emphasising share buybacks to support shareholder returns.

8,033 when markets open today.\n\nLondon's blue-chip index closed 4.43 points lower at 8,040.38, despite spending most of the day at a record high, with Bank of England chief economist Huw Pill's warning that interest rate cuts could be some ways off spoiling the party.\n\nOn today's macroeconomic calendar, UK car production presented some fairly glum figures.\n\nYear-on-year production declined 27.1% to 59,467 units in March 2024, breaking six consecutive months of growth.\n\nExports plunged 35.9% to 39,472 units, though this accounted for at least two thirds of total

This is likely a key driving force behind BHP's offer as copper prices have surged more than 17% since the start of the year and it could rise further, driven by a surge in demand for the metal. Copper is a key material used in the manufacturing of electric vehicles and renewable energy devices like wind turbines, and its demand is expected to rise sharply amid a push for cleaner energy.\n\nThursday's offer is BHP's second major acquisition in the past year after it acquired Australian mining firm OZ Minerals in a $6.27 billion (A$9.6 billion) deal last year.

She is an award-winning financial journalist who has worked in London, where she is currently based, and Hong Kong. She previously worked at The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg.\n\nShares of Meta Platforms (META) are plunging in premarket trading after the Facebook parent unnerved investors wary of its artificial intelligence (AI) spending plans; AI spending is the dominant theme uniting the three megatech firms -- Microsoft (MSFT), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), and Intel (INTC) -- reporting after the closing bell, while shares of IBM (IBM) are stumbling after the tech firm issued disappointing quarterly sales and said it will acquire cloud software maker HashiCorp (HCP) for $6.4 billion; Comcast (CMCSA) posted an earnings beat on a jump in Peacock subscribers; GE Vernova (GEV) results came up shy of forecasts in the company's debut quarterly report; and mining giant BHP Group (BHP) is offering to buy rival Anglo American in a megadeal that is betting on copper's continued gains. Stock futures were pointing lower as investors awaited the flurry of earnings reports as well the latest reading on U.S. economic growth, with the first-quarter GDP report set for release at 8:30 a.m. ET. Here's what investors need to know today.\n\nShares of Meta Platforms (META) were down 15% in premarket trading after the Facebook parent provided weak revenue guidance and announced plans to increase spending -- news that sent the company's shares sharply lower despite better-than-expected quarterly results. Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Mark Zuckerberg joined company executives on an earnings call that focused on artificial intelligence (AI), saying investment in the technology is necessary to \"stay at the leading edge of this.\" The company said it had raised its capital expenditures guidance for 2024 to between $35 billion and $40 billion, up from between $30 billion and $37 billion, due to \"infrastructure investments to support our artificial intelligence (AI) roadmap.\" The stock slump marks a stark contrast from Meta's last quarterly results, when plans for its first dividend lifted shares.\n\nAI costs -- especially after Meta's spending spree -- will be the dominant theme uniting the three megatech firms reporting quarterly results after the bell today: Microsoft (MSFT), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), and Intel (INTC). Investors will likely be watching Microsoft's cloud segment growth and AI updates from its OpenAI partner when the company issues its fiscal third-quarter results. Alphabet's first-quarter results are set to show year-over-year revenue and profit gains, with investors focused on whether the tech giant can sustain growth in its Google Cloud business as well as watching for updates on its in-house custom chip as hyperscalers reduce their reliance on Nvidia (NVDA). Intel, also posting first-quarter earnings, will be watched for updates on its foundry business and whether it can record revenue growth in its data center and AI operations. Meanwhile, shares of IBM (IBM) were down 9% in premarket trading after the computing and consulting giant confirmed late Wednesday it will acquire cloud software maker HashiCorp (HCP) for $6.4 billion and posted quarterly revenue that came in short of Wall Street expectations.\n\nComcast (CMCSA) reported higher-than-forecast quarterly earnings, registering a 55% year-over-year jump in paid subscribers to its Peacock streaming service during the period. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.04, up from 92 cents the same period last year, and beating expectations of 98 cents a share. Comcast added a net 3 million subscribers to Peacock in the first quarter, ending the period with 34 million. Revenue during the quarter rose 1.2% to $30.06 billion, topping analyst estimates of $29.87 billion. The company said it began showing \"Oppenheimer\" exclusively on Peacock in February and it was the most-watched paid movie in the streamer's history. Shares were down less than 1% about 90 minutes before the opening bell.\n\nGE Vernova (GEV) shares were off nearly 2% in premarket trading after the recently spun-off energy division of conglomerate General Electric posted debut quarterly results that were included earlier in GE Aerospace's (GE) report. The wind-turbine maker reported a 6% year-over-year revenue rise to $7.3 billion, and a narrowing of its adjusted loss per share to 41 cents from $1.25 a share the same period last year, with both top- and bottom-line earnings missing analysts' forecasts. GE Aerospace reported its first quarterly results earlier this week, with those numbers including GE Vernova figures.\n\nMining giant BHP Group (BHP) has offered to buy rival Anglo American, which has a market capitalization of about $35 billion, in one of the industry's largest transactions in years. In a deal that could reshape global mining, Anglo American said Thursday it had received an all-share offer from BHP, contingent upon it spinning off shareholdings in two South Africa-listed units, Anglo American Platinum and Kumba Iron Ore. The deal would bring together two of the industry's largest miners at a time of soaring copper demand for renewable energy projects and electric vehicles as the world moves away from fossil fuels. Copper reportedly represents some 30% of Anglo American's output before selling off the platinum and iron ore units as proposed by BHP, while BHP counts a majority stake in Chile's Escondida, the world's biggest copper mine, among its assets. BHP shares traded in New York were down about 2.5% in premarket trading.", "source": {"uri": "investopedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investopedia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

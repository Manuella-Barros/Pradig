Frank Kulesa, chief of response operations for the northern New England sector of the Coast Guard, said he's unsure how much oil has been released from the vessel.\n\nPamela Manns, a lieutenant with the Coast Guard, said it's important to remove the boat immediately to prevent more pollution.\n\n\"Look at this beautiful, pristine coast,\" Mann said. \"The Coast Guard is dedicated to keeping the Maine coastline pristine for everybody's use.\"\n\nTwo booms have surrounded the vessel since January -- one with plastic curtains sectioning the area off, and another one that absorbs any sheened oil.\n\nKulesa said the money for removing the boat comes from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, which provides the Coast Guard with the funds to remove abandoned vessels. The cost to remove the Jacob Pike could come to $300,000 and will be passed onto Cleary, Kulesa said.\n\n\"Ultimately, our job is just to use that fund to remove the threats from the environment,\" Kulsea said.", "source": {"uri": "bangordailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangor Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jules_walkup@bangordailynews.com", "name": "Jules Walkup", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Coast Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpswell,_Maine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harpswell, Maine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harpswell, Maine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_town", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sardine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_vessel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fishing vessel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stern"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Portland,_Maine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Portland, Maine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Portland, Maine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Watercraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Watercraft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://bdn-data.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/08/240807_JMW_JacobPike_092.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802571", "eventUri": "eng-9802571", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

The wreck has been leaking fuel into the marine environment, and the Coast Guard estimates that it could contain up to 1,000 gallons of diesel.\n\nCoast Guard Sector Northern New England attempted to get the owner to take action to clean up the wreck, but found that the individual \"was unwilling or unable.\" In order to address the hazard to the environment, the Coast Guard federalized the response and tapped the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to pay for the cost of cleanup. It hired a pollution response contractor, who boomed off the vessel and pumped off 400 gallons of oily water mixture; however, the work stopped short of completion because sending a diver inside the tight confines of the vessel would be too risky. To get at the last potential sources of pollution, the wreck will have to be refloated.\n\nThe owner, identified as Cyrus Cleary, has been summoned by the town authorities on the charge of abandoning a watercraft. If found responsible, he could be fined up to 150 percent of the cost of removal. Separately, the administrators of the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund will pursue recoupment of all federal costs after the wreck removal is complete.\n\nJacob Pike was an 83-foot wooden fishing vessel built for the sardine trade. Later in life, it worked in the lobster fishery. It ceased commercial operations in 2022, and like many defunct vessels, it changed hands several times in succession. Cleary, the current owner, told the Bangor Daily News that he disagrees with the Coast Guard over the removal method and does not believe he should be responsible for the full cost, which will be in the low six figures.\n\nOperations to remove the vessel are under way. The plan is to set rigging, raise the Pike to the surface, and prepare it for a tow to its next destination.

Scott Baumgartner photo\n\nThe Coast Guard raised the battered Jacob Pike from the bottom of the New Meadows River in Harpswell on Wednesday, more than seven months after the fishing vessel sank during a brutal winter storm.\n\nThe ship was salvaged in a 20-hour operation. Divers placed a chain and six air bags beneath the stern. After the 83-foot wooden boat broke the surface, the crew began pumping water out of the vessel.\n\nMaine Department of Environmental Protection was on scene throughout the process. Although DEP staff did not collect water quality samples, they monitored the intermittent dispersal of the oil sheen.\n\nAs the boat emerged, its underbelly indicated that despite damage to the structure from months underwater, it was seaworthy enough to be towed by Determination Marine to Turner's Island for disposal.\n\nIt wasn't a one-off mission. Local, state and federal agencies have collaborated for months to come up with a plan.\n\n\"The plan was a comprehensive effort to ensure the protection of the local fishery and environment,\" said Christopher Hopper, DEP Division of Response Services director, noting there were no reports of impact on local oyster beds or marine wildlife.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday, Aug. 6, salvage crews spent about six hours staging equipment for the Wednesday operation. Lt. Pamela Manns photo\n\nWhat happened to the Jacob Pike?\n\nThe Jacob Pike, built in 1949, spent most of its life as a commercial vessel in the sardine industry. When it was found under water on Jan. 10, uninsured with expired certificates, the cause of its demise was tough to pinpoint.\n\nAccording to Coast Guard Lt. Pamela Manns, it's believed that a hatch was left open, causing the vessel to fill with water and sink. While the total amount of oil on board is unknown, the fuel tank can hold up to 1,000 gallons.\n\nAfter the vessel sank, the Coast Guard's Pollution Response Team observed significant oil sheening in the water. A Notice of Federal Interest and Administrative Orders were placed, directing the boat's owner, Cyrus Cleary, to address the pollution. When it was clear clean u\" would not occur, the Coast Guard issued a Notice of Federal Assumption and took control of the response -- monitoring the vessel, raising it to the surface and disposing of it.\n\n\"It's rare we issue a federal case,\" said Manns. \"To put things into perspective, in my 18 years of service, I've never had to do it. Our highest-ranking commandant had to sign off on approval to dip into the fund.\"\n\nThe Federal Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund is a multi-billion dollar funding source established to pay removal costs from oil spills in U.S. navigable waters. Cleary will be billed later for the response costs, which include those paid for by the fund in addition to those incurred by other agencies who dedicated personnel and equipment to the recovery effort.\n\nCoast Guard Response Department Head Frank Kulesa estimates the total costs will be around $300,000.\n\nAdvertisement Monitoring the oil\n\nEnveloping the sunken Jacob Pike vessel floats yellow containment boom, also known as \"hard boom,\" and white absorbent boom, also known as \"soft boom.\" Laura Sitterly / The Times Record\n\nThe Coast Guard hired Clean Harbors to mitigate any pollution. They placed a floating oil boom around the sunken vessel, removed 400 gallons of oily water, and extracted 11 marine batteries. Due to the risk of diver entanglement, the decision was made to fully raise the ship, prompting the Aug. 7 operation.\n\n\"This is not our first step,\" said Manns. \"We monitored the vessel through winter storms to ensure the booms held tight - to prevent a larger disaster from happening.\"\n\nManns explained there are two types of boom: hard boom, a plastic float that moves with the tide and keeps the oil from spreading, and soft boom, also known as \"sausage boom\" because of its shape, which is made out of absorbent material.\n\nHard boom prevents the outward flow of oil, and the soft boom absorbs what \"sneaks away.\" Skimmers were also used to catch what trickled past the double barrier.\n\nA team effort\n\nSince sinking, the Jacob Pike has posed an environmental threat. When Harpswell Harbormaster Paul Plummer contacted Cleary, who failed to take appropriate action, local officials pooled together to strategize.\n\n\"The Coast Guard doesn't operate in a vacuum,\" said Manns. \"We relied on the expertise of the DEP, who knows the waterway; NOAA, to inform us what species could be impacted; and the town of Harpswell.\"\n\n\"The size and scope of this project were beyond the town's capacity, so it was key to have partners at various levels of government, particularly the Coast Guard, taking the lead,\" said Harpswell Town Administrator Kristi Eiane. \"Addressing the pollution ensures the clean waters we depend on can thrive.\"\n\nManns agreed, highlighting the importance of swift, collaborative operations. \"Anytime there is oil, it's a cause for concern to the Coast Guard because we love these and want to keep them safe for everyone to enjoy,\" she said.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nComments are not available on this story.\n\nSend

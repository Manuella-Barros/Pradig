I'm excited to enjoy the remainder of the year as there are still goals I want to accomplish.\"\n\nThompson's last LPGA victory came in 2019 (ShopRite LPGA Classic). She's racked up 15 titles around the world and participated on four Solheim Cup teams.\n\nShe won her lone major, the 2014 Chevron Championship (then the Kraft Nabisco Championship) at 19 years old. At the 2017 Chevron, Thompson was infamously docked a four-stroke penalty after a home viewer reported her for improperly marking her ball. She lost in a playoff to So Yeon Ryu (much to the dismay of Tiger Woods.)\n\nShe has eight other top-3s in majors.\n\nIn 2007, as a 12-year-old, Thompson became the youngest golfer to qualify for the U.S. Women's Open. She made her first U.S. Women's Open cut two years later.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to the next chapter of my life. Time with family, friends, and my trusted companion Leo,\" Thompson said on IG. \"I will always look for ways to contribute to the sport and inspire the next generation of golfers. And of course, I look forward to a little time for myself.\"\n\nThompson has long been one of the more popular faces on the LPGA Tour. In February, she stole the show in the latest edition of Capital One's The Match, playing with Rose Zhang, Rory McIlroy, and Max Homa.\n\nThompson's 23 endorsements -- including Puma and Cobra -- are the most of any player on the LPGA Tour, and have generate millions in sponsorship money for the LPGA Tour, according to Golf.com.\n\n\"Lexi's impact extends far beyond the golf course,\" LPGA commissioner Mollie Marcoux Samaan wrote on X. \"She embodies the spirit and dedication of our founders -- always showing up and engaging intentionally to help further the growth and impact of the LPGA. She is beloved by fans, consistently seen signing autographs and interacting with them no matter the result that day.\"\n\nLast fall, Thompson accepted a sponsor exemption to the Texas Shriner's Houston Open, becoming the seventh woman to enter a PGA Tour event. She carded five birdies en route to a 2-under 69 on Friday to come within two strokes of being the first woman to make a PGA Tour cut in 80 years.\n\n\"Definitely at the top of my accomplishments,\" she said afterward.\n\nThompson, 29, is currently ranked no. 54 in the world.\n\nPlaying alonsgide Zhang and Minjee Lee, Thompson will begin her final U.S. Women's Open at 1:58 p.m. ET on Thursday at Lancaster Country Club in Lancaster, PA.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_corvo@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Michael Corvo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Women's_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Women's Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexi_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lexi Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LPGA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chevron Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ShopRite_LPGA_Classic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ShopRite LPGA Classic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryu_So-yeon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryu So-yeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solheim_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solheim Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chevron Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Zhang", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rose Zhang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Homa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Homa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minjee_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minjee Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stroke play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_Magazine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf Magazine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancaster,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lancaster, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lancaster, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Travel", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/lexi-thompason.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604941", "eventUri": "eng-9604941", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

I'm excited to enjoy the remainder of the year as there are still goals I want to accomplish. I'm looking forward to the next chapter of my life. Thime with family, friends, and my trusted companion Leo. I will always look for ways to contribute to the sport and inspire the next generation of golfers. And of course, I look forward to a little time for myself.\"\n\nRelated: Who are some of women's golf's best players of all time?\n\nDuring that 2007 U.S. Women's Open, Lexi Thompson became the youngest at the time to qualify and two years later and 14 years old, she made the cut in that event\n\nThompson, 29, won 11 events and one major, which came at the 2014 Kraft Nabisco Championship at Mission Hills Country Club in Rancho Mirage, Calif., during her 12-year LPGA Tour career.\n\nEven with only one major victory to her name and 11 victories, Thompson has provided that impact to so many. Whether it is with her swing or empowering young girls to go out and play the game, Thompson has shown how much of an influence she can be in this sport of women's professional golf.\n\nIn addition to her career wins, she is a two-time Olympian, a six-time Solheim Cup member and has become one of the game's most influential players.\n\nHer impact is comparable to some other golf legends like Lorena Ochoa and Annika Sorenstam as well as some of today's current stars such as Nelly Korda and Rose Zhang.\n\nEight months ago in October, Thompson became the seventh female ever to compete on the PGA Tour at the Shriners Children's Open in Las Vegas. Even with her 300-yard drives, she nearly made the cut that week, a feat that could even rival her major championship.\n\nWith a second round 69, Lexi Thompson became the second ever woman to break 70 in a PGA Tour event and nearly became the first woman in nearly eighth decades to make the cut at a PGA Tour event.\n\nPart of playing in that particular event was not just to show herself that she can play with men, but an opportunity to show others, especially the children in attendance at the Shriners Children's Open, that any dream can be possible.\n\n\"It's been something I grew up doing with my brothers and have wanted to do, but to also send a message out to the Shriners kids that no dream is too small, and they can go after what they want and follow their dreams,\" said Thompson in her pre-tournament press conference at the Shriners Children's Open. \"If I can leave here inspiring others, and especially the kids, the Shriners kids, that's what it's all about and what this tournament is. There is more than just playing golf.\"\n\nHaving that type of mentality has transformed people like Lexi Thompson from an LPGA Tour player to a LPGA Tour legend and a generational talent.\n\nAs Thompson prepares for her 18 U.S. Women's Open start this week, all eyes will be on her not only this week, but for the rest of the season, whether it is being in contention for a win or as December nears and the end of the season is about to conclude.", "source": {"uri": "sportsnaut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportsnaut.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "breven_honda@sportsnaut.com", "name": "Breven Honda", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexi_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lexi Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LPGA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Women's_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Women's Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_U.S._Women's_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2007 U.S. Women's Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shriners_Children's_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shriners Children's Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Kraft_Nabisco_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2014 Kraft Nabisco Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Hills_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mission Hills Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solheim_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solheim Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorena_Ochoa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lorena Ochoa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annika_S\u00f6renstam", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Annika S\u00f6renstam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rancho_Mirage,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rancho Mirage, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rancho Mirage, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Zhang", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rose Zhang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly_Korda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nelly Korda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shriners", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shriners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://sportsnaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/lexi-thompson-22063319.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604941", "eventUri": "eng-9604941", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

After the LPGA rewrote its age-requirement rules to grant her full membership, she won three events in the next two years, including the 2014 Kraft Nabisco Championship (now called the Chevron Championship) for her lone major title.\n\nIn all, Thompson has won 11 times on tour, though not since 2019.\n\n\"While these achievements are remarkable in and of themselves, Lexi's impact extends far beyond the golf course,\" LPGA commissioner Mollie Marcoux Samaan said. \"She embodies the spirit and dedication of our founders - always showing up and engaging intentionally to help further the growth and impact of the LPGA. She is beloved by fans, consistently seen signing autographs and interacting with them no matter the result that day. ... Lexi's remarkable career and the way she has conducted herself both on and off the course have inspired countless girls around the world to pursue their goals with passion and perseverance.\"\n\nAs the next wave of players began to dominate the LPGA, Thompson became known as much for her close calls as her bold, aggressive style of play. She surrendered leads at both the 2019 and 2021 U.S. Women's Open, the latter after taking a five-shot lead on the back nine on Sunday. In 2017, while in position to win her second major championship, she was penalized four strokes for incorrectly replacing her ball on the green and eventually lost in a playoff at Mission Hills. Later that year, she missed a 2-foot putt on the final green to lose the LPGA's season-ending title.\n\nA six-time Solheim Cup participant and two-time U.S. Olympian, the big-hitting Thompson remained a fixture in the top 10 of the Rolex Rankings throughout the 2010s.\n\nThompson's performance has slipped in recent years, however, and in 2023 she was in danger of losing her LPGA card before a late-season rally. This year, she is ranked 64th in the season-long standings and has four missed cuts in six starts while continuing to deal with a lingering hand injury.\n\nA popular figure on social media, Thompson took a mental and emotional break from golf in 2018, and she has prioritized her mental health in recent years. When she became the seventh woman to play in a PGA Tour event last fall, at the Shriners Children's Open, she said her lasting goal was to inspire young girls.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LPGA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Women's_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Women's Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancaster,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lancaster, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lancaster, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chevron Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Kraft_Nabisco_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2014 Kraft Nabisco Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shriners_Children's_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shriners Children's Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_U.S._Women's_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2021 U.S. Women's Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solheim_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solheim Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolex", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rolex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stroke play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/KteF7ork7AgtP3LPTxpztA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_golf_channel_404/fd3a885d0a09ba3769841b24147bbf2d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604941", "eventUri": "eng-9604941", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

At the time she was the youngest player to ever qualify for the event and went on to set a LPGA Tour record as the youngest winner when she clinched the top prize at the Navistar LPGA Classic at 16.\n\nThe 29-year-old's career will be remembered for her powerful strokeplay, an appeal to young supporters and many sliding door moments at majors.\n\nAt 19, She won the Kraft Nabisco Championship in 2014 which would become her first and only major victory.

On Tuesday at this week's U.S. Women's Open, Thompson announced her intentions to retire at the end of this season.\n\nThompson, now 29, has fittingly never missed a U.S. Women's Open start between then and now, but she will hang up her cleats when her 14th LPGA season finishes in November. She is scheduled to conduct a press conference Tuesday afternoon from Lancaster Country Club in Lancaster, Pa.\n\nThe decision comes as a bit of a surprise given Thompson is still nine months shy of her 30th birthday, but her form has been trending in the wrong direction for much of the last year. Having spent most of her career in the top 30, she currently ranks 54th in the world and has gone nearly five years without a victory.\n\nThompson has won 11 times in her LPGA Tour career, highlighted by one major championship, the 2014 Chevron, where she leapt into Poppie's Pond at just 19 years old. Plenty of major championship contention followed but several ended in heartbreak. She infamously received a four-shot penalty at the same event in 2017 after mismarking her ball during the third round (an infraction called in from a viewer at home). She rallied into a playoff but lost to So Yeon Ryu in one of the sport's most controversial finishes. Even Tiger Woods tweeted in her support: \"Viewers at home should not be officials wearing stripes,\" Woods wrote. \"Let's go Lexi, win this thing anyway.\"\n\nDespite winning just the one major championship, Thompson has been a member of six Solheim Cup teams and has long been one of the game's most popular players, routinely making time for fans at events. She has spent a majority of her career sponsored by Puma and Cobra golf, elevating the amount of sponsorship money reaching the women's game. A recent report on women's athlete sponsorships ranks her first above any other women's golfers with a stunning 23 endorsement deals.\n\nHer impact on the sport went even further last fall when Thompson accepted a sponsor's exemption into the Shriner's Hospitals for Children Open, an event on the PGA Tour. She wasn't the first female to compete on the men's tour, but boosted ratings for the event and nearly became the second woman to make a cut in a PGA Tour event. Her five-birdie second round left her just two shots short of the cutline, but well ahead of dozens of Tour players.\n\n\"Definitely at the top,\" Thompson said afterwards, wearing a huge smile. \"Definitely at the top of my accomplishments.\"\n\nThompson's final U.S. Women's Open will begin with a 1:58 p.m. ET tee time Thursday alongside Rose Zhang and Minjee Lee.", "source": {"uri": "golf.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Women's_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Women's Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexi_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lexi Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LPGA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancaster_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lancaster Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancaster,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lancaster, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lancaster, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chevron Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryu_So-yeon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryu So-yeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chevron Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Zhang", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rose Zhang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puma_(brand)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Puma (brand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solheim_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solheim Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minjee_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minjee Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Women", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://golf.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/lexi.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604941", "eventUri": "eng-9604941", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Lexi's commitment to our partners has also been unparalleled; throughout her career, she has continually made time to engage with partners, their employees, and their clients, and truly has valued their tremendous support of women's golf.\n\n\"This dedication was exemplified last year when she was honored with our Founders Award, given to an LPGA Member who best exemplifies the spirit, ideals, and values of the LPGA through her behavior and deeds, as voted on by her peers. Lexi's remarkable career and the way she has conducted herself both on and off the course have inspired countless girls around the world to pursue their goals with passion and perseverance.\"\n\nWorld No. 1 Nelly Korda commented on Thompson's impact on the LPGA Tour.\n\n\"She's had such an amazing career,\" Korda said. \"I've gotten to be on the team with her a couple times representing our country.

She's won 11 times in her LPGA career -- including the 2014 Kraft Nabisco Championship (now the Chevron Championship) for her only major title -- but hasn't won since 2019. Still, she's remained one of the game's most popular and marketable players since she stormed onto the scene as a teen.\n\nThompson captioned her Tuesday Instagram post as a \"letter I wrote to the game of golf.\" She spoke for about 3 minutes, 40 seconds as a collage of photos from her career flickered across the screen.\n\n\"Golf, what can I say after all these years?\" Thompson began. \"You have played such an important role for the majority of my life. You welcomed me into your world at such a young age, and for that I am forever grateful.\n\n\"Though our relationship has been complicated at times, you taught me resilience, patience and the power of perseverance,\" she continued. \"You showed me the highs and lows of competing. The thrill of victory and lessons learned in defeat. I'm so grateful to you for all the amazing moments and memories you have given me.\"\n\nThompson mentioned the thrill of qualifying for her first U.S. Women's Open at age 12 and her first LPGA win at age 16. She said her major win was the proudest moment of her career, and she said she'll never forget what it felt like competing against the men at the 2023 Shriners Children's Open.\n\nShe spoke about the pride she felt representing her country at the Solheim Cup and Olympics, but she was also open and honest about the difficult aspects of the professional game and the pressure she felt.\n\n\"Although this has been an amazing journey, it hasn't always been an easy one,\" she said. \"Since I was 12 years old, my life as a golfer has been a whirlwind of constant attention, scrutiny and pressure. The cameras are always on, capturing every swing and every moment on and off the golf course. Social media never sleeps, with comments and criticisms flowing in from around the world. It can be exhausting to maintain a smile on the outside while grappling with struggles on the inside.\"\n\nThompson also thanked fans, friends, family, the LPGA Tour, her sponsors and more. She said she's looking forward to the next chapter, which means more time with her friends, family and, of course, for herself.\n\n\"While it is never easy to say goodbye,\" she concluded, \"it is indeed time.\"\n\nYou can listen to her complete message below.

Here's what you need to know:\n\nThis stat really says a lot about what Thompson was up against this week, and what she accomplished in shooting even par over two days: TPC Summerlin, the course for the Shriner's Children's Open, is playing at 7,255 yards. The LPGA event this week in Shanghai is playing at 6,518 yards. Thompson is one of the longer hitters on the LPGA Tour, but there's still a sizable gulf between her and the average PGA Tour player off the tee. That she made it up and is probably going to end up beating 40 guys is really something.\n\n\"I would say the biggest challenge was ... probably just some of the pin locations,\" Thompson told reporters. \"They tuck them very close to the edges to where you have to hit high shots and carry it and be able to stop it within two bunkers or a narrow part of the green. I would say that was the biggest part because I don't get it as far down as the guys, so I have a little bit longer of a shot. But I took my medicine and just hit to the fatter part of the green and gave myself a 25-, 30-footer and just made par on those kind of holes.\"\n\nIt even seemed like she was going to make the cut for most of the day Friday! A front-nine 34 got her into position, and then she got to 4-under for the week with birdies right after the turn. Unfortunately a wayward tee shot on the par-3 fifth (her 13th hole) cost her a stroke, and another bogey on her 17th did her in. -- Hugh Kellenberger, senior golf managing editor\n\nThompson, 28, is one of the biggest names in women's golf. She made history as the youngest to play in a U.S. Open at age 12 and by winning an LPGA tournament at 16. She has 11 LPGA wins and one major victory, the 2014 Kraft Nabisco Championship, which she won at 19.\n\nShe received an unrestricted sponsor exemption to compete in the Shriners Children's Open to become the seventh woman to compete against the men on the PGA Tour. The last woman to play in a PGA Tour event was American Brittany Lincicome at the 2018 Barbasol Championship\n\nThompson ranks No. 25 in the Rolex Rankings.

Her decision came as a surprise to many, considering Thompson is only 29 years old, and many expected her to build her career on this Tour and in the future.\n\nHowever, Thompson obviously had reasons for making such a decision.\n\nHer career has had an interesting trajectory, as she appeared at the US Women's Open at the age of just 12. Since then, 17 years have passed.\n\nThree years later, this brilliant golfer began her professional career at the age of 15, and her first victory came a year later (in 2011). Already then, many anticipated that Thompson would build a great career and become a respected name in the world of golf. The LPGA had to change its rules regarding age, primarily for her but also for others, to secure her a full card, which ensured her victories three more times.\n\nLooking at her successes at the Majors, she has only managed to win one Major, the Chevron Championship in 2014. Looking at the Women's British Open, she was not particularly successful, as her best result was T8 in 2016. Thompson came very close at all three other Majors, including the Women's PGA Championship, where she finished T2 in 2022. The same situation occurred at the US Women's Open with her best score being T2 in 2019. And ultimately, the 29-year-old golfer finished 2nd at the Evian Championship in 2015.\n\nIt must be admitted that at many points during her career, Thompson was unlucky, and she certainly could have achieved more. However, her career is still respectable, as she has achieved 11 victories on the LPGA Tour, 2 victories on the Ladies European Tour, and 1 victory on the LPGA of Japan Tour.\n\nAs a junior, Thompson was also successful, winning the U.S. Girls' Junior Championship in 2008. As a teenager, she made great achievements and caused shock among golf fans. She had the opportunity to represent her country, the US, at the Solheim Cup six times.\n\nThe USGA emphasized in its statement that Lexi's aggressiveness and playing style are reasons why many golf fans worldwide respect her. Additionally, her charisma, openness, and passion for golf are other reasons why Thompson has gained huge sympathies among fans of this sport.\n\nThompson's decision is still not definitive, as there is a chance that she may potentially change her mind. However, the leaders of the USGA wish her luck regardless of the path she chooses. The girl who started her career as a young girl and sparked the interest of many in women's golf has decided to potentially leave this game. Nevertheless, her playing style and character will remain memorable, whatever happens.\n\n\"Lexi's aggressive, powerful style of play earned her the respect of millions of fans, but it was the gracious way she treated those fans that won their love.\n\nWhatever is next for Thompson, whether or not it includes golf, she has a legion of followers who will be rooting her on. The one-time child star walks away from competitive golf just as she entered the game, with her head held high over her 6-foot frame, striding the golf course golf very much on her own terms and in her own style.\"- USGA wrote.\n\nIt is expected that this 29-year-old golfer will announce her decision tomorrow and potentially reveal the reasons why she will end her career. Some speculate that the potential reason could be the fact that Thompson entered this profession too early and has been part of the big scene for years. When you enter a sport as a young person and face all the challenges, sometimes it can 'consume' you after a few years.\n\nHowever, Thompson has always done what she knew best, believing in herself and her successes. She has always provided golf fans with what they wanted from her. Lexi is the reason why many girls have embarked on the same path, which can be her main satisfaction after ending her professional career.\n\nThompson wasn't particularly successful this season, considering that the Ford Championship played in late March this year was her only positive result, where she finished T3. At times, it seemed like Thompson was tired of playing golf, but we'll see what happens next. We wish her luck and success regardless of the decision she makes. For years, she has brought joy to the women's golf scene.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sead_dedovic@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Sead Dedovic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Golf_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Golf Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexi_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lexi Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LPGA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Women's_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Women's Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chevron Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA_of_Japan_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LPGA of Japan Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evian_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Evian Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Girls'_Junior_Golf_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Girls' Junior Golf Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solheim_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solheim Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladies_European_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ladies European Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_British_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's British Open"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community_and_Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community and Clubs", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image149305.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604941", "eventUri": "eng-9604941", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Speaking ahead of the Lancaster Country Club event, Thompson admitted that golf has dominated her life since her early childhood and that she is ready to try new things.\n\nShe said: \"Golf has been my life ever since I was 5 years old, tournaments when I was 7. I haven't really known much of a life different, but it's been an amazing one.\"\n\nShe continued: \"There's more things to life than going to a tournament every week and doing the same training every day. There's just more to it, and I'm looking forward to experiencing that.\n\n\"I feel like I'm very content with where my life is and where this decision will lead me to. Yeah, I'm just looking forward to what life has in store other than golf.\"\n\nDespite Thompson's decision to step away from the game at the end of the LPGA Tour season, she didn't rule out a return to action on a part-time basis.\n\n\"I'm not going to say yes or no on how many events I'll play or if I do,\" she explained. \"I'm just going to take it day by day and see how I feel, especially going into next year. But I'm very content with this being my last full-time schedule year.\"\n\nThompson, who played on the PGA Tour last year in the Shriners Children's Open, also opened up on the difficulties professional players face, saying: \"A lot of people don't - they don't realize a lot of what we go through as a professional athlete. I'll be the last one to say like throw me a pity party. That's the last thing I want. We're doing what we love. We're trying the best every single day.\"\n\nShe added: \"I think it's a lot for everyone out here or in any professional sport. A lot of people don't know what we go through. The amount of training and hard work that we put ourselves through, it's a lot. I don't think we deserve - I think we deserve a lot more credit than what we get.\"\n\nWhile Thompson, whose one Major win to date came at the 2014 Kraft Nabisco Championship, is not looking too far ahead, she admitted there is one burning ambition she has this year - a seventh appearance on the US Solheim Cup team. She said: \"Number one is to definitely be on the Solheim Cup team. Huge honor just to represent my country and play alongside the team there and my captain; definitely that.\"\n\nThompson also hinted what the future may hold away from the relentless life of a full-time LPGA Tour pro, both in her business and personal life. She said: \"I'm super into fitness. Hopefully I'll have my Lexi Fitness app up and going very soon. And just enjoying life. Family's huge for me, so I hope to have a family one day.\"\n\nFar from a spur-of-the-moment decision, Thompson also admitted the thought of retiring had been in her mind for some time. She added: \"I've been thinking about it for a few months now. It's just a matter of time and place.\n\n\"Like I said before, this is where my whole career got started. This is where the whole dream that's started of playing on the LPGA Tour and being out here and playing professional golf and playing against the best.

Since then, Lucy Li took over the most-junior entrant mantel, aged 11 in 2014.\n\nBut almost two decades on from Thompson's own record-breaking week, not only is she set for another crack at the event, but it will be Thompson's 18th championship in a row.\n\nA lengthy and successful career on the LPGA Tour means Thompson has not relied on qualifying very often since her debut, but a US Women's Open title does continue to elude the World No.49 - even after breaking her Major duck in 2014 at the Kraft Nabisco Championship, days on from her 19th birthday.\n\nThompson was the second-youngest women's Major champion when she won what is now the Chevron Championship - one of 15 professional victories.\n\nWhile she failed to make the cut on debut, or in the subsequent season, Thompson's breakthrough would arrive in 2010 - the same year she turned pro. 12 months after recording a very respectable T34 result as a 14-year-old, the Florida-born talent finished just inside the top-10 as a 15-year-old.\n\nSince then, Thompson has gradually improved on her highest-ever position multiple times, scoring T7 as a 19-year-old in 2014, clinching T5 in 2018, and ending T2 in 2019.\n\nYet, perhaps the closest Thompson ever came to lifting arguably the most prestigious trophy in the women's game arrived in 2021 when she ended solo third.\n\nThompson was five clear midway through the final round of the 2021 championship at The Olympic Club before slipping back into the pack and finishing bogey-bogey to miss out on a playoff. Yuka Saso ended up defeating Nasa Hataoka on the third hole of a sudden-death shootout to claim victory.\n\nMeanwhile, in 2023, Thompson's 17th US Women's Open saw her miss the cut at Pebble Beach as eventual champion, Allisen Corpuz battled to nine-under in California.\n\nThe 11-time LPGA Tour winner described the iconic course as \"hard\" following a first-round 74 last year in which playing partner and now World No.1 Nelly Korda shot 76.\n\nThompson said: \"It always plays difficult. Tee shots are hard, and bunkers have a lot of sand and the rough is up really thick. It's definitely a Major championship golf course.\"\n\nA second-round 79 spelt the end of Thompson's week at an event where several huge names also crashed out early. Jin Young Ko, Madelene Sagstrom, Danielle Kang, Megan Khang, and Georgia Hall all failed to sit at better than six-over on Friday night.\n\nOverall, the Floridian has made the cut 12 times, with one second-place, two other top-fives, and a couple more top-10s.\n\nIf the 29-year-old is to stand in the winner's circle once again, though, she will have to reverse a concerning trend regarding her recent form. In Thompson's past five events, she has missed the cut four times - with the only exception arriving via a T3 result at the Ford Championship four starts ago.\n\nHer previous four appearances in 2024 generated a further missed cut, a T42 finish at the Aramco Ladies International, an 11th-place result in the Aramco Team Series in Tampa, and a T16 at the LPGA Drive On Championship in what was her season-opening event.", "source": {"uri": "golfmonthly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf Monthly Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonny_leighfield@golfmonthly.com", "name": "Jonny Leighfield",

At the end of 2024, I will be stepping away,\" Thompson wrote on Instagram. \"I'm excited to enjoy the remainder of the year as there are still goals I want to accomplish. I'm looking forward to the next chapter of my life.\"\n\nThompson has endured a few mediocre years by her standards and is now down in 54th in the rankings, having risen as high as second in peak when she won the Chevon Championship - then the Kraft Nabisco - in 2014. That remains her only major victory and on her current run of three successive missed cuts and without an LPGA Tour win in five years it is no shock to find her generally priced at 100-1 in the tournament in which she will be competing for a remarkable 18th time since her historic debut.\n\nYet while she is clearly not the Lexi of old who racked up 12 other top-threes in the majors, Stacey Lewis, the US Solheim Cup captain, still rates her and it will be interesting if she picks her again for September's match in Washington DC. Last year, Lewis overlooked her poor form and enlisted Thompson as a wildcard for the match in Spain and her faith was rewarded as she won three points from her four games.\n\nThe US ultimately watched Europe retain the Cup for a third successive time, but if Thompson had not triumphed against Emily Kristine Pedersen in the bottom singles then the away side would not have had the consolation of drawing the encounter 14-14. Nobody in the Stars and Stripes has won more points than Thompson since she made her Solehim bow in 2013 and she will obviously be missed as America tries to reassert their superiority.\n\nThompson re-emphasised her quality a few weeks after the Solheim when coming within a few shots of making the cut in a PGA Tour event in Las Vegas. In truth, her career - although lit up with milestone such as becoming the youngest winner on the LPGA Tour when she was 16 - has been as famous for its crushing disappointments as much as her successes.\n\nMost notoriously, Thompson was hit with a four-shot penalty when leading in the final round of the 2017 Kraft Nabisco because of a controversial rules violation the day before and then four years later she lost a five-shot advantage on the Sunday in the US Women's Open.\n\nThe news surprised everyone, including Thompson's team-mate Nelly Korda. At Lancaster Country Club in Pennsylvania, he world No 1 is trying to win her first US Women's Open, which would be her second major in succession and her sixth victory in her last seven events.\n\nBut it says plenty about Thompson's celebrity that Korda was questioned about the 15-time winner in her press conference.\n\n\"I honestly heard probably 15 minutes ago,\" Korda said. \"I've been on the team with Lexi a couple times representing our country. It's sad to see that she's leaving and not going to be out here with us anymore.\"", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_corrigan@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "James Corrigan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solheim_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solheim Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Women's_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Women's Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabisco", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nabisco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kraft Foods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPGA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LPGA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Kristine_Pedersen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emily Kristine Pedersen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancaster_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lancaster Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly_Korda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nelly Korda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars_and_Stripes_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stars and Stripes (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/golf/2024/05/28/TELEMMGLPICT000379722325_17169177932010_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQf0Rf_Wk3V23H2268P_XkPxc.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604941", "eventUri": "eng-9604941", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

That would be an amazing feeling.\"\n\nThompson, 28, is an 11-time LPGA winner with one major who ranks among the longest drivers and biggest stars in women's golf. Other LPGA stars to play PGA Tour events include Annika Sorenstam and Michelle Wie West, but the only one to ever make the 36-hole cut was Babe Didrikson Zaharias at the 1945 Los Angeles Open.\n\nThompson has been one of the longest players on the LPGA Tour, often averaging just under 280 yards per drive. That usually puts her in the top 10 on tour, where courses are set up shorter and she often needs to hit shorter clubs. The average driving distance on the PGA Tour is usually around 300 yards, and Thompson said TPC Summerlin in Las Vegas is well set up for her.\n\n\"Here it's driver on every hole, and I definitely like that,\" she said. \"Fire away and swing, get the most distance I can on a few of those holes.\"\n\nLast week at the Sanderson Farms Championship in Jackson, Miss., PGA Tour pro -- and PGA Tour policy board member -- Peter Malnati was asked about Thompson playing in a men's event and briefly used the word gimmick before immediately correcting himself.\n\n\"I don't think we're going to need to resort to gimmicks to drum up interest,\" he said. \"I shouldn't have said that. I don't know that having Lexi play is a gimmick, but I don't think the tournaments are going to have to go to those kind of lengths to drum up interest and get storylines that they can sell because I think these events are actually going to have a lot of meaning.\"\n\nThompson brushed off Malnati's comments, saying \"it's all good\" and that she expected to hear comments of that nature.\n\n\"I'm out here playing of course with the men, but I want to leave a message just to the kids that I'm following my dreams and to go after what you want with a positive mindset and don't let anybody's comments or reaction get in the way of that,\" Thompson said. \"But it's all good.

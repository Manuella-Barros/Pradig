The 18-year-old high school senior revealed that she\u2019ll be heading to Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the fall. A TikTok video posted by a fellow high school student, which has since been made private, showed Suri and her classmates at New York City\u2019s LaGuardia High School showing off their college sweaters. The clip was set to the Hannah Montana song, \u201cI\u2019ll Always Remember You,\u201d as each graduating senior used their hands to reveal their new alma mater. After Suri showed off her red Carnegie Mellon sweatshirt, she then did a little dance for the camera. \u201cLaG commitment day,\u201d the student captioned the TikTok. The Mission: Impossible star, 61, and the Dawson\u2019s Creek alum, 45, welcomed their daughter Suri in April 2006. The actors met one year prior and were engaged two months later. Holmes and Cruise tied the knot during an Italian ceremony in November 2006, and Holmes later filed for divorce in June 2012 after five years of marriage. According to Page Six, their daughter celebrated her 18th birthday in New York City last month while her father was in London. Holmes has previously opened up about working hard to \u201cprotect\u201d Suri because of her childhood in the spotlight. \u201cWhat has been really important for me with my daughter, because she was so visible at a young age, is I really like to protect her,\u201d the Batman Begins star told Glamour in April last year. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful to be a parent, to be her parent. She\u2019s an incredible person.\u201d The mother of one even enlisted her daughter to join her on a recent project. Suri sang \u201cBlue Moon\u201d during the opening credits of Holmes\u2019 2022 film, Alone Together, and also sang vocals on her 2023 movie, Rare Objects. \u201cI hope she always does something on my films. I always ask her,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cBut both of those experiences came out of the same sense of what I love about our industry, which is, you have these projects and you become a family with people. And it\u2019s this safe, beautiful, creative space.\u201d She continued: \u201cSo it comes out of love for me to include someone who I love dearly. That\u2019s how I like to work. I like to have that kind of feeling. It was very meaningful to me to have her there, because she\u2019s my heart.\u201d While much of Suri\u2019s early life was captured by paparazzi, Holmes shared in an essay for Vogue Australia how the mother-daughter duo were able to embrace their newfound private lives during the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cHobbies such as sewing, painting and writing became new hallmarks of satisfaction and having had time at home to just be. To listen. To live for a moment in time without the pressure of results and instead appreciate the natural rhythms of mother and daughter was the most precious gift,\u201d she wrote in 2020. Holmes also revealed that she and Suri watched Dawson\u2019s Creek together during the height of the pandemic. The actor was just 19 years old when she starred as Joey Potter on the WB series, which ran from 1998 to 2003. \u201cShe has seen Dawson\u2019s Creek, and I think it\u2019s probably weird since she\u2019s a teenager,\u201d Holmes told Variety in March 2023. \u201cI\u2019m not like, \u2018You need to watch mommy\u2019s work.\u2019 But during the pandemic, we had a good laugh about it. It\u2019s wild to have a daughter who\u2019s almost the same age as I was when I began all this.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Suri Cruise, 18, hints at where she\u2019ll be attending college in a TikTok video  </p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/suri-cruise-college-carnegie-mellon-b2559178.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/08/15/tom%20cruise%20katie%20holmes.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:42:51", "author": "Meredith Clark", "authors": ["Meredith Clark"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.261}

However, many of those studies did not include environmental and lifestyle factors or a large number of participants. This analysis of a large database included environmental and lifestyle factors that assessed both short- and long-term risk. It also reviewed whether different genetic susceptibilities to psychiatric disorders affect the possible link between cardiovascular disease and psychiatric disorders.\n\nResearchers reviewed the records of the UK Biobank, a biomedical database and research resource with genetic, physical and health data for about 500,000 adults. Cardiovascular disease was defined here as ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease or stroke, blood clots, heart failure, irregular heart rhythms, or other conditions. Researchers analyzed how often patients who had been hospitalized for cardiovascular disease were later diagnosed with anxiety, depression, stress-related disorder, substance misuse, a psychotic disorder or suicide behaviors in comparison with people of similar age, gender and the presence of other serious health conditions. Participants were excluded from the analysis if they were diagnosed with cardiovascular disease or a psychiatric condition prior to the date of cardiovascular hospitalization.\n\nThe analysis found:\n\nPeople were 83% more likely to be diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder within one year of hospital admission for cardiovascular disease, compared to individuals free of cardiovascular disease, psychiatric disorders or suicide attempts.People hospitalized for cardiovascular disease were 24% more likely to be diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder up to nearly 8 years later, compared to people without cardiovascular disease.The largest increases in risk were for anxiety, depression and suicide behaviors, such as self-harm or suicide attempts.People who had a stroke or other forms of cerebrovascular disease had more than three times higher risk of any psychiatric disorder and suicide attempt within one year of hospitalization and a 49% increased risk after one year.The association between cardiovascular disease and anxiety, depression, stress-related disorder, substance misuse, psychotic disorders or suicide behaviors was not significantly modified by different genetic susceptibilities.\n\n\"If you or a loved one has been hospitalized for heart disease, be aware that mental health issues may arise during recovery. It's important to monitor for signs of anxiety, depression or suicidal thoughts. These mental health challenges are common and treatable,\" said Song.\n\n\"This study's findings confirm that after a cardiovascular disease diagnosis and/or hospitalization, patients are at increased risk for mental health conditions, therefore, mental health screening and early intervention are crucial,\" said Mariell Jessup, M.D., FAHA, chief science and medical officer of the American Heart Association. \"It's also critical for patients, family members, loved ones or caregivers to share any changes that may signal depression, anxiety or potential for suicidal behaviors with the health care team. Mental health, biological health, physiological health and physical health are inextricably intertwined. And, as detailed in our 2023 guideline on chronic coronary disease and two other scientific statements, routine screening and referrals for mental health care and management should be considered for most patients with cardiovascular disease.\"\n\nSong urged people having suicidal thoughts to contact emergency services or go to the nearest emergency room right away or use crisis resources, such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (call 988 in the U.S.) or local mental health crisis services.\n\nSong added, \"Patients should tell their health care professional about any mental health symptoms. They can provide support, refer you to a mental health specialist or adjust your treatment plan. Reach out to a therapist, counselor or psychiatrist for help if you're struggling with your mental health or share your feelings with family members, friends or a support group to gain emotional support and help you navigate the challenges you're facing.\"\n\nThe study has several limitations. Because the diagnoses of cardiovascular disease were taken from hospital inpatient admission data, potentially leading to undercounting patients with less severe cardiovascular disease, the findings may not be generalizable to all people with cardiovascular disease. In addition, diagnosed psychiatric disorders may have been present but were undetected before the cardiovascular event. Some risk factors that may have influenced the results, such as medication use or the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in family members, were not included in the analysis. Moreover, the data in the UK Biobank is from a population of mostly white adults in Britain, so results may not be generalizable to people of other racial or ethnic groups or living in other geographic locations.\n\nStudy details, background and design:\n\nThe investigators analyzed the health records of selected participants in the UK Biobank, a large biomedical database and research resource with genetic, physical and health data on about 500,000 adults. Participants were enrolled between 2006 and 2010, lived in the U.K. and received health care through the National Health Service.The analysis compared almost 64,000 adults (64% men; average age 63 years) first hospitalized with cardiovascular disease or stroke between 1997 and 2020. Almost 128,000 adults were matched for gender, age and the presence of other serious illness.Researchers compared the diagnosis of any psychiatric disorder or suicide attempt after the date of CVD hospitalization. These included anxiety, depression, stress-related disorder, substance misuse, psychotic disorder and suicidal behaviors.Using a Polygenic Risk Score, which estimates susceptibility to a disease based on genes, the researchers analyzed whether a genetic predisposition to these psychiatric conditions influenced the risk after a CVD hospitalization.Participants were excluded from the analysis if they were diagnosed with heart disease or a psychiatric condition before the date of the CVD hospitalization.\n\nCo-authors, disclosures and funding sources are listed in the manuscript.\n\n/Public Release.

They can provide support, refer you to a mental health specialist or adjust your treatment plan. Reach out to a therapist, counselor or psychiatrist for help if you're struggling with your mental health or share your feelings with family members, friends or a support group to gain emotional support and help you navigate the challenges you're facing.\"\n\nThe study has several limitations. Because the diagnoses of cardiovascular disease were taken from hospital inpatient admission data, potentially leading to undercounting patients with less severe cardiovascular disease, the findings may not be generalizable to all people with cardiovascular disease. In addition, diagnosed psychiatric disorders may have been present but were undetected before the cardiovascular event. Some risk factors that may have influenced the results, such as medication use or the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in family members, were not included in the analysis. Moreover, the data in the UK Biobank is from a population of mostly white adults in Britain, so results may not be generalizable to people of other racial or ethnic groups or living in other geographic locations.\n\nStudy details, background and design:\n\nCo-authors, disclosures and funding sources are listed in the manuscript.\n\nStudies published in the American Heart Association's scientific journals are peer-reviewed.

Participants were a median age of 63. Median follow-up was about 7 1/2 years. Researchers looked at how often participants developed anxiety, depression, a stress-related disorder, substance misuse, a psychotic disorder or suicide behaviors.\n\nThe risk for multiple psychiatric conditions significantly increased following hospitalization for cardiovascular disease, especially during the first year, regardless of genetic susceptibility.

These mental health challenges are common and treatable.\"\n\nPrior research has found a higher risk of psychiatric disorders - such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder - among people with cardiovascular disease. But most of these studies did not include large populations or account for environmental and lifestyle factors.\n\nIn the new study, researchers analyzed genetic, physical and health data for two groups of people in the UK Biobank, a biomedical database of about half a million people in the United Kingdom. They compared data for 63,923 people hospitalized for a cardiovascular condition between 1997 and 2020 to similar data for 127,845 matched adults without cardiovascular disease. Researchers wanted to know how lifestyle and environmental factors affected short- and long-term risk for psychiatric disorders and whether genetic susceptibility played a role.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nCardiovascular disease was defined as ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease or stroke, blood clots, heart failure, irregular heart rhythms and other heart conditions. Participants were a median age of 63. Median follow-up was about 7 1/2 years. Researchers looked at how often participants developed anxiety, depression, a stress-related disorder, substance misuse, a psychotic disorder or suicide behaviors.\n\nThe risk for multiple psychiatric conditions significantly increased following hospitalization for cardiovascular disease, especially during the first year, regardless of genetic susceptibility. Participants were 83% more likely to be diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder within one year of hospital admission. The biggest increases in risk were for anxiety, depression and suicide behaviors, such as self-harm or suicide attempts.\n\nThe risk lessened but did not disappear after the first year. People hospitalized for cardiovascular disease remained 24% more likely to be diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder. Those who had a stroke and other cerebrovascular disease had a more than threefold higher risk for psychiatric disorders and suicide attempts within the first year of hospital admission and a 49% higher risk after one year.\n\nPeople who have suicidal thoughts should contact emergency services, go to the nearest emergency room, dial 988 for the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline or contact local mental health crisis services, Song said.\n\n\"Patients should tell their health care professional about any mental health symptoms,\" Song said. \"They can provide support, refer you to a mental health specialist or adjust your treatment plan. Reach out to a therapist, counselor or psychiatrist for help if you're struggling with your mental health, or share your feelings with family members, friends or a support group to gain emotional support and help you navigate the challenges you're facing.\"\n\nAmerican Heart Association News\n\ncovers heart and brain health.

It's important to monitor for signs of anxiety, depression or suicidal thoughts. These mental health challenges are common and treatable.\"\n\nTo investigate the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and suicide attempts among individuals hospitalized with CVD, Song and colleagues conducted a matched cohort study of patient data from the U.K. Biobank.\n\nTheir analysis included 63,923 patients hospitalized for the first time with CVD between 1997 and 2020 and 127,845 matched individuals without a CVD hospitalization (median age, 63 years; 64% men). Hospitalized patients with any history of psychiatric disorders or prior suicide attempts were excluded from the analysis.\n\nIndividuals hospitalized with CVD had higher Townsend deprivation index, BMI and proportion of smoking and family history of psychiatric disorders compared with the matched cohort, as well as lower educational attainment and household income.\n\nThe researchers observed an increased risk for anxiety, depression, stress-related disorder, substance misuse, psychotic disorder and suicide behaviors among people hospitalized with CVD compared with the matched cohort, with especially high risk during the first year after diagnosis (adjusted HR = 1.83; 95% CI, 1.58-2.12). After 1 year, risk declined but remained elevated (aHR = 1.24; 95% CI, 1.16-1.32).\n\nRisk for any psychiatric disorders and suicide attempt in the first year after diagnosis was elevated across most CVDs and was highest for cerebrovascular disease, followed by HF, arrhythmia/conduction disorders, ischemic heart disease and emboli/thrombosis.\n\nMoreover, the researchers found no significant impact of genetic susceptibility to the studied psychiatric disorders and risk for developing the psychiatric disorder following first-time CVD hospitalization.\n\n\"Patients should tell their health care professional about any mental health symptoms,\" Song said in the release. \"They can provide support, refer you to a mental health specialist or adjust your treatment plan. Reach out to a therapist, counselor or psychiatrist for help if you're struggling with your mental health or share your feelings with family members, friends or a support group to gain emotional support and help you navigate the challenges you're facing.\"\n\nThe phone number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 988 in the U.S. and Canada, and 0800-689-5652 for the National Suicide Prevention Helpline U.K. or 111 for the NHS.", "source": {"uri": "healio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Healio"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_attempt", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suicide attempt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cardiovascular disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prevalence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sichuan University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Heart_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Heart Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengdu", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chengdu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chengdu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_history_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Family history (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cohort (statistics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicidal_ideation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suicidal ideation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cohort study"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cardiovascular_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cardiovascular Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.healio.com/~/media/slack-news/stock-images/fm_im/d/depression_adobestock_60945003.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9780658", "eventUri": "eng-9780658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

It reached super status earlier this year after boosting temperatures during the hottest year on record and influencing other global weather events.\n\nWith El Ni\u00f1o out of the spotlight, its opposite is preparing to take center stage later this summer: La Ni\u00f1a.\n\nFor now, neither La Ni\u00f1a nor El Ni\u00f1o are present and a so-called neutral phase has begun, according to NOAA's Climate Prediction Center. But this will change quickly as La Ni\u00f1a builds through the summer and is likely firmly in control by September during the peak of hurricane season.\n\nHere's what a summer without El Ni\u00f1o and a budding La Ni\u00f1a could have in store.\n\nLa Ni\u00f1a summers following strong El Ni\u00f1o winters have historically been some of the hottest on record in the US. This summer could be no different, even before La Ni\u00f1a is entrenched.\n\nAbove-average temperatures are expected over nearly all of the Lower 48 this summer. Sizzling conditions began early in the West and a push of July-like heat is spreading over the eastern half of the country.\n\nThe transition to La Ni\u00f1a isn't the only factor influencing temperatures during the hottest time of the year. They are always on the rise in a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution.\n\nAlong with more intense heat, seasonal forecasts show a concerning precipitation trend for a large portion of the western half of the US. Drier than normal conditions are expected for most West states and parts of the Plains.\n\nDryness and heat are cyclical. The hotter an area becomes, the more it dries out, which could be a recipe for new or worsening drought. A dry area will then get even hotter as most of the sun's energy goes into heating the ground, with little energy lost to evaporation of wet soil.\n\nThe loss of El Ni\u00f1o will also have major ramifications in the Atlantic Ocean and is one major reason experts are calling for a hyperactive hurricane season.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o tends to create hostile upper level winds that rip storms apart while La Ni\u00f1a does the opposite. So, more storms could develop this year without El Ni\u00f1o holding them back. El Ni\u00f1o also won't be around to curve many storms away from the US, potentially leaving the coasts vulnerable this season.\n\nThe Atlantic Ocean's record-breaking water temperatures could also act like food for storms, helping them to form, strengthen and survive.\n\nThe Atlantic is also not the only ocean that's steamy. Over the past year, El Ni\u00f1o helped drive global average ocean temperatures to record-breaking levels. La Ni\u00f1a may eventually have somewhat of a cooling effect on the world's oceans, potentially leveling off some of the out-of-control heating of the past year.\n\nBut that's not happening anytime soon. Oceans are incredibly slow to cool, especially since about 90% of the world's excess heat produced by burning planet-heating fossil fuels are stored in them.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o arrived in June of 2023 and eventually became one of the strongest on record. It influenced the world during its year-long lifetime.\n\nMost notably, El Ni\u00f1o helped push both air and ocean temperatures to record levels globally. Every month from June 2023 to May 2024 was the world's hottest such month on record, CNN previously reported.\n\nGlobal ocean temperatures first climbed to record breaking levels in March 2023 and have remained at historic levels since then.\n\nDespite records starting before El Ni\u00f1o arrived on the scene, the toasty climate pattern only exacerbated the situation as record heat in the air seeped into the oceans.\n\nThe natural climate pattern also influenced many significant weather events since last summer.\n\nCalifornia and the western US also typically pick up more rain during El Ni\u00f1o, especially over the winter months. That played out this past winter when multiple powerful atmospheric river events slammed the West Coast.\n\nFurther research is needed to determine El Ni\u00f1o's full impact over the last 12 months, but these events are proof of the highly influential pattern's reach.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Ni\u00f1a", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "La Ni\u00f1a"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni\u00f1o", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "El Ni\u00f1o"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sea surface temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_variability_and_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate variability and change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Prediction_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate Prediction Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Evaporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contiguous United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Atlantic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Precipitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_river", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric river"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Oceanography", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Oceanography", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleogeography_and_Paleoclimatology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/14fb4c6a57c4b6165259047976e4991c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649512", "eventUri": "eng-9649512", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 241, "relevance": 1}

It reached super status earlier this year after boosting temperatures during the hottest year on record and influencing other global weather events.\n\nWith El Ni\u00f1o out of the spotlight, its opposite is preparing to take center stage later this summer: La Ni\u00f1a.\n\nFor now, neither La Ni\u00f1a nor El Ni\u00f1o are present and a so-called neutral phase has begun, according to NOAA's Climate Prediction Center. But this will change quickly as La Ni\u00f1a builds through the summer and is likely firmly in control by September during the peak of hurricane season.\n\nHere's what a summer without El Ni\u00f1o and a budding La Ni\u00f1a could have in store.\n\nSweltering summer, active Atlantic\n\nLa Ni\u00f1a summers following strong El Ni\u00f1o winters have historically been some of the hottest on record in the US. This summer could be no different, even before La Ni\u00f1a is entrenched.\n\nAbove-average temperatures are expected over nearly all of the Lower 48 this summer. Sizzling conditions began early in the West and a push of July-like heat is spreading over the eastern half of the country.\n\nThe transition to La Ni\u00f1a isn't the only factor influencing temperatures during the hottest time of the year. They are always on the rise in a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution.\n\nAlong with more intense heat, seasonal forecasts show a concerning precipitation trend for a large portion of the western half of the US. Drier than normal conditions are expected for most West states and parts of the Plains.\n\nDryness and heat are cyclical. The hotter an area becomes, the more it dries out, which could be a recipe for new or worsening drought. A dry area will then get even hotter as most of the sun's energy goes into heating the ground, with little energy lost to evaporation of wet soil.\n\nThe loss of El Ni\u00f1o will also have major ramifications in the Atlantic Ocean and is one major reason experts are calling for a hyperactive hurricane season.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o tends to create hostile upper level winds that rip storms apart while La Ni\u00f1a does the opposite. So, more storms could develop this year without El Ni\u00f1o holding them back. El Ni\u00f1o also won't be around to curve many storms away from the US, potentially leaving the coasts vulnerable this season.\n\nThe Atlantic Ocean's record-breaking water temperatures could also act like food for storms, helping them to form, strengthen and survive.\n\nThe Atlantic is also not the only ocean that's steamy. Over the past year, El Ni\u00f1o helped drive global average ocean temperatures to record-breaking levels. La Ni\u00f1a may eventually have somewhat of a cooling effect on the world's oceans, potentially leveling off some of the out-of-control heating of the past year.\n\nBut that's not happening anytime soon. Oceans are incredibly slow to cool, especially since about 90% of the world's excess heat produced by burning planet-heating fossil fuels are stored in them.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o's lasting impact\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o arrived in June of 2023 and eventually became one of the strongest on record. It influenced the world during its year-long lifetime.\n\nMost notably, El Ni\u00f1o helped push both air and ocean temperatures to record levels globally. Every month from June 2023 to May 2024 was the world's hottest such month on record, CNN previously reported.\n\nGlobal ocean temperatures first climbed to record breaking levels in March 2023 and have remained at historic levels since then.\n\nDespite records starting before El Ni\u00f1o arrived on the scene, the toasty climate pattern only exacerbated the situation as record heat in the air seeped into the oceans.\n\nThe natural climate pattern also influenced many significant weather events since last summer.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o likely had a hand in hot and dry conditions in northern South America that brought the Amazon River to record-low levels in October, the US Lower 48's hottest ever winter and severe drought in large portions of central and southern Africa this winter.\n\nParts of Africa's east coast typically record more rain during El Ni\u00f1o events, but excessive rainfall unfolded to devastating, deadly effect in Kenya in April and May.\n\nCalifornia and the western US also typically pick up more rain during El Ni\u00f1o, especially over the winter months. That played out this past winter when multiple powerful atmospheric river events slammed the West Coast.\n\nFurther research is needed to determine El Ni\u00f1o's full impact over the last 12 months, but these events are proof of the highly influential pattern's reach.\n\nCNN's Laura Paddison contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Probably not", "body": "A tree trunk is lies on a now dry section of the El Guavio Water Reservoir on April 18, 2024 in Gachal\u00e1, Colombia. Water reservoirs around Colombia are facing low levels due to a major drought caused by El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation. (Diego Cuevas/Getty Images)\n\nThe last twelve months have been the hottest in recorded human history. This relentess pattern is being driven by human-caused climate change, but also El Ni\u00f1o, a natural part of our global weather cycle that results in hotter temperatures. Though we are now entering the colder La Ni\u00f1a phase of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which should bring some cooler temperatures over several years, some experts say that our heating planet is so out of balance, the cooling could make little difference.\n\nEven though our species' greenhouse gas emissions are raising Earth's temperatures to perilous levels, the La Ni\u00f1a phase is known to cool both ocean and land temperatures, potentially ameliorating extreme weather like heatwaves, wildfires and tropical storms.\n\nYet when Salon reached out to experts about what people can expect in Summer 2024, the answer was the same: La Ni\u00f1a is a powerful force, but climate change is an even stronger one. The summer of 2024 will, unfortunately, be full of nasty weather.\n\n\"The forecast is for hotter and drier in [the] western half of the U.S.,\" Dr. Kevin Trenberth, a distinguished scholar at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, told Salon. \"Influences of [sea surface temperatures] are less in summer owing to the way atmospheric dynamics works. Effects are bigger into the other hemisphere.\" In New Zealand, where Trenberth currently lives, residents are still seeing influences from the fading El Ni\u00f1o phase of the cycle. During the El Ni\u00f1o phase, sea surface temperatures are highest over the tropical Pacific, which means that drought is more common in various land areas. The result, as humanity learned over the last few years, is heat waves and wild fires.\n\n\"But going into La Ni\u00f1a, as forecast later this summer, it means that the Pacific is where the action is not favored and so it occurs elsewhere,\" said Trenberth. \"More bits of rain mean cooler temperatures on land. This is a very general statement and the CPC from NOA tries to add value by refining the patterns of weather.\"\n\nDr. Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), said that it is going to be difficult to \"pin down\" the current phase's exact impact on the summer heat because it is not acting in a vacuum. While media coverage often makes the ENSO cycle seem like the single determinant of weather patterns during this time of year, the reality is much more complicated.\n\n\"There is so much more going on besides La Ni\u00f1a that can affect jet stream patterns and hence temperature and heat waves, notably, the very high sea surface temperatures over the North Atlantic,\" Serreze said. \"La Ni\u00f1a years tend to be a bit cooler than El Ni\u00f1o years in the global average, in part because the absence of the warm water pool over the eastern tropical Pacific, so that may prevent us from reaching another record high global average temperature in 2024.\"\n\nYet because climate change has thrown a wrench into the way the system usually works, nothing can be predicted with confidence.\n\n\"There is more going on that just La Ni\u00f1a,\" said Serreze. \"The ENSO cycle will likely always be with us, but as global temperatures continue to rise, it may become less important in terms of year to year variations in global temperature.\" Indeed, Serreze predicts an active hurricane season in 2024 because \"in a La Ni\u00f1a, wind shear is reduced in the hurricane formation regions -- hurricanes don't like wind shear\" and \"waters are very, very warm in the hurricane formations regions, and hurricanes feed on a warm ocean.\"\n\nWant more health and science stories in your inbox?

In general, climate change has shaken up what scientists can expect from the La Ni\u00f1a cycle.\n\n\"Mainly later in the summer, watch out especially for an active hurricane season in the Atlantic and real risk of flooding in the East and Southeast,\" said Trenberth. \"It has been extraordinarily hot in India and southeast Asia as El Ni\u00f1o has held sway, but those regions could be in for some flooding events much later in the summer in the monsoon. In Australia the risk of heavy rains goes up also, later.\"\n\nA 2023 study published in the journal Nature raised further questions about how the La Ni\u00f1a cycle's impact on weather is different now that global temperatures are rising.\n\n\"A three-year-long La Ni\u00f1a event beginning in 2020 had a key role in triggering consecutive seasonal droughts in parts of the United States and the Horn of Africa, and in causing floods in eastern Australia,\" the authors write. \"This rare 'triple' La Ni\u00f1a sparked worldwide discussion about how global warming could change the duration of these formidable events.\"\n\nFor his part, Trenberth predicts that all weather patterns are being altered by climate change and that this \"means all extremes are enhanced. Stronger rains where it rains, more rapid drying where it does not rain and risk of drought and wild fire. We see these extremes taking place in different parts of Africa at the same time.\"\n\nTrenberth also has advice for citizens of the world: Start saving water.\n\n\"Water resources are paramount,\" said Trenberth. \"Saving water from when we have too much for the inevitable times when we don't have enough is much needed and not done well. Often the part of government responsible for preventing flooding has nothing to do with the part responsible for water resources and preventing fires and drought. So excess water is channeled into a river or ocean and lost. Local government has a key role to play, but may not be well advised.\"", "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Salon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern_Oscillation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_E._Trenberth", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin E.

Here's what to expect in the coming months - KION546", "body": "(CNN) -- El Ni\u00f1o has officially come to an end and the ripples from its demise will shake up weather around the globe.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o - a natural climate pattern marked by warmer than average ocean temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean - has gripped the planet since the start of last summer. It reached super status earlier this year after boosting temperatures during the hottest year on record and influencing other global weather events.\n\nWith El Ni\u00f1o out of the spotlight, its opposite is preparing to take center stage later this summer: La Ni\u00f1a.\n\nFor now, neither La Ni\u00f1a nor El Ni\u00f1o are present and a so-called neutral phase has begun, according to NOAA's Climate Prediction Center. But this will change quickly as La Ni\u00f1a builds through the summer and is likely firmly in control by September during the peak of hurricane season.\n\nHere's what a summer without El Ni\u00f1o and a budding La Ni\u00f1a could have in store.\n\nLa Ni\u00f1a summers following strong El Ni\u00f1o winters have historically been some of the hottest on record in the US. This summer could be no different, even before La Ni\u00f1a is entrenched.\n\nAbove-average temperatures are expected over nearly all of the Lower 48 this summer. Sizzling conditions began early in the West and a push of July-like heat is spreading over the eastern half of the country.\n\nThe transition to La Ni\u00f1a isn't the only factor influencing temperatures during the hottest time of the year. They are always on the rise in a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution.\n\nAlong with more intense heat, seasonal forecasts show a concerning precipitation trend for a large portion of the western half of the US. Drier than normal conditions are expected for most West states and parts of the Plains.\n\nDryness and heat are cyclical. The hotter an area becomes, the more it dries out, which could be a recipe for new or worsening drought. A dry area will then get even hotter as most of the sun's energy goes into heating the ground, with little energy lost to evaporation of wet soil.\n\nThe loss of El Ni\u00f1o will also have major ramifications in the Atlantic Ocean and is one major reason experts are calling for a hyperactive hurricane season.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o tends to create hostile upper level winds that rip storms apart while La Ni\u00f1a does the opposite. So, more storms could develop this year without El Ni\u00f1o holding them back. El Ni\u00f1o also won't be around to curve many storms away from the US, potentially leaving the coasts vulnerable this season.\n\nThe Atlantic Ocean's record-breaking water temperatures could also act like food for storms, helping them to form, strengthen and survive.\n\nThe Atlantic is also not the only ocean that's steamy. Over the past year, El Ni\u00f1o helped drive global average ocean temperatures to record-breaking levels. La Ni\u00f1a may eventually have somewhat of a cooling effect on the world's oceans, potentially leveling off some of the out-of-control heating of the past year.\n\nBut that's not happening anytime soon. Oceans are incredibly slow to cool, especially since about 90% of the world's excess heat produced by burning planet-heating fossil fuels are stored in them.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o arrived in June of 2023 and eventually became one of the strongest on record. It influenced the world during its year-long lifetime.\n\nMost notably, El Ni\u00f1o helped push both air and ocean temperatures to record levels globally. Every month from June 2023 to May 2024 was the world's hottest such month on record, CNN previously reported.\n\nGlobal ocean temperatures first climbed to record breaking levels in March 2023 and have remained at historic levels since then.\n\nDespite records starting before El Ni\u00f1o arrived on the scene, the toasty climate pattern only exacerbated the situation as record heat in the air seeped into the oceans.\n\nThe natural climate pattern also influenced many significant weather events since last summer.\n\nCalifornia and the western US also typically pick up more rain during El Ni\u00f1o, especially over the winter months. That played out this past winter when multiple powerful atmospheric river events slammed the West Coast.\n\nFurther research is needed to determine El Ni\u00f1o's full impact over the last 12 months, but these events are proof of the highly influential pattern's reach.\n\nCNN's Laura Paddison contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

And looking beyond that, La Ni\u00f1a also has a strong 85% chance of persisting through the winter of 2024-25, forecasters said.\n\nLa Ni\u00f1a often creates weather patterns that increase hurricane activity in the Atlantic basin, which includes storms that form in the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. It also affects winter weather in the U.S. and around the world.\n\nIn contrast, the outgoing El Ni\u00f1o pattern usually helps to suppress Atlantic hurricane activity, experts say. (It can have many other effects too, including boosting global heat.)\n\nAccording to the Climate Prediction Center, La Ni\u00f1a can contribute to an increase in Atlantic hurricane activity by weakening the wind shear over the Caribbean Sea and tropical Atlantic basin, which allows storms to develop and intensify.\n\nIt's one of the reasons forecasters have predicted a \"hyperactive\" hurricane season in the Atlantic basin this year, with one forecast expecting as many as 33 named storms. An average year sees 14.\n\nForecasters also said Thursday that the planet is not quite in a La Ni\u00f1a yet: As of June, we're in the middling \"ENSO-neutral\" phase, a halfway point between the two influential climate patterns.\n\n\"ENSO-neutral conditions returned during the past month,\" the Climate Prediction Center said in its monthly update. This means that seawater temperatures in the Pacific Ocean are neither unusually warm nor unusually cool.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o is a natural climate pattern in which sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean are warmer than average. It occurs, on average, every two to seven years.\n\nIts name means \"the little boy\", or \"Christ child\" in Spanish. El Ni\u00f1o originally was recognized by fishermen off the coast of South America in the 1600s with the appearance of unusually warm water in the Pacific Ocean around Christmas.\n\nThe entire natural climate cycle is officially known as El Ni\u00f1o - Southern Oscillation, called ENSO by scientists. The cycle swings between warmer and cooler seawater in a region along the equator in the tropical Pacific. La Ni\u00f1a is marked by cooler-than-average ocean water in the region.\n\nWhen water temperatures are neither unusually warm nor cool, \"ENSO-neutral\" conditions are declared.\n\nA typical La Ni\u00f1a winter in the U.S. brings cold and snow to the Northwest and unusually dry conditions to most of the Southern states, according to the Climate Prediction Center. The Southeast and mid-Atlantic also tend to see higher-than-average temperatures during a La Ni\u00f1a winter.\n\nMeanwhile, New England and the Upper Midwest into New York tend to see lower-than-average temperatures, the Weather Channel said.\n\nThe most recent El Ni\u00f1o will go down as one of the five strongest in history, the World Meteorological Organization said. Coupled with climate change, it helped boost global temperatures to the highest on record in 2023.\n\nHowever, \"the end of El Ni\u00f1o does not mean a pause in long-term climate change as our planet will continue to warm due to heat-trapping greenhouse gases,\" World Meteorological Organization deputy secretary-General Ko Barrett said earlier this month.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_variability_and_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Climate variability and change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Ni\u00f1a", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "La Ni\u00f1a"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Prediction_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Climate Prediction Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni\u00f1o", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "El Ni\u00f1o"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_hurricane", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic hurricane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern_Oscillation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sea surface temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawater", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seawater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_shear", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wind shear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mid-Atlantic (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Meteorological_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Meteorological Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Midwest", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Upper Midwest"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern United States"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleogeography_and_Paleoclimatology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology", "wgt": 27}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_news_641/09ca4e99b75ab08b3ee8196167f90d7e", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649512", "eventUri": "eng-9649512", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

It reached super status earlier this year after boosting temperatures during the hottest year on record and influencing other global weather events.\n\nWith El Ni\u00f1o out of the spotlight, its opposite is preparing to take center stage later this summer: La Ni\u00f1a.\n\nFor now, neither La Ni\u00f1a nor El Ni\u00f1o are present and a so-called neutral phase has begun, according to NOAA's Climate Prediction Center. But this will change quickly as La Ni\u00f1a builds through the summer and is likely firmly in control by September during the peak of hurricane season.\n\nHere's what a summer without El Ni\u00f1o and a budding La Ni\u00f1a could have in store.\n\nLa Ni\u00f1a summers following strong El Ni\u00f1o winters have historically been some of the hottest on record in the US. This summer could be no different, even before La Ni\u00f1a is entrenched.\n\nAbove-average temperatures are expected over nearly all of the Lower 48 this summer. Sizzling conditions began early in the West and a push of July-like heat is spreading over the eastern half of the country.\n\nThe transition to La Ni\u00f1a isn't the only factor influencing temperatures during the hottest time of the year. They are always on the rise in a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution.\n\nAlong with more intense heat, seasonal forecasts show a concerning precipitation trend for a large portion of the western half of the US. Drier than normal conditions are expected for most West states and parts of the Plains.\n\nDryness and heat are cyclical. The hotter an area becomes, the more it dries out, which could be a recipe for new or worsening drought. A dry area will then get even hotter as most of the sun's energy goes into heating the ground, with little energy lost to evaporation of wet soil.\n\nThe loss of El Ni\u00f1o will also have major ramifications in the Atlantic Ocean and is one major reason experts are calling for a hyperactive hurricane season.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o tends to create hostile upper level winds that rip storms apart while La Ni\u00f1a does the opposite. So, more storms could develop this year without El Ni\u00f1o holding them back. El Ni\u00f1o also won't be around to curve many storms away from the US, potentially leaving the coasts vulnerable this season.\n\nThe Atlantic Ocean's record-breaking water temperatures could also act like food for storms, helping them to form, strengthen and survive.\n\nThe Atlantic is also not the only ocean that's steamy. Over the past year, El Ni\u00f1o helped drive global average ocean temperatures to record-breaking levels. La Ni\u00f1a may eventually have somewhat of a cooling effect on the world's oceans, potentially leveling off some of the out-of-control heating of the past year.\n\nBut that's not happening anytime soon. Oceans are incredibly slow to cool, especially since about 90% of the world's excess heat produced by burning planet-heating fossil fuels are stored in them.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o arrived in June of 2023 and eventually became one of the strongest on record. It influenced the world during its year-long lifetime.\n\nMost notably, El Ni\u00f1o helped push both air and ocean temperatures to record levels globally. Every month from June 2023 to May 2024 was the world's hottest such month on record, CNN previously reported.\n\nGlobal ocean temperatures first climbed to record breaking levels in March 2023 and have remained at historic levels since then.\n\nDespite records starting before El Ni\u00f1o arrived on the scene, the toasty climate pattern only exacerbated the situation as record heat in the air seeped into the oceans.\n\nThe natural climate pattern also influenced many significant weather events since last summer.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o likely had a hand in hot and dry conditions in northern South America that brought the Amazon River to record-low levels in October, the US Lower 48's hottest ever winter and severe drought in large portions of central and southern Africa this winter.\n\nParts of Africa's east coast typically record more rain during El Ni\u00f1o events, but excessive rainfall unfolded to devastating, deadly effect in Kenya in April and May.\n\nCalifornia and the western US also typically pick up more rain during El Ni\u00f1o, especially over the winter months. That played out this past winter when multiple powerful atmospheric river events slammed the West Coast.\n\nFurther research is needed to determine El Ni\u00f1o's full impact over the last 12 months, but these events are proof of the highly influential pattern's reach.", "source": {"uri": "6abc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "6abc Action News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Ni\u00f1a", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "La Ni\u00f1a"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni\u00f1o", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "El Ni\u00f1o"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sea surface temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_variability_and_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate variability and change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Prediction_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate Prediction Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Evaporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contiguous United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Atlantic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Precipitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_river", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric river"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Oceanography", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Oceanography", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleogeography_and_Paleoclimatology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/14943948_061324-wpvi-cnnw-el-nino-img.JPG?w=1600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649512", "eventUri": "eng-9649512", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

It is exceedingly likely that a La Ni\u00f1a pattern will develop later this summer or fall. NOAA says there is a 65% chance for La Ni\u00f1a in July to September and an 85% chance from November to January.\n\nLa Ni\u00f1a refers to cooler than average waters near the equator in the Pacific Ocean. It is the opposite of El Ni\u00f1o, which refers to warmer than average water in the equatorial Pacific. Locally, El Ni\u00f1o likely contributed to our mild and wet winter, with record rainfall to begin 2024 across Southern New England.\n\nLooking ahead, the arrival of La Ni\u00f1a could lead to a hyper-active Atlantic hurricane season later this summer. Sea surface temperatures are still running much warmer than average in the Atlantic, and La Ni\u00f1a tends to result in less wind shear over the tropical Atlantic. Wind shear interferes with the development of tropical systems by tearing them apart, so less wind shear can mean a higher number of stronger storms.\n\nThere was a rare La Ni\u00f1a three-peat recently, with three years in a row of La Ni\u00f1a in late 2020, 2021, and 2022, ending in early 2023.

Not so fast, experts caution\n\nLa Ni\u00f1a usually has a cooling effect, but it's little match for climate change\n\nBy MATTHEW ROZSA\n\nStaff Writer\n\nThe last twelve months have been the hottest in recorded human history. This relentess pattern is being driven by human-caused climate change, but also El Ni\u00f1o, a natural part of our global weather cycle that results in hotter temperatures. Though we are now entering the colder La Ni\u00f1a phase of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which should bring some cooler temperatures over several years, some experts say that our heating planet is so out of balance, the cooling could make little difference.\n\nEven though our species' greenhouse gas emissions are raising Earth's temperatures to perilous levels, the La Ni\u00f1a phase is known to cool both ocean and land temperatures, potentially ameliorating extreme weather like heatwaves, wildfires and tropical storms.\n\nYet when Salon reached out to experts about what people can expect in Summer 2024, the answer was the same: La Ni\u00f1a is a powerful force, but climate change is an even stronger one. The summer of 2024 will, unfortunately, be full of nasty weather.\n\n\"The forecast is for hotter and drier in [the] western half of the U.S.,\" Dr. Kevin Trenberth, a distinguished scholar at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, told Salon. \"Influences of [sea surface temperatures] are less in summer owing to the way atmospheric dynamics works.

Cooler hurricane-helping La Nina to replace the phenomenon that adds heat to Earth", "body": "The strong El Ni\u00f1o weather condition that added a bit of extra heat to already record warm global temperatures is gone. It's cool flip side, La Ni\u00f1a, is likely to breeze in just in time for peak Atlantic hurricane season, federal meteorologists said.\n\nThe National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration Thursday pronounced dead the El Ni\u00f1o that warms parts of the central Pacific. The El Ni\u00f1o, while not quite a record breaker in strength, formed a year ago has been blamed, along with human-caused climate change and overall ocean warmth, for a wild 12 months of heat waves and extreme weather.\n\nThe world is now in a neutral condition when it comes to the important natural El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, which warps weather systems worldwide. Neutral is when weather gets closer to long-term averages or normal, something that hasn't happened as much recently as it used to, said NOAA physical scientist Michelle L'Heureux, who is the lead forecaster of the agency's ENSO team. But it likely won't last, she added.\n\nShe said there's a 65% chance that a La Ni\u00f1a, a cooling of the same parts of the Pacific that often has opposite effects, will form in the July, August and September time period. One of the biggest effects of La Ni\u00f1a is that it tends to make Atlantic hurricane season more active, and that storm season starts its peak in August.\n\n\"The likelihood of a La Ni\u00f1a coupled with record warm sea surface temperatures is the reason the National Hurricane Center is forecasting an extraordinary hurricane season,\" said Kathie Dello, North Carolina's state climatologist. \"States from Texas to Maine are making preparations for an active year.\"\n\nBoth El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a create \"potential hot spots\" for extreme weather but in different places and of different types, L'Heureux said.\n\n\"La Ni\u00f1a tends to, in the winter, bring drier conditions across the southern tier of the United States and if you put global warming on top of that, that could also mean those drier conditions could intensify into droughts,\" L'Heureux said.\n\nThat's because storm systems, mostly in the winter, move slightly northward with a shift in the jet stream during La Ni\u00f1a years, bringing more rain and snow north, L'Heureux said.\n\nEven though a La Ni\u00f1a tends to be cooler, there will likely be a residual effect of the exiting El Ni\u00f1o on global temperatures, L'Heureux said. This year has seen each month breaking global records so far.\n\nNo more than 8% of last year's record heat could be attributed to El Ni\u00f1o and other natural variability, a panel of 57 scientists concluded earlier this month. The rest was from human-caused climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.\n\nA 1999 economic study found that drought from La Ni\u00f1a cost the United States agriculture between $2.2 billion to $6.5 billion, which is far more than the $1.5 billion cost of El Ni\u00f1o. A neutral ENSO is best for agriculture.\n\nGiven La Ni\u00f1a's connection to Atlantic hurricanes and drought in the United States it makes sense that they are generally costlier, but every El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a is different, so people and governments should prepare for them, said meteorologist and economist Michael Ferrari, chief scientific officer of AlphaGeo, a firm that works on financial investments and climate.\n\nThe El Ni\u00f1o that just ended \"wasn't a record-breaker in anybody's book, but it was probably about top five,\" L'Heureux said. And it added to overall global temperature and brought more moisture to the southern United States this year, along with drier conditions in parts of South America and Central America, she said. The Horn of Africa got wetter.\n\nCoral reef experts say the combination of record ocean temperatures and the boost of heating from El Ni\u00f1o have led to a major global bleaching event threatening and at times killing vulnerable coral.\n\nBefore this year's El Ni\u00f1o, the world had back-to-back-to-back La Ninas, which is unusual, L'Heureux said. Some studies have shown that the globe should expect more El Ninos and La Ninas -- and fewer neutrals -- as the world warms, but it's still an unsettled issue, she said.\n\n\u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

Here's what that means for a streak of record heat.", "body": "The latest El Ni\u00f1o global climate pattern is officially over, ending a year-long episode in which its planet-warming influence helped blast ocean and air temperatures far into record-setting territory.\n\nIts end is no surprise, following the typical course of an earthly phenomenon that has been observed for centuries in some parts of the world. But this time, it brings with it new uncertainties in a world heated and changed by human emissions of fossil fuel exhaust and other greenhouse gases.\n\nScientists believe El Ni\u00f1o's end could break a string of off-the-charts heat that has persisted within the world's oceans and across the planet's surface for more than a year. A La Ni\u00f1a pattern, El Ni\u00f1o's planet-cooling inverse, is forecast to develop by summer's end, and scientists say it will probably slow, but not reverse, the heating of the globe.\n\nBut in a world that has warmed close to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit in less than two centuries, that prediction isn't guaranteed - because not even a strong El Ni\u00f1o can explain the scale by which global temperatures have surged recently.\n\n\"Even when you factor that in ... it's surprising how warm it has been,\" said Nathaniel Johnson, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration meteorologist. \"The degree to which we've shattered records recently has been surprising.\"\n\nThis El Ni\u00f1o was historically strong\n\nIn a monthly update on what is known as the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, scientists at NOAA wrote Thursday they know El Ni\u00f1o is over because unusual warmth that developed in Pacific Ocean surface waters last year has waned. El Ni\u00f1o is in place when warm waters pool along the equator in the eastern and central Pacific, triggering changes in trade wind speeds and direction and releasing heat and moisture into the atmosphere.\n\nThose Pacific waters got as much as 3.6 degrees F warmer than normal this winter, an indication of what climate scientists consider to be a historically strong El Ni\u00f1o episode. During the 2015-2016 El Ni\u00f1o, which pushed the planet to what were then record-setting average temperatures, Pacific waters warmed as much as 4.7 degrees F.\n\nThat ocean warmth has domino effects on weather patterns around the world, causing extreme heat waves and drought in some areas, and flooding storms in others. The effects were evident across much of the world over the past year.\n\nFor example, the hot, humid air rising from that region of the Pacific is known for sending wet and stormy weather eastward - something linked to a surge in dengue cases in Peru and to a second-straight rainy winter in California. Other extremes El Ni\u00f1o is known for also developed in earnest: Floods in Kenya that killed scores of people and extreme heat waves across Southeast Asia.\n\nNow, sea surface temperatures in the El Ni\u00f1o linked zones of the Pacific have been steadily cooling and are close to average.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o is likely to flip quickly into La Ni\u00f1a\n\nThe world could soon switch to a set of opposite extremes. In the Thursday update, NOAA's Climate Prediction Center estimated about a 2-in-3 chance that La Ni\u00f1a forms sometime between July and September.\n\nLa Ni\u00f1a, as the inverse of El Ni\u00f1o, is tied to cooler-than-normal waters along the equator in the central and eastern Pacific.\n\nStrong episodes of El Ni\u00f1o frequently transition into La Ni\u00f1a because the oceanic heat associated with El Ni\u00f1o transfers into the atmosphere, and that eventually causes the Pacific waters to rapidly cool, said Johnson, a meteorologist at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in New Jersey.\n\nLa Ni\u00f1a has its own set of domino effects around the world, including wetter-than-normal conditions across Southeast Asia and Indonesia, dry conditions across the southern tier of the United States and cooler-than-normal temperatures in southern Asia, eastern Africa and western South America.\n\nPerhaps among the most significant La Ni\u00f1a impacts: An intensified Atlantic hurricane season. La Ni\u00f1a tends to decrease wind shear - differences in wind speeds and direction at varying altitudes - and that can allow tropical storms to more easily form and strengthen.\n\nAn expectation that La Ni\u00f1a is likely by fall prompted NOAA forecasters to warn this year's hurricane season could be among the most active on record.\n\nQuestions remain about global warming trends\n\nWhether La Ni\u00f1a's global cooling influence can counteract the recent spike in record-setting global heat could become clear in the coming months, scientists said.\n\nSo far, that appears to be the case, said Gavin Schmidt, director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Global temperature trends suggest a streak of record-hot months could grow to 13 once June is up, or perhaps end at the one-year mark, observed in May, he said.\n\nAnalyses suggest the warming trend may be realigning with what climate models tell scientists to expect, based on what they know about the influence of rising greenhouse gases on planetary temperatures, Schmidt said.\n\nBut if global temperatures continue to surpass scientists' expectations, \"that would be very indicative of a more systematic issue,\" Schmidt said in an email - meaning some influence on global warming that scientists have not yet been able to pinpoint. And that would mean a strong likelihood that 2024 replaces 2023 as the planet's hottest year on record.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"},

There is a 62% chance of at least one major hurricane making landfall somewhere on the U.S. coastline, with a 34% chance on the East Coast specifically, and a 42% chance on the Gulf Coast. There is also a 66% chance of a major hurricane tracking through the Caribbean. All of these values are higher than the measured average probability from 1880 to 2020.\"Given the combined hurricane-favorable signals of an extremely warm Atlantic and a likely developing La Nia, the forecast team has higher-than-normal confidence for an April outlook that the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season will be very active,\" forecasters wrote. \"This is the highest prediction for hurricanes that CSU has ever issued with their April outlook.\"SEE MORE: La Nina signals the potential for an active hurricane season aheadCSU develops its hurricane forecast using statistical models and historical data from other leading forecasters: the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, the UK Met Office, the Japan Meteorological Agency, and Italy's Centro Euro-Mediterraneo sui Cambiamenti Climatici. CSU will publish additional refined forecasts in June, July, August and November and will issue two-week forecasts from August through October, during the historical height of the Atlantic hurricane season.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will publish its own seasonal outlook in May.\n\nAnd get ready, because chances are high La Ni\u00f1a will be here during the peak of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season.\n\n\u27a4Tropics watch, June 13: Invest 90L moves off Florida. Gulf of Mexico disturbance could become tropical depression\n\nLet's explain what all that means and why it's so important for Florida residents -- or any location prone to hurricanes -- especially when it comes tropical cyclones.\n\nNOAA: El Ni\u00f1o is gone\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o, which means little boy in Spanish, is a weather pattern in the Pacific Ocean that influences weather worldwide, NOAA said.\n\nWarmer waters cause the Pacific jet stream to move south, bringing drier and warmer conditions to the northern U.S. and Canada. Along the U.S. Gulf Coast and Southeast, El Ni\u00f1o conditions mean wetter weather with an increased potential for flooding.\n\nOf particular interest to those living in hurricane-prone areas. El Ni\u00f1o conditions (usually) mean a \"substantially decreased chance of experiencing a hurricane.\"\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o contributes to more eastern and central Pacific hurricanes and fewer Atlantic hurricanes.\n\nStronger wind shear in the tropical Atlantic associated with El Ni\u00f1o also tends to mean fewer hurricanes since those conditions help prevent storms from developing or growing stronger.\n\nDuring El Ni\u00f1o, fewer hurricanes develop from easterly waves moving off the African coast, especially during the busiest months of hurricane season from mid-August through mid-October.\n\nLooking back 30 years, Philip Klotzbach, a meteorologist at Colorado State University who specializes in Atlantic basin seasonal hurricane forecasts, said that during El Ni\u00f1o years, there have been:\n\nENSO-neutral conditions now exist. What does that mean?\n\nNOAA announced \"ENSO-neutral conditions are present\" across the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean.\n\nENSO stands for the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation cycle.\n\nIf that didn't help much, let's explain.\n\n\"El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a are two opposing climate patterns\" which scientists call the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation cycle,\" NOAA said. Simply put, ENSO is made up of two phases: La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o. If you count the time when neither is present, then you have ENSO-neutral.\n\nBoth El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a change ocean temperatures and atmospheric circulation in the tropics, which have global impacts on weather, and typically last nine to 12 months. On average, El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events occur every two to seven years, with El Ni\u00f1o generally occurring more frequently than La Ni\u00f1a.\"\n\nThat's a good thing when it comes to Atlantic hurricanes. Here's why.\n\nLa Ni\u00f1a and its impact on Atlantic hurricane seasons\n\nLa Ni\u00f1a, which means little girl in Spanish, has the opposite effect of El Ni\u00f1o.\n\nDuring a La Ni\u00f1a year, winter temperatures are warmer than normal in the South and cooler than normal in the North. La Ni\u00f1a can also lead to a more severe hurricane season.\n\nLa Ni\u00f1a contributes to fewer eastern and central Pacific hurricanes and more Atlantic hurricanes.\n\n\"During La Ni\u00f1a, more hurricanes form in the deep tropics from African easterly waves and, therefore, have a greater likelihood of becoming major hurricanes that may eventually threaten the Caribbean Islands and the United States,\" NOAA said.\n\nA major hurricane is a Category 3, 4 or 5 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of at least 111 mph.\n\nLa Ni\u00f1a decreases wind shear in the Atlantic, which increases the chances for the development and strengthening of tropical cyclones.\n\nLooking back 30 years, Klotzbach, said that during La Ni\u00f1a years, there have been:\n\nLa Ni\u00f1a expected to develop July-September\n\nThe peak of the Atlantic hurricane season runs from mid-August through mid-October.\n\nThere's a 65% chance La Ni\u00f1a will develop from July through September and there's an 85% La Ni\u00f1a will persist from November through January, NOAA said.\n\nAnd that's why forecasters are predicting a very active 2024 Atlantic hurricane season\n\nThe presence of La Ni\u00f1a is a big factor in why every forecasting agency has been predicting a very active Atlantic hurricane season this year.\n\nIt doesn't help we're seeing record warm water temperatures in the Atlantic, which also provide fuel for tropical cyclones.\n\nNOAA said May 2024 was the 14th consecutive month of record-warm global ocean temperatures.\n\nWhat are the names for the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season?\n\nTime is running out to buy tax-free hurricane supplies for June 2024\n\nTwo days remain to take advantage of Florida's hurricane supplies tax-free holiday.\n\nThe first two-week sales tax holidays ends Friday, June 14.\n\nIf you miss it, a second sales tax holiday will run from Aug. 24 through Sept. 6.\n\nBasic hurricane kit: Can't afford generator, weeks of food?

While most climate models indicate the arrival of a La Ni\u00f1a, the time frame remains a bit murky.\n\nNOAA believes there is a greater than 60% chance of returning to a La Ni\u00f1a state by late summer, but some forecasters believe it could be later in the year before water temperatures cool to greater than -0.5 degrees Celsius below normal.\n\nHowever, experts at Colorado State University and many others consider the impending La Ni\u00f1a to play a significant role in intensifying the 2024 hurricane season.\n\nResearchers said they expect 23 named storms to form in 2024, with 11 that could reach hurricane status. Five of the 11 hurricanes are expected to reach major hurricane status with winds of at least 115 mph.\n\nAs we exit hurricane season at the end of the year and march toward fall and winter, the La Ni\u00f1a phase typically correlates to dry weather in the southern U.S. and cooler, wetter weather in the Pacific Northwest and parts of the North.\n\nIt would be the opposite of what we've generally seen this past El Ni\u00f1o winter.\n\nCalifornia took the brunt of several storms - many of them atmospheric river storms - leaving much of the state well above average for precipitation.\n\nAs the strong Pacific jet stream persistently hugged the South, several rainstorms have pushed through Texas and the Gulf Coast. Florida suffered through one of its cloudiest December-January periods on record, according to data from Alaska climatologist Brian Brettschneider.\n\nMeanwhile, aside from a strong polar-vortex-fed arctic outbreak in mid-January, it was a very mild winter across the nation's northern tier.\n\nMinneapolis had just 29.5 inches of snow - nearly 22 inches below average - and people were able to play golf and install swimming pools during the winter in a region more well-known for subzero temperatures and snowstorms. Swimming and golf may be relegated back to more of a summertime event if La Nina gets a hold of next winter.", "source": {"uri": "foxweather.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Weather"},

This makes global wheat and corn prices less likely to be affected by La Ni\u00f1a or El Ni\u00f1o, said Bill Weatherburn, senior climate and commodities economist at Capital Economics.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o is a natural warming of eastern and central Pacific Ocean surface temperatures, while La Ni\u00f1a is characterized by colder temperatures in the equatorial Pacific region.\n\n\"La Ni\u00f1a correlates with warm and dry weather across North America (Midwest US), East Asia (China) and parts of South America (Argentina and parts of Brazil) during the growing season,\" Maxar meteorologist Chris Hyde said.\n\nHowever, for crops spanning South Africa (maize), South and Southeast Asia (India's sugarcane and wheat), and Australia, La Ni\u00f1a is supportive due to high rainfall and can contribute to crops performing well as a result, aside from flooding risks, Isaac Hankes, senior weather analyst at London Stock Exchange Group, said.\n\nWeather experts note that these correlations are influenced by the timing and intensity of La Ni\u00f1a.\n\nOther agencies, such as the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and Japan's weather bureau also noted an end to the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon and forecast La Ni\u00f1a to form this year.\n\nFor India, the shift from El Ni\u00f1o to La Ni\u00f1a likely brings a wetter monsoon, but another phenomenon called the IOD (Indian Oscillation Dipole) can influence rainfall intensity, AccuWeather's lead international forecaster Jason Nicholls said.\n\nAn IOD-positive event leads to a wetter summer monsoon, while a negative IOD event leads to less moisture and drier conditions, Nicholls added. -- Reuters", "source": {"uri": "gmanetwork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GMA Network"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Canada's deadliest wildfires on record bathed skylines in smoke from Minnesota to New York. In Texas and Arizona, hundreds of people lost their lives to heat, while in Vermont, flash floods caused damages equivalent to those from a hurricane.\n\nForecasts suggest that this year's upcoming \"danger season\" has its own catastrophes in store. On May 23, scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season could be the most prolific yet. A week earlier, they released a seasonal map predicting blistering temperatures across almost the entire country.\n\nOne driving force behind these projections is the alternating Pacific Ocean climate patterns known as El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a, which can create huge shifts in temperature and precipitation across the North and South American continents. After almost a year of El Ni\u00f1o, La Ni\u00f1a is expected to take the reins sometime during the upcoming summer months. As climate change cooks the planet and the Pacific shifts between these two cyclical forces, experts say the conditions could be ripe for more extreme weather events.\n\n\"We've always had this pattern of El Ni\u00f1o, La Ni\u00f1a.

La Ni\u00f1a conditions are predicted to take hold over the Pacific Ocean as soon as July, setting the stage to affect our weather here on land.\n\nThe Climate Prediction Center issued a La Ni\u00f1a watch Thursday. The group of national forecasters say there's a 65% chance La Ni\u00f1a forms between July and September. Chances increase even more as we move later into the year.\n\nOdds are La Ni\u00f1a will be with us as we move into peak hurricane season. La Ni\u00f1a years are associated with more hurricanes and more damaging storms in the Atlantic basin.\n\nThis year appears likely to follow that pattern. Experts are predicting a record-breaking \"hyperactive\" 2024 season of tropical storms and hurricanes.\n\n\"The likelihood of a La Ni\u00f1a coupled with record warm sea surface temperatures is the reason the National Hurricane Center is forecasting an extraordinary hurricane season,\" said Kathie Dello, North Carolina's state climatologist. \"States from Texas to Maine are making preparations for an active year.\"\n\nLa Ni\u00f1a typically reaches its peak in the winter. That's when it will likely have the strongest impact on weather patterns.\n\nA La Ni\u00f1a winter usually means dry, warmer-than-average conditions across the southern half of the country. Past La Ni\u00f1a years have contributed to severe drought conditions in California and the Southwest.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pacific Northwest and Ohio Valley tend to get more precipitation, and northern states can see extra-cold weather.\n\nWhen we're in a La Ni\u00f1a, water along the Pacific coast is also colder and more nutrient dense, according the National Ocean Service. That's also good news for marine life, like salmon and squid, that live along the West Coast.\n\nBetween now and whenever La Ni\u00f1a officially takes over, we're in a situation described as \"ENSO neutral,\" meaning neither El Ni\u00f1o nor La Ni\u00f1a is in place.

That may have important effects on the 2024 hurricane season and next winter.\n\nA near year-long stretch of El Ni\u00f1o comes to a close: El Ni\u00f1o, the periodic warming of water in the eastern and central Pacific Ocean near the equator, first began last June. After peaking in late November and December, ocean temperatures in this zone have dipped below the threshold of what's considered at least weak El Ni\u00f1o conditions.\n\nWe are now in what's considered neutral conditions, meaning sea-surface temperatures for the equatorial Pacific Ocean as a whole are close to average.\n\nIn the side-by-side comparison below, you can see how cooler-than-average sea-surface temperatures (blue shadings) signifying El Ni\u00f1o's demise have grown more widespread in equatorial Pacific Ocean since March. This is because a reservoir of cooler water worked its way upward from below the surface, replacing some of El Ni\u00f1o's warmer-than-average waters (orange shadings).\n\nThe forecast: According to the latest outlook from NOAA's Climate Prediction Center, there is a 65% chance La Ni\u00f1a - the periodic cooling of that same stretch of equatorial Pacific ocean water - will develop between July and September, which includes the heart of the hurricane season. The chance La Ni\u00f1a will persist into late fall and winter is 85% for November through January.\n\n(For even more granular weather data tracking in your area, view your 15-minute details forecast in our Premium Pro experience.)\n\nWhy this matters: These changes in ocean temperatures can affect weather patterns thousands of miles away, including near the U.S. While far from the only driver of the weather pattern, here are some impacts you could see in this transition to La Ni\u00f1a:\n\n- Increased chance of a hot summer in the central and eastern U.S.\n\n- A warmer, drier winter 2024-25 in the South, colder winter in the Northern Plains and wetter winter in the Pacific Northwest.\n\n(Further beef up your forecast with our detailed, hour-by-hour breakdown for the next 8 days - only available on our Premium Pro experience.)\n\nIs it weird to go from a strong El Ni\u00f1o to La Ni\u00f1a? According to NOAA's Tom Di Liberto in a February 2024 ENSO blog, a La Ni\u00f1a followed an El Ni\u00f1o event more than half the time. Di Liberto also noted five of the eight strong El Ni\u00f1os since 1950 were quickly followed by a La Ni\u00f1a.\n\n- How Past Hurricanes Seasons Have Turned Out After Change To La Ni\u00f1a\n\n- Summer 2024 Outlook\n\nChris Dolce has been a senior meteorologist with weather.com for over 10 years after beginning his career with The Weather Channel in the early 2000s.\n\nJonathan Erdman is a senior meteorologist at weather.com and has been covering national and international weather since 1996.

As a result, Namibia cannot make money by exporting yellow cakes abroad.\n\nWe need to have honest discussions regarding nuclear energy and uranium enrichment in Namibia.\n\nThere is now only one nuclear power facility in Africa, South Africa's Koeberg Nuclear Power Station, which has two reactors, according to the World Nuclear Industry Status Report and Statista Research Department.\n\nGlobally, 32 countries are home to 440 nuclear reactors that are currently operational. With 94 nuclear power reactors operating at the time, the United States had the biggest nuclear power reactor fleet.\n\nOut of all countries in the world, France generates the most electricity through nuclear power. Approximately 65% of electricity produced in the European nation comes from nuclear sources.\n\nIn the US, by contrast, less than 20% of electricity is generated from nuclear power.\n\nAn estimated 10,3% of the world's electricity is produced by nuclear power; 32 countries get up to 75% of their total electricity from 440 nuclear installations.\n\nMoreover, 50 countries' 220 research reactors employ nuclear energy.\n\nAbout 80% of all electricity must be low-carbon by 2050, according to projections from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in order to meet the 2\u00b0C target.\n\nNuclear power, which is the second-largest source of low-carbon power globally after hydropower, generates around 28% of all low-carbon power. Thus, Namibia has no reason to not be able to establish nuclear power plants in the same manner.\n\nThe implementation of nuclear power plant reactions cannot be accelerated in Namibia because there is no defined nuclear policy in place.\n\nCreating a new nuclear policy includes limiting the use of the nation's uranium, developing the fundamental components of nuclear infrastructure, evaluating the feasibility of introducing nuclear power into Namibia's energy mix and a fund for the management of radioactive waste must be established. Additionally, exporting raw minerals must be prohibited.\n\nIt is critical to recognise that Namibia has not explored nuclear energy in its present national development programme (NDP) and as the country prepares to introduce NDP6, it should be evident what goals and expectations Namibia has for the remaining period of Namibia's long-term vision, Vision 2030.\n\nThe country's current power consumption, at 750 megawatts, is deemed insufficient by the Electricity Control Board as it falls short of the 1 000 megawatts required for a nuclear facility to be economically viable. Potentially smaller 300 megawatt power plants could be built to meet the immediate need for electricity.\n\nThe country's arm of Russian nuclear giant Rosatom is working towards the construction of Namibia's first nuclear power plant.\n\nDeveloping a new nuclear power plant in Namibia would be complicated and take longer than expected.\n\nAlthough building nuclear power facilities will need significant investment, Namibians would likely incur more of the costs.\n\nWith the substantial amount of capital required for a nuclear power plant, cautious financial planning and management are essential.\n\nThe process of constructing a new nuclear power plant involves complex obstacles that can lead to delays and cost overruns.\n\nEvery facet of building a nuclear power plant is closely inspected from a security and safety standpoint.\n\nThe main obstacles to nuclear fission technology in Namibia are a lack of infrastructure and technical capability, obstacles to funding and investment, difficulties with policies and regulations and public perception and worries about nuclear security and safety.\n\nNamibia has to prepare its approach to developing nuclear energy infrastructure and capacity.\n\nGrowing and maintaining a successful nuclear power plant in Namibia will also require investments in workforce development and regulatory frameworks.\n\nBecause the energy sector requires high initial investment, specialised technology, particular workforce skills and a long-term horizon, it can be difficult for local companies to readily participate.\n\nGovernments have the potential to play a major role in achieving net zero by implementing effective risk management systems, enforcing credible commitments and getting involved in the construction phase if private actors aren't maximizing the project's potential.\n\nNamibia faces many difficulties, including low economic growth, high unemployment, low foreign earnings, a huge trade deficit and a high rate of capital flight as a result of imported electricity.\n\nBoth national water security and food security are adversely affected by the current state of inadequate energy security. It is a major deterrent to investments and industrialisation, as well as a major obstacle to the creation of sustainable jobs.\n\nNamibia must prioritise investments in nuclear energy, revise its policy on the optimal use of earth resources, establish a post-mining site rehabilitation fund, maximise benefits to local companies, develop human capacity, direct research, development and application efforts and uphold equity if it hopes to take the lead in the energy sector.\n\nThe current condition of inadequate security has detrimental effects on the social and economic spheres.\n\nIt is a significant barrier to the establishment of long-term jobs and acts as a deterrent to investment and industrialisation.\n\nInvesting in nuclear power facilities stimulates the development of technological skills and opens up job possibilities, which boosts local economies.\n\nAdopting nuclear power has the ability to propel prosperity and progress throughout the southern regions as Namibia moves forward.\n\nConclusively, international collaboration with countries possessing nuclear experience can offer invaluable expertise, facilitate information sharing and foster the advancement of nuclear industry capacity.\n\nThe building of a nuclear power plant will have a significant positive impact on Namibia's sustainable development, energy security and economic growth.\n\nThus, with a well-thought-out plan, Namibia may reap the benefits of nuclear power while mitigating any potential negatives, paving the way for a more optimistic and sustainable energy future.", "source": {"uri": "namibian.com.na", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Namibian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josef_sheehama@namibian.com.na", "name": "Josef Sheehama", "type": "author",

However, calls for a return to nuclear energy in the country are growing louder.\n\nIn December, the Spanish government approved a radioactive waste plan for decommissioning nuclear facilities and set a timetable for the closure of nuclear power plants between 2027 and 2035.\n\nHowever, there are opponents to the closure, such as the president of Foro Nuclear, Ignacio Araluce. He said that the plants \"are necessary for the system\" in Spain.\n\nGetting EU support for nuclear off the ground\n\nSmall modular reactors are nuclear reactors that are smaller in both power and physical size compared to traditional gigawatt-scale power plants.\n\nThe commission wants to support their development to help cut carbon emissions but this is a technological race with China, the United States and Russia that the EU is only just entering.\n\nIn February, the commission launched a European Industrial Alliance for small modular reactions to bring together governments and industry players to accelerate the development of the technology.\n\nInnovation in the nuclear sector also extends to waste management. The Dutch start-up Thorizon will receive a \u20ac10 million ($11 million) grant from the French government.\n\nThe Amsterdam-based company wants to accelerate the development of a small nuclear reactor that uses nuclear waste from regular power plants as fuel.\n\nAccording to the company, one such plant could provide clean energy to 250,000 households. The new nuclear reactor should be more sustainable, cheaper and safer than conventional nuclear reactors.\n\nThe EU commission also agreed to a \u20ac2 billion subsidy from the Dutch government for the construction of a new nuclear reactor in the Dutch village of Petten.\n\nThe reactor - which won't generate electricity - is intended to develop and store medical radioisotopes for cancer treatment.\n\nChanging times in Franco-Italian nuclear steel agreement\n\nIn July, the French electricity group EDF announced a nuclear cooperation agreement with the federation of steel industries in Italy to speed up the decarbonization of the sector in a country that has been nuclear-free for almost 35 years.\n\nThe agreement aims at \"promoting cooperation in the use of nuclear energy to boost the competitiveness and decarbonization of the Italian steel industry\", EDF said in a press release. The steel industry is a major emitter of greenhouse gases.\n\nThe deal was signed with Italian energy company Edison, Italian power plant manufacturer Ansaldo Energia, nuclear technology developer Ansaldo Nucleare and Federacciai, the Italian steel industry federation.\n\nItaly has not produced nuclear energy since the 1990s, following the country's decision in a 1987 referendum to withdraw from civil nuclear power after the Chernobyl accident.\n\nOn April 26, 1986, reactor four of the then-Soviet nuclear power plant Chernobyl in northern Ukraine exploded. The accident is considered the largest nuclear disaster in the civilian use of nuclear power.\n\nDue to the radioactivity, large areas of land around the nuclear power plant in what is now Ukraine and neighbouring Belarus were closed off and tens of thousands of people were forcibly relocated. Thousands of people died as a result of radioactive contamination.\n\nThe content of this article is based on reporting by AFP, ANP, ANSA, dpa, EFE, and Europa Press as part of the European Newsroom

The most cost-effective way for Namibia to boost energy security and resilience while diversifying its sources of electricity generation is through nuclear power.\n\nNamibia is the third-largest producer of uranium in the world and the largest producer in Africa, yet it has no nuclear power plant reactors. Instead, practically all of Namibia's electricity demands are met by South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Zambia. As a result, Namibia cannot make money by exporting yellow cake abroad. We need to have honest discussions regarding nuclear energy and uranium enrichment in Namibia.\n\nThere is now only one nuclear power facility in Africa, South Africa's Koeberg Nuclear Power Station, which has two reactors according to the World Nuclear Industry Status Report and Statista Research Department. Globally, 32 countries are home to 440 nuclear reactors that are currently operational. With 94 nuclear power reactors operating at the time, the United States has the largest nuclear power reactor fleet. Out of all countries in the world, France generates the most electricity from nuclear power.\n\nNuclear power, which is the second-largest source of low-carbon power globally after hydropower, generates around 28% of all low-carbon power. Thus, Namibia has no reason not to be able to establish nuclear power plants in the same manner as over 32 other nations.\n\nUnfortunately, the implementation of nuclear power cannot be accelerated in Namibia because there is no defined nuclear policy in place. In order to create a new nuclear policy that includes limiting the use of the nation's uranium, developing the fundamental components of nuclear infrastructure, and evaluating the feasibility of introducing nuclear power into Namibia's energy mix, a fund for the management of radioactive waste must be established.\n\nIt is critical to recognize that Namibia has not explored nuclear energy in its present National Development Plan and as the country prepares to introduce NDP6, it should be evident what goals and expectations Namibia has for the remaining period of Vision 2030. The country's current power consumption, at 750 megawatts, is deemed insufficient by the Electricity Control Board (ECB) and falls short of the 1000 megawatts required for a nuclear facility to be economically viable.\n\nTo overcome this threshhold, smaller 300 megawatt power plants could be built to meet the immediate need for electricity. The country's arm of Russian nuclear giant Rosatom, Headspring Investments, is working on the construction of Namibia's first nuclear power plant despite the absence of a formal nuclear policy.\n\nIt's critical to recognize that developing a new nuclear power plant in Namibia would be complicated and take longer than expected. Also, building a nuclear power plant will need significant investment, indicating that cautious financial planning and management are essential to avoid financial strain.\n\nIn addition, the process of constructing a new nuclear power plant involves complex obstacles that can lead to delays and cost overruns. Every facet of building a nuclear power plant is closely inspected from a security and safety standpoint. The main obstacles to nuclear fission technology in Namibia are a lack of infrastructure and technical capability, obstacles to funding and investment, difficulties with policies and regulations, and public perception which include worries about nuclear security and safety.\n\nGrowing and maintaining a successful nuclear power plant will require significant investments in infrastructure, workforce development, and regulatory frameworks. Because the complex energy sector requires high initial investment, specialized technology, particular workforce skills, and a long-term horizon, it can be difficult for local companies to readily participate.\n\nMoreover, governments have the potential to play a major role in achieving net zero by implementing effective risk management systems, enforcing credible commitments, and getting involved in the construction phase if private actors aren't maximizing the project's potential. Namibia faces many difficulties, including low economic growth, high unemployment, low foreign earnings, a huge trade deficit, and a high rate of capital flight as a result of imported electricity.\n\nBoth national water security and food security are adversely affected by the current state of inadequate energy security. It is a major deterrent to investments and industrialization, as well as a major obstacle to the creation of sustainable jobs. Namibia must prioritize investments in nuclear energy, revise its policy on the optimal use of earth resources, establish a post-mining rehabilitation fund, maximize benefits to local companies, and develop human capacity and research.\n\nIn conclusion, international collaboration with countries possessing nuclear experience can offer invaluable expertise, facilitate information sharing, and foster the advancement of a local nuclear industry. Building the first nuclear power plant will have a significant positive impact on Namibia's development, achieving energy security, and boosting economic growth.\n\nThus, with a well-thought-out plan, Namibia may reap the benefits of nuclear power while mitigating any potential negatives, paving the way for a more optimistic and sustainable energy future.", "source": {"uri": "economist.com.na",

Though non-nuclear Iran would suffer the greater harm if Israel were left with no intra-war choice but to launch nuclear weapons, the more powerful Jewish state could still suffer the grievous consequences of Iranian errors or miscalculations.\n\nIn any direct and protracted war with Iran, nuclear Israel would be in a reassuring position of \"escalation dominance.\" But there could also be a distressing \"fly in the ointment.\" The sole foreseeable factor that could impair Israel's escalation advantage would be North Korean military support for Iran. This is because Iran's belligerent ally in Pyongyang is already nuclear and Israel is a \"50 target state\" -- a state with no meaningful strategic depth.\n\nThe apt remedy for Israel should be an immediate policy shift from \"deliberate nuclear ambiguity\" (amimut in Hebrew) to \"selective nuclear disclosure.\" Until now, nuclear ambiguity has managed to work. Though this success has seemingly done little to deter conventional aggression or acts of terror, it has kept the country's enemies from launching any potentially existential aggressions.\n\nTo be suitably deterred, Iran would require verifiable assurances that Israel's nuclear weapons were effectively invulnerable and also \"penetration-capable.\" This second expectation means that Israel's nuclear weapons would not only be adequately protected from adversarial first strikes but could also \"punch through\" Iran's active defenses. In essence, an immediate end to \"deliberate nuclear ambiguity\" could prove indispensable to Israel's security from Iran and perhaps North Korea.\n\nIran's judgments concerning Israel's ultimate willingness to engage with nuclear weapons would depend on acquiring useable foreknowledge of these weapons as well as their operational capabilities. Ironically, Iranian perceptions of solely mega-destructive, high-yield Israeli nuclear weapons could undermine the credibility of Israel's nuclear deterrent. Bringing an immediate end to \"deliberate nuclear ambiguity\" would represent the most promising Israeli corrective. Moreover, if Iran should ever decide to share some of its offensive nuclear assets with a surrogate jihadist terrorist group, Jerusalem would need to have prepared for the nuclear deterrence of determined sub-state adversaries.\n\nThe main point of any shift from deliberate nuclear ambiguity to selective nuclear disclosure would be to signal that Israel's \"bomb\" lies safely beyond any preemptive enemy reach and is adjustable to all possible levels of enemy aggression. Removing the bomb from the \"basement\" could enhance Israel's strategic deterrence to the extent that it would heighten enemy perceptions of secure and capable Israeli nuclear forces. Any properly calculated end to deliberate nuclear ambiguity could underscore Israel's willingness to use nuclear forces in reprisal for first-strike or retaliatory attacks. For now, among other things, any purposeful shift from deliberate nuclear ambiguity to selective nuclear disclosure would need to convince Iran of Israel's willingness to use nuclear forces against a determined non-nuclear aggressor.\n\nThough generally misunderstood, a \"Samson Option\" could gainfully support Israel's task of strategic dissuasion. For Jerusalem, the reinforcing benefits of \"Samson\" would lie not in any supposed eagerness to \"die with the Philistines,\" but in the Option's conspicuous deterrent advantages at the high-end of competition for \"escalation dominance.\" An explicitly-revealed Samson Option could multiply and magnify the survival benefits of selective nuclear disclosure not by pointlessly threatening Israeli spasms of revenge, but by expressly reminding Iran that Israel's nuclear force calibrations would remain functional at the eleventh hour.\n\nIn assessing its optimal levels of deliberate nuclear disclosure, Israel should continuously bear in mind the country's overriding strategic nuclear objective: deterrence ex ante, not revenge ex post. If, however, nuclear weapons should be introduced into a conflict with Iran (most plausibly via military participation by Iran's ally North Korea), one form or another of nuclear war-fighting could ensue.\n\nFor Israel, the correct time to end its traditional and outdated policy of \"deliberate nuclear ambiguity\" is the present. The intellectually barren argument that it has worked thus far and would therefore continue to work in the future is dangerously misleading. Left unrevised by a more carefully calculated and prudent Israeli nuclear policy, such an unscientific argument could propel the people of Israel into Dante's eternity of \"fire and ice.\" From this dreadful eternity, there could be neither escape nor sanctuary.", "source": {"uri": "israel365news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Israel365 News | Latest News.

Kennan, and the arms-control negotiator Gerard C. Smith to push for a change in America's nuclear policy.\n\nIn 1982, the Gang of Four published an article in the establishment organ Foreign Affairs calling on the U.S. to scrap plans to deploy nuclear weapons in the event of a Soviet invasion of Europe.\n\n\"It is time to recognize that no one has ever succeeded in advancing any persuasive reason to believe that any use of nuclear weapons, even on the smallest scale, could reliably be expected to remain limited,\" wrote the authors.\n\n\"There is no way for anyone to have any confidence that such a nuclear action will not lead to further and more devastating exchanges,\" they continued. As such, the authors called for the adoption of a no-first-use policy that would, in their view, \"bring new hope to everyone in every country whose life is shadowed by the hideous possibility of a third great twentieth-century conflict in Europe-conventional or nuclear.\"\n\nAmerican national security elites have traveled a long way in the wrong direction in this (and many other) matters since the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989. Indeed, political support for sane and ethical nuclear policies such as those advocated by the Gang of Four is virtually non-existent within the American political establishment in today's Washington.\n\nInstead, the nuclear policies pursued in conjunction with U.S. allies and non-allied \"friends\" such as Israel (with its undeclared stockpile of around 90 nuclear warheads) have made the world far less safe than it need be.\n\nAnd worryingly, solutions that once found support in establishment figures like Kennan are today often dismissed as the height of na\u00efvet\u00e9 among Washington's nuclear clerisy. Yet, as nuclear watchdog groups such as the Arms Control Association have argued, a no-first-use policy would clearly serve the national interest; after all, \"a clear US no-first-use policy would reduce the risk of Russian or Chinese nuclear miscalculation during a crisis by alleviating concerns about a devastating US nuclear first-strike.\"\n\nWhile a no-first-use policy is -- let's be honest -- nowhere on the horizon, there are other steps that a future Harris or Trump administration might take to lessen the already unacceptably high risks of nuclear catastrophe. One such move, suggested by prize-winning investigative journalist and author of the bestselling book Nuclear War: A Scenario, Anne Jacobsen, would be for the U.S. president to issue an executive order to rescind the current \"launch on warning\" policy which currently keeps American intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) on hair-trigger alert at all times. As Princeton University professor Frank von Hippel has written,\n\nLaunch on warning is controversial for two reasons: First, history has shown that false warnings do occur due to equipment failure and human error, and today there is the additional danger of hackers. Second, a launch-on-warning posture is indistinguishable from being constantly poised to mount a first strike, which pressures Russia and China to put their missiles on hair trigger as well. The United States would be on the receiving end for any mistaken launch one of them makes.\n\nA no-first-use policy would, perhaps, transform U.S. foreign policy in the eyes of the world -- a defensive nuclear policy, one that would be in keeping with St. Augustine's theory of just war (jus ad bellum) is one that is also morally defensible. It would also be in line with the pledge made in Geneva in 1985 by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev, that \"a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.\"", "source": {"uri": "theamericanconservative.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The American Conservative"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_w_carden@theamericanconservative.com", "name": "James W.

For some time, South Korea has grappled with the question of pursuing nuclear armament. However, the urgency of this decision is becoming more apparent, as postponement may no longer be a viable option.\n\nSouth Korea has thus far adhered to its commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and relied on its alliance with the United States, refraining from developing nuclear weapons despite having the necessary know-how and technical expertise. However, concerns about the effectiveness of the NPT in curbing nuclear proliferation, combined with uncertainties surrounding the U.S.-South Korea alliance -- exacerbated by trade tensions and discussions about potential reductions in U.S. military support -- are intensifying the debate.\n\nAn independent nuclear capability could provide South Korea with greater autonomy in its defense strategy, reducing reliance on external partners. North Korea's nuclear program has long progressed beyond its early stages, establishing itself as a significant nuclear power with a substantial arsenal. Despite various diplomatic efforts, North Korea has continued to expand its nuclear capabilities, potentially threatening South Korea and even the U.S. mainland. As North Korea's arsenal grows, doubts about the reliability of the U.S. nuclear umbrella have surfaced, with some in South Korea questioning whether the U.S. would risk its own security in a nuclear conflict to defend South Korea.\n\nAcquiring nuclear weapons could offer South Korea strategic leverage in its dealings with North Korea and other regional actors. By signaling a potential willingness to develop nuclear weapons, South Korea might encourage North Korea and its allies, including China, to engage more constructively in negotiations. This strategy could help halt North Korea's nuclear advancements and foster more effective denuclearization discussions.\n\nThe recent strategic partnership between North Korea and Russia, which includes mutual defense agreements, complicates the regional security landscape. This alliance could further entrench North Korea's nuclear status, prompting South Korea to explore a broader range of security options, potentially including the development of its own nuclear deterrent.\n\nPublic opinion in South Korea has shifted notably, with increasing support for a domestic nuclear capability. Polls indicate that a significant portion of the population favors this idea, driven by concerns about North Korea's nuclear threats and skepticism about the reliability of U.S. protection. This shift in public sentiment may reflect a growing national inclination toward considering nuclear armament as a defensive measure.\n\nThe possible return of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency has rekindled discussions about South Korea's nuclear options. During his previous term, Trump's unconventional foreign policy, particularly toward North Korea, raised concerns about U.S. defense commitments. His direct engagement with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and decisions like suspending joint military exercises with South Korea in 2018 alarmed many in Seoul, as these exercises are vital for maintaining readiness against potential aggression.\n\nIf re-elected, Trump might continue to prioritize direct engagement with North Korea, potentially at the expense of traditional deterrence strategies. This could include scaling back the U.S. military presence in South Korea unless Seoul significantly increases its financial contributions.\n\nWhile developing nuclear weapons could enhance South Korea's deterrence against North Korea, it also poses significant risks, including diplomatic and economic isolation. Such a move could provoke strong reactions from neighboring countries, particularly China and North Korea and potentially trigger a regional arms race. Japan, for instance, might feel compelled to develop its own nuclear arsenal, fundamentally altering the security dynamics in East Asia.\n\nFurthermore, South Korea's nuclearization would violate the NPT, likely resulting in international condemnation and potential economic sanctions. The U.S. might also impose sanctions if South Korea proceeds without proper coordination despite their alliance.\n\nThe decision to pursue nuclear weapons involves weighing substantial costs and international implications against the need for a reliable deterrent against North Korea, enhanced national security and strategic benefits. As South Korea navigates this complex issue, it finds parallels in India's nuclear journey. India's nuclear program was driven by security concerns, the desire for strategic autonomy and the aspiration to enhance its international standing. India sought to counterbalance the nuclear capabilities of China and Pakistan and establish itself as a regional power.\n\nSimilarly, South Korea has relied on the U.S. nuclear umbrella to counter North Korea's nuclear threat. However, the persistent and escalating threats have increased domestic support for an independent nuclear deterrent. South Korea seeks greater control over its national security, reducing dependence on the U.S. amid doubts about the credibility and sustainability of U.S. extended deterrence.\n\nIndia's experience offers valuable lessons for South Korea. Despite facing international backlash and sanctions following its nuclear tests in 1998, India managed to secure strategic partnerships with major powers, including the U.S. This suggests that the long-term benefits of nuclear deterrence can outweigh the short-term diplomatic and economic costs, providing a potential roadmap for South Korea.\n\nAs South Korea considers its nuclear future, there are several ways India could assist. India could offer diplomatic support, share its experiences in managing international sanctions and help establish post-nuclearization partnerships. Both nations could benefit from cooperation in nuclear safety, civilian nuclear energy and related fields. A collaborative approach to nuclear issues could enhance regional stability and security, balancing China's influence and addressing the North Korean threat. As strategic partners, India and South Korea can navigate potential international backlash and sanctions, potentially affecting their economies and global standing.\n\nIndia's support for South Korea's nuclear program could be seen as a strategic measure to counteract the increasing nuclear capabilities of North Korea and its strategic partnership with Russia. By supporting South Korea, India can contribute to a more balanced power structure in Asia and help create a stable and secure regional environment, reducing the risk of nuclear conflict.\n\nIndia's support for South Korea's nuclear program represents a strategic decision that could enhance regional security, balance geopolitical power in Asia and strengthen bilateral relations. Drawing from its nuclear history, India can provide South Korea with valuable guidance and support, contributing to a more stable and secure Asian continent.\n\nLakhvinder Singh is the director of

The only other time Congress created such a group was in 2008.\n\nBut China was a new concern. Western intelligence says Beijing has since 2020 launched a sudden expansion of its nuclear stockpile, amassing launchers and warheads without explanation.\n\nAlarm bells were ringing in Washington. The Cold War was a stand-off between two nuclear superpowers, and the US now fears China is on a highway to becoming a third.\n\nIn its October 2023 final report, the 12-person Commission painted the situation as dire.\n\n\"The new global environment is fundamentally different than anything experienced in the past, even in the darkest days of the Cold War,\" they said.\n\nThe commissioners recommended that the US consider its first nuclear expansion since the Cold War, including more warheads, delivery systems, defenses, and launchers.\n\nAll of this underlines a deeper anxiety among leading experts that the international arena, fixated for decades on the post-9/11 war on terror, is now tilting relentlessly back to an era of nuclear build-up and brinkmanship.\n\nBusiness Insider asked 10 nuclear scholars -- including four Commissioners -- and US-China relations experts on how the US should act.\n\nThey agreed that if global trends do not dramatically reverse, the world is poised to live under the shadow of nuclear threat again.\n\nSeveral prominent arms control scholars have criticized the Commission's report, fearing an arms race that they feel is unnecessary and will escalate the risk of annihilating humanity.\n\nBut signs are showing that the US government feels a build-up may have to be considered. In a speech on Thursday, Vipin Narang, the Defense Department's senior official overseeing nuclear policy, said that \"we now find ourselves in nothing short of a new nuclear age.\"\n\nIt's a looming future that some experts feel is being dismissed in the US, especially among younger generations born after the Soviet Union's collapse.\n\n\"All of the trend lines are going in the wrong direction. So I think we are moving toward a much more dangerous world than it is today,\" said James Acton, co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\"And it's certainly possible that in the future, it could be as dangerous, if not more dangerous, than the original Cold War,\" he said.\n\nAt the crux of the US' concerns is what American leaders call the Two-Peer Problem.\n\nThe US is worried it will need to simultaneously counter two of its equals on the nuclear playing field, when it traditionally only had the power to fight one -- namely, the Soviet Union.\n\nBeijing is reported to be rapidly increasing its stockpile to an estimated 500 warheads in 2023, up from 400 in 2022.\n\nAt that rate, China will have 1,550 warheads -- putting it on par with US and Russian capabilities -- by 2035.\n\nThat would be the Two-Peer Problem: A three-way tie that experts fear will shatter the past basis for nuclear negotiations.\n\nA simple way to understand this dilemma is to look at the numbers.\n\nThe US and Russia previously agreed to limit arsenals to 1,550 deployed warheads each.\n\nIf China were to reach parity, Washington would want an arsenal matching Moscow's and Beijing's combined, or theoretically 3,100 warheads.\n\nRussia and China are more likely to think the appropriate equilibrium is for everyone to deploy 1,550 warheads each. However, given their close ties, the US is unlikely to accept such an agreement.\n\nWith no common number to reach, the three powers will be prone to rushing to gain the upper hand, Acton said.\n\n\"Once this arms race really kicks off, I think it's going to be very, very, very hard to stop it,\" he added.\n\nBy its calculations, Washington now has only 11 years to find and establish a solution by 2035. That's a short window for nuclear programs, which are generally rolled out over decades, not years.\n\n\"Decisions need to be made now,\" wrote the Commission.\n\nThe recommendations in its report included putting multiple warheads on one intercontinental ballistic missile (known as MIRV), building more B-21 stealth bombers, and basing nuclear weapons in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nIt also advised the US to look into more tactical nukes, which are lower-yield bombs that Russia stockpiles by the thousands. The report made no recommendations on numbers.\n\nRose Gottemoeller, one of the 12 Commissioners, emphasized to BI that the report only asked the US to begin planning for an expansion, not to pull the trigger on a build-up now.\n\n\"We have the opportunity between now and 2035 to try to get Russia back to the negotiating table and to get China to start talking to us about controlling nuclear weapons,\" said Gottemoeller, NATO's deputy secretary-general from 2016 to 2019 and the former US chief negotiator with Russia on nuclear programs.\n\nWashington and Moscow held nuclear talks for decades during the Cold War and beyond, but China has not engaged in such discussion so far.\n\nThat's unacceptable to the US. \"They're not obligated to agree to anything specific, but they are obligated to negotiate in good faith, and they have certainly not done that,\" said Marshall Billingslea, former US special presidential envoy for arms control and one of the 12 Commissioners.\n\nRussia, meanwhile, spent the last two years making nuclear threats over the war in Ukraine.\n\nTo scholars supporting a US nuclear expansion, the situation has deteriorated so drastically that the time to simply hope for negotiations has passed. America must act, they told BI.\n\n\"I think when the United States is strong, our adversaries think: 'Okay, this is dangerous. We don't want to get into a conflict with the United States,'\" Matt Kroenig, a professor at Georgetown University's government studies department. He was also one of the 12 Commissioners.\n\n\"When the United States is weak, that's when you see aggression and violence,\" he added.\n\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry and embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment sent by BI.\n\nScholars who disagree said the US is looking at the Two-Peer Problem incorrectly.\n\nNuclear weapons are widely understood as the ultimate defense against existential threats like invasion, and these experts say the US can maintain that even if it has fewer nuclear weapons.\n\n\"We should focus on keeping our nuclear arsenal survivable, safe, secure, and reliable,\" said Acton of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"We don't need to compete with them numerically. It won't enhance deterrence to do so.\"\n\nFrancesca Giovannini, executive director of the Project on Managing the Atom at Harvard University's Kennedy School, said that while official US-China nuclear talks are frozen, academics and non-governmental organizations are still trying to keep the dialogue flowing.\n\nHowever, she told BI that the White House's past moves, such as withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002, have sowed doubt in Beijing that the US will keep to its arms control commitments.\n\n\"These examples come back often in dialogue,\" she said. \"In China, arms control is increasingly seen as a mechanism devised by the United States to constrain China's rising military power.\"\n\nThat has made talk of arms control an increasingly dangerous line for Chinese experts to defend in the domestic debate, Giovannini added.\n\n\"For many, the United States is a non-reliable interlocutor and a political mess, especially Congress,\" she said.\n\nLyle Goldstein, director of the China Initiative at Brown University, said that in China, senior strategists already believe Beijing's nuclear build-up is a response to US aggression, not the other way round.\n\n\"I said: 'Are you seriously thinking about limited nuclear war?' And they said yes, emphatically yes. They said: 'We are thinking about it because you are thinking about it,'\" Goldstein said.\n\nGreg Weaver, a former deputy director for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the fundamental argument for a nuclear expansion is that the US must show that it can credibly defend itself and its allies.\n\n\"If someone launched a large-scale attack on the United States, there's no question we would annihilate them in response,\" said Weaver, an advisor to the Commission.\n\n\"But that's not our strategy. We extend nuclear deterrence to about 35 countries in Europe and Asia. Credible extended deterrence requires different capabilities than it does to just deter attacks directly on the United States,\" he added.\n\nSome scholars like Weaver have championed a few additions to US nuclear forces, such as a cruise missile that can deliver a warhead from a submarine.\n\nBut those additional programs come at a cost. The US is already estimated to spend $1.5 trillion in the next 30 years on modernizing its aging nuclear forces -- which most experts agree must be done.\n\nGoldstein of Brown University fears that money will be siphoned from other pressing domestic interests.\n\n\"Schools and hospitals and high-speed rails and all the things that we'd like to have in our country. We don't have them. One reason is because we're spending trillions on nuclear weapons,\" he said.\n\nDavid Kearn, who studied missiles for RAND and advised the Defense Secretary's office from 2016 to 2017, believes nuclear spending will distract from conventional weapons development.\n\nIn July, a congressional review found that the US was already unprepared to fight a war against either China or Russia.\n\n\"They're saying the sea-launched cruise missile would be $12 billion. That could be almost two attack submarines. I'll take the two attack subs, please,\" said Kearn, now an associate professor of politics at St. John's University.\n\nAnalysts like Weaver say the Pentagon only spends a small fraction of its annual defense budget on nuclear weapons, and that the US can reasonably achieve a more powerful nuclear deterrent with prudent spending.\n\n\"We can do it if it's the priority,\" said Rebeccah Heinrichs, one of the 12 Commissioners and director of the Hudson Institute's Keystone Defense Initiative. \"But if climate change, for example, competes with the priority to maintain the peace and deter China and Russia, it will prevent us from doing it.\"\n\nDespite growing signs of an uncontrollable arms race, several experts said they feel public focus on the issue has been strangely absent.\n\n\"I think it's generational,\" Kroenig said. \"Even when I was in graduate school in the early 2000s, I had many of my advisors saying: 'Nuclear weapons? That's a Cold War issue. That's ancient history. Study something relevant like terrorism or insurgency.'\"\n\nGiovannini said organizations studying nuclear weapons are struggling to recruit young analysts and students. \"They are more interested in the artificial intelligence space than nuclear weapons,\" she said.\n\nAs 2035 approaches, experts can see a future with three nuclear superpowers and almost zero negotiation.\n\n\"I'm afraid unless we can get talks on track, we will be back to where we were in the 1950s,\" said Gottemoeller. \"When governments simply weren't willing to talk to each other about this.\"\n\n\"And what did it produce?\" she said. \"A severe crisis. The Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, when we came to the brink of nuclear annihilation.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider India"}, "authors": [],

This figure remains unchanged from the previous year. In contrast, support for solar and wind power remains higher but has seen a significant decline since 2020.\n\nWhile 78% of Americans favour expanding solar power and 72% support wind power, these numbers have dropped by double digits since 2020. This decline is primarily driven by a decrease in Republican support for these renewable energy sources. However, support for nuclear power has grown by 13 percentage points during the same period.\n\nAmericans are divided on the federal government's role in promoting nuclear energy. According to a March 2023 Pew survey, 41% believe the government should encourage nuclear energy production, while 22% think it should be discouraged. Meanwhile, 36% feel the government should not influence the matter either way.\n\nThe May survey highlights significant gender differences in attitudes toward nuclear power. Men are much more likely than women to support the expansion of nuclear power plants in the U.S., with 70% of men in favour compared to 44% of women. This trend is consistent across political affiliations.\n\nGlobal Gender Perspectives\n\nGlobally, gender differences in support for nuclear energy are also evident. A Pew survey conducted from fall 2019 to spring 2020 found that in 18 of the 20 surveyed regions, men were more likely than women to favour using more nuclear power as a domestic energy source.\n\nPOLITICAL PARTY VIEWS ON NUCLEAR ENERGY\n\nRepublicans are generally more supportive of nuclear power than Democrats. Two-thirds of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents support expanding nuclear power, compared to about half of Democrats and Democratic leaners. This partisan gap in support has persisted since 2016.\n\nSupport for nuclear power has increased among both Republicans and Democrats over the past few years. Since 2020, Republican support has grown by 14 points, while Democratic support has increased by 12 points. Despite these gains, Democrats remain evenly divided on the issue, with 49% in favour and 49% opposed.\n\nWithin the Republican Party, younger members tend to support renewable energy sources like solar and wind more than their older counterparts. However, the reverse is true for nuclear energy. Republicans under 30 are less likely to support expanding nuclear power compared to those aged 65 and older (61% vs. 72%).\n\nThe United States currently operates 94 nuclear power reactors, including a new one that began operations in Georgia this spring. These reactors generated 18.6% of all U.S. electricity in 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nNearly half of these reactors (48) are located in the South, with 22 in the Midwest, 18 in the Northeast, and 6 in the West, based on data from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\nThe number of U.S. reactors has declined from a peak of 111 in 1990. The oldest operational reactor, Nine Mile Point-1 in Scriba, New York, has been running since November 1969. Most current reactors began operations in the 1970s and 1980s. In the last decade, only three new reactors have been added, while nine have been shut down.\n\nThe decline in nuclear power projects can be attributed to several factors, including safety concerns following accidents like Fukushima Daiichi in 2011, high construction costs, and issues related to radioactive waste storage. These challenges have led many countries to reconsider their nuclear energy plans.\n\nDespite these hurdles, advocates argue that nuclear power is crucial for reducing carbon emissions from electricity generation. There has been renewed interest in reviving decommissioned nuclear sites, such as the Three Mile Island and Palisades plants. California recently delayed the retirement of its last nuclear plant until 2030, and construction has begun on a new plant in Wyoming featuring an advanced sodium-cooled fast reactor.\n\nThe steady support for nuclear power in the U.S. reflects its potential role in a diverse energy portfolio. As the country grapples with climate change and the need for reliable energy sources, nuclear power may see a resurgence. However, overcoming public concerns and economic barriers will be essential for its expansion. The ongoing debate highlights the complexity of balancing energy needs, environmental goals, and public opinion in shaping the future of America's energy landscape.", "source": {"uri": "indianf.com",

The war has destabilized that supply. But Canada has skin in the game, too.\n\nSaskatchewan has high-quality uranium deposits and is the home base for Cameco, one of the world's largest producers. For its part, Ontario is building a blueprint for the construction of more-affordable reactor technology.\n\nThe pitch to Western leaders: it's time to \"\"rid our economies of any dependence on these foreign states that ... do not share our democratic embrace,\" Lecce said.\n\n\"This is Ontario's moment.\"\n\nNuclear power reactors provide about 14 per cent of Canada's total electricity. In Ontario, where most of the reactors are located, the proportion is more than 50 per cent.\n\nOntario Power Generation has plans to increase nuclear capacity by leaning into small modular reactors at the Darlington nuclear site. The new reactors, developed by General Electric Hitachi Nuclear Energy, are a fraction of the size of a conventional model.\n\nIndustry experts say it means they can be built at a faster pace for a much smaller price tag, although it's unclear how much Ontario is expecting to spend. The plan is to have the first reactor online by 2029.\n\nColossal costs and unpredictable timelines have slowed down development across much of North America to date.\n\nPublic skepticism has been a hurdle, too.\n\nA partial reactor meltdown at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979 brought about demonstrations fronted by the likes of Jane Fonda and \"No Nukes\" concerts with Bruce Springsteen taking the stage against nuclear energy. It cooled popular support for decades.\n\nSome of the concern has softened as global warming and greenhouse-gas emissions cause increasing worry.\n\nAt last year's international climate summit in Dubai, COP28, more than 20 countries signed on to a commitment to triple nuclear energy by 2050.\n\nCanada and the U.S. were among them.\n\nThe pledge noted that nuclear energy could play a key role in achieving global net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions. But in the U.S., the pace and price tags of recent projects have made it difficult to build momentum.\n\nAn expansion of Plant Vogtle, the country's biggest nuclear facility, went online in Georgia seven years late and some $11 billion overbudget, for a cost of nearly $35 billion overall.\n\nAnother project from Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is currently expected to cost up to $4 billion. With Gates chairing its board, energy company TerraPower recently started construction on the plant in Wyoming.\n\n\"Those kinds of prices, or anything close to it, means that nuclear is an extremely expensive alternative for addressing climate change,\" said David Schlissel, a director at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.\n\nIt would be better to invest in more cost-efficient renewable energies and batteries, Schlissel said, arguing that the nuclear industry is engaging in \"a lot of hype.\"\n\nThe U.S. currently gets roughly 20 per cent of its electricity nationwide from a fleet of 94 nuclear reactors, mostly located east of the Mississippi River. It amounts to roughly half of the country's carbon-free electricity.\n\nPolicies put in place under both former president Donald Trump and President Joe Biden's administrations have pushed the nuclear industry forward, said Jacopo Buongiorno, a professor of nuclear science and engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nAdditional subsidies and incentives for clean-energy sources, including nuclear, were established with the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.\n\nBuongiorno, who is also the director of the Center for Advanced Nuclear Energy Systems, said there's excitement about how nuclear energy can play a role in decarbonizing the power grid. But the industry growth is still not there.\n\nThe push for small modular reactors so far consists of \"a lot of talk but not a lot of action\" in the U.S., Buongiorno said.\n\nThat means American stakeholders will be watching Canada closely to see how Ontario's efforts play out, he added.\n\n\"If they can deliver it on time and on budget, I think the floodgates will be opened.\"\n\nThere's a demand around the world for more energy, said George Christidis, with the Canadian Nuclear Association.\n\nAnd nuclear power will play a critical role in maintaining close alignment between Canada and the U.S., he said -- no matter who wins the November presidential election.\n\n\"Both Canada and the U.S. now are very much aligned in meeting these big policy goals,\" he said. \"Energy, security and

We have some big decisions to make", "body": "Scriba, N.Y. - Twice a year, in June and December, 40 sirens scattered around northern Oswego County scream for three minutes to test a warning system that would alert residents if catastrophe struck the nuclear plants at Nine Mile Point.\n\nIt's a periodic reminder of the unique character of nuclear power, where the stakes are high and vigilance is paramount.\n\nSecurity officers at the plants carry long guns. Employees wear radiation monitors. The spent uranium fuel stored on site must be kept safely away from humans for thousands of years.\n\nOswego County long ago embraced its role as a nuclear powerhouse. A symbol of the atom lies at the center of the county seal.\n\nBut a decision looms over the future of New York's nuclear power reactors that could have seismic implications for Oswego and New York state. How much longer will the nukes run?\n\nThe three reactors in Oswego County, plus a smaller sister plant in Wayne County, are the only remaining nuclear plants in New York. They are key anchors in the electric grid, cranking out more than one-fifth of New York's electricity.\n\nThey also provide 1,800 high-paying jobs in a needy region and pay tens of millions in local property taxes. Their presence helped lure Micron Technology to Central New York.\n\nBut the nukes are aging and expensive. Owner Constellation Energy Corp. has received hefty, state-mandated subsidies to keep the plants running since they nearly shut down in 2016 to stop losing money.\n\nThe oldest of the four - the 55-year-old Nine Mile Point Unit 1, outside Oswego - is the oldest operating nuclear reactor in the country. The R.E. Ginna plant in Wayne County is second. Their operating licenses expire in 2029.\n\nConstellation must decide soon whether to ask federal regulators to renew their licenses. The government review takes years. If the company obtains 20-year extensions, it could keep the plants running a total of 80 years, rather than the 40 they were originally approved for.\n\nAll signs point to go. New York is hungry for electricity made without carbon emissions. But there is one important condition.\n\n\"It has to be economic,\" said Richard Barlette, Constellation's state government affairs director.\n\nThe licenses are not the only things that expire in 2029.\n\nNew York state customers have been paying extra on their utility bills to fund roughly $500 million in annual subsidies to keep the four Upstate nuclear plants running, under a deal approved by former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the state Public Service Commission.\n\nThose subsidies, which have totaled roughly $3.6 billion so far, also are scheduled to end in 2029.\n\nBefore applying for license extensions, Constellation officials will seek a commitment from New York state to guarantee the financial prosperity of the nukes, according to correspondence filed with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. That's likely to mean either ongoing subsidies or some other mechanism to ensure adequate revenue.\n\nUltimately, the future of the nuclear plants may depend on whether state officials decide to continue to support them to help meet New York's ambitious energy plan. Under a clean energy law passed in 2019, the electric grid is required to produce zero emissions by 2040.\n\nSeveral environmental groups oppose extending the use of nuclear power - especially if that means ongoing subsidies - arguing that more resources should be devoted to beefing up renewable energy instead.\n\nBut Constellation says New York can kiss its zero emission goal goodbye if the nuclear plants are not part of the solution.\n\n\"Assuming that there's continued policy support, and that the units are made solvent, they'll certainly be there to help hit that 2040 target,'' Barlette said. \"Otherwise ... you're going to see a backsliding on achievement of that 2040 goal.\"\n\nDuring their first few decades, the Upstate nuclear plants often struggled. They averaged only 75% production through the year 2000. They labored through some lengthy shutdowns, including one at Nine Mile 1 that started in 1987 and stretched to 2 \u00bd years.\n\nBut the nukes are reliable workhorses now. Since 2001, they have been available more than 94% of the time, according to data from the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\nThe people who run the state's electric grid would hate to see them retire anytime soon.\n\n\"We would definitely have concerns about that,'' said Kevin Lanahan, a vice president at the New York Independent System Operator. The NYISO oversees the state's bulk electric system that supplies local utilities with power to send to customers.\n\nNew York's last coal-fired power plant closed in 2020. Plants fueled by natural gas and oil are targeted for extinction as the state aims for an emission-free electric system by 2040.\n\nThat leaves nuclear and hydroelectric power, which produce roughly equal amounts, as the main sources of around-the-clock generation at a time when the demand for electricity is rising. The NYISO estimates that New York will need 35% more electricity in 2040 than it does now.\n\nIf the nukes retire when their current licenses expire, \"that would be moving in the wrong direction,'' Lanahan said. \"We need to add capacity.\"\n\nWhen Micron Technology executives were shopping for a place to build a $100 billion chip fab complex, they were attracted to a site in Clay because of its proximity to the Oswego nuclear plants, said Scott Gatzemeier, the Micron official in charge of the project. The high-voltage substation across the street from Micron's site is fed directly by the nuclear plants 30 miles away.\n\n\"It's linked, literally, with a direct line,'' Gatzemeier said.\n\nIf Micron builds all four planned chip fabs in Clay, they will gobble up 16 billion kilowatt-hours a year, enough for more than 2 million homes. At the same time, the equipment is extremely sensitive to fluctuations in voltage. The reliable, around-the-clock output from nuclear plants will be important, Gatzemeier said.\n\n\"You lose up to a week's worth of output for a millisecond power disruption,'' he said. \"So power stability and power availability were absolutely key factors in our decision.\"\n\nThe four Upstate reactors line the shore of Lake Ontario. Besides Nine Mile 1 and Ginna, they include Nine Mile Point Unit 2, the youngest, which is licensed through 2046; and the James A. FitzPatrick plant, which abuts the two Nine Mile reactors, licensed through 2034.\n\nThe licenses for all four units have already been extended once, adding 20 years to their original 40-year terms. So far, only two of the 94 U.S. reactors have been extended a second time, for a total of 80 years, but more than a dozen have applications in the works.\n\nEight years ago, the Upstate nuclear plants were losing money and threatening to shut down. In response, the Public Service Commission approved a 12-year subsidy program to pay the nuclear plants a premium in return for their \"zero emission'' power. The subsidies add about $2 a month to the average household utility bill.\n\nThat was a tough time for nukes. Many that operated in competitive markets like New York were losing money, forced to sell their power at low prices to match generators that burn cheap natural gas. Thirteen nuclear plants outside New York shut down from 2013 to 2022.\n\nBut now the nuclear script has flipped. Constellation, the nation's largest nuclear operator, is riding high on the value of its nuclear fleet.\n\nThe company's stock price rose about 70% in the past year, as the company spent $1.5 billion buying back shares. The CEO got a 45% boost in compensation, to $15.2 million.\n\nThe nuclear subsidies that started in New York caught on in two other states where the company operates, Illinois and New Jersey. And this year the federal government rolled out a nuclear production tax credit that will provide support for a decade.\n\nOn top of that, demand for electricity is predicted to skyrocket in years to come, boosting the value of any power plants that can survive the transition to a zero emission grid. Energy-intensive businesses like artificial intelligence data centers have even begun looking to locate at nuclear plants and buy their entire output directly.\n\nThere's surging interest in developing new nuclear plants, but that future is uncertain.\n\nRecent efforts to build large nukes have run into huge cost overruns and long delays. And plans for smaller innovative reactors are still being drawn up, leaving them a decade away from commercial use, Barlette said.\n\nExisting nuclear plants, on the other hand, are gold.\n\nRather than shutting down reactors, Constellation and other nuclear operators are looking now to bring some of them back from the dead.\n\nConstellation is taking a hard look at whether to reopen a Pennsylvania reactor that was shut five years ago for losing money, CEO Joe Dominguez said during a May call with analysts.\n\nIn Illinois, Constellation decided last year to invest $800 million to upgrade the capacity of two plants it had previously targeted for early retirement.\n\nA Michigan company is working to restart a nuclear plant there that closed two years ago.\n\nIn New York, Constellation is focused on positioning the existing four reactors to run another 20 years, Barlette said.\n\nConstellation gets paid more for power produced in New York than in other states, in part because New York provides the most lucrative subsidies.\n\nFor every kilowatt-hour it produces in New York, Constellation earns about 35% more than what it earns at its 17 reactors in other states, according to company financial projections issued in June.\n\nThe Nine Mile 1 and Ginna reactors have already operated longer than any other nuke in the United States. They are among the three oldest nuclear plants in the world. (The oldest, a small reactor in Switzerland, fired up three months before Nine Mile 1.)\n\nThat puts the New York plants at the forefront of questions about how long nuclear reactors can keep running safely beyond their original 40-year licenses. (Forty years was chosen for economic reasons, according to the NRC, not physical limitations.)\n\nWhen it comes to operating reactors beyond 60 years, federal regulators have said that the potential deterioration of materials is a key concern. In particular, the agency cites the potential for degradation of the reactor pressure vessel, internal vessel components, concrete structures and electrical cables.\n\nNuclear operators must demonstrate to the NRC that they have an effective \"aging management program'' to monitor and upgrade the health of their equipment. The details are subject to ongoing modification based on industry experience, which is shared among operators.\n\nCritics say there is too much potential for unanticipated component failures to justify letting nuclear plants run for up to 80 years. Tim Judson, executive director of the Nuclear Information and Resource Service, said no operator has experience running plants for that long.\n\n\"We are already in uncharted territory,'' Judson said.\n\nRoughly 90% of all U.S. reactors have already extended their licenses once, to 60 years. Nuclear advocates say the plants have gotten safer with age as operators gain experience and share knowledge. NRC officials say nuclear safety has \"improved dramatically'' over the past 25 years.\n\nHere's one issue yet unresolved: No one knows what, exactly, will become of the spent nuclear fuel that is piling up around the nation's power reactors. The waste remains dangerously radioactive for thousands of years after it is used to generate electricity.\n\nThe United States has no long-term repository for spent fuel. Instead, each nuclear power plant stores the waste on site. For five years or more, used fuel rods are kept in pools inside the reactor building while they cool. Then the used fuel is placed in so-called \"dry casks\" and moved outside.\n\nThere are different designs. At the FitzPatrick nuclear plant at Nine Mile Point, the fuel rods are placed in a carbon steel canister that is encased in concrete 26 inches thick. The result is a 19-foot-tall, 11-foot-wide cylinder that weighs 180 tons and stands upright on a concrete pad 30 inches thick.\n\nAt the other three plants, Constellation loads the fuel rods into stainless steel canisters that are injected with helium as a coolant. Each canister is loaded horizontally into a concrete \"crypt\" that is 15 feet tall and 14 feet wide.\n\nDry casks are designed to be used to transport the waste to a permanent repository, if one ever becomes available. For now, they serve as on-site storage.\n\nThus far, Constellation's four Upstate reactors have filled 110 dry casks that sit outside the plants. The NRC considers them safe for 100 years, after which they might have to be replaced.\n\nSpent fuel is considered high-level nuclear waste that must be isolated for tens of thousands of years.\n\nU.S. officials have tried unsuccessfully for decades to develop a site where spent fuel could be buried deep underground forever.\n\nNew York's energy plans are driven by legislation passed in 2019 aimed at fighting climate change. The Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act requires ambitious changes to cut down on greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nState energy officials are grappling with how to make that happen. So far, New York emissions have moved in the wrong direction.\n\nThe only Downstate nuclear plants, Units 2 and 3 at the Indian Point plant in Westchester County, shut down several years ago for environmental reasons. (They never received subsidies.) After they shut down, the gap in power production was filled by plants burning natural gas. Fossil fuel plants now supply 49% of the state's electricity, compared with 39% before Indian Point went offline.\n\nWind and solar power - the intended mainstays of the future grid -- have been painfully slow to develop. They provide only 8% of New York's electricity, even after including all the solar panels on individual homes.\n\nThe Public Service Commission is one year into a review to determine which energy sources will help make the electric grid emission-free. Nuclear - existing or new - is one of the options.\n\nTo date, state energy officials have treated existing nuclear plants as part of the zero emission solution, said Doreen Harris, president and CEO of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority. Harris co-chaired the Climate Action Council, which assumed that the Upstate nukes would continue operations when the council drew up its 2022 plan for meeting state climate goals.\n\n\"We did make an assumption that they would continue to operate,\" Harris said. \"Obviously, it takes some of the pressure off of the need for other zero emission new resources.\"\n\nBut it will be up to the PSC to decide whether nuclear power should be supported with additional financial incentives to help meet emission targets, Harris said.\n\nAs part of its deliberations, the PSC hosted a two-day technical conference in December 2023 to hear from experts. The panel discussion on nuclear power featured three speakers -- from government, academia and the nuclear industry - each of whom expressed full-throated support for nuclear power.\n\nJulie Kozeracki, director of strategy in the U.S. Department of Energy loan programs office, said using nuclear plants to supply 20% to 40% of the state's electricity is the cheapest way to achieve a zero emissions electric grid, according to a video of the conference.\n\n\"We should build all of the solar and wind that we possibly can, as quickly as we can,\" she said. \"And we still need the nuclear.\"\n\nEmily Liu, a nuclear engineer and head of the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, agreed that nuclear should be part of the mix.\n\n\"You really need a base energy,'' Liu said. \"You cannot depend on solar and wind because they come and go. Even if you pack them with batteries, that's going to be a huge cost and it's not very dependable. So, yeah, having a baseload from nuclear is a must.\"\n\nCritics of nuclear power complained to the PSC that the panel did not include anyone who questions the economic viability or environmental risks of nuclear plants.\n\nThe Alliance for a Green Economy, a renewable power advocacy group, questioned the assumption that the future electric grid would benefit from having large generating plants that must run all the time. A number of studies have concluded that so-called baseload power is an outmoded concept that does not have the flexibility to mesh well with renewable sources like wind and solar, which vary in output.\n\nA grid supplied chiefly by renewables will require flexible, quick-start power sources that can fill in when the sun isn't shining or the wind blowing. That is not a role typically played by nuclear plants, which generally run at full power all the time.\n\n\"We hope that there will be additional time and discussion dedicated to understanding nuclear generating facilities, their environmental impacts, their cost impacts, and their ability, or lack there-of, to be part of a future electrical grid,\" AGREE wrote in a response to the technical conference.\n\nJudson, of the Nuclear Information and Resource Service, said committing resources to sustain nuclear power plants reduces the investments that could be better spent on improving battery storage or other technology to support renewable energy.\n\nSorting out the economics of the energy transition - what should be subsidized and how much it will cost -- will be critical to planning the future electric grid, said John Howard, a former member of the Public Service Commission and the state Climate Action Council.\n\nRenewable power plants, like the nukes, have been eligible for subsidies for years. So far, that cost has been minimal compared with the nuclear subsidies because wind and solar plants have been slow to come online and produce electricity.\n\nThat is likely to change.\n\nNYSERDA announced in June that it finalized a deal to buy enough electricity for about 1 million homes from two offshore wind farms to be built roughly 30 miles from Long Island.

This will be especially necessary now, as China is moving forward with a project that will put them as the country with the most operational nuclear energy reactors.\n\nNuclear energy has always been surrounded by controversy and fears, especially since the tragic accidents that have occurred throughout the history of its use, Chernobyl being the most representative and, more recently, the Fukushima plant. The presence of radioactive waste and the possibility of a leak or, even worse, an explosion, makes people consider it a \"forbidden energy\".\n\nHowever, it is important to note that forbidden energy is actually one of the most sustainable and least polluting sources of electrical power. Nuclear fission plants offer a large generation capacity and in each cycle of the energy production process only water vapor is emitted, which is the element that drives the turbines that generate the reactors.\n\nIt is important to bear this in mind when talking about the new thorium and molten salt plants that China is planning to install throughout its territory. The new reactor will consist of a generator that uses molten salts as a cooling medium, which is incredibly efficient and, by using thorium as fuel, also becomes more sustainable.\n\nThe use of molten salts in nuclear reactors is quite common, as it is one of the most effective ways of reducing the heat generated during fission, emitting less waste and being much safer. However, this new reactor, named TMSR-LF1, is the first to combine this material with the use of thorium as fuel.\n\nThorium is a much more abundant and easily extractable material than conventional uranium. This not only reduces contamination during the nuclear power supply chain, but also offers many great advantages. One of these advantages is the generation of much less radioactive waste, which also decays much faster.\n\nThorium is converted to uranium-232 during the plant's power generation process. This material is contaminated with uranium-233 to prevent its use in nuclear weapons proliferation, thus ensuring compliance with strict safety standards. As it is a much more radioactive fuel and less effective as a weapon, the danger of warlike uses is eliminated.\n\nThe new TMSR-LF1 nuclear reactor, far from being considered off-limits energy, will make it possible to generate clean electricity using a more durable and efficient fuel in combination with a high-capacity cooling system. The advantages of this unprecedented conjunction of strategic technologies holds great promise for China's sustainable electrification.\n\nCurrently, the nation with the most operational nuclear reactors is the United States, which has 94 operating nuclear reactors, while China has 56, ranking second. However, they are moving ahead with the construction of many new reactors that, once complete, will change the Asian giant's place on the podium.\n\nWith so many advantages associated and the potential of these new safer and more sustainable fissile fuels, what follows is to create awareness in society. Currently, in America we have 94 nuclear energy reactors, according to latest reports from the Nuclear Energy Institute of the United States.", "source": {"uri": "ecoticias.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ECOticias.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thorium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molten_salt", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Molten salt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_Nuclear_Power_Plant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear fission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chernobyl disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_waste", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radioactive waste"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMSR-LF1", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TMSR-LF1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water vapor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Energy development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_generator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric generator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reactor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear reactor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium-233", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uranium-233"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Energy_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear Energy Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electrification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fissile_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fissile material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_proliferation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear proliferation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.ecoticias.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Depositphotos_325232134_L-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800448", "eventUri": "eng-9800448", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

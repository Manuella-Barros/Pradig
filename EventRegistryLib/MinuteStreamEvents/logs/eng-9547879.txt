That's the same as in most years. Yet droughts in India, China, North America and Mexico meant hydropower hit a five-year low. Research shows climate change is causing droughts to develop more quickly and be more severe.\n\nPeople used more electricity than ever last year, about 2% more, an increase of about as much as Canada uses in a year. Some of this new demand was for heat pumps, which are an efficient way to both heat and cool buildings, and for electric vehicles. It was also for electrolyzers, special machines used to get hydrogen out of water, for energy. These are all technologies that provide solutions to climate change.\n\nOther increased demand was for electricity to feed new data centers and for air conditioning as places around the world become hotter.\n\nSolar made up the biggest share of new clean energy last year. More than twice as much solar power was added as coal power. It was the 19th year in a row that solar was the fastest-growing source of electricity generation. A surge in solar installations happened at the end of the year and the report predicts 2024 will see an even larger jump.\n\nChina added more renewable energy than any other country last year -- 51% of the new solar power and 60% of the new wind power globally. China, the European Union, the United States and Brazil together accounted for 81% of new solar generation in 2023.\n\nYet China was also responsible for 55% of coal generation globally and 60% of China's electricity generation came from coal. The International Energy Agency says coal is the most carbon-intensive of the fossil fuels.\n\nScientists say emissions from burning fuels like coal must ramp steeply down to protect Earth's climate, yet there was an increase in electricity made from burning fossil fuels. China, India, Vietnam and Mexico were responsible for nearly all of the rise.\n\nThe report said some countries burned coal to make up for the loss of hydroelectric power they experienced when drought caused their reservoirs to dry up. This is an example of a vicious cycle -- when climate change prompts the use of more of the substances that cause climate change in the first place.\n\nDespite all the growth in clean energy, fossil fuels still made up the majority of global electricity generated last year, causing a 1% rise in global power sector emissions. Scientists say even if we slashed all greenhouse gas emissions today, the planet would continue to warm for years because of the amount of pollutants already added to the atmosphere.\n\nAnalysts expect the world to use even more electricity in 2024. But renewable energy generation is forecast to grow even faster. That could mean a 2% drop (333 terawatt-hours) in energy generated from fossil fuels.", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydropower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydropower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollutant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pollutant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_farm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wind farm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Methane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydroelectricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal-fired_power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coal-fired power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electrolysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat pump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electricity generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Energy_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://cdn.newsday.com/ace/c:NzkxYmMyZWMtZDA0My00:ODVhYTI4/landscape/1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547879", "eventUri": "eng-9547879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 225, "relevance": 1}

More than 100 countries at the COP28 climate summit in Dubai last year agreed to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030.\n\nThe report showed renewable sources provided 30.3% of global electricity last year, up from 29.4% in 2022 as growth in projects, particularly solar, increased capacity.\n\nCombined with nuclear, 39.4% of global electricity now comes from low-carbon sources.\n\nEmber said the world is now at a turning point where solar and wind not only slow emissions growth but actually start to push fossil generation into decline.\n\n\"With record construction of solar and wind in 2023, a new era of falling fossil generation is imminent. 2023 was likely the pivot point, marking peak emissions in the power sector,\" its report read.\n\n\"The rise in solar capacity that happened during 2023 really unlocks the possibility that we are able to reach that level of renewables by 2030, and the tripling of capacity that was promised at COP28,\" Dave Jones, Ember's director of global insights said in an interview.\n\nRenewables have expanded from 19% of global electricity in 2000. Solar and wind generation reached a record share of 13.4% in 2023, which marks a gain of 1.5 percentage points compared to 2022\n\nSolar is accelerating faster than anyone thought possible, according to Jones.\n\n\"The decline of power sector emissions is now inevitable. 2023 was likely the pivot point - peak emissions in the power sector - a major turning point in the history of energy,\" he noted.\n\n\"But the pace of emissions falls depends on how fast the renewables revolution continues. The good news is we already know the key enablers that help countries unleash the full potential of solar and wind.\"\n\nAlthough it remained the largest source of clean power globally, hydropower generation fell to a five-year low, the report said, mainly due to droughts in China and elsewhere.\n\nIts share in the world's electricity mix dropped 0.6 percentage points to 14.3% - the lowest level since at least 2000 and just 1 percentage point above wind and solar.\n\nThe report revealed that 95% of the coal generation rise last year occurred in four countries that were severely affected by droughts: China, India, Vietnam and Mexico.\n\nNuclear provided 9.1% of global electricity in 2023, unchanged from the previous year.\n\nIn 2023, global electricity demand increased by 627 terawatt hours (TWh), or 2.2%, the equivalent of adding the entire electricity demand of Canada (607 TWh).\n\nThat brought total global demand to a new record high of 29,471 TWh. Nevertheless, 2023's growth rate was lower than the 2.5% average growth of the past decade (2012-2022).\n\nMore than half of the global additions in solar and wind capacity came in China last year, the report said, with total global solar generation up 23.2% and wind power up 9.8%.\n\nSolar outpaced wind generation growth for the second year running. The 2023 rate made it the fastest-growing source of electricity generation for the 19th year in a row.\n\nSolar reached a 5.5% share of the global electricity mix, up from 4.6% in 2022.

The International Energy Agency's (IEA) Net Zero Emissions scenario sets out a global target of 60% renewable electricity by 2030.\n\nIn 2023, fossil fuels generated 58% of T\u00fcrkiye's electricity.

That's the same as in most years. Yet droughts in India, China, North America and Mexico meant hydropower hit a five-year low. Research shows climate change is causing droughts to develop more quickly and be more severe.\n\nPeople used more electricity than ever last year, about 2% more, an increase of about as much as Canada uses in a year. Some of this new demand was for heat pumps, which are an efficient way to both heat and cool buildings, and for electric vehicles. It was also for electrolyzers, special machines used to get hydrogen out of water, for energy. These are all technologies that provide solutions to climate change.\n\nOther increased demand was for electricity to feed new data centers and for air conditioning as places around the world become hotter.\n\nSolar made up the biggest share of new clean energy last year. More than twice as much solar power was added as coal power. It was the 19th year in a row that solar was the fastest-growing source of electricity generation. A surge in solar installations happened at the end of the year and the report predicts 2024 will see an even larger jump.\n\nFILE - Solar panels work near the small town of Milagro, Navarra Province, northern Spain, Feb. 24, 2023. Billions of people are using different kinds of energy each day and 2023 was a record-breaking year for renewable energy sources, according to a report published Wednesday, May 8, 2024, by Ember, a think tank based in London. (AP Photo/Alvaro Barrientos, File)\n\nChina added more renewable energy than any other country last year - 51% of the new solar power and 60% of the new wind power globally. China, the European Union, the United States and Brazil together accounted for 81% of new solar generation in 2023.\n\nYet China was also responsible for 55% of coal generation globally and 60% of China's electricity generation came from coal. The International Energy Agency says coal is the most carbon-intensive of the fossil fuels.\n\nScientists say emissions from burning fuels like coal must ramp steeply down to protect Earth's climate, yet there was an increase in electricity made from burning fossil fuels. China, India, Vietnam and Mexico were responsible for nearly all of the rise.\n\nThe report said some countries burned coal to make up for the loss of hydroelectric power they experienced when drought caused their reservoirs to dry up. This is an example of a vicious cycle - when climate change prompts the use of more of the substances that cause climate change in the first place.\n\nDespite all the growth in clean energy, fossil fuels still made up the majority of global electricity generated last year, causing a 1% rise in global power sector emissions. Scientists say even if we slashed all greenhouse gas emissions today, the planet would continue to warm for years because of the amount of pollutants already added to the atmosphere.\n\nAnalysts expect the world to use even more electricity in 2024. But renewable energy generation is forecast to grow even faster. That could mean a 2% drop (333 terawatt-hours) in energy generated from fossil fuels.\n\n____\n\nThe Associated Press\u00b4 climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

It is published today alongside the world's first open dataset on electricity generation in 2023 covering 80 countries representing 92% of global electricity demand, as well as historic data for 215 countries.\n\n\"The renewables future has arrived,\" said Dave Jones, Ember's director of global insights. \"Solar in particular is accelerating faster than anyone thought possible.\"\n\nSolar was the main supplier of electricity growth, adding more than twice as much new electricity generation as coal in 2023. Solar maintained its status as the fastest-growing electricity source for the nineteenth consecutive year, and surpassed wind to become the largest source of new electricity for the second year running.\n\nRenewable generation growth could have been even higher in 2023, but hydropower generation reached a five-year low amid droughts in China and other parts of the world.\n\nUnder normal conditions, the clean capacity added during 2023 would have been enough to enable a 1.1% fall in fossil generation.\n\nHowever, the shortfall in hydropower was met by an increase in coal generation, which led to a 1% increase in global power sector emissions. 95% of the coal generation rise in 2023 occurred in four countries that were severely affected by droughts: China, India, Vietnam and Mexico.\n\nNonetheless, the report shows that expected clean electricity growth gives confidence that a new era of declining power sector emissions is about to begin, with a projected 2% decrease in global fossil generation in 2024.\n\n\"The decline of power sector emissions is now inevitable,\" continued Jones. \"2023 was likely the pivot point - peak emissions in the power sector - a major turning point in the history of energy. But the pace of emissions falls depends on how fast the renewables revolution continues.\"\n\nAt the UN's COP28 climate change conference in December, world leaders reached a historic agreement to triple global renewables capacity by 2030. The target would see the world reach 60% renewable electricity by 2030, which would almost halve power sector emissions and put the world on a pathway aligned with the 1.5C climate goal.", "source": {"uri": "techdigest.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tech Digest"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_price@techdigest.tv", "name": "Chris Price", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ember_(non-profit_organisation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ember (non-profit organisation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fossil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydropower", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydropower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.techdigest.tv/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/solar-farm-vodafone-1024x683-1.jpeg.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547879", "eventUri": "eng-9547879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

Billions of people are using different kinds of energy each day and 2023 was a record-breaking year for renewable energy sources, according to a report published Wednesday, May 8, 2024, by Ember, a think tank based in [...]\n\nBillions of people are using different kinds of energy each day and 2023 was a record-breaking year for renewable energy sources -- ones that don't emit planet-warming pollutants like carbon dioxide and methane -- according to a report published Wednesday by Ember, a think tank based in London.\n\nFor the first time, 30% of electricity produced worldwide was from clean energy sources as the number of solar and wind farms continued to grow fast.\n\nOf the types of clean energy generated last year, hydroelectric dams produced the most. That's the same as in most years. Yet droughts in India, China, North America and Mexico meant hydropower hit a five-year low. Research shows climate change is causing droughts to develop more quickly and be more severe.\n\nPeople used more electricity than ever last year, about 2% more, an increase of about as much as Canada uses in a year. Some of this new demand was for heat pumps, which are an efficient way to both heat and cool buildings, and for electric vehicles. It was also for electrolyzers, special machines used to get hydrogen out of water, for energy. These are all technologies that provide solutions to climate change.\n\nOther increased demand was for electricity to feed new data centers and for air conditioning as places around the world become hotter.\n\nSolar made up the biggest share of new clean energy last year. More than twice as much solar power was added as coal power. It was the 19th year in a row that solar was the fastest-growing source of electricity generation. A surge in solar installations happened at the end of the year and the report predicts 2024 will see an even larger jump.\n\nChina added more renewable energy than any other country last year -- 51% of the new solar power and 60% of the new wind power globally. China, the European Union, the United States and Brazil together accounted for 81% of new solar generation in 2023.\n\nYet China was also responsible for 55% of coal generation globally and 60% of China's electricity generation came from coal. The International Energy Agency says coal is the most carbon-intensive of the fossil fuels.\n\nScientists say emissions from burning fuels like coal must ramp steeply down to protect Earth's climate, yet there was an increase in electricity made from burning fossil fuels. China, India, Vietnam and Mexico were responsible for nearly all of the rise.\n\nThe report said some countries burned coal to make up for the loss of hydroelectric power they experienced when drought caused their reservoirs to dry up. This is an example of a vicious cycle -- when climate change prompts the use of more of the substances that cause climate change in the first place.\n\nDespite all the growth in clean energy, fossil fuels still made up the majority of global electricity generated last year, causing a 1% rise in global power sector emissions. Scientists say even if we slashed all greenhouse gas emissions today, the planet would continue to warm for years because of the amount of pollutants already added to the atmosphere.\n\nAnalysts expect the world to use even more electricity in 2024. But renewable energy generation is forecast to grow even faster. That could mean a 2% drop (333 terawatt-hours) in energy generated from fossil fuels.\n\n____\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Ember, a think tank headquartered in London, in its \"Global Electricity Review 2024\" released May 8 wrote that the numbers show a goal to triple renewable energy generation capacity by the end of the decade is in reach. The group said, \"Renewables generated a record 30% of global electricity in 2023, driven by growth in solar and wind. With record construction of solar and wind in 2023, a new era of falling fossil generation is imminent.\" Ember's fifth annual review of the global electricity market said that solar power generation capacity rose 23% last year, with wind power showing a 10% increase. Generation from fossil fuels, including coal and natural gas, rose just less than 1%. The group said electricity output from renewables would be even higher if not for persistent, years-long drought conditions in many areas that has lessened hydropower production. The group said that four countries severely impacted by drought -- China, India, Vietnam, and Mexico -- accounted for 95% of the increase in coal-fired generation. \"The renewables future has arrived. Solar in particular is accelerating faster than anyone thought possible,\" said Dave Jones, Global Insights Programme Director for Ember and one of the report's authors. \"The decline of power sector emissions is now inevitable. 2023 was likely the pivot point -- peak emissions in the power sector -- a major turning point in the history of energy.\" Ember said solar power has been the world's fastest-growing source of energy for 19 consecutive years.\n\nTracking Power Sector Output and Emissions\n\nEmber said its report \"analyzes electricity data from 215 countries, including the latest 2023 data for 80 countries representing 92% of global electricity demand. The analysis also includes data for 13 geographic and economic groupings, such as Africa, Asia, the EU [European Union] and the G7 [the world's seven largest economies].\" The group said it also tracks top six countries and regions in terms of emissions of carbon dioxide (CO), which Ember said account for more than 72% of all global power sector emissions. Jones said \"the pace of emissions falls depends on how fast the renewables revolution continues. The good news is we already know the key enablers that help countries unleash the full potential of solar and wind. There's an unprecedented opportunity for countries that choose to be at the forefront of the clean energy future.\" The group in the executive summary of the report wrote: \"The renewables revolution -- led by solar and wind -- is breaking records and driving ever-cleaner electricity production. The world is now at a turning point where solar and wind not only slow emissions growth, but actually start to push fossil generation into decline.\" The report continued: \"Indeed, the expansion of clean capacity would have been enough to deliver a fall in global power sector emissions in 2023. However, drought caused a five-year low in hydropower, which created a shortfall that was met in large part by coal. Nonetheless, the latest forecasts give confidence that 2024 will begin a new era of falling fossil generation, marking 2023 as the likely peak of power sector emissions.\"\n\nRecord Global Power Demand\n\nThe report noted that \"global electricity demand rose to a record high in 2023, with an increase of 627 TWh, which is equivalent to adding the entire demand of Canada (+607 TWh). Nevertheless, the 2023 increase of 2.2% was below the average for recent years, due to a pronounced decrease in demand in OECD [Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development] countries, notably the U.S. (-1.4%) and the EU (-3.4%). In contrast, the rapid demand growth in China (+6.9%) was equivalent to the total global growth in demand in 2023. More than half of the electricity demand rise in 2023 was from five technologies: electric vehicles (EVs), heat pumps, electrolyzers, air conditioning and data centers. The spread of these technologies will accelerate the growth in electricity demand, but overall energy demand will decline as electrification is much more efficient than fossil fuels.\" Jones noted the push for electrification. \"Expanding clean electricity not only helps to decarbonize the power sector. It also provides the step up in supply needed to electrify the whole economy; and that's the real game-changer for the climate,\" he said. The report noted that absent U.S. power generation from natural gas, the amount of electricity produced from that fuel would have fallen worldwide last year. Ember said that outside the U.S., other countries generated 62 TWh less from gas-fired power plants in 2023 than in 2022. The U.S., though, with abundant natural gas -- and also replacing coal-fired power plants with gas-fired units -- produced an additional 115 TWh of electricity from gas in 2023. -- Darrell Proctor is a senior associate editor for POWER (@POWERmagazine).", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

In 2023, for the first time, 30% of the world's electricity was produced from renewable sources, thanks to the expansion of wind and solar energy. The milestone is even more significant in the European Union, where 44% of electricity was generated from renewable sources.\n\nThis is the conclusion of the fifth edition of the Global Electricity Review report, prepared by Ember and published today. Although the most relevant of the study is the prognosis of the researchers, who are confident that a \"new era\" of decline in the generation of fossil energy is about to begin.\n\nIn the last two decades, renewable energies have gone from representing 19% of global electricity production (in 2000) to the current figure of 30% and, as the report concludes, it has been the growth of wind energy and solar which have driven the record.\n\n\"The future of renewable energy has arrived,\" says Dave Jones, director of Ember's Global Insights program. And solar energy, in particular, is accelerating faster than anyone thought possible.\"\n\nAlso in the last two decades, solar and wind energy have grown significantly, going from 0.2% in 2000 to 12.4% last year. This expansion has been even faster in the European Union, which accounted for 17% of the global growth in solar and wind power generation in 2023.\n\nOf these two energy sources, solar power has established itself as the main supplier of electricity growth on a global scale and, for the second year in a row, surpassed wind power in the production of new electricity. The researchers also noted that solar generated more than twice as much new electricity as coal by 2023, while maintaining its position as the world's fastest-growing source of electricity for the ninth year in a row.\n\nRegarding the geographical distribution, China led solar and wind generation, representing 51% and 60% respectively of the new global generation. Greece ranked second in solar electricity generation, followed by Hungary and the Netherlands. And in the specific case of Spain, the country was the eighth with the most electricity generation with solar energy and the seventh with wind power.\n\nAs a result of these changes, the group argues that the CO2 intensity of global energy generation reached a new historic low in 2023, being 12% lower than its peak in 2007. They also claim that the 'expansion of wind and solar energy would have been sufficient to cause a decrease in the emissions of the sector during 2023, if it were not for the reduction in the generation of hydroelectric energy caused by the drought.\n\nThe report indicates that, under normal conditions, a 1.1% reduction in fossil energy generation and therefore emissions would have been achieved. However, due to the deficit in hydropower caused by the drought, coal-fired electricity generation was increased to compensate, resulting in a 1% increase in emissions from the global energy sector . To state this, they rely on the fact that almost all of the increase in coal generation last year (95%) happened in four countries that were severely affected by droughts: China, India, Vietnam and Mexico.\n\nEmber argues in its analysis that clean electricity has helped to slow the growth of fossil fuels by almost two-thirds over the past ten years, and that the data collected gives them the \"confidence\" to believe that it is about to begin a new era of reduced emissions from the electricity sector. Specifically, they project a 2% reduction in fossil energy generation on a global scale by 2024, which will lead to further reductions over the following years.\n\nThe researchers add that, as a result, half of the world's economies are at least five years beyond their fossil energy peak. In the specific case of the European Union, emissions from the electricity sector would have reached their peak in 2007 and would have decreased by 46% since then.\n\nIn this sense, the decrease in coal production that the European Union has made in the last ten years is considered important; which has been the second largest, behind the United States.\n\nAt COP28, world leaders agreed to triple global renewable energy capacity by 2030, meaning that by that date 60% of the world's electricity should come from renewable sources. This would almost halve emissions from the electricity sector and would be in line with the climate objective of 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nHowever, the report warns that in order to achieve these international climate change goals, the energy sector should be the first to decarbonize; and that the decrease in emissions will be conditioned by the speed with which the expansion of clean energy continues.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solar energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electricity generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydroelectricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydropower", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hydropower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Energy industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/05/_7b1de.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547879", "eventUri": "eng-9547879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

It is also needed to meet the rising electricity demand in an increasingly electrified economy and to decouple economic growth from emissions, which is crucial for tackling climate change.\"\n\nSolar maintained its status as the world's fastest-growing electricity source for the 19th consecutive year, adding more than twice as much new electricity worldwide as coal in 2023.\n\nIndia saw the world's fourth-largest increase in solar generation in 2023 (+18 terawatt hour or TWh), behind China (+156 TWh), the United States (+33 TWh) and Brazil (+22 TWh). Together, the top four solar growth countries accounted for 75 per cent of growth in 2023.\n\nEmber said the global solar generation in 2023 was more than six times larger than in 2015.\n\nSolar's contribution to electricity generation in India increased from 0.5 per cent in 2015 to 5.8 per cent in 2023.\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency's (IEA) \"Net Zero Emissions\" scenario, solar would increase to 22 per cent of global electricity generation by 2030.\n\nWith electricity generation accounting for nearly half of India's annual carbon dioxide emissions (1.18 gigatonnes in 2023), accelerating the transition to cleaner generation sources is imperative for the country to meet both its developmental and climate goals.\n\nAs part of its national plan to fight climate change, India has committed to achieving 50 per cent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030.\n\nAt the United Nations COP28 climate change conference in December last year, world leaders arrived at a historic agreement to triple the global renewable energy capacity by 2030.\n\nThe IEA says tripling the global RE capacity and doubling energy efficiency are crucial to limiting the average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, a political target set in 2015 to prevent further worsening of climate impacts.\n\nIndia is one of the few countries planning to triple renewable capacity by 2030.

With record construction of solar and wind in 2023, a new era of falling fossil generation is imminent. 2023 was likely the pivot point, marking peak emissions in the power sector.\n\nEmber's fifth annual Global Electricity Review provides the first comprehensive overview of changes in global electricity generation in 2023, based on reported data. It presents the trends underlying them, and the likely implications for energy sources and power sector emissions in the near future. With the report, Ember is also releasing the first comprehensive, free dataset of global electricity generation in 2023.\n\nThe report analyses electricity data from 215 countries, including the latest 2023 data for 80 countries representing 92% of global electricity demand. The analysis also includes data for 13 geographic and economic groupings, such as Africa, Asia, the EU and the G7. It also dives deeper into the top six CO2 emitting countries and regions, which account for over 72% of global power sector emissions, and the Annex gives an overview of 25 other countries that are significant polluters.\n\nWe make all of the data freely accessible to empower others to do their own analysis and help speed the switch to clean electricity.\n\nRenewables generated a record 30% of global electricity in 2023, driven by growth in solar and wind. With record construction of solar and wind in 2023, a new era of falling fossil generation is imminent. 2023 was likely the pivot point, marking peak emissions in the power sector.\n\nThe renewables revolution - led by solar and wind - is breaking records and driving ever-cleaner electricity production. The world is now at a turning point where solar and wind not only slow emissions growth, but actually start to push fossil generation into decline.\n\nIndeed, the expansion of clean capacity would have been enough to deliver a fall in global power sector emissions in 2023. However, drought caused a five-year low in hydropower, which created a shortfall that was met in large part by coal. Nonetheless, the latest forecasts give confidence that 2024 will begin a new era of falling fossil generation, marking 2023 as the likely peak of power sector emissions.\n\nRenewables provided 30% of global electricity for the first time\n\nIn 2023, growth in solar and wind pushed the world past 30% renewable electricity for the first time. Renewables have expanded from 19% of global electricity in 2000, driven by an increase in solar and wind from 0.2% in 2000 to a record 13.4% in 2023. China was the main contributor in 2023, accounting for 51% of the additional global solar generation and 60% of new global wind generation. Combined with nuclear, the world generated almost 40% of its electricity from low-carbon sources in 2023. As a result, the CO2 intensity of global power generation reached a new record low, 12% lower than its peak in 2007.\n\nSolar was the main supplier of electricity growth in 2023\n\nSolar is leading the energy revolution. It was the fastest-growing source of electricity generation for the 19th year in a row, and surpassed wind to become the largest source of new electricity for the second year running. Indeed, solar added more than twice as much new electricity as coal in 2023. The record surge in installations at the very end of 2023 means that 2024 is set for an even larger increase in solar generation.\n\nHydropower fell to a five-year low, preventing a fall in emissions in 2023\n\nDrought conditions resulted in a record fall in hydropower generation, which dropped to a five-year low. Under normal conditions, the clean capacity added during 2023 would have been enough to enable a 1.1% fall in fossil generation. However, the shortfall in hydropower was met by an increase in coal generation, which led to a 1% increase in global power sector emissions. 95% of the coal generation rise in 2023 occurred in four countries that were severely affected by droughts: China, India, Viet Nam and Mexico.\n\nDemand growth slowed in 2023, but in future it will only go up\n\nGlobal electricity demand rose to a record high in 2023, with an increase of 627 TWh which is equivalent to adding the entire demand of Canada (+607 TWh). Nevertheless, the 2023 increase of 2.2% was below the average for recent years, due to a pronounced decrease in demand in OECD countries, notably the US (-1.4%) and the EU (-3.4%). In contrast, the rapid demand growth in China (+6.9%) was equivalent to the total global growth in demand in 2023. More than half of the electricity demand rise in 2023 was from five technologies: electric vehicles (EVs), heat pumps, electrolysers, air conditioning and data centres. The spread of these technologies will accelerate the growth in electricity demand, but overall energy demand will decline as electrification is much more efficient than fossil fuels.\n\nA new era of declining power sector emissions is about to begin\n\nEmber forecasts fossil generation to fall slightly in 2024, leading to larger falls in subsequent years. Demand growth in 2024 is expected to be higher than in 2023 (+968 TWh) but clean generation growth is forecast to be even greater (+1300 TWh), leading to a 2% fall in global fossil generation (-333 TWh). Already the rollout of clean generation, led by solar and wind, has helped to slow the growth in fossil fuels by almost two-thirds in the last ten years. As a result, half the world's economies are already at least five years past a peak in electricity generation from fossil fuels. OECD countries are at the forefront of this, with power sector emissions collectively peaking in 2007 and falling 28% since then.\n\nThe decade ahead will see the energy transition enter a new phase. A permanent decline in fossil fuel use in the power sector at a global level is now inevitable, leading to falling sector emissions. Clean electricity additions - led by solar and wind - are already forecast to outpace demand growth in the coming decade, securing moderate reductions in fossil fuel use and hence emissions, even as demand accelerates to meet the growing needs of electrification and other booming technologies.\n\nFor the goal of achieving international climate change targets, this is critical, with multiple analyses finding that the power sector should be the first to decarbonise - by 2035 in OECD countries, by 2045 in the rest of the world. The sector is currently the highest emitting of all, producing more than a third of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. Clean electricity is also key to decarbonising transport, heating and much of industry, by replacing the fossil fuel burning that currently takes place in car and bus engines, boilers, furnaces and other applications. An accelerating transition to a clean electrified economy powered by wind, solar and other forms of clean energy will also unlock benefits in areas such as economic growth, jobs, air quality and energy sovereignty.\n\nThe pace of emissions declines will be shaped by how quickly the build-out of clean power continues. There is a global consensus on the scale of ambition needed. At the UN's COP28 climate change conference in December, world leaders reached a historic agreement to triple global renewables capacity by 2030. The target would see the world reach 60% renewable electricity by 2030, almost halving power sector emissions and putting the world on a pathway aligned with the 1.5C climate goal. Leaders also agreed at COP28 to double annual energy efficiency improvements by 2030, which will be crucial to delivering the full potential of electrification and avoiding runaway growth in electricity demand.\n\nCountries are already demonstrating the key enablers that galvanise rapid growth in solar and wind, including high-level policy ambition, incentive mechanisms and flexibility solutions. The report highlights three countries - China, Brazil and the Netherlands - which show that despite very different starting points, the combination of these approaches is delivering rapid transformations of their electricity systems and preparing the way for a clean, electrified economy.\n\nRelated Article: TotalEnergies and Vanguard Renewables Form Joint Venture for RNG Projects in

That's the same as in most years. Yet droughts in India, China, North America and Mexico meant hydropower hit a five-year low. Research shows climate change is causing droughts to develop more quickly and be more severe.\n\nPeople used more electricity than ever last year, about 2% more, an increase of about as much as Canada uses in a year. Some of this new demand was for heat pumps, which are an efficient way to both heat and cool buildings, and for electric vehicles. It was also for electrolyzers, special machines used to get hydrogen out of water, for energy. These are all technologies that provide solutions to climate change.\n\nOther increased demand was for electricity to feed new data centers and for air conditioning as places around the world become hotter.\n\nSolar made up the biggest share of new clean energy last year. More than twice as much solar power was added as coal power. It was the 19th year in a row that solar was the fastest-growing source of electricity generation. A surge in solar installations happened at the end of the year and the report predicts 2024 will see an even larger jump.\n\nChina added more renewable energy than any other country last year -- 51% of the new solar power and 60% of the new wind power globally. China, the European Union, the United States and Brazil together accounted for 81% of new solar generation in 2023.\n\nYet China was also responsible for 55% of coal generation globally and 60% of China's electricity generation came from coal. The International Energy Agency says coal is the most carbon-intensive of the fossil fuels.\n\nScientists say emissions from burning fuels like coal must ramp steeply down to protect Earth's climate, yet there was an increase in electricity made from burning fossil fuels. China, India, Vietnam and Mexico were responsible for nearly all of the rise.\n\nThe report said some countries burned coal to make up for the loss of hydroelectric power they experienced when drought caused their reservoirs to dry up. This is an example of a vicious cycle -- when climate change prompts the use of more of the substances that cause climate change in the first place.\n\nDespite all the growth in clean energy, fossil fuels still made up the majority of global electricity generated last year, causing a 1% rise in global power sector emissions. Scientists say even if we slashed all greenhouse gas emissions today, the planet would continue to warm for years because of the amount of pollutants already added to the atmosphere.\n\nAnalysts expect the world to use even more electricity in 2024. But renewable energy generation is forecast to grow even faster. That could mean a 2% drop (333 terawatt-hours) in energy generated from fossil fuels.\n\n____\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

From the analysis, 2023 saw a 23% growth in solar generation, 10% growth in wind generation and only a 0.8% growth in fossil generation.\n\n\"The renewables future has arrived. Solar, in particular, is accelerating faster than anyone thought possible,\" said Dave Jones, Ember's director of global insights.\n\nThis surge in renewables has led to a slowing down in carbon emissions. Indeed, a separate report published in March 2024 from the International Energy Agency (IEA) revealed that while global energy-related carbon emissions reached a record level in 2023, the rise was lower than 2022's rise.\n\nThe Ember report found that the energy-related emissions in 2023 would have been significantly smaller if it hadn't been for the low hydropower output caused by extreme droughts in China, the US and several other economies. This shortfall in output was met in large part by coal, which resulted in over 40% of the rise in global CO emissions in 2023.\n\nIn 2023, solar led the way in electricity generation, and surpassed wind to become the largest source of new electricity for the second year running. Indeed, solar added more than twice as much new electricity as coal in 2023. China added as much solar PV capacity in 2023 than the entire world did in 2022.\n\nThe Ember report forecasts that fossil generation will fall slightly in 2024, leading to larger falls in subsequent years. This will mark 2023 as the likely peak of power sector emissions.\n\nAccording to its analysis, demand growth in 2024 is expected to be higher than in 2023 (+968 TWh) but clean generation growth is forecast to be even greater (+1300 TWh), leading to a 2% fall in global fossil generation (-333 TWh).\n\n\"The decline of power sector emissions is now inevitable. 2023 was likely the pivot point - peak emissions in the power sector, a major turning point in the history of energy. But the pace of emissions falling depends on how fast the renewables revolution continues,\" said Jones.\n\nThe pace of emissions declines will be shaped by how quickly new clean power technologies come online and fossil generation decreases.\n\nAt the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) held in Dubai during December 2023, it was decided that to limit global temperature rises to 1.5\u00b0C the G7 group of industrialised nations - consisting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US - must phase out coal by 2030 and fully decarbonise electricity by 2035.\n\nIn April 2024, energy and climate ministers from the G7 met in Turin, where a deal is being agreed to phase out the use of coal power \"in the first half of the 2030s\" where the emissions have not been captured.\n\nAlso in April 2024, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced it had finalised a suite of rules to reduce pollution from fossil fuel-fired power plants in a bid \"to protect public health, advance environmental justice and confront the climate crisis\".\n\nAs well as reducing fossil fuel generation, the Ember report urges countries to focus on ramping up renewable energy generation and preparing the way for a clean, electrified economy.\n\n\"There's an unprecedented opportunity for countries that choose to be at the forefront of the clean energy future. Expanding clean electricity not only helps to decarbonise the power sector, it also provides the step up in supply needed to electrify the whole economy - and that's the real game-changer for the

The gains were driven by a 10 per cent increase in wind energy generation and a 23 per cent increase in solar power generation. In contrast, fossil fuel generation grew just 0.8 per cent year-on-year.\n\nRecord construction of new wind and solar farms last year mean the trend is likely to continue throughout 2024, while any increase in hydro generation following drought conditions in key markets during 2023 should ensure power sector emissions start to fall.\n\n\"The renewables revolution - led by solar and wind - is breaking records and driving ever-cleaner electricity production,\" the report stated. \"The world is now at a turning point where solar and wind not only slow emissions growth, but actually start to push fossil generation into decline.\n\n\"Indeed, the expansion of clean capacity would have been enough to deliver a fall in global power sector emissions in 2023. However, drought caused a five-year low in hydropower, which created a shortfall that was met in large part by coal. Nonetheless, the latest forecasts give confidence that 2024 will begin a new era of falling fossil generation, marking 2023 as the likely peak of power sector emissions.\"\n\nThe report underscores how renewables have become a mainstream player in the global power sector, having seen solar and wind grow from a 0.2 per cent of the electricity mix at the start of the century to a record 13.4 per cent last year.\n\nCombined with nuclear, the world generated almost 40 per cent of its electricity from low-carbon sources in 2023. As a result, the carbon intensity of global power generation reached a new record low and is now down 12 per cent on its 2007 peak.\n\nThe report also confirms how solar is \"leading the energy revolution\", cementing its position as the fastest-growing source of electricity generation for the 19th year in a row and adding more than twice as much new electricity as coal in 2023.\n\nIn addition, the report highlighted how the global economy appears to be making progress on improving energy efficiency. Global electricity demand rose to a record high in 2023, with an increase of 627TWh equivalent to adding the entire demand of Canada. But increased demand of 2.2 per cent was below the average for recent years, due to a pronounced decrease in demand in OECD countries.\n\n\"More than half of the electricity demand rise in 2023 was from five technologies: electric vehicles (EVs), heat pumps, electrolysers, air conditioning and data centres,\" the report stated. \"The spread of these technologies will accelerate the growth in electricity demand, but overall energy demand will decline as electrification is much more efficient than fossil fuels.\"\n\nAs such, Ember expects global power sector emissions to have peaked in 2023 and should experience a modest fall in 2024. \"Already the rollout of clean generation, led by solar and wind, has helped to slow the growth in fossil fuels by almost two-thirds in the last ten years,\" it added. \"As a result, half the world's economies are already at least five years past a peak in electricity generation from fossil fuels. OECD countries are at the forefront of this, with power sector emissions collectively peaking in 2007 and falling 28 per cent since then.\"\n\nHowever, the report also stressed that the growth in renewables generation will need to continue to accelerate rapidly if global climate goals are to be met.\n\nMultiple analyses have shown power sectors would need to be fully decarbonised by 2035 in OECD countries and by 2045 in the rest of the world to bring global emissions into line with the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe target agreed at last year's COP28 Summit to triple renewables capacity by 2030 is also in line with these goals, but would require renewables to double their share of the global power mix to 60 per cent inside just seven years.\n\nHowever, Dave Jones, global insights programme director at Ember, said the renewables sector was surpassing expectations on an annual basis.\n\n\"The renewables future has arrived,\" he said. \"Solar in particular is accelerating faster than anyone thought possible. The decline of power sector emissions is now inevitable. 2023 was likely the pivot point - peak emissions in the power sector - a major turning point in the history of energy.\n\n\"But the pace of emissions falls depends on how fast the renewables revolution continues. The good news is we already know the key enablers that help countries unleash the full potential of solar and wind. There's an unprecedented opportunity for countries that choose to be at the forefront of the clean energy future. Expanding clean electricity not only helps to decarbonise the power sector. It also provides the step up in supply needed to electrify the whole economy; and that's the real game-changer for the climate.\"\n\nThe report comes just a day after an analysis from the International Energy Agency (IEA) revealed how investment in manufacturing plants for five key clean energy technologies - solar PV, wind turbines, batteries, electrolysers, and heat pumps - surged more than 70 per cent in 2023 to $200bn, with just five sectors collectively accounting for roughly four per cent of all global GDP growth last year.\n\nSpending on solar PV manufacturing more than doubling year-on-year and investment in batteries rising by around 60 per cent, according to the figures.\n\nThe reports suggests renewable energy costs are increasingly competitive with fossil fuels in multiple markets, while supply chain constraints are being addressed. As such, industry experts are increasingly focused on grid investment and planning regimes as the two main barriers to renewables deployment that could derail efforts to deliver a decarbonised power system.\n\nYou can now sign up to attend the fifth annual Net Zero Festival, which will be hosted by BusinessGreen on October 22-23 at the Business Design Centre in London.", "source": {"uri": "businessgreen.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessGreen"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_murray@businessgreen.com", "name": "James Murray", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fossil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electricity generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OECD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydropower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydropower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaic_power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photovoltaic power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydroelectricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_intensity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emission intensity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electrolysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electrification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat pump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low-carbon economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Energy_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://image.chitra.live/api/v1/wps/2232adb/ca06a560-0a34-44bc-9d4b-4fe9eaa526ff/4/iw-climate-change-renewable-024-600x315.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547879", "eventUri": "eng-9547879", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-22", "dateEnd": "-10-23", "textStart": 6323, "textEnd": 6336}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

The main contributor to the growth was solar, which added more than twice the generation of new electricity as coal last year. Solar's surge was the fastest for the 19th year in a row and the biggest new electricity source again after surpassing wind power last year.\n\n\"The decline of power sector emissions is now inevitable. 2023 was likely the pivot point -- peak emissions in the power sector -- a major turning point in the history of energy. But the pace of emissions falls depends on how fast the renewables revolution continues,\" Jones said, according to Ember.\n\nThe report looked at power data from 215 countries. The analysis included the latest data from 2023 for 80 countries that represented 92 percent of electricity demand around the globe. It also examined data for 13 economic and geographic groupings like the European Union, Asia, Africa and the Group of Seven largest developed economies in the world.\n\nAt the United Nations COP28 climate change conference at the end of 2023, world leaders set a target of reaching 60 percent of global electricity being supplied by clean energy by 2030. The goal would mean countries would have to triple their current renewables capacity in the coming six years, reported The Guardian.\n\n\"The good news is we already know the key enablers that help countries unleash the full potential of solar and wind. There's an unprecedented opportunity for countries that choose to be at the forefront of the clean energy future. Expanding clean electricity not only helps to decarbonise the power sector. It also provides the step up in supply needed to electrify the whole economy; and that's the real game-changer for the climate,\" Jones said in Ember's summary of the report.\n\nEmber added that global power generation's carbon dioxide intensity fell to 12 percent below its peak in 2007 -- a new record low.\n\n\"The speed of solar and wind expansion is remarkable and a sign that society can bring about rapid change,\" said Niklas H\u00f6hne, a climate scientist with the NewClimate Institute, who did not contribute to Ember's research, as CNN reported.\n\nDrought conditions caused a record fall in the generation of hydropower to a five year low, Ember said. The shortfall was met by a rise in coal power generation. Nearly all -- 95 percent -- of the increase in coal generation last year was in four drought-stricken countries: India, China, Vietnam and Mexico.\n\nEmber's forecast was for fossil fuel generation to \"fall slightly\" this year, but for the decrease to grow in subsequent years.\n\nEmber said electricity demand growth was expected to be higher this year, but that the increase in green energy generation was predicted to be even greater, resulting in a reduction in global fossil fuel production of two percent.\n\n\"The decade ahead will see the energy transition enter a new phase,\" Ember said. \"Clean electricity additions - led by solar and wind - are already forecast to outpace demand growth in the coming decade, securing moderate reductions in fossil fuel use and hence emissions, even as demand accelerates to meet the growing needs of electrification and other booming technologies.\"\n\nEmber said green power was key to the decarbonization of heating, transportation and much of industry.\n\n\"An accelerating transition to a clean electrified economy powered by wind, solar and other forms of clean energy will also unlock benefits in areas such as economic growth, jobs, air quality and energy sovereignty,\" Ember said.\n\nNancy Haegel, a National Renewable Energy Laboratory research advisor, told CNN that, while the report \"does provide hope,\" the question was whether the transition to renewables would happen quickly enough.\n\n\"Choices in the next 10 years are critical,\" Haegel said.", "source": {"uri": "ecowatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EcoWatch"},

That's the same as in most years. Yet droughts in India, China, North America and Mexico meant hydropower hit a five-year low. Research shows climate change is causing droughts to develop more quickly and be more severe.\n\nPeople used more electricity than ever last year, about 2% more, an increase of about as much as Canada uses in a year. Some of this new demand was for heat pumps, which are an efficient way to both heat and cool buildings, and for electric vehicles. It was also for electrolyzers, special machines used to get hydrogen out of water, for energy. These are all technologies that provide solutions to climate change.\n\nOther increased demand was for electricity to feed new data centers and for air conditioning as places around the world become hotter.\n\nSolar made up the biggest share of new clean energy last year. More than twice as much solar power was added as coal power. It was the 19th year in a row that solar was the fastest-growing source of electricity generation. A surge in solar installations happened at the end of the year and the report predicts 2024 will see an even larger jump.\n\nRelated: Portland schools set to receive $50M for climate action\n\nChina added more renewable energy than any other country last year -- 51% of the new solar power and 60% of the new wind power globally. China, the European Union, the United States and Brazil together accounted for 81% of new solar generation in 2023.\n\nYet China was also responsible for 55% of coal generation globally and 60% of China's electricity generation came from coal. The International Energy Agency says coal is the most carbon-intensive of the fossil fuels.\n\nScientists say emissions from burning fuels like coal must ramp steeply down to protect Earth's climate, yet there was an increase in electricity made from burning fossil fuels. China, India, Vietnam and Mexico were responsible for nearly all of the rise.\n\nRelated: Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler turns to clean energy tax to fix budget woes\n\nThe report said some countries burned coal to make up for the loss of hydroelectric power they experienced when drought caused their reservoirs to dry up. This is an example of a vicious cycle -- when climate change prompts the use of more of the substances that cause climate change in the first place.\n\nDespite all the growth in clean energy, fossil fuels still made up the majority of global electricity generated last year, causing a 1% rise in global power sector emissions. Scientists say even if we slashed all greenhouse gas emissions today, the planet would continue to warm for years because of the amount of pollutants already added to the atmosphere.\n\nAnalysts expect the world to use even more electricity in 2024. But renewable energy generation is forecast to grow even faster. That could mean a 2% drop (333 terawatt-hours) in energy generated from fossil fuels.\n\n____", "source": {"uri": "opb.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "opb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Although the most striking thing about the study is the researchers' forecast, who trust that a \"new era\" of decrease in fossil energy generation is about to begin.\n\nIn the last two decades, renewable energies have gone from representing 19% of global electricity production (2000) to the current figure of 30% and, as the report concludes, has been the growth of wind and solar energy those that have driven the record.\n\n\"The future of renewable energy has arrived,\" said Dave Jones, director of Ember's Global Insights program, in a statement, adding: \"And solar energy, in particular, is accelerating faster than anyone thought possible. \".\n\nAlso in the last two decades, solar and wind energy have grown significantly, going from 0.2% in 2000 to 12.4% last year. This expansion has been even faster in the European Union, which accounted for 17% of global growth in solar and wind energy generation in 2023.\n\nOf these two energy sources, solar has established itself as the main provider of electricity growth worldwide and, for the second consecutive year, surpassed wind energy in the production of new electricity. Researchers have further noted that solar generated more than twice as much new electricity as coal in 2023, while maintaining its position as the world's fastest-growing source of electricity for the 19th consecutive year.\n\nIn terms of geographic distribution, China led in solar and wind generation, representing 51% and 60% respectively of new global generation. Greece ranked second in solar electricity generation, followed by Hungary and the Netherlands. And in the specific case of Spain, the country was the eighth country with the highest electricity generation with solar energy and the seventh with wind energy.\n\nAs a result of these changes, the group argues that the CO2 intensity of global energy generation reached a new historical low in 2023, being 12% lower than its peak in 2007. In addition, they maintain that the expansion of wind energy and Solar energy would have been enough to cause a decrease in the sector's emissions during 2023, if not for the reduction in hydroelectric power generation caused by the drought.\n\nThe report indicates that, under normal conditions, a 1.1% decrease in fossil energy generation and, therefore, in emissions would have been achieved. However, due to the drought-induced shortfall in hydropower, coal-fired electricity generation was increased to compensate, resulting in a 1% increase in global energy sector emissions.\n\nTo affirm this, they rely on the fact that almost all of the increase in coal generation last year (95%) occurred in four countries that were severely affected by droughts: China, India, Vietnam and Mexico.\n\nHowever, despite the decline in hydropower, the report maintains that the rapid growth of solar and wind energy mentioned above - as well as the projected future growth for both renewable energy sources - \"have brought the world to a point \"crucial turning point where fossil energy generation begins to decline globally.\"\n\nEmber argues that clean electricity has helped slow the growth of fossil fuels by almost two-thirds in the last ten years, and that the data collected gives them \"confidence\" that a new era of decreasing carbon emissions is about to begin. electric sector.\n\nSpecifically, they project a 2% reduction in global fossil energy generation in 2024, which will lead to further reductions in subsequent years.\n\nThe researchers add that, as a result, half of the world's economies are at least five years beyond their fossil energy peak. In the specific case of the European Union, emissions from the electricity sector would have peaked in 2007 and would have decreased by 46% since then.\n\nIn this sense, the decrease in coal production that the European Union has made in the last ten years is considered important; which has been the second largest, behind the United States.\n\n\"The decrease in emissions from the energy sector is now inevitable. The year 2023 was probably the turning point, marking the peak of emissions in this sector and representing an important milestone in the history of energy,\" explains Jones, adding: \"But the pace of emissions decline depends on what as quickly as the renewable energy revolution continues.\"\n\nAt COP28, world leaders agreed to triple global renewable energy capacity by 2030, meaning that by that year, 60% of the world's electricity should come from renewable sources. This would reduce emissions from the electricity sector by almost half and would be aligned with the 1.5\u00b0C climate goal.\n\nHowever, the report warns that to achieve these international climate change objectives, the energy sector should be the first to decarbonize; and that the decrease in emissions will be conditioned by the speed with which the expansion of clean energy continues.\n\nTo drive growth in renewables, the report highlights the importance of high-level policy ambition, incentive mechanisms and flexibility solutions, which are driving rapid growth in solar and wind energy in territories such as China, Brazil and the United States. Netherlands.\n\n\"We already know the key drivers helping countries unlock the full potential of solar and wind energy and there is an unprecedented opportunity for countries that choose to be at the forefront of the clean energy future,\" explains Jones.\n\n\"The expansion of clean electricity not only helps decarbonize the energy sector, but also provides the boost needed to electrify the entire economy; and that is the real game changer for the climate,\" closes the expert.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solar energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydropower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydropower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electricity generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Energy industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydroelectricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solar power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electrification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Low-carbon economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/05/_8ef64.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547879", "eventUri": "eng-9547879", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 434, "textEnd": 439}], "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

The year marked a turning point in the transition to low-carbon energy, according to think tank Ember, with coal and gas power on the cusp of a long-term decline.\n\nGreen electricity jumped from 29.4 per cent of total generation in 2022 to 30.3 per cent last year, a new high. This was driven by the rapid rollout of wind and solar power, particularly in China. Hydropower and other renewables, such as bioenergy, made up the remainder of renewable generation.\n\nSolar is by far the fastest-growing electricity source, increasing its share of generation from 4.6 per cent in 2022 to 5.5 per cent in 2023. That is the continuation of a long-running trend; since 2000, wind and solar power have gone from generating just 0.2 per cent of global electricity to a record 13.4 per cent today.\n\nThe share generated by fossil fuels fell from 61.4 per cent in 2022 to 60.6 per cent in 2023, but the amount of electricity produced by these fuels rose slightly because of a 2.2 per cent hike in overall energy demand, mostly in China. Nuclear provided 9.1 per cent of electricity, the same as in 2022.\n\nA further surge in wind and solar deployment means that, in absolute terms, fossil fuel generation should fall in 2024 - for the first time outside economic crises or pandemics - even as demand for electricity grows, says Ember's Hannah Broadbent.\n\n\"We really think that 2023 was a major turning point in the history of energy,\" she says. \"Not only did renewables reach this historic milestone, we also believe that it will be the peak of fossil generation as well. We expect from this year that fossil generation will start to decline at a global level.\"\n\nFossil fuel generation would have declined in absolute terms in 2023, says Broadbent, but severe droughts in China, India, Vietnam and Mexico curtailed hydropower. Coal plants stepped in to fill the gap, leading to a 1 per cent increase in power sector emissions.\n\nAssuming a partial return to normality for hydropower in 2024, Ember says it expects emissions from electricity generation to fall by 4 per cent in 2024, the start of a long-term decline for fossil fuels in the mix.\n\nHowever, green electricity deployment must increase even more rapidly over the coming years to meet the world's climate goals. Models suggest wind and solar must deliver 40 per cent of global electricity generation by the end of the decade, around triple its current contribution, in order to meet the target of stopping global warming exceeding 1.5\u00b0C.", "source": {"uri": "newscientist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Scientist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solar power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ember_(non-profit_organisation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ember (non-profit organisation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioenergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bioenergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydropower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydropower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Low-carbon power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fossil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electricity generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/02151113/SEI_202185812.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547879", "eventUri": "eng-9547879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

It also took into account historic data from 215 countries.\n\nThe report shows that record growth in wind and solar last year brought the unprecedented contribution of renewable energy to global electricity generation.\n\nWind electricity generation grew by 10% in 2023, while solar growth overtook wind -- growing 23% in the year -- to become the largest \"new\" source of electricity.\n\nSolar added twice as much new electricity generation as coal in 2023, according to the report.\n\nThe research showed that 102 countries had a renewable electricity generation share of at least 30% or higher (up from 98 in 2022) and that renewable generation exceeded 50% in 69 countries, up from 66 in 2022.\n\nThe renewables added in 2023 ought to have brought a 1.1% fall in fossil generation, but a shortfall in hydropower last year was met by an increase in coal generation, which meant global power sector emissions actually increased by 1%, Ember said.\n\nThe vast majority (95%) of the coal generation rise in 2023 occurred in four countries - China, India, Vietnam and Mexico - that were severely impacted by droughts, the report said.\n\nHowever, Ember also predicts additional growth in renewables generation this year is expected to bring a 2% drop in global fossil-fuel generation by the end of 2024.\n\nWind's 10% rise in electricity generation worldwide was driven by sweeping growth in China, with the country accounting for 60% of new global wind energy generation in 2023.\n\nOther significant contributors to wind power generation included the EU (24%) and Brazil (7%).\n\nDespite its slower growth, wind still generated more electricity worldwide (7.8%) than solar (5.5%).\n\nHowever, the growth in renewable energy generation was lower than expected.\n\nThe report said this was largely due to the slowdown in the deployment of new wind energy, which experienced a number of challenges last year, including supply chain pressures, permitting delays and inflation pushing up costs.\n\nWind growth was 18% lower than in 2022, according to the report.\n\n\"The US was a key contributor to the wind slowdown, experiencing a fall in wind generation for the first time since at least 2001 (-9.1TWh, -2.1%). Low wind conditions kept load factors close to the lowest levels seen in the past five years, while capacity additions slowed before an anticipated uplift from the Inflation Reduction Act. These were likely short-term factors, bringing confidence in a return to growth levels similar to those from 2020-2021,\" Ember said.\n\nThe firm's's director of global insights, Dave Jones, said the report highlights a significant turning point in the global power sector's emissions.\n\n\"The decline of power sector emissions is now inevitable,\" he said. \"2023 was likely the pivot point - peak emissions in the power sector - a major turning point in the history of energy. But the pace of emissions falls depends on how fast the renewables revolution continues.\"\n\nBruce Douglas, CEO of Global Renewables Alliance, said the report showed the start of the \"renewable energy era\" as he urged faster deployment and actions that would aid the rollout of more wind and solar around the world.\n\n\"The current 30% renewables share would increase dramatically by 2030 if countries deliver on their commitment to triple global renewable capacity.

Billions of people are using different kinds of energy each day and 2023 was a record-breaking year for renewable energy sources, according to a report published Wednesday, May 8, 2024, by Ember, a think tank based in London.\n\nBy Isabella O'Malley, Associated Press\n\nWednesday, May 8, 2024 | 2 a.m.\n\nBillions of people are using different kinds of energy each day and 2023 was a record-breaking year for renewable energy sources -- ones that don't emit planet-warming pollutants like carbon dioxide and methane -- according to a report published Wednesday by Ember, a think tank based in London.\n\nFor the first time, 30% of electricity produced worldwide was from clean energy sources as the number of solar and wind farms continued to grow fast.\n\nOf the types of clean energy generated last year, hydroelectric dams produced the most. That's the same as in most years. Yet droughts in India, China, North America and Mexico meant hydropower hit a five-year low. Research shows climate change is causing droughts to develop more quickly and be more severe.\n\nPeople used more electricity than ever last year, about 2% more, an increase of about as much as Canada uses in a year. Some of this new demand was for heat pumps, which are an efficient way to both heat and cool buildings, and for electric vehicles. It was also for electrolyzers, special machines used to get hydrogen out of water, for energy. These are all technologies that provide solutions to climate change.\n\nOther increased demand was for electricity to feed new data centers and for air conditioning as places around the world become hotter.\n\nSolar made up the biggest share of new clean energy last year. More than twice as much solar power was added as coal power. It was the 19th year in a row that solar was the fastest-growing source of electricity generation. A surge in solar installations happened at the end of the year and the report predicts 2024 will see an even larger jump.\n\nChina added more renewable energy than any other country last year -- 51% of the new solar power and 60% of the new wind power globally. China, the European Union, the United States and Brazil together accounted for 81% of new solar generation in 2023.\n\nYet China was also responsible for 55% of coal generation globally and 60% of China's electricity generation came from coal. The International Energy Agency says coal is the most carbon-intensive of the fossil fuels.\n\nScientists say emissions from burning fuels like coal must ramp steeply down to protect Earth's climate, yet there was an increase in electricity made from burning fossil fuels. China, India, Vietnam and Mexico were responsible for nearly all of the rise.\n\nThe report said some countries burned coal to make up for the loss of hydroelectric power they experienced when drought caused their reservoirs to dry up. This is an example of a vicious cycle -- when climate change prompts the use of more of the substances that cause climate change in the first place.\n\nDespite all the growth in clean energy, fossil fuels still made up the majority of global electricity generated last year, causing a 1% rise in global power sector emissions. Scientists say even if we slashed all greenhouse gas emissions today, the planet would continue to warm for years because of the amount of pollutants already added to the atmosphere.\n\nAnalysts expect the world to use even more electricity in 2024. But renewable energy generation is forecast to grow even faster. That could mean a 2% drop (333 terawatt-hours) in energy generated from fossil fuels.", "source": {"uri": "lasvegassun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Renewables have expanded from 19% of global electricity in 2000, driven by an increase in solar and wind from 0.2% in 2000 to a record 13.4% in 2023.\n\n\"Solar is leading the energy revolution,\" said the report. \"It was the fastest-growing source of electricity generation for the 19th year in a row, and surpassed wind to become the largest source of new electricity for the second year running.\"\n\nChina was the main contributor to solar growth in 2023, accounting for 51%. Other major contributors were the EU (12%) and the U.S. (11%). Together the four solar growth economies, China, EU, the U.S., and Brazil, accounted for 81% solar growth in 2023.\n\nSolar reached a 5.5% share of the global electricity mix, reaching 1,631 TWh, rising from 4.6% in 2022.\n\n\"Despite reaching new record highs, the absolute growth in wind and solar (+513 TWh) was below expectations and slightly smaller than in 2022 (+517 TWh). This was mainly due to lower-than-expected wind growth, which was 18% lower compared to the 249 TWh increase in 2022,\" said Ember.\n\nDemand for electricity grew by 637 TWh globally in 2023, rising 2.2%, or the equivalent of adding the entire electricity demand of Canada to the total. This brought global electricity demand to a record 29,471 TWh. The increase in demand in 2023 was slightly lower than the average annual increase over the previous decade of 2.5%.\n\nSolar and wind met most of the increased electricity demand globally, adding 513 TWh of generation, or about 82% of new demand.\n\n\"Despite their lower-than-expected growth, solar and wind were the powerhouses of newly added clean electricity,\" said the report. \"In aggregate, all other clean electricity sources fell - small rises in bioenergy and nuclear were not enough to counter the large fall in hydro generation caused by extensive droughts. Together, all clean sources met 79% of the increase in electricity demand, creating a shortfall that was met by fossil generation.\"\n\nThe unprecedented growth of solar energy is leading the charge toward a carbon-free energy system, said Ember. In the decade of 2000 to 2010 cumulative global capacity doubled every two years, then from 2010 to 2023 the rate slowed to doubling every three years. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said that if solar deployment continues along an arc of doubling every 3.8 years from 2023 to 2030, the world will be on-pace for its Net Zero Economy scenario.\n\n\"Solar capacity has boomed due to steep declines in costs, supportive policy environments, technology efficiency improvements, and increased manufacturing capability,\" said Ember. \"A key to the rapid rise is Wright's law of technology learning curves, whereby the technology gets cheaper as it is deployed more and it is deployed more as it gets cheaper.\"\n\nCombined with nuclear, the world generated about 40% of its electricity from low-carbon sources in 2023. Ember said this has resulted in CO2 intensity of global power generation falling 12% lower than its peak in 2007.\n\nHowever, despite the average emissions per unit of energy generated decreasing in 2023, carbon emissions are higher than ever. Absolute fossil fuel generation increased 0.8% over the year, and global emissions increased by 1%, reaching 14,153 million tons of CO2 emitted by electricity generation.\n\n\"2023 came very close to becoming the first year of a new era of falling power sector emissions,\" said Ember. \"As clean electricity growth continues, we have growing confidence that in 2024, it will rise above electricity demand and lead to a fall in emissions.\"\n\nClean energy capacity growth was already large enough to deliver a decline in emissions 2023, but a record fall in hydropower generation due to droughts prevented that. Ember said that 2023 likely marked the peak of power sector emissions.", "source": {"uri": "pv-magazine-usa.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "pv magazine USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_kennedy@pv-magazine-usa.com", "name": "Ryan Kennedy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ember_(non-profit_organisation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ember (non-profit organisation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt-hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kilowatt-hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fossil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electricity generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioenergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bioenergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Energy system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Energy_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solar energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Low-carbon economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hydroelectricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ton"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/Ember.png?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547879", "eventUri": "eng-9547879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

It predicts global fossil fuel generation will fall slightly in 2024, before experiencing much bigger declines in subsequent years.\n\nIt's a significant step toward the world reaching 60% renewable electricity by 2030, which is critical to meeting global climate goals, said Dave Jones, global insights director at Ember.\n\n\"The renewables future has arrived,\" Jones said. \"Solar in particular is accelerating faster than anyone thought possible.\"\n\nA look at the data reveals just how much the global power sector is changing.\n\nIn 2000, renewables made up less than 19% of the global energy mix. Now they make up more than 30%. Taking nuclear energy into account, the world generated almost 40% of its electricity from low-carbon sources last year.\n\nAlthough global levels of planet-heating pollution reached a record high in 2023, the boom in renewables has pushed the electricity sector's carbon intensity -- the amount of carbon pollution produced per unit of electricity -- to a record low in 2023, 12% less than its 2007 peak.\n\nThe rise of renewables is also pushing fossil fuels into decline, slowing their growth by almost two-thirds over the past decade, the report found. Already, more than half of countries are five years past their peak in fossil fuel-generated electricity.\n\nFossil fuels' share in the overall electricity mix has fallen from 64.7% in 2000 to 60.6% in 2023. Ember predicts this number will drop significantly in 2024, to 57.6%, as the rapid increase in solar starts to be felt.\n\n\"We're going to get that boom in renewables, which will really change the picture very quickly,\" Jones told CNN.\n\nSolar was the fastest-growing source of electricity in 2023 for the 19th consecutive year, according to the report. It made up nearly twice as much new electricity generation as coal last year.\n\nThe surge of solar installations happened at the end of 2023, so the full effect is yet to be felt, said Jones. \"I think that 2024 will bring a bit of a shock when you start seeing those numbers,\" he said, especially among those who assume the demand for fossil fuels such as gas is going to just keep rising.\n\nWhile coal and gas still make up the bulk of global electricity generation, their growth rate last year was far lower than that of wind and solar.\n\n\"The speed of solar and wind expansion is remarkable and a sign that society can bring about rapid change,\" said Niklas H\u00f6hne, a climate scientist at the non-profit the NewClimate Institute, who was not involved in Ember's research.\n\nRenewable growth would have been even higher if it hadn't been for significant drops in hydropower output due to drought in countries such as China and India, the report found. The shortfall was mostly filled by coal.\n\nBut it's a different story when looking at how big a role it plays in China's national electricity mix -- just 6%, far below many other major solar-producing nations.\n\nSolar makes up more than 10% of annual electricity generation in 33 countries, according to the report, including Chile (30%), Australia (17%) and the Netherlands (17%) -- and California, the world's fifth-largest economy, generates 28% of its electricity from solar.\n\nGlobal electricity demand increased to a record high in 2023 -- adding the equivalent of Canada's entire electricity demand -- but the rate of growth slowed compared to the average over the past decade.\n\nChina was the main driver of demand, while the United States and the European Union saw sharp falls amid milder weather and -- particularly for the EU -- a temporary slump in industrial activity.\n\nElectricity demand is set to soar from 2024 onward, Ember's analysis found. Electric vehicles, heat pumps and electrolysis -- the process used to make green hydrogen, a much-hyped clean energy -- will increase demand, alongside technologies such as air conditioning and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe spread of these technologies will increase the growth in electricity demand, but overall demand will decline as electrification is more efficient than fossil fuels, according to the report.\n\nOverall, Ember's report \"does provide hope,\" said Nancy Haegel, a research advisor at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, who was not involved in the analysis. \"It shows that we can generate significant amounts of electricity with renewable energy.\"\n\nThe question is whether the pace of the transition will be fast enough, she told CNN. \"Choices in the next 10 years are critical.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

It predicts global fossil fuel generation will fall slightly in 2024, before experiencing much bigger declines in subsequent years.\n\nIt's a significant step toward the world reaching 60% renewable electricity by 2030, which is critical to meeting global climate goals, said Dave Jones, global insights director at Ember.\n\n\"The renewables future has arrived,\" Jones said. \"Solar in particular is accelerating faster than anyone thought possible.\"\n\nA look at the data reveals just how much the global power sector is changing.\n\nRecord-breaking renewables\n\nIn 2000, renewables made up less than 19% of the global energy mix. Now they make up more than 30%. Taking nuclear energy into account, the world generated almost 40% of its electricity from low-carbon sources last year.\n\nAlthough global levels of planet-heating pollution reached a record high in 2023, the boom in renewables has pushed the electricity sector's carbon intensity -- the amount of carbon pollution produced per unit of electricity -- to a record low in 2023, 12% less than its 2007 peak.\n\nThe rise of renewables is also pushing fossil fuels into decline, slowing their growth by almost two-thirds over the past decade, the report found. Already, more than half of countries are five years past their peak in fossil fuel-generated electricity.\n\nFossil fuels' share in the overall electricity mix has fallen from 64.7% in 2000 to 60.6% in 2023. Ember predicts this number will drop significantly in 2024, to 57.6%, as the rapid increase in solar starts to be felt.\n\n\"We're going to get that boom in renewables, which will really change the picture very quickly,\" Jones told CNN.\n\nBooming solar\n\nSolar was the fastest-growing source of electricity in 2023 for the 19th consecutive year, according to the report. It made up nearly twice as much new electricity generation as coal last year.\n\nThe surge of solar installations happened at the end of 2023, so the full effect is yet to be felt, said Jones. \"I think that 2024 will bring a bit of a shock when you start seeing those numbers,\" he said, especially among those who assume the demand for fossil fuels such as gas is going to just keep rising.\n\nWhile coal and gas still make up the bulk of global electricity generation, their growth rate last year was far lower than that of wind and solar.\n\n\"The speed of solar and wind expansion is remarkable and a sign that society can bring about rapid change,\" said Niklas H\u00f6hne, a climate scientist at the non-profit the NewClimate Institute, who was not involved in Ember's research.\n\nRenewable growth would have been even higher if it hadn't been for significant drops in hydropower output due to drought in countries such as China and India, the report found. The shortfall was mostly filled by coal.\n\nChina leading the pack\n\nChina is far and away the leader on solar, accounting for nearly 36% of global generation last year.\n\nBut it's a different story when looking at how big a role it plays in China's national electricity mix -- just 6%, far below many other major solar-producing nations.\n\nSolar makes up more than 10% of annual electricity generation in 33 countries, according to the report, including Chile (30%), Australia (17%) and the Netherlands (17%) -- and California, the world's fifth-largest economy, generates 28% of its electricity from solar.\n\nElectricity demand set to soar\n\nGlobal electricity demand increased to a record high in 2023 -- adding the equivalent of Canada's entire electricity demand -- but the rate of growth slowed compared to the average over the past decade.\n\nChina was the main driver of demand, while the United States and the European Union saw sharp falls amid milder weather and -- particularly for the EU -- a temporary slump in industrial activity.\n\nElectricity demand is set to soar from 2024 onward, Ember's analysis found. Electric vehicles, heat pumps and electrolysis -- the process used to make green hydrogen, a much-hyped clean energy -- will increase demand, alongside technologies such as air conditioning and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe spread of these technologies will increase the growth in electricity demand, but overall demand will decline as electrification is more efficient than fossil fuels, according to the report.\n\nOverall, Ember's report \"does provide hope,\" said Nancy Haegel, a research advisor at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, who was not involved in the analysis. \"It shows that we can generate significant amounts of electricity with renewable energy.\"\n\nThe question is whether the pace of the transition will be fast enough, she told CNN. \"Choices in the next 10 years are critical.\"\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

India's ambitious plans to triple its renewable capacity by 2030 underscore its commitment to this cause, although Ember's analysis suggests that significant increases in annual capacity additions are needed to meet this target.\n\n(With PTI inputs)", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "republic_world_digital@republicworld.com", "name": "Republic World Digital", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solar energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solar power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_generator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric generator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_intensity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emission intensity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electrification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electricity generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydroelectricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Energy_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nameplate_capacity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nameplate capacity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 43}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "wgt": 28}], "image": "https://img.republicworld.com/rbharatimage/solarenergyproduction-sutterstocks-171518017627516_9.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547879", "eventUri": "eng-9547879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

The analysis also includes data for 13 geographic and economic groupings, such as Africa, Asia, the EU and the G7.\n\nRenewables have expanded from 19% of global electricity in 2000, driven by an increase in solar and wind from 0.2% in 2000 to a record 13.4% in 2023.\n\nSolar is leading the energy revolution. It was the fastest-growing source of electricity generation for the 19th year in a row, and surpassed wind to become the largest source of new electricity for the second year in a row.\n\nEmber said while global electricity demand slowed in 2023, it will only go up in the future.\n\nMore than half of the electricity demand rise in 2023 was from five technologies: electric vehicles, heat pumps, electrolyzers, air conditioning and data centers. As the use of these technologies increases, the growth in electricity demand will increase. However, the report points out, overall energy demand will decline as electrification is much more efficient than fossil fuels.\n\nEmber forecasts fossil generation to fall slightly in 2024, leading to larger falls in subsequent years.\n\n\"Already the rollout of clean generation, led by solar and wind, has helped to slow the growth in fossil fuels by almost two-thirds in the last ten years. As a result, half the world's economies are already at least five years past a peak in electricity generation from fossil fuels,\" the report states.\n\nThe decade ahead will see the energy transition enter a new phase. A permanent decline in fossil fuel use in the power sector at a global level is now inevitable, leading to falling sector emissions.\n\nClean electricity additions - led by solar and wind - are already forecast to outpace demand growth in the coming decade, securing moderate reductions in fossil fuel use and hence emissions, even as demand accelerates to meet the growing needs of electrification and other technologies.\n\nFor the goal of achieving international climate change targets, this is critical, with multiple analyses finding that the power sector should be the first to decarbonize - by 2035 in OECD countries, by 2045 in the rest of the world.\n\nThe pace of delines in emmissions will be shaped by how quickly the build-out of clean power continues. There is a global consensus on the scale of ambition needed. At the UN's COP28 climate change conference in December, world leaders reached a historic agreement to triple global renewables capacity by 2030. The target would see the world reach 60% renewable electricity by 2030, almost halving power sector emissions and putting the world on a pathway aligned with the 1.5C climate goal.\n\n\"The renewables future has arrived. Solar in particular is accelerating faster than anyone thought possible. The decline of power sector emissions is now inevitable. 2023 was likely the pivot point - peak emissions in the power sector - a major turning point in the history of energy. But the pace of emissions falls depends on how fast the renewables revolution continues.\n\n\"The good news is we already know the key enablers that help countries unleash the full potential of solar and wind. There's an unprecedented opportunity for countries that choose to be at the forefront of the clean energy future.\n\n\"Expanding clean electricity not only helps to decarbonize the power sector. It also provides the step up in supply needed to electrify the whole economy; and that's the real game-changer for the climate,\" said Dave Jones, Global Insights Program Director at Ember.", "source": {"uri": "renewableenergymagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Renewable Energy Magazine, at the heart of clean energy journalism"}, "authors": [{"uri": "beth_anton@renewableenergymagazine.com", "name": "Beth Anton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electricity generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electrolysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electrification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heat pump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_supply_and_consumption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World energy supply and consumption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fossil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_transition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Energy transition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OECD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Low-carbon economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.renewableenergymagazine.com/ficheroenergias/fotos/fossil.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547879", "eventUri": "eng-9547879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

The rapid growth of solar power led to a record-breaking year for clean energy generation in 2023, and the year is expected to mark the start of a long-term decline in fossil fuels. Renewables generated a record share of global electricity in 2023 thanks to the rapid growth of wind and solar power. The year marked a turning point in the transition to low-carbon energy, according to think tank Ember, with coal and gas power on the cusp of a long-term decline. Green electricity jumped from 29.4 per cent of total generation in 2022 to 30.3 per cent last year, a new high. This was driven by the rapid rollout of wind and solar power, particularly in China.

It says they are now growing fast enough to exceed rising demand, meaning there will be a peak in fossil fuel electricity generation - and emissions - from this year. As a result, Ember says in its latest annual review of global electricity data that a \"new era of falling fossil fuel generation is imminent\". Renewables met a record 30% of global electricity demand in 2023 and emissions from the sector would already have peaked if not for a record fall in hydropower, the analysis says.

Solar power boomed in 2023, the fastest growing source of electricity generation for the 19th year running, according to new data.\n\nCNN --\n\nThe world has passed a clean energy milestone, as a boom in wind and solar meant a record-breaking 30% of the world's electricity was produced by renewables last year, new data shows.\n\nThe planet is reaching \"a crucial turning point\" toward clean energy, according to the Global Electricity Review published Wednesday by climate think tank Ember. It predicts global fossil fuel generation will fall slightly in 2024, before experiencing much bigger declines in subsequent years.\n\nIt's a significant step toward the world reaching 60% renewable electricity by 2030, which is critical to meeting global climate goals, said Dave Jones, global insights director at Ember.\n\n\"The renewables future has arrived,\" Jones said. \"Solar in particular is accelerating faster than anyone thought possible.\"\n\nA look at the data reveals just how much the global power sector is changing.\n\nRecord-breaking renewables\n\nIn 2000, renewables made up less than 19% of the global energy mix. Now they make up more than 30%. Taking nuclear energy into account, the world generated almost 40% of its electricity from low-carbon sources last year.\n\nAlthough global levels of planet-heating pollution reached a record high in 2023, the boom in renewables has pushed the electricity sector's carbon intensity -- the amount of carbon pollution produced per unit of electricity -- to a record low in 2023, 12% less than its 2007 peak.\n\nThe rise of renewables is also pushing fossil fuels into decline, slowing their growth by almost two-thirds over the past decade, the report found. Already, more than half of countries are five years past their peak in fossil fuel-generated electricity.\n\nFossil fuels' share in the overall electricity mix has fallen from 64.7% in 2000 to 60.6% in 2023. Ember predicts this number will drop significantly in 2024, to 57.6%, as the rapid increase in solar starts to be felt.\n\n\"We're going to get that boom in renewables, which will really change the picture very quickly,\" Jones told CNN.\n\nBooming solar\n\nSolar was the fastest-growing source of electricity in 2023 for the 19th consecutive year, according to the report. It made up nearly twice as much new electricity generation as coal last year.\n\nThe surge of solar installations happened at the end of 2023, so the full effect is yet to be felt, said Jones. \"I think that 2024 will bring a bit of a shock when you start seeing those numbers,\" he said, especially among those who assume the demand for fossil fuels such as gas is going to just keep rising.\n\nWhile coal and gas still make up the bulk of global electricity generation, their growth rate last year was far lower than that of wind and solar.\n\n\"The speed of solar and wind expansion is remarkable and a sign that society can bring about rapid change,\" said Niklas H\u00f6hne, a climate scientist at the non-profit the NewClimate Institute, who was not involved in Ember's research.\n\nRenewable growth would have been even higher if it hadn't been for significant drops in hydropower output due to drought in countries such as China and India, the report found. The shortfall was mostly filled by coal.\n\nChina leading the pack\n\nChina is far and away the leader on solar, accounting for nearly 36% of global generation last year.\n\nBut it's a different story when looking at how big a role it plays in China's national electricity mix -- just 6%, far below many other major solar-producing nations.\n\nSolar makes up more than 10% of annual electricity generation in 33 countries, according to the report, including Chile (30%), Australia (17%) and the Netherlands (17%) -- and California, the world's fifth-largest economy, generates 28% of its electricity from solar.\n\nElectricity demand set to soar\n\nGlobal electricity demand increased to a record high in 2023 -- adding the equivalent of Canada's entire electricity demand -- but the rate of growth slowed compared to the average over the past decade.\n\nChina was the main driver of demand, while the United States and the European Union saw sharp falls amid milder weather and -- particularly for the EU -- a temporary slump in industrial activity.\n\nElectricity demand is set to soar from 2024 onward, Ember's analysis found. Electric vehicles, heat pumps and electrolysis -- the process used to make green hydrogen, a much-hyped clean energy -- will increase demand, alongside technologies such as air conditioning and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe spread of these technologies will increase the growth in electricity demand, but overall demand will decline as electrification is more efficient than fossil fuels, according to the report.\n\nOverall, Ember's report \"does provide hope,\" said Nancy Haegel, a research advisor at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, who was not involved in the analysis. \"It shows that we can generate significant amounts of electricity with renewable energy.\"\n\nThe question is whether the pace of the transition will be fast enough, she told CNN. \"Choices in the next 10 years are critical.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "laura_paddison@cnn.com", "name": "Laura Paddison", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}],

Solar power generation surge of 23% and the 10% rise in wind power output, in comparison to an increase of just 0.8% in facilities that run on fossil fuels are the think tank's other main takeaways.\n\nThe report's authors estimated that last year marked the peak in emissions in the power sector. More than half of economies, 118 of them, are already at least five years past their peak. Their combined emissions have fallen by a quarter in the last decade. Collectively, they represent 43% of global electricity demand.\n\nWind and solar generation continued to expand faster than any other source of electricity. Together they reached a new record high of 13.4% (3.94 PWh) in 2023, gaining 1.5 percentage points of the global electricity mix from the year before. China was the main contributor, accounting for 51% of the additional global solar generation in 2023 and 60% of new global wind generation.\n\nTogether the top four solar growth economies - China, the European Union, United States and Brazil - had a 81% share in solar power growth in 2023, Ember underscored.\n\nWith nuclear power in the equation, low-carbon technologies provided almost 40% of electricity production\n\nChina accounted for 51% of additional global solar generation and 60% of new global wind generation.

However, drought caused a five-year low in hydropower and a record year-over-year drop, of 88 TWh to 4.21 PWh. It created a modest shortfall that was met in large part by coal.\n\nThe growth in solar power output, of 307 TWh or 23%, outpaced wind (206 TWh and 9.8%, respectively), for the second year in a row. Photovoltaics reached a 5.5% share of the global electricity mix (1.63 PWh) 0r 0.9 points more than in 2022. Wind still provided a higher share of global electricity, 7.8% (2.3 PWh).\n\nSolar added more than twice as much new electricity as coal in 2023 and it was the fastest-growing source of electricity for the 19th year in a row.\n\nDespite reaching new record highs, the absolute growth in wind and solar power was below expectations and slightly smaller than in 2022. Ember noted that the increase in wind output was 18% lower than in 2022.\n\nGlobal electricity demand rose by 627 TWh to a record high.

That's the biggest takeaway from the annual report produced by the energy think tank where I work, Ember.\n\nThe rapid growth in solar and wind power has brought the world to a crucial pivot point -- likely this year -- where fossil fuel-powered generation will start to decline at a global level.\n\nAs a result, 2023 will likely go down in history as the peak of emissions in the power sector. That's incredibly positive news. Fossil fuels may still generate 61% of the world's electricity, but the renewables future is coming into sight. And faster than you think.\n\nBut there's still a long way to go. The pace of emissions falling -- and what that means for efforts to keep temperature increases within the world's 1.5 degree Celsius target -- depends on how fast this renewables revolution goes.\n\nHere are five things you need to know from our landmark report.\n\nGrowth in building out solar and wind pushed the world past 30% renewable electricity last year for the first time ever.\n\nThe pace of change is astonishing. Hydropower has historically been the dominant source of the world's renewable electricity, providing around a sixth of the world's electricity in the last two decades. But the newcomers on the scene -- solar and wind -- are driving all the recent growth. Together, they generated a record 13% of global electricity in 2023, double what they accounted for in 2017.\n\nLast year also brought clean energy and fossil fuels into competition like never before: In 2023, for the first time, global investment in solar topped investment in oil production.\n\nThe growth in solar capacity installed in 2023 was truly off the scale.\n\nThe prior year already saw record levels of solar-power installations, breaking 200 gigawatts for the first time. Last year smashed that with 444 GW, topping virtually every credible forecast. As recently as 2022, the International Energy Agency forecast only 257 GW.\n\nThe continued supply of cheap solar meant that it maintained its status as the world's fastest-growing source of electricity generation for the 19th consecutive year.\n\nChina is leading the charge. The country installed more solar panels in 2023 than the US has in its entire history. Clean energy was the top driver of China's economic growth in 2023. For other fast-growing solar markets like South Africa, a secure supply of electricity is a major motivating factor.\n\nSolar power is taking off around the world, but many sunny countries have still yet to harness its potential.\n\nSix countries generated at least a sixth of their electricity from solar last year. Some intuitively make sense: Chile topped the table with 20% of its electricity coming from solar in 2023, up from just 2% in 2015. Others are surprising. The Netherlands -- not known as a particularly bright or warm place -- ranked fourth, proving that it's not the sun that matters, but enabling policies.\n\nThose examples show how much further the solar boom has to go. Countries like Egypt, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia still generate less than 3% of their electricity from solar, despite some of the best conditions in the world. For sunny regions like Africa, overcoming financial barriers will be crucial.\n\nThe early adopters of solar are proving that whether you are a sunny country or not, solar can rapidly become a major source of cheap, clean electricity.\n\nSolar's sidekick has had a tougher year, with weak Midwest breezes in the US a key cause of slower-than-expected growth in the world's wind generation in 2023.\n\nBut long-term trends suggest that the recent blip won't hold back wind power. Overall wind generation still reached a new record high in 2023, tripling since 2015. Like with solar, China continues to lead, installing 65% of the global wind-power capacity added during 2023.\n\nDespite concerns that the industry is struggling, its long-term outlook nevertheless looks encouraging: The offshore wind industry is overcoming its inflationary and planning problems, though cheap onshore wind remains largely untapped.\n\nWind doesn't need the same rapid trajectory as solar to put the world on course for net zero. But it will be crucial to rapidly replacing fossil fuels, and needs to become the backbone alongside solar of the future clean electricity system.\n\nA new era of falling fossil generation is imminent. 2023 will likely go down in history as the peak of emissions in the power sector.\n\nThe rapid growth in solar and wind has brought the world to this crucial pivot point. Solar and wind have already helped to slow the growth in fossil generation over the last decade, and 2024 will bring a bumper year of renewable generation, with the rise in solar generation set to double from the previous year.\n\nA long-term decline in power sector emissions is now not just inevitable but imminent, even as the world enters a new phase of higher electricity demand as we electrify all manner of technologies from transportation to heating.\n\nThe pace of emissions falls still depends on how fast the renewables revolution continues. It's a big task, but the costs are far outweighed by the benefits -- a liveable planet, with cheaper and more secure energy.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

Its authors say that this rapid growth has brought the world to a crucial turning point where fossil fuel generation starts to decline.\n\nClean power sources have already helped to slow the growth in fossil fuels by almost two-thirds in the last 10 years.\n\n\"The renewables future has arrived,\" says Dave Jones, Ember's director of global insights. \"Solar in particular is accelerating faster than anyone thought possible.\"\n\nSolar was the world's main supplier of electricity last year, providing twice as much new energy than coal. It maintained its status as the fastest-growing source of energy for the 19th year in a row.\n\nThe EU is well ahead of the global average generating 44 per cent of its energy from renewables. Expansion of solar and wind is happening much faster than the rest of the world with the bloc contributing 17 per cent of global growth in 2023.\n\nGreece had the world's second-highest share of solar power in its energy mix at 19 per cent, according to the report, followed by Hungary (18 per cent) and the Netherlands (17 per cent). Chile was in first place, with almost 20 per cent.\n\nSarah Brown, Ember's European programme director, says the EU is ahead due to \"early adoption and early action\". The European Green Deal has been instrumental in setting targets, creating policies and securing investments, she adds.\n\n\"You've got obviously that early adoption, people are aiming for decarbonising the power sector and the best way to do that is through wind and solar,\" Brown explains.\n\n\"You also have the invasion of Ukraine which increased the sense of urgency around transitioning to clean power and getting off relying on fossil fuels - not just coal but also gas, and particularly from Russia. That was a big boost for accelerating the transition across the EU.\"\n\nThen in 2022, REPowerEU saw packages to boost implementation of wind and solar. Plans were put in place to help individual member states reach renewable energy targets and deploy technologies at a national scale.\n\nThere was a fall in energy demand due to the energy crisis, cost of living crisis and mild weather over the last few years. There was also a lot of talk about coal filling the gap when that demand rose again with increasing electrification.\n\nBut Brown says that towards the end of last year and the beginning of this year, demand has plateaued and stabilised.\n\n\"Certainly you can't ignore that there was some demand [based] impact on the decrease in use of fossil fuels, but also there was a significant role of wind and solar replacing it.\"\n\nOverall, she says, the EU is \"very much on the way\" to its goal of having renewable sources account for 72 per cent of power generation by 2030.\n\nGlobally, the Ember report says, renewable energy growth could have been even higher in 2023 if it weren't for a five-year low in generation from hydropower. This was due to drought in China and other parts of the world.\n\nNormally this would have meant that the clean energy capacity added around the world last year would have caused fossil fuel generation to drop by 1.1 per cent. Instead, it was met with an increase in coal power, causing a 1 per cent increase in global power sector emissions.\n\nFour countries severely affected by drought - China, India, Vietnam and Mexico - accounted for 95 per cent of the rise in coal generation.\n\nDespite this, the report's authors say that expected clean energy growth gives them confidence that a new era of declining power sector emissions is about to begin. They predict a 2 per cent drop in fossil fuel generation this year with half the world's economies now at least five years past a peak in fossil power.\n\n\"The decline of power sector emissions is now inevitable,\" Jones says.\n\n\"2023 was likely the pivot point - peak emissions in the power sector - a major turning point in the history of energy. But the pace of emissions falls depends on how fast the renewables revolution continues.\"\n\nKey enablers like the EU with high-level policy ambition, incentive mechanisms and flexibility solutions need to continue to \"unleash the full potential of solar and wind\", he adds, for this momentum to continue.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"},

It is the same as most years. However, droughts in India, China, North America and Mexico meant that hydropower hit a five-year low. Research shows climate change is causing droughts to develop faster and be more severe.\n\nPeople used more electricity than ever last year, about 2% more, an increase of about as much as Canada uses in a year. Some of this new demand was for heat pumpswhich are an efficient way of heating and cooling buildings, and for electric vehicles. It was also for electrolyzers, special machines that were used to take hydrogen without water, for energy. These are all technologies that provide solutions to climate change.\n\nOther growing demand was for electricity to power new data centers and for air conditioning as countries around the world heat up.\n\nSolar accounted for most of the new clean energy last year. More than twice as much solar power was added as coal power. It was the 19th year in a row that solar was the fastest growing source of electricity generation. A surge in solar installations occurred at the end of the year, and the report predicts that 2024 will see an even bigger jump.\n\nChina added more renewable energy than any other country last year, 51% of new solar power and 60% of new wind power globally. China, the European Union, the United States and Brazil together accounted for 81% of new solar generation in 2023.\n\nHowever, China was also responsible for 55% of global coal production and 60% of China's electricity generation came from coal. of International Energy Agency states that coal is the most carbon-laden of fossil fuels.\n\nScientists say emissions from burning fossil fuels like coal must be sharply reduced to protect the Earth's climate, yet there has been an increase in electricity produced by burning fossil fuels. China, India, Vietnam and Mexico were responsible for almost all of the growth.\n\nThe report said some countries were burning coal to compensate for the loss of hydroelectric power they experienced when the drought caused their reservoirs to dry up. This is an example of a vicious cycle where climate change drives the use of more of the substances that cause climate change in the first place.\n\nDespite all the growth in clean energy, fossil fuels still accounted for the majority of global electricity produced last year, causing a 1% increase in global energy sector emissions. Scientists say that even if we cut all greenhouse gas emissions today, the planet would continue to warm for years because of the amount of pollutants already added to the atmosphere.\n\nAnalysts expect the world to use even more electricity in 2024. But renewable energy production is projected to grow even faster. This could mean a 2% (333 terawatt-hours) drop in energy produced from fossil fuels.\n\nThe Associated Press's climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from many private foundations.

It looks at 80 countries and assesses their energy growth, since they make up 92 percent of global electricity demand.\n\nThe report states that for the first time ever, the world has achieved 30 percent of renewable energy in its total energy mix as of 2023, and most of this addition comes from solar and wind energy sources.\n\nSince the goal of the COP28 climate summit (held in Dubai last year) is to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030, renewable energy is expected to make up 60 percent of global energy consumption by then.\n\n\"The renewables future has arrived,\" Ember's global insights director Dave Jones said in a communication. \"Solar in particular is accelerating faster than anyone thought possible.\"\n\nUntil 2021, wind energy growth had always been higher than solar energy's, but in 2022 and 2023, solar has surpassed wind as the fastest-growing renewable energy source.\n\nSolar's rise in most countries has been due to supportive policies, rapid drop in prices and availability of solar panel modules and a drop in battery storage costs, states the report. To put it in context, in 2022, global solar capacity addition was 268 GW, according to BloombergNEF, while it was 444 GW in 2023. This is a big rise, and according to forecasts from the International Energy Agency and Ember, this is expected to grow even more.\n\nSolar energy's growth rate in the last decade (2012-2022) has been 23 percent, which is positive news. Ember's report forecasts that to achieve the tripling of renewable energy capacity globally by 2030, solar energy needs to maintain just a 9 percent growth rate in the next decade.\n\nThe Global Electricity Review 2024 also highlighted that while solar and wind energy generation saw 23 percent and 10 percent growth, respectively, in 2023. Fossil fuel generation logged 0.8 percent growth in the same period.\n\nAlso Read: India's solar waste to fill 720 Olympic-sized pools by 2030 -- CEEW study calls for robust recycling\n\nAccording to the analysts at Ember, fossil fuel energy generation is expected to fall slightly this year due to solar and wind energy growth.\n\nEmber's report further states that half of the countries in the world have already crossed their \"peak fossil fuel electricity generation\" point and are five years past it.\n\nMost major economies are \"steadily declining\" in coal generation. The US saw a 19 percent fall, Japan saw a 6.3 percent decline while the European Union saw a 25 percent slump in coal generation, but the reasons were different, the report notes.\n\nIn the US, it was mainly the switch to natural gas from coal, while in the EU it was wind and solar energy that contributed to this reduction.\n\nIndia, however, is still one of the top four coal generating countries, along with China, Vietnam and Mexico. China is expected to see a 3 percent fall in coal generation in 2024, but there are no such forecasts for India currently.\n\nChina and India are also among the nations where global electricity demand was the highest, and Ember forecasts that this will continue to grow because of strong GDP growth, rise in electric cars and heat pumps, and also the industrial push in these countries right now.\n\nFurther, the rise in fossil fuel generation in China and India in 2023 was due to recurring droughts that reduced their capacity to generate hydro-energy. In India, hydro-generation dropped by 15 percent while China saw a 4.5 percent drop, according to the report.\n\nHydropower actually fell to a five-year low in 2023 because of the droughts, but remains the largest clean energy source in the world right now. The reason the power sector emissions did not see a reduction globally is because of the recorded loss of hydropower, however, solar energy is slowly expected to make up this loss.\n\nAnother key reason for rising electricity demand across the world is the increasing use of air conditioners, notes the Ember report.\n\nIndia's solar energy generation is in line with the global trajectory, since it saw the world's fourth-largest increase in solar generation in 2023 by adding 18+ TWh of solar energy. It is right behind China, US and Brazil, which added 156 TWh, 33 TWh and 22 TWh, respectively, last year.\n\nThis rise in solar energy has occurred steadily, with India's current solar capacity being 17 times higher than its 2015 capacity. In addition to power generation, India has also taken strides in adding to its battery storage capacity.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) announced that it has granted regulatory approval to India's first commercial utility-level Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) at Kilokari substation in Delhi. Since it is a utility-level unit, the BESS has a 20 MW/40 MW per hour capacity, which is 100 times what a usual residential BESS would have.\n\nWith this new energy storage system, partially funded by the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP), the government plans to provide 24\u00d77 reliable power supply to 12,000 low-income households, according to a statement by GEAPP.\n\nRenewable energy storage systems are one of the biggest challenges for energy transition in the upcoming decades, according to the Ember report. Projects such as the GEAPP and DERC's commercial storage system in Kilokari will be crucial in the future if India is to meet its COP28 renewable energy targets.", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in",

It analyses data from the majority of the world's nations, collectively representing more than 92% of global electricity demand.\n\nAccording to the review, 30% of the world's electricity generation in 2023 was renewable. A further 10% was nuclear.\n\nEmber tracked a 23% increase in solar electricity generation year-on-year for 2023. More than twice as much new electricity generation was provided during the year by solar than by coal, largely due to a surge in installations in the second half of the year.\n\nAdditionally recorded is a 10% year-on-year increase in wind generation growth.\n\nThis means that wind has scaled more rapidly than any other sources of electricity generation in history, surpassing the 1,000TWh per year mark within eight years. Comparatively, this milestone took 12 years in nuclear and wind, 32 years in coal and 28 in gas.\n\n'A crucial turning point'\n\nHistorically, while renewable and nuclear electricity generation rates have increased, so too have rates of fossil fuel generation - largely to keep pace with increasing electricity demand.\n\nEmber did record an 0.8% increase in fossil fuel generation in 2023 and foresees a boom in demand in the coming years to account for emerging electrified technologies such as electric vehicles, heat pumps and hydrogen production facilities.\n\nGrowth in data centres to account for the digital revolution, plus the addition of more air conditioning and cooling, will also increase global electricity demand.\n\nNonetheless, Ember's analysts believe that \"a new era\" of \"permanent\" decline in power sector emissions is likely to begin in 2024. This would be a \"major turning point\".\n\nThe analysts note that half of the world's economies have already passed peak electricity generation from fossil fuels. Most other economies will likely turn to cleaner options as they decrease in costs, and as governments and investors seek to make good on their climate commitments.\n\nThe pace of the decline in emissions from power will be shaped by decisions made by world leaders, Ember notes, with current plans not aligned with the Paris Agreement's 1.5C trajectory.\n\nThe UN's most recent annual climate summit saw hundreds of nations rallying behind a global ambition to treble the world's renewable generation capacity and double the annual rate of energy efficiency improvements by 2030. This top-line pledge must now be built out with appropriate supporting policies tackling issues such as supply chain constraints, planning and permitting hurdles and grid connection delays.\n\nEmber's global insights programme director Dave Jones said: \"There's an unprecedented opportunity for countries that choose to be at the forefront of the clean energy future.\n\n\"Expanding clean electricity not only helps to decarbonise the power sector. It also provides the step up in supply needed to electrify the whole economy; and that's the real game-changer for the climate.\"\n\nLast week, a separate analysis from Wood McKenzie warned that a five-year delay to the global energy transition away from fossil fuels could result in the global average temperature rising to 3C above pre-industrial levels. This level of delay is not unthinkable, with some world leaders retreating from green spending amid economic downturn and some nations pausing or watering down action against a backdrop of elections.", "source": {"uri": "edie.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "edie.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_george@edie.net", "name": "Sarah George", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electrification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_production", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen production"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat pump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Jones_(footballer,_born_1956)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dave Jones (footballer, born 1956)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electrical grid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_transition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Energy transition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Low-carbon economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://edienetlive.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/SolarWind.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547879", "eventUri": "eng-9547879", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 168, "textEnd": 173}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

In line with the global trend, India generated 5.8 per cent of its electricity from solar last year, as reported in Ember's \"Global Electricity Review\".\n\nEmber's Asia Programme director Aditya Lolla said, \"Increasing clean electricity is not just for reducing carbon emissions in the power sector. It is also needed to meet the rising electricity demand in an increasingly-electrified economy and to decouple economic growth from emissions, which is crucial for tackling climate change.\" Solar maintained its status as the world's fastest-growing electricity source for the 19th consecutive year, adding more than twice as much new electricity worldwide as coal in 2023.\n\nIndia saw the world's fourth-largest increase in solar generation in 2023 (+18 terawatt hour or TWh), behind China (+156 TWh), the United States (+33 TWh) and Brazil (+22 TWh). Together, the top four solar growth countries accounted for 75 per cent of growth in 2023.\n\nEmber said the global solar generation in 2023 was more than six times larger than in 2015.\n\nSolar's contribution to electricity generation in India increased from 0.5 per cent in 2015 to 5.8 per cent in 2023.\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency's (IEA) \"Net Zero Emissions\" scenario, solar would increase to 22 per cent of global electricity generation by 2030.\n\nWith electricity generation accounting for nearly half of India's annual carbon dioxide emissions (1.18 gigatonnes in 2023), accelerating the transition to cleaner generation sources is imperative for the country to meet both its developmental and climate goals.\n\nAs part of its national plan to fight climate change, India has committed to achieving 50 per cent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030.\n\nAt the United Nations' COP28 climate change conference in December last year, world leaders arrived at a historic agreement to triple the global renewable energy capacity by 2030.\n\nThe IEA says tripling the global RE capacity and doubling energy efficiency are crucial to limiting the average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, a political target set in 2015 to prevent further worsening of climate impacts.\n\nIndia is one of the few countries planning to triple renewable capacity by 2030.

The report by global energy think tank Ember said India ranked ninth in solar energy deployment in 2015.\n\nSolar produced a record 5.5 per cent of global electricity in 2023. In line with the global trend, India generated 5.8 per cent of its electricity from solar last year, as reported in Ember's \"Global Electricity Review\".\n\nEmber's Asia Programme director Aditya Lolla said, \"Increasing clean electricity is not just for reducing carbon emissions in the power sector. It is also needed to meet the rising electricity demand in an increasingly-electrified economy and to decouple economic growth from emissions, which is crucial for tackling climate change.\"\n\nSolar maintained its status as the world's fastest-growing electricity source for the 19th consecutive year, adding more than twice as much new electricity worldwide as coal in 2023. India saw the world's fourth-largest increase in solar generation in 2023 (+18 terawatt hour or TWh), behind China (+156 TWh), the United States (+33 TWh) and Brazil (+22 TWh). Together, the top four solar growth countries accounted for 75 per cent of growth in 2023.\n\nEmber said the global solar generation in 2023 was more than six times larger than in 2015. Solar's contribution to electricity generation in India increased from 0.5 per cent in 2015 to 5.8 per cent in 2023. According to the International Energy Agency's (IEA) \"Net Zero Emissions\" scenario, solar would increase to 22 per cent of global electricity generation by 2030.\n\nWith electricity generation accounting for nearly half of India's annual carbon dioxide emissions (1.18 gigatonnes in 2023), accelerating the transition to cleaner generation sources is imperative for the country to meet both its developmental and climate goals.\n\nAs part of its national plan to fight climate change, India has committed to achieving 50 per cent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030.\n\nAt the United Nations' COP28 climate change conference in December last year, world leaders arrived at a historic agreement to triple the global renewable energy capacity by 2030.\n\nThe IEA says tripling the global RE capacity and doubling energy efficiency are crucial to limiting the average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, a political target set in 2015 to prevent further worsening of climate impacts. India is one of the few countries planning to triple renewable capacity by 2030.

Many African nations have huge solar potential but this has yet to be harnessed fully.\"\n\nDespite a lack of policy incentives, there has been a boom in rooftop solar in South Africa, which has seen solar generation more than double in the last two years to reach 6.8% of the country's electricity in 2023.\n\nThe rapid growth in solar and wind energy has brought about a crucial turning point where fossil fuel generation starts to decline at a global level.\n\nAlready, clean electricity growth has helped to slow the growth of fossil fuels by almost two-thirds in the last ten years.\n\n\"The decline of power sector emissions is now inevitable. 2023 was likely the pivot point -- peak emissions in the power sector -- a major turning point in the history of energy,\" Jones added.\n\nSince 2000, renewables have expanded from 19 per cent to more than 30 percent of global electricity, driven by an increase in solar and wind from 0.2 percent in 2000 to a record 13.4 percent in 2023.\n\nAs a result, the CO2 intensity of global power generation reached a new record low in 2023, 12 per cent lower than its peak in 2007.\n\n\"But the pace of emissions falls depends on how fast the renewables revolution continues. We already know the key enablers that help countries unleash the full potential of solar and wind,\" Jones said.\n\n\"There's an unprecedented opportunity for countries that choose to be at the forefront of the clean energy future.\"\n\nSenior Advisor, Climate and Renewable Energy at Power Shift Africa, Amos Wemanya, said despite its substantial potential, Africa lags behind the global average.\n\n\"Today, the cost of capital for renewable energy projects in Africa can be up to seven times higher than in the developed world.\n\n\"As the world transitions to a renewable energy future, it must recognise Africa's urgent need for financial support and the means of implementation, such as technology to tap into its abundant renewables potential,\" Wemanya said.\n\n\"It is encouraging that African countries like Kenya lead the continent in the uptake of solar and wind power and even surpass the global average. The world is morally obligated not to leave Africa behind in this transition.''\n\nRenewables in Africa present an opportunity to spur socioeconomic benefits to communities, economic growth and prosperity for countries. and to address the pervasive energy poverty and injustice that have plagued the continent for decades.\n\nThe report underscores how key enablers -- high-level policy ambition, incentive mechanisms, and flexibility solutions -- are driving rapid growth in solar and wind, particularly in countries such as China, Brazil, and the Netherlands.\n\nThe 2022 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey says 58 per cent of Kenyan households have electricity, including 90 per cent in urban households and 36 per cent in rural households.\n\nKDHS says 24 per cent of the household population in Kenya has access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking, including stoves and cookers using electricity, LPG/natural gas/biogas, solar, and alcohol/ethanol.\n\nThe use of clean fuels and technology for cooking is substantially higher in urban areas than in rural areas, at 59 percent versus six percent.\n\nThe Global Electricity Review provides the first comprehensive overview of the global power system in 2023 based on country-level data.\n\nIt was published on Wednesday alongside the world's first open dataset on electricity generation in 2023, covering 80 countries representing 92 percent of global electricity demand, as well as historic data for 215 countries.\n\nAt the UN's COP28 climate change conference in December last year, world leaders reached a historic agreement to triple global renewable capacity by 2030.\n\nThe target would see the world reach 60 percent renewable electricity by 2030, which would almost halve power sector emissions and put the world on a pathway aligned with the 1.5C climate goal.\n\nIn last year's Nairobi Declaration, African leaders called for financing to deliver a fivefold increase in renewable capacity by 2030 in the region.\n\nThe Economic Survey Report for 2022 indicates increasing cases of diseases of the respiratory system are largely associated with air pollution.\n\nThe survey shows that cases handled

While aggressive wind and solar policies have enabled regions like Brazil, China, and the Netherlands to quickly shift their grids toward cleaner energy sources, large-scale wind and solar farm deployments have helped some of the world's largest economies reduce their reliance on fossil fuels and coal. The think tank estimates that at this rate, countries with net zero carbon emissions goals for their power grids -- like the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom -- could meet those goals by 2035.\n\nPublished Wednesday, Ember's Global Electricity Review 2024 incorporates energy source and consumption data from 80 countries. The organization obtains this data from the Energy Institute's Statistical Review of World Energy, the Energy Information Administration, Eurostat, and 70 country-specific agencies responsible for updating their statistics monthly. While country-specific sources aren't always perfect -- different countries use different methodologies, and a given country might feel incentivized to make its grid appear cleaner than it is -- Ember reportedly checks each dataset against another from a different source to ensure accuracy. The result is a wide yet high-resolution picture of at least 94% of the world's energy grid.\n\nAccording to the report, there are now 33 countries that fulfill at least 10% of their energy demand with solar power, including Chile, Australia, and the Netherlands. (California, one of the world's largest economies, gets 28% of its energy from solar.) This is said to be a natural progression of Wright's law, which states that technology gets cheaper as it's deployed more and vice versa. Solar panels are cheaper to make and install today than in 2010, enabling the cumulative global solar capacity to double every three years since then. That said, 60% of the solar capacity added in 2023 was in China, and 14% was added in Europe. These regions receive little sunlight compared with regions optimized for solar, causing 2023 solar generation to fall short of projections by 182 terawatt hours (TWh) despite the source's overall growth.\n\nWind is also a major contributor to renewable energy's increased share, with China accounting for 60% of new global wind generation in 2023. The source is estimated to have provided 7.8% of global electricity last year. Together with solar, nuclear power, and hydropower, wind helped nearly 40% of the world's electricity come from clean sources in 2023.\n\n\"The world is now at a turning point where solar and wind not only slow emissions growth, but actually start to push fossil generation into decline,\" the researchers write.\n\nEmber points out that the expansion of wind and solar would have helped reduce global power sector emissions in 2023, if not for a drought that caused hydropower output to fall. China, India, Vietnam, and Mexico were each affected by particularly dry weather last year, forcing each country to compensate with coal by anywhere from 5.9% to 42%. This means global power sector emissions increased by 1%. Ember expects emissions to fall this year, barring the continuation of unusually arid weather; should these regions face a long-term lack of precipitation, new wind and solar might be required to pick up the slack coal would otherwise continue to take on.\n\nGlobal energy demand is also bound to grow, which means renewables will need to grow with it. Not only is Earth becoming more populated, but power-hungry data centers are an increasingly prevalent part of our infrastructure, and more technologies (like vehicles) are moving toward electricity over gas. More people are using air conditioning, too, as the planet warms and the equipment becomes more accessible. Ember estimates that we're at the start of a \"new era\" of global electricity demand growth, with demand expected to outpace global GDP growth (3.4% versus 3.1%).", "source": {"uri":

This would have added around 4bn tonnes of carbon dioxide (GtCO2) to annual global emissions.\n\nNevertheless, the growth of clean electricity sources needs to accelerate to meet the global goal of tripling renewables by 2030, Ember says.\n\nMeeting this goal would almost halve power sector emissions by the end of the decade, and put the world on a pathway aligned with the 1.5C climate target set in the Paris Agreement.\n\nIn 2023, more than twice as much new electricity generation from solar was added around the world as from coal, Ember says.\n\nThe share of solar within the global energy mix reached 5.5%, up from 4.6% in 2022, according to Ember. The share of wind stayed steady at 7.8% (2,304 terawatt hours, TWh).\n\nNo other sources of electricity generation have ever grown from 100TWh per year to 1,000TWh faster than solar and wind, Ember says. These took just eight and 12 years respectively, as shown in the figure below.\n\nThis sits far ahead of gas generation at 28 years, coal at 32 years and hydropower at 39 years. (Nuclear also grew from 100TWh to 1,000TWh over 12 years, the Ember figure shows, but tailed off more quickly than wind).\n\nGlobal electricity generation technology expansion by technology (TWh), showing the time it has taken for key technologies to grow from 100TWh to 1,000TWh. Source: Ember.\n\nIn response to Ember's report, Dr Hannah Ritchie, deputy editor at Our World in Data, says in a statement:\n\n\"The main headline from Ember's 2023 review is that the world sees a bright future for solar power. It is consistently breaking records and maintains its position as the fastest-growing power source in history. This is not only driven by the need to move to clean energy, but by its exciting economics as prices continue to fall. There are early signs that a peak in power sector emissions is imminent. Faster growth in low-carbon energy will be needed to drive down emissions quickly, especially as countries electrify transport, heating and industry.\"\n\nDespite solar and wind capacity growth in 2023, generation grew more slowly than expected, rising by 513TWh - a small drop from the 517TWh added in 2022.\n\nSolar generation growth lagged behind record high capacity addition growth of 36%, due to lower sunlight levels in 2023, especially in China, as well as underreporting of solar generation in some countries. This is expected to be temporary, notes Ember.\n\nFor wind, there was a fall in generation for the first time since 2001, down 9.1TWh or 2.1%. Low wind conditions kept load factors close to their lowest level in five years, Ember says.\n\nAdditionally, higher costs slowed wind capacity additions as developers were forced to delay or cancel projects. More than $30bn in investment was put on hold as at least 10 offshore wind projects in the US and Europe were hit by delays, the Wall Street Journal reported for example.\n\nIn other renewables, hydropower's share of the electricity mix fell by 0.6 percentage points to 14.3% of the world's electricity mix, Ember reports. It therefore remains the world's largest source of clean power, but its share of the mix is now at the lowest since at least 2000, with wind and solar combined sitting just 1 percentage point behind at 13.4% (3,935TWh) .\n\nThis is despite 7GW of new hydropower capacity coming online in 2023, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).\n\nEmber had previously estimated that there would be a 0.4% reduction in global power sector emissions in 2023, but the fall in hydropower generation prevented this. Instead, emissions from the power sector rose by 1%, as the hydro shortfall was mostly met by coal.\n\nWind and solar have expanded from 0.2% of the global electricity mix in 2000 to 13.4% in 2023. Over the last year, their share grew by another 1.5 percentage points, up from 11.9% in 2022.\n\nWhile wind and solar were rising fast, 2023 also saw global electricity demand reaching a record high, with an increase in demand of 627TWh, Ember reports. This is the equivalent of adding the entire demand of Canada (607TWh), for example.\n\nWith wind and solar having grown by 513TWh in 2023 and nuclear by 46TWh, but hydro falling 88TWh, the remaining demand growth was met by increased fossil fuel use.\n\nThis continued the trend of recent years where the gap between clean power growth and rapidly-rising demand was met by expanded electricity generation from fossil fuels.\n\nMoreover, last year's increase in demand was below the recent average, rising by 2.2%. This was due to a pronounced decrease in demand from OECD countries, including the US (-1.4%) and the European Union (-3.4%).\n\nElsewhere, there was rapid growth in electricity demand in China, growing nearly 7%. This was the equivalent of the total global demand growth in 2023, Ember notes.\n\nLooking ahead, demand is likely to grow even faster as energy use is increasingly electrified. Already more than half of global electricity demand growth in 2023 was driven by the rise of electric vehicles (EVs), heat pumps, electrolysers, air conditioning and data centres, the report states.\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA), nearly 14m EVs were registered globally in 2023, bringing the total number on the roads to 40m. This puts electric car sales last year at 3.5m higher than in 2022, a 35% year-on-year increase.\n\nEmber forecasts that electricity demand will accelerate significantly going forwards, with a growth of 968TWh expected in 2024. Even faster growth would be expected on a path to staying below 1.5C under the IEA's \"NZE\" scenario, it notes.\n\nYet clean electricity generation is expected to grow faster still, with wind,solar and other clean energy sources adding an estimated 1,300TWh in 2024, as shown in the chart below.\n\nThis would be more than double the increase in 2023 (493TWh), due to an expected uplift in the US from the Inflation Reduction Act and a reversal in short-term factors such as last year's hydro drought, the report says.\n\nAs a result of this, Ember estimates that fossil generation will decline by 333TWh or 2% in 2024. Even more importantly, Ember says clean energy growth makes ongoing falls in power sector fossil fuel use \"inevitable\" - meaning a steady decline in related emissions.\n\nPast and expected future growth in electricity demand (light blue), demand under the IEA's 1.5C pathway (NZE, dark blue) and generation from clean energy sources including solar, wind, hydro and nuclear (green), terawatt hours. Source: Ember.\n\nChristiana Figueres, former executive secretary of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and founding partner of Global Optimism, says in a press statement:\n\n\"The fossil fuel era has reached its necessary and inevitable expiration date as these findings show so clearly. This is a critical turning point: Last century's outdated technologies can no longer compete with the exponential innovations and declining cost curves in renewable energy and storage. All of humanity and the planet upon which we depend will be better off for it.\"\n\nAt the COP28 UN climate conference in Dubai in 2023, all countries agreed to contribute to the tripling of global renewable energy capacity by 2030, in what was seen as a \"crucial\" step for 1.5C.\n\nAlthough the COP28 outcome did not include numerical targets, Ember says tripling renewables would mean adding 14,000TWh of annual renewable generation by 2030, compared to 2022 levels. In 2022, renewables accounted for 8,599TWh of the 28,844TWh of electricity generated globally.\n\nAfter accounting for rising electricity demand, it says this tripling would help cut fossil fuel generation by 6,570TWh, or 37%. With highly-polluting coal power bearing the brunt of this reduction, power sector emissions would fall even faster, by 45% in 2030, it says.\n\nAlready, the expansion of renewable energy has slowed fossil fuel growth substantially, as the graph below shows.\n\nAfter recording average annual growth of 3.5% over the decade 2004-2013, fossil fuel generation only grew by an average of 1.3% in the decade to 2023.\n\nFossil fuel generation was 22% lower in 2023 than it would have been without solar and wind generation. Between 2015 and 2023, wind and solar have together avoided more than 4GtCO2 emissions, Ember notes.\n\nGlobal electricity generation from fossil fuels (black), wind and solar (green) and other clean energy technologies (blue) between 2000 and 2023 in TWh. Source: Ember.\n\nMeeting the tripling goal would mean some 60% of global electricity supplies coming from renewable sources by 2030.\n\nThis would mark a dramatic shift from current renewable shares. In 2023, 102 countries had a renewable generation share of 30% or higher, up from 98 in 2022. Yet only 69 countries in 2023 had a share in excess of 50%.\n\nHitting the tripling target would help put \"the world on a pathway aligned with the 1.5C climate goal\", says Ember.\n\nEmber's director

This surge was primarily fueled by the expansion of solar projects, which experienced a notable increase in capacity.\n\nDave Jones, Director of Global Insights at Ember, emphasized the pivotal role of solar capacity expansion in paving the way towards achieving the ambitious renewable energy targets set for 2030. \"The rise in solar capacity that happened during 2023 really unlocks the possibility that we are able to reach that level of renewables by 2030, and the tripling of capacity that was promised at COP28,\" Jones affirmed in an interview.\n\nChina emerged as a global leader in renewable energy deployment, accounting for over half of the worldwide additions in solar and wind capacity in 2023. The report highlighted a remarkable 23.2% increase in global solar generation and a substantial 9.8% growth in wind power.\n\nDespite these encouraging developments, industry experts have identified challenges surrounding grid connections and permit approvals for new renewable energy projects as hurdles that need to be addressed to ensure the attainment of the 2030 targets.\n\nLooking ahead, the report projects a continued trajectory of renewable growth, forecasting a 2% decline in fossil fuel power production in 2024. This trend is anticipated to drive overall fossil fuel power production to less than 60% of global electricity production for the first time since at least 2000, based on Ember's data.\n\n\"The permanent decline in fossil fuel use in the power sector at a global level is now inevitable, leading to falling sector emissions,\" the report concluded, underscoring the pivotal role of renewable energy in combating climate change and meeting international sustainability goals.\n\nAs the world collectively strives to mitigate the impacts of climate change, the surge in renewable energy production represents a beacon of hope, demonstrating the feasibility of transitioning towards a cleaner, more sustainable energy future.

According to Ember, renewable sources have reached record rates in electricity generation, significantly reducing emissions in some of the world's most energy-hungry regions.\n\nEmber has just released its latest Global Electricity Review, a report detailing the use of renewable and fossil fuel sources in generating electric energy for various needs of individuals and businesses. In it, the non-profit UK organization says renewable energy sources accounted for more than a third of electricity generated in 2023.\n\nWith the report, the group aims to provide the first \"comprehensive overview\" of changes in electricity generation over the past year. Data indicates that 2023 was a pivotal year for renewable sources as solar and wind sources saw growth rates of 23 percent and 10 percent, respectively. Conversely, fossil sources experienced only a 0.8 percent increase in electricity generation.\n\nEmber's report gathered data from 215 different countries, including the latest available data for 80 countries representing 92 percent of global electricity demand. Data from 13 geographic and economic regions, such as Asia, Africa, the EU, and the G7, is also included.\n\nFor the first time, Ember is providing access to its comprehensive dataset free of charge.\n\nEmber states that the undeniable growth of renewable sources, particularly solar energy, will propel the world towards a \"new era\" where fossil fuel generation becomes less prominent.\n\nThe report highlights that renewable sources for electricity generation only accounted for 19 percent of the global market in 2000, whereas they now surpass 30 percent. However, hydropower sources hit a five-year low in 2023, with coal and other fossil fuel sources compensating for it, thus preventing a further reduction in greenhouse emissions.\n\nGlobal electricity demand increased by 2.2 percent in 2023, with Ember forecasting even higher demand for 2024. Over the next decade, the energy transition is expected to enter a new phase characterized by a \"permanent\" decline in fossil fuels and decreasing emissions.

India generated 113 billion units (BU) of solar power in 2023 compared to Japan's 110 BU.\n\nIn terms of installed power capacity, which includes sources of renewable and non-renewable energy, India at 73 gigawatt ( 1 GW is one billion watts) ranks fifth in the world while Japan is at third place (83 GW), according to data computed by Ember.\n\nWhile reflective of the rising share of solar power in India's energy mix, the power produced per year can vary due to fluctuations in a country's power demand and local circumstances which lead to a gap between the installed capacity and actual power produced.\n\nData from government think-tank, Niti Ayog suggest that as of May 2024, solar power while making up 18% of India's total installed electricity of 442 GW, made up only 6.66% of the power actually produced - reflecting the gap between potential and actuals.\n\nWill new solar power rules boost production? | Explained\n\nPower demand in Japan decreased by 2% (2 BU) in 2023 after rising in 2021 and 2022, thus allowing India to overtake Japan. While it is unclear if this trend will sustain next year, as surpassing the next country - the United States which is in the second spot - will require India to more than double its current solar production and exceed 228 BU.\n\nThe leading producer of solar power in the world is China which produced 584 BU of solar power in 2024 - more than the next four countries combined (the United States, Japan, Germany and India).\n\nGlobally however, renewable sources of energy made up 30% of global electricity produced. Renewables have expanded from 19% of global electricity in 2000, driven by an increase in solar and wind power, to 30% in 2023. China was the main contributor in 2023, accounting for 51% of the additional global solar generation and 60% of new global wind generation. Combined with nuclear, the world generated almost 40% of its electricity from low-carbon sources in 2023.\n\nEmber forecasts fossil fuel generation to drop in 2024 and the trend to continue in other years, suggesting that 2023 might be the year when the fossil fuel production may have \"peaked\" globally.\n\n\"The renewables future has arrived,\" said Dave Jones, Ember's director of global insights. \"Solar in particular is accelerating faster than anyone thought possible.\"\n\nGlobal solar generation in 2023 was more than six times larger than in 2015, while in India it was 17 times higher. Share of solar generation increased from 0.5% of India's electricity in 2015 to 5.8% in 2023.\n\n\"Increasing clean electricity isn't just for reducing carbon emissions in the power sector,\" said Aditya Lolla, Ember's Asia Programme Director, \"It's also needed to meet the rising electricity demand in an increasingly electrified economy and decoupling economic growth from emissions, which is crucial for tackling climate change.\"\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ember_(non-profit_organisation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ember (non-profit organisation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solar power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nameplate_capacity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nameplate capacity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-renewable_resource", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-renewable resource"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_mix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Energy mix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electrification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Low-carbon economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/todays-paper/tp-national/glofap/article68112373.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/TH26-JACOB-KOSHG0RCNM95B.3.jpg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547879", "eventUri": "eng-9547879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

India, on the other hand, reached 10 percent share of solar and wind in 2023.\n\nBangladesh has mostly met the growing demand for electricity with gas, but solar energy can help reduce reliance on costly imports, said the report.\n\nIt states that Bangladesh relied on fossil fuels for 98 percent of its electricity in 2023.\n\nMentionable, the country aims to generate 16 percent of electricity, using renewable energy sources by 2030.\n\nEmber's analysis shows that an ambitious plan to focus on solar energy could help reduce fossil fuel import costs for Bangladesh significantly.\n\nAccording to the report, Bangladesh now faces the dual challenge of meeting its growing electricity demand, while ensuring that its power sector emissions don't follow a similar growth. Ramping up public and private investments into the country's renewable energy sector is therefore crucial.\n\nExperts have suggested focusing on rooftop solar panels, streamlining the process of opening letters of credit (LCs), and reducing or waiving import tax on rooftop solar panels to help transition to renewable electricity.\n\nShafiqul Alam, lead energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), said the country signed letters of intent or contracts for 10,000-12,000 megawatts of electricity from renewable energy.\n\n\"It is important to implement the conversion, and the most challenging issue is to procure land for the projects along with the enormous cost of the long transmission lines, for which it sometimes gets tough to feasibly implement the project,\" he said.\n\nIf the government provides land for some projects and bears the transmission line costs, it would be easier to implement the projects, he added.\n\nTalking about the report, Ember's Asia Programme Director Aditya Lolla clarified that increasing clean electricity isn't just for the purpose of reducing carbon emissions.\n\n\"It's also needed to meet the rising electricity demand in an increasingly electrified economy and decouple economic growth from emissions, which is crucial for tackling climate change,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "thedailystar.net",

By 2050, the IEA expects more than 50% of global energy consumption will be through electrons.

This milestone was highlighted in a recent report by Ember, a leading global energy think tank, which also noted that solar energy contributed to a record 5.5 per cent of global electricity this year. Specifically, India's contribution from solar reached 5.8 per cent of its total electricity generation, aligning with the upward trend in renewable energy usage worldwide.\n\nThe surge in renewable energy, particularly wind and solar, has propelled the share of renewables in the global electricity mix to over 30 per cent. Furthermore, when including nuclear power, clean energy sources now account for nearly 40 per cent of total global electricity generation. This shift has led to the carbon intensity of global electricity hitting a new low, marking a 12 per cent decrease from its peak in 2007.\n\nHowever, the potential for even greater renewable energy generation was somewhat curtailed in 2023 due to a significant drop in hydropower production, attributed to drought conditions in China and other regions. Despite these challenges, solar energy maintained its position as the fastest-growing electricity source globally for the 19th consecutive year. Remarkably, solar added more than double the new electricity capacity worldwide compared to coal this year.\n\nIndia's solar generation saw an impressive increase of 18 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2023, positioning it fourth globally behind China, the United States, and Brazil. These four nations collectively contributed to 75 per cent of the global increase in solar generation for the year. The report further highlights that global solar generation in 2023 was over six times higher than in 2015.\n\nAditya Lolla, Ember's Asia Programme director, emphasized the broader implications of increasing clean electricity. He stated, \"Increasing clean electricity is not just for reducing carbon emissions in the power sector. It is also needed to meet the rising electricity demand in an increasingly electrified economy and to decouple economic growth from emissions, which is crucial for tackling climate change.\"\n\nWith nearly half of India's annual carbon dioxide emissions stemming from electricity generation (1.18 gigatonnes in 2023), accelerating the shift towards cleaner energy sources is crucial for India to achieve its developmental and climate objectives. The country has committed to achieving 50 per cent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030.\n\nAt the United Nations COP28 climate change conference held last December, world leaders reached a historic agreement to triple global renewable energy capacity by 2030. This ambitious target aligns with the International Energy Agency's (IEA) Net Zero Emissions scenario, which suggests that solar power could account for 22 per cent of global electricity generation by 2030. Tripling global renewable energy capacity alongside doubling energy efficiency is deemed essential by the IEA for limiting average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius and preventing further climate impacts.\n\nIndia stands among the few countries with plans to triple its renewable capacity by the end of this decade. According to Ember's analysis, this will require a significant increase in annual capacity additions for India to meet its ambitious target.\n\nFor investment related articles, business news and

This would have added around 4bn tonnes of carbon dioxide (GtCO2) to annual global emissions.\n\nNevertheless, the growth of clean electricity sources needs to accelerate to meet the global goal of tripling renewables by 2030, Ember says.\n\nMeeting this goal would almost halve power sector emissions by the end of the decade, and put the world on a pathway aligned with the 1.5C climate target set in the Paris Agreement.\n\nIn 2023, more than twice as much new electricity generation from solar was added around the world as from coal, Ember says.\n\nThe share of solar within the global energy mix reached 5.5%, up from 4.6% in 2022, according to Ember. The share of wind stayed steady at 7.8% (2,304 terawatt hours, TWh).\n\nNo other sources of electricity generation have ever grown from 100TWh per year to 1,000TWh faster than solar and wind, Ember says. These took just eight and 12 years respectively, as shown in the figure below.\n\nThis sits far ahead of gas generation at 28 years, coal at 32 years and hydropower at 39 years. (Nuclear also grew from 100TWh to 1,000TWh over 12 years, the Ember figure shows, but tailed off more quickly than wind).\n\nIn response to Ember's report, Dr Hannah Ritchie, deputy editor at Our World in Data, says in a statement:\n\n\"The main headline from Ember's 2023 review is that the world sees a bright future for solar power. It is consistently breaking records and maintains its position as the fastest-growing power source in history. This is not only driven by the need to move to clean energy, but by its exciting economics as prices continue to fall. There are early signs that a peak in power sector emissions is imminent. Faster growth in low-carbon energy will be needed to drive down emissions quickly, especially as countries electrify transport, heating and industry.\"\n\nDespite solar and wind capacity growth in 2023, generation grew more slowly than expected, rising by 513TWh - a small drop from the 517TWh added in 2022.\n\nSolar generation growth lagged behind record high capacity addition growth of 36%, due to lower sunlight levels in 2023, especially in China, as well as underreporting of solar generation in some countries. This is expected to be temporary, notes Ember.\n\nFor wind, there was a fall in generation for the first time since 2001, down 9.1TWh or 2.1%. Low wind conditions kept load factors close to their lowest level in five years, Ember says.\n\nAdditionally, higher costs slowed wind capacity additions as developers were forced to delay or cancel projects. More than $30bn in investment was put on hold as at least 10 offshore wind projects in the US and Europe were hit by delays, the Wall Street Journal reported for example.\n\nIn other renewables, hydropower's share of the electricity mix fell by 0.6 percentage points to 14.3% of the world's electricity mix, Ember reports. It therefore remains the world's largest source of clean power, but its share of the mix is now at the lowest since at least 2000, with wind and solar combined sitting just 1 percentage point behind at 13.4% (3,935TWh) .\n\nThis is despite 7GW of new hydropower capacity coming online in 2023, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).\n\nEmber had previously estimated that there would be a 0.4% reduction in global power sector emissions in 2023, but the fall in hydropower generation prevented this. Instead, emissions from the power sector rose by 1%, as the hydro shortfall was mostly met by coal.\n\nWind and solar have expanded from 0.2% of the global electricity mix in 2000 to 13.4% in 2023. Over the last year, their share grew by another 1.5 percentage points, up from 11.9% in 2022.\n\nWhile wind and solar were rising fast, 2023 also saw global electricity demand reaching a record high, with an increase in demand of 627TWh, Ember reports. This is the equivalent of adding the entire demand of Canada (607TWh), for example.\n\nWith wind and solar having grown by 513TWh in 2023 and nuclear by 46TWh, but hydro falling 88TWh, the remaining demand growth was met by increased fossil fuel use.\n\nThis continued the trend of recent years where the gap between clean power growth and rapidly-rising demand was met by expanded electricity generation from fossil fuels.\n\nMoreover, last year's increase in demand was below the recent average, rising by 2.2%. This was due to a pronounced decrease in demand from OECD countries, including the US (-1.4%) and the European Union (-3.4%).\n\nElsewhere, there was rapid growth in electricity demand in China, growing nearly 7%. This was the equivalent of the total global demand growth in 2023, Ember notes.\n\nLooking ahead, demand is likely to grow even faster as energy use is increasingly electrified. Already more than half of global electricity demand growth in 2023 was driven by the rise of electric vehicles (EVs), heat pumps, electrolysers, air conditioning and data centres, the report states.\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA), nearly 14m EVs were registered globally in 2023, bringing the total number on the roads to 40m. This puts electric car sales last year at 3.5m higher than in 2022, a 35% year-on-year increase.\n\nEmber forecasts that electricity demand will accelerate significantly going forwards, with a growth of 968TWh expected in 2024. Even faster growth would be expected on a path to staying below 1.5C under the IEA's \"NZE\" scenario, it notes.\n\nYet clean electricity generation is expected to grow faster still, with wind,solar and other clean energy sources adding an estimated 1,300TWh in 2024, as shown in the chart below.\n\nThis would be more than double the increase in 2023 (493TWh), due to an expected uplift in the US from the Inflation Reduction Act and a reversal in short-term factors such as last year's hydro drought, the report says.\n\nAs a result of this, Ember estimates that fossil generation will decline by 333TWh or 2% in 2024. Even more importantly, Ember says clean energy growth makes ongoing falls in power sector fossil fuel use \"inevitable\" - meaning a steady decline in related emissions.\n\nChristiana Figueres, former executive secretary of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and founding partner of Global Optimism, says in a press statement:\n\n\"The fossil fuel era has reached its necessary and inevitable expiration date as these findings show so clearly. This is a critical turning point: Last century's outdated technologies can no longer compete with the exponential innovations and declining cost curves in renewable energy and storage. All of humanity and the planet upon which we depend will be better off for it.\"\n\nAt the COP28 UN climate conference in Dubai in 2023, all countries agreed to contribute to the tripling of global renewable energy capacity by 2030, in what was seen as a \"crucial\" step for 1.5C.\n\nAlthough the COP28 outcome did not include numerical targets, Ember says tripling renewables would mean adding 14,000TWh of annual renewable generation by 2030, compared to 2022 levels. In 2022, renewables accounted for 8,599TWh of the 28,844TWh of electricity generated globally.\n\nAfter accounting for rising electricity demand, it says this tripling would help cut fossil fuel generation by 6,570TWh, or 37%. With highly-polluting coal power bearing the brunt of this reduction, power sector emissions would fall even faster, by 45% in 2030, it says.\n\nAlready, the expansion of renewable energy has slowed fossil fuel growth substantially, as the graph below shows.\n\nAfter recording average annual growth of 3.5% over the decade 2004-2013, fossil fuel generation only grew by an average of 1.3% in the decade to 2023.\n\nFossil fuel generation was 22% lower in 2023 than it would have been without solar and wind generation. Between 2015 and 2023, wind and solar have together avoided more than 4GtCO2 emissions, Ember notes.\n\nMeeting the tripling goal would mean some 60% of global electricity supplies coming from renewable sources by 2030.\n\nThis would mark a dramatic shift from current renewable shares. In 2023, 102 countries had a renewable generation share of 30% or higher, up from 98 in 2022. Yet only 69 countries in 2023 had a share in excess of 50%.\n\nHitting the tripling target would help put \"the world on a pathway aligned with the 1.5C climate goal\", says Ember.\n\nEmber's director of global insights, Dave Jones says in a statement:", "source": {"uri": "carbonbrief.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Carbon Brief"}, "authors": [{"uri": "molly_lempriere@carbonbrief.org", "name": "Molly Lempriere", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ember_(non-profit_organisation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ember (non-profit organisation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydropower", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydropower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt-hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kilowatt-hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_World_in_Data", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Our World in Data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris Agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_mix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Energy mix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electrification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Renewable_Energy_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Renewable Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Energy_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshore_wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offshore wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiana_Figueres", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christiana Figueres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.carbonbrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DKR3CM.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547879", "eventUri": "eng-9547879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

[It] has really led the citizen-energy movement, which has installed rooftop solar panels and really made possible the near-exponential expansion of renewables in energy.\"\n\nChina plays an outsized role on both sides of the energy transition story.\n\nLast year it created about 29 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, twice those of the runner-up - the United States.\n\nBut it also installed half the world's solar panels and 60 percent of the world's wind turbines, easily rating as the green energy transition leader. It manufactures as much as 85 percent of the solar panels the rest of the world installs.\n\nIt is also a leader in the electrification of transport and heating, two of the most polluting sectors of the economy after electricity production. Last year it put more electric vehicles on the road and heat pumps into homes than the rest of the world combined, and was responsible for almost all new electricity demand.\n\nEmber applauds this, saying, \"China's need to find new export markets is a tremendous opportunity for countries around the world to take advantage of how cost-competitive and available solar is compared to other generation sources.\"\n\nBut not everyone is happy with China's state-led model of renewables development.\n\n\"Right now the very broad spread of renewables, and especially solar, is partly based on the very large subsidies China is giving to photovoltaic infrastructure,\" energy analyst Miltiadis Aslanoglou told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"Its goal is to dominate and wipe any competitors off the map so that in the coming years it will have a technology monopoly.\"\n\nThe European Union and the US, leading markets for Chinese photovoltaics, are both beneficiaries and victims, Aslanoglou said.\n\n\"The accusation is that all the added value being created in China is at the expense of [what would be] a competitive market in renewables for everyone else, due to all the state subsidies being given.\"\n\nThat has knock-on effects, said Aslanoglou, leaving electricity grids unprepared to carry increasing loads, and potentially up-ending the business plans of expensive gas terminals, pipelines and distribution networks, which require decades to recoup investments.\n\nNikos Tsafos, chief energy adviser to Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, believes that is a far preferable problem to climate change.\n\n\"What we know is that in most countries renewables are the cheapest way to produce new energy,\" he told Al Jazeera. \"For a country like Greece, which imports fossil fuels, renewables are cheaper and more reliable, and that creates a dynamic that is almost unstoppable.\"\n\nUnder Mitsotakis, Greece has transitioned quickly, producing 57 percent of its electricity from renewables last year, and aiming to produce 80 percent by the end of the decade. For Greece, which once imported almost all of its energy, that means security of supply and price stability, undergirding what it hopes will be an economic comeback from its 2010 bankruptcy in the coming decade.\n\nAfter struggling to kick-start and grow a renewable energy industry, Tsafos believes Europe has finally arrived at a very desirable problem, which is how to absorb the clean electricity it generates.\n\n\"We have hours when renewables have zero market value,\" Tsafos said. \"The question is no longer whether renewables are competitive, but how to reform the system to absorb them.\"\n\nNot unlike China, Europe and the US have opted for state-led solutions.\n\nThe EU's 2020 Recovery and Resilience Fund set aside 270 billion euros ($290bn) in subsidies and loans for renewable energy installations and grid upgrades. Two years later, US President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act set aside $783bn in renewable energy and climate change mitigation measures.\n\n\"Some companies will close, others will spring up,\" said Tsafos. \"The energy transition is inevitable and not something you should delay or something you can prevent. If something creates a new dependence, you have to manage the tradeoffs.\"", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The continent can't develop further without access to energy.\"\n\nHe called for financial reforms to bring in affordable and new types of funding.\n\nFinancing the clean transition in developing

To put it in context, in 2022, global solar capacity addition was 268 GW, according to BloombergNEF, while it was 444 GW in 2023, thereby breaching the 200 GW per year milestone.\n\nSolar's rise in most countries has been due to steep declines in costs, supportive policy environments, technology efficiency improvements, and increased manufacturing capability, states the report.\n\nThe trend of heightened deployment is apparent, with 33 countries now boasting more than 10 per cent share of solar generation, including Chile (20 per cent), Australia (17 per cent) and the Netherlands (17 per cent), as well as the state of California at 28 per cent (itself the world's fifth largest economy).\n\nRenewables Future Has Arrived\n\nThe Global Electricity Review 2024 examines 80 countries, encompassing 92 percent of global electricity demand, to evaluate their energy growth.\n\nAccording to the report, for the first time in history, renewables accounted for over 30 per cent of the global electricity mix, with most of this addition coming from solar and wind energy sources.\n\nRenewables have expanded from comprising 19 per cent of global electricity in 2000, primarily fueled by the expansion of solar and wind power, to reaching 30 per cent in 2023. When combined with nuclear energy, low-carbon sources generated nearly 40 per cent of the world's electricity in 2023.\n\n\"The renewables future has arrived,\" Ember's global insights director Dave Jones said in a communication. \"Solar in particular is accelerating faster than anyone thought possible.\"\n\nWith the objective of tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030 set forth at the COP28 climate summit convened in Dubai in 2023, it is anticipated that renewable energy will constitute 60 per cent of global energy consumption by that time.\n\nIndia is one of the few countries planning to triple renewable capacity by 2030, aiming for 509 GW. According to Ember analysis, annual capacity additions need to significantly increase for India to meet this capacity target.", "source": {"uri": "swarajyamag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Swarajyamag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amit_mishra@swarajyamag.com", "name": "Amit Mishra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt-hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kilowatt-hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solar power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ember_(non-profit_organisation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ember (non-profit organisation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_generator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric generator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_supply_and_consumption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World energy supply and consumption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Low-carbon economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://swarajya.gumlet.io/swarajya/2021-10/0f326b5c-0ce9-4581-a615-9a26fd52c7d3/solar_panels.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547879", "eventUri": "eng-9547879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

It has climbed from ranking ninth in 2015,\" the report said.\n\nIn 2023, solar energy achieved a milestone as it contributed 5.5 percent to global production and India alone generated 5.8 percent of its electricity from solar energy.\n\nIndia experienced the world's fourth-largest surge in solar generation in 2023, adding 18 Terawatt hours (TWh) to its capacity, following China (+156 TWh), the United States (+33 TWh), and Brazil (+22 TWh). These top four countries collectively accounted for 75 percent of global solar growth that year.\n\n\"A renewables-powered future is now becoming a reality. Solar power, in particular, is growing at an unprecedented pace\", said Aditya Lolla, Ember's Asia Programme Director.\n\nFor the nineteenth consecutive year, solar maintained its status as the fastest-growing electricity source worldwide, outpacing coal in new electricity additions by more than twofold in 2023.\n\nThe trajectory of solar energy has been accelerating rapidly. Global solar generation in 2023 exceeded six times that of 2015, with India experiencing a seventeen-fold increase during the same period. India's share of solar generation surged from 0.5 percent in 2015 to 5.8 percent in 2023.\n\nPathways toward decarbonizing electricity underscore the pivotal role solar energy will play in shaping the future energy landscape.\n\nAccording to the IEA Net Zero Emissions scenario, solar energy's contribution is projected to rise to 22 percent of global electricity generation by 2030. The aim of tripling global renewables capacity by 2030, as agreed upon at COP28, holds promise in advancing this trajectory.\n\nIndia stands among the select few nations committed to tripling renewable capacity by 2030. Ember's analysis suggests that India will need to significantly ramp up annual capacity additions to meet this ambitious target.\n\n\"Increasing clean electricity isn't just for reducing carbon emissions in the power sector. It's also needed to meet the rising electricity demand in an increasingly electrified economy and decoupling economic growth from emissions, which is crucial for tackling climate change\", Aditya Lolla concluded.\n\n(With inputs from ANI)\n\nThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

Renewable sources accounted for a record 30 percent of electricity production globally last year, primarily driven by solar and wind power expansion.\n\nDespite projections indicating a 2 percent decrease in fossil fuel-powered electricity in 2024, the US's transition to cleaner energy sources needs to catch up, raising concerns about its commitment to combating climate change.\n\nDave Jones, Ember's insights director, conveyed in an email statement that reducing power sector emissions is now unavoidable.\n\nHe highlighted 2023 as a pivotal moment in energy history, indicating a significant turning point. However, Jones emphasized that the rate of progress hinges on the ongoing momentum of the renewables revolution.\n\nAlso read: AI Data Centers Restricted Worldwide Due to Energy Consumption\n\nThe transition towards renewable energy could be accelerating faster if it weren't for the United States's influence. Despite being the largest gas producer globally, the US consumed unprecedented quantities last year, impeding the global decline in electricity generation from gas observed by Ember in 2023.\n\nExcluding the US, other economies collectively reduced their gas-powered electricity generation by 62 terawatt hours compared to the previous year. However, during the same period, the US significantly increased its gas-based electricity generation by 115 terawatt hours.\n\nOne significant contributing factor to this issue is the United States' tendency to replace aging coal-powered plants, known for their high carbon emissions, with gas-fired plants instead of cleaner energy alternatives.\n\nAccording to Jones, this shift represents a transition from one fossil fuel source to another. After two decades of heavily relying on gas-powered plants, the US faces a substantial challenge in transitioning towards a genuinely clean power system.\n\nEmber reports that the United States obtains only 23 percent of its electricity from renewable sources, which is lower than the global average of 30 percent.\n\nEmber's findings align closely with projections made by the International Energy Agency (IEA), which declared the shift towards clean energy \" inevitable \" in October.\n\nThe IEA anticipates a peak in global demand for coal, gas, and oil within this decade, encompassing all energy sectors, not just electricity. Additionally, the IEA foresees renewables comprising nearly half of the world's electricity supply by 2030.\n\nEmber's outlook has brightened following the commitment of over 130 nations to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030 at a United Nations climate summit held in December.\n\nThis significant advancement could propel global renewable electricity to reach 60 percent by the decade's end, a substantial leap from less than 20 percent observed in 2000.", "source": {"uri": "techtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tech Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "inno_flores@techtimes.com", "name": "Inno Flores", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ember_(non-profit_organisation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ember (non-profit organisation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fossil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Verge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt-hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kilowatt-hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Energy_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Energy industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://1734811051.rsc.cdn77.org/data/thumbs/full/446484/820/0/0/0/blue-solar-panel-board.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547879", "eventUri": "eng-9547879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

China was the main driver for that surge, as it contributed to more than half (51%) of the additional global solar generation last year. Overall, China, the EU, the US and Brazil accounted for 81% of solar power growth in 2023.\n\n\"The renewables future has arrived. Solar in particular is accelerating faster than anyone thought possible,\" said Dave Jones, global insights programme director at Ember.\n\nAmong the four trends highlighted in Ember's report that will shape the electricity transition in 2024, solar PV is at the forefront of the energy revolution and leading the way. Earlier this year, BloombergNEF forecasted solar PV to add 574GW of capacity in 2024, up from the 444GW added in 2023.\n\nWith an abundance of supply capacity - a Rystad Energy report from last year highlighted 40GW of modules sitting in European warehouses - and a fall in solar panel prices, solar is expected to further increase its generation in 2024 as added capacity increases too.\n\nFurthermore, delivering the pledge made during COP28 last year of trebling renewables capacity by 2030, would bring renewables production capacity to 60% by the end of the decade.\n\n\"Given the excess of supply, and the rapid drop in battery storage costs, solar is increasingly limited only by how fast it can be connected to the grid,\" reads the report.\n\nMoreover, 33 countries have now a more than 10% share of total generation from solar, including Chile (20%), Australia and the Netherlands (both at 17%), while the US state of California in itself has a 28% share of solar PV.\n\nDespite the fast pace growth of solar PV in terms of installed capacity, its generation has been underperforming in 2023. Among the issues for that shortfall is due to the location of where solar was added and generating with both China and the EU receiving fewer sunlight than global standards.\n\nAnother key aspect that needs to be addressed, is the increase in curtailment occurring in certain markets, particularly in Japan, the Netherlands and Australia.\n\nAlthough demand growth slowed down in 2023 - with a 2.2% increase that was below average in recent years - it is expected to increase in the coming years. Half of the demand growth in 2023 came from electric vehicles, data centres, heat pumps, electrolysers and air conditioning. These five technologies are expected to accelerate the growth in electricity demand in the coming years, yet overall energy demand will decline due to electrification being more efficient than fossil fuels.\n\nIn 2024, Ember forecasts clean energy generation - led by solar PV (600TWh) and wind (289TWh) - to add over 1,300TWh, far higher than the demand growth which is forecast to be 968TWh. The accelerated growth of clean energy could lead to a 2% decrease in global fossil fuel generation in 2024.", "source": {"uri": "pv-tech.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "PV Tech"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_tourino_jacobo@pv-tech.org", "name": "Jonathan Touri\u00f1o Jacobo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaic_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Photovoltaic system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electricity generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_storage_power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battery storage power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_panel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solar panel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electrolysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electrification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heat pump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nameplate_capacity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nameplate capacity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunlight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547879", "eventUri": "eng-9547879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

not seen a similar expansion in solar and wind, reaching a share of just 3.2% in 2023,\" Ember said in a statement on Thursday.\n\n\"In comparison, its neighbor Vietnam reached a 13% share for solar and wind in 2023,\" it added.\n\nEmber said that the Philippines relies on fossil fuels for 78% of its electricity and its per capita power sector emissions are below the global average.\n\nLow-carbon sources accounted for more than a fifth of the country's electricity, with the majority from hydropower and geothermal.\n\nSolar and wind provided just 2.5%, which is below the global average of 13% and the average among the countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations of 4.4%\n\n\"The Philippines saw its power sector emissions nearly double in the last 10 years as rising demand was met with a more than doubling of coal power generation,\" the think tank said.\n\nEmber's Global Electricity Review 2024 provides the first comprehensive overview of the global power system in 2023 based on country-level data.\n\nThe think tank said that the growth in solar and wind pushed the world past 30% renewable electricity for the first time in 2023.\n\n\"A renewables-powered future is now becoming a reality,\" Ember's Asia Programme Director Aditya Lolla said. \"Solar power, in particular, is growing at an unprecedented pace.\"\n\nIt said solar has been the fastest-growing electricity source for a 19th year and surpassed wind to become the largest source of new electricity for a second year running.\n\nThe government aims to increase the share of renewable energy to 35% by 2030 and to 50% by 2040.\n\nDepartment of Energy (DoE) estimates indicate that as of February, coal had a share of 43.8% in power generation, with installed capacity for coal-fired power plants amounting to 12,406 megawatts (MW).\n\nThe DoE said that at least 4,164.92 MW of power projects will become operational in 2024.\n\nIt is looking at the completion and commercial operation of 1,984.775 MW worth of solar capacity.\n\nOf the total, 966.294 MW are expected to come online by June 2024 while 494.888 MW are undergoing testing and commissioning. -- Sheldeen Joy Talavera",

Yet droughts in India, China, North America and Mexico meant hydropower hit a five-year low. Research shows climate change is causing droughts to develop more quickly and be more severe.\n\nPeople used more electricity than ever last year, about 2% more, an increase of about as much as Canada uses in a year. Some of this new demand was for heat pumps, which are an efficient way to both heat and cool buildings, and for electric vehicles. It was also for electrolyzers, special machines used to get hydrogen out of water for energy. These are all technologies that provide solutions to climate change.\n\nPeople are also reading...

WJBC mourns loss of former radio host Scott Laughlin\n\nOther increased demand was for electricity to feed new data centers and for air conditioning as places around the world become hotter.\n\nSolar made up the biggest share of new clean energy last year. More than twice as much solar power was added as coal power. It was the 19th year in a row that solar was the fastest-growing source of electricity generation. A surge in solar installations happened at the end of the year and the report predicts 2024 will see an even larger jump.\n\nChina added more renewable energy than any other country last year -- 51% of the new solar power and 60% of the new wind power globally. China, the European Union, the United States and Brazil together accounted for 81% of new solar generation in 2023.\n\nYet China was also responsible for 55% of coal generation globally and 60% of China's electricity generation came from coal. The International Energy Agency says coal is the most carbon-intensive of the fossil fuels.\n\nScientists say emissions from burning fuels like coal must ramp steeply down to protect Earth's climate, yet there was an increase in electricity made from burning fossil fuels. China, India, Vietnam and Mexico were responsible for nearly all of the rise.\n\nThe report said some countries burned coal to make up for the loss of hydroelectric power they experienced when drought caused their reservoirs to dry up. This is an example of a vicious cycle -- when climate change prompts the use of more of the substances that cause climate change in the first place.\n\nDespite all the growth in clean energy, fossil fuels still made up the majority of global electricity generated last year, causing a 1% rise in global power sector emissions. Scientists say even if we slashed all greenhouse gas emissions today, the planet would continue to warm for years because of the amount of pollutants already added to the atmosphere.\n\nAnalysts expect the world to use even more electricity in 2024. But renewable energy generation is forecast to grow even faster. That could mean a 2% drop in energy generated from fossil fuels.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Energy Ecology Electricity Chemistry Meteorology Physics Organic Chemistry Astronomy The

India has climbed from ranking ninth in 2015.\n\nThe Global Electricity Review 2024 published on Wednedsay provides a comprehensive overview of the global power system in 2023 based on country-level data.\n\nIt was published alongside the world's first open dataset on electricity generation in 2023 covering 80 countries representing 92 percent of global electricity demand, as well as historic data for 215 countries.\n\n\"India's growth in solar generation in 2023 pushed the country past Japan to become the world's third-largest solar power generator.It has climbed from ranking ninth in 2015,\" the report said.\n\nThe report finds that solar produced a record 5.5 per cent of global electricity in 2023. In line with the global trend, India generated 5.8 per cent of its electricity from solar in 2023.\n\nIndia saw the world's fourth-largest increase in solar generation in 2023 (+18 Terawatt hours or TWh), behind China (+156 TWh), the United States (+33 TWh) and Brazil (+22 TWh). Together the top four solar growth countries accounted for 75 percent of growth in 2023.\n\n\"A renewables-powered future is now becoming a reality. Solar power, in particular, is growing at an unprecedented pace\", said Aditya Lolla, Ember's Asia Programme Director.\n\nSolar maintained its status as the world's fastest-growing electricity source for the nineteenth consecutive year, adding more than twice as much new electricity worldwide as coal in 2023.\n\nSolar has been rapidly accelerating in recent years. Global solar generation in 2023 was more than six times larger than in 2015, while in India it was 17 times higher. India's share of solar generation increased from 0.5 per cent of India's electricity in 2015 to 5.8 per cent in 2023.\n\nPathways to decarbonizing electricity show that solar will play a central role in the future energy system.\n\nAccording to the IEA Net Zero Emissions scenario, solar would increase to 22 percent of global electricity generation in 2030. The goal to triple global renewables capacity by 2030 agreed at COP28 has the potential to put the world on this course.\n\nIndia is one of the few countries planning to triple renewable capacity by 2030. According to Ember's analysis, annual capacity additions need to significantly increase for India to meet this capacity target.\n\n\"Increasing clean electricity isn't just for reducing carbon emissions in the power sector. It's also needed to meet the rising electricity demand in an increasingly electrified economy and decoupling economic growth from emissions, which is crucial for tackling climate change\", Aditya Lolla concluded.

China\n\nThirty percent of the world's electricity in 2023 was generated by renewable energy sources, according to a think tank.\n\nThe data comes from the Global Electricity Review 2024 report [PDF] authored by Ember Climate. While the 165-page document covers lots of topics, the headliner was the share of global electricity created by renewables, which for the first time ever was just above 30 percent last year.\n\nHitting that percentage mark was thanks to continued expansion in wind and solar energy, which represented 13.4 percent of energy generated in 2023, up from 11.9 percent in 2022. The EU, US, and Brazil accounted for much of the boost in wind and solar, but China was by far the leader, having created 60 percent and 51 percent of new sources of wind and solar respectively.\n\nAlthough a new milestone has been reached for the renewable energy sector, the figures apparently fell short of expectations. Growth in wind energy declined for the second year in a row; 2021 saw wind energy increase by roughly 250 TWh while 2023 clocked in a relatively small 206 TWh boost. The combined energy rise from wind and solar at 513 TWh was just slightly lower than the 517 TWh gain seen in 2022.\n\nIn the case of solar energy, though, there are some caveats. China saw less sunlight in 2023, which limited the impact of its new solar panels, and some countries underreported their expansion of solar energy. The report says these are temporary factors, and had they not occurred, the actual increase for solar could have been around 387 TWh instead of 307.\n\nAdditionally, hydro power fell to a five-year low, dropping its share of global energy to just 14.3 percent and offsetting some of the gains made by wind and solar. Although new dams were brought online in 2023, droughts continue to make hydro energy collection much less efficient. Mexico was hit especially hard, seeing 42 percent of its hydroelectric power drop.\n\nWind, solar, hydro, other renewables, and nuclear together now make up 39.4 percent of the world's electricity supply. It might not be too much longer until most energy in the world is generated by low-carbon sources.\n\nThe Ember report also points out that while renewable and other clean energy sources made substantial gains in 2023, it wasn't quite enough to satisfy demand, which stood at an additional 627 TWh. The lower-than-expected growth in wind and solar, the decline in hydroelectric power, and the small gain in other sources like bioenergy meant a 135 TWh increase in fossil fuels was necessary to meet demand.\n\nThis was despite the fact that the relative increase in power demand in 2023 was just 2.2 percent, a little lower than the 2.5 percent average seen from 2012 to 2022.\n\nThe vast majority of increased demand came from China, at 606 TWh, well ahead of India at 99 TWh. Meanwhile, power demand in the US, EU, Asia-Pacific, and Africa fell somewhat. Of course, China also built lots of wind and solar infrastructure to meet its own demand.\n\n2023 may have seen a drop in global carbon emissions if wind and solar had met expectations, if there hadn't been droughts, or if demand was lower. A small increase in coal and natural gas usage resulted in 1 percent higher emissions in 2023. However, both fossil fuels saw their relative usage decline slightly as clean energy grew much more, and 2023 did see a 1.2 percent decline in the carbon intensity of power generation.\n\nEmber predicts 2023 was the high watermark for the fossil fuel industry, and that from here on out emissions will fall, assuming that wind and solar continue on their current trajectory. The report predicts for 2024 that solar energy will rise to 600 TWh, wind 289 TWh, hydro 332 TWh, and nuclear and others a combined 80 TWh. This would be far more than the projected 968 TWh of demand for the year, leading to a fall in fossil fuel energy generation.\n\nThe prediction is optimistic, something the report acknowledges. If droughts persist and demand is even higher than Ember forecasts, both of which it says are a possibility, then a decline in fossil fuel energy could turn into another slight increase. AI datacenters could certainly throw off predictions, if the warnings about power usage prove to be true.\n\nIn the longer term, Ember forecasts that tripling renewable energy by 2030 would nearly cut emissions in half. This would add 14,000 TWh to the global power supply, more than meeting the predicted 9,000 TWh of demand. Combined with additional power from nuclear and cutting-edge hydrogen power generation, fossil fuel power could drop by 37 percent, most of which would be coal, thus dropping emissions by 45 percent.\n\nA doubling of renewable energy might be more realistic, however, as the report notes: \"Ember's research shows that government plans to 2030 already align with a doubling of global renewable capacity.\" These plans would need to be updated for tripling renewables by 2030 to be a possibility.\n\nLonger-term plans like US cities transitioning to green power by 2050 are already on the rocks, so it's not guaranteed by any means that Ember's hypothetical 2030 will become reality. \u00ae", "source": {"uri": "theregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "theregister.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt-hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kilowatt-hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solar energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydroelectricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ember_(non-profit_organisation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ember (non-profit organisation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windmill", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Windmill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioenergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bioenergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydropower", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydropower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_panel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solar panel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low-carbon economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunlight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_intensity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emission intensity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://regmedia.co.uk/2024/02/13/turbine_shutterstock.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547879", "eventUri": "eng-9547879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

In line with the global trend, India generated 5.8 per cent of its electricity from solar in 2023.\n\nIndia saw the world's fourth-largest increase in solar generation in 2023 (+18 Terawatt hours or TWh), behind China (+156 TWh), the United States (+33 TWh) and Brazil (+22 TWh). Together the top four solar growth countries accounted for 75 percent of growth in 2023.\n\n\"A renewables-powered future is now becoming a reality. Solar power, in particular, is growing at an unprecedented pace\", said Aditya Lolla, Ember's Asia Programme Director.\n\nSolar maintained its status as the world's fastest-growing electricity source for the nineteenth consecutive year, adding more than twice as much new electricity worldwide as coal in 2023.\n\nSolar has been rapidly accelerating in recent years. Global solar generation in 2023 was more than six times larger than in 2015, while in India it was 17 times higher. India's share of solar generation increased from 0.5 per cent of India's electricity in 2015 to 5.8 per cent in 2023.\n\nPathways to decarbonizing electricity show that solar will play a central role in the future energy system.\n\nAccording to the IEA Net Zero Emissions scenario, solar would increase to 22 percent of global electricity generation in 2030. The goal to triple global renewables capacity by 2030 agreed at COP28 has the potential to put the world on this course.\n\nIndia is one of the few countries planning to triple renewable capacity by 2030. According to Ember's analysis, annual capacity additions need to significantly increase for India to meet this capacity target.\n\n\"Increasing clean electricity isn't just for reducing carbon emissions in the power sector. It's also needed to meet the rising electricity demand in an increasingly electrified economy and decoupling economic growth from emissions, which is crucial for tackling climate change\", Aditya Lolla concluded.

So now, it's more important than ever to cut fossil fuel use in the power industry - by far the biggest contributor to global CO2 emissions. At least we're making progress: a new study from think tank Ember showed that renewable sources provided a record 30.3% of global electricity last year, up from 29.4% in 2022, with green energy generation growing at a faster rate than that of fossil fuels. The widespread build-out of solar farms in the past few years has spurred that on, after an oversupply of Chinese solar panels led to a big drop in prices. That's helping to put a global target to triple renewable capacity by 2030 within sight, according to Ember.\n\nBuilding new renewable energy plants isn't just a matter of saving the world: global demand for electricity is set to accelerate in the coming years as data centers, crypto miners, and EVs become more widespread. In fact, the International Energy Agency projects that global power demand for data centers alone could double by 2026 to over 1,000 terawatt-hours. For context, that's the entire annual electricity consumption of Japan.\n\nZooming in: A balancing act.\n\nThe issue with renewable energy, though, is that it relies on the whims of the wind and sun. But everything from data centers to crypto miners to whole countries need a stable supply of electricity.

Though planet-warming fossil fuel use also increased last year (by 0.8%), Ember thinks that number will shrink in the near future.\n\n\"Already the rollout of clean generation, led by solar and wind, has helped to slow the growth in fossil fuels by almost two-thirds in the last ten years,\" the report says. \"As a result, half the world's economies are already at least five years past a peak in electricity generation from fossil fuels.\"", "source": {"uri": "qz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Quartz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydropower", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydropower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Energy development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fossil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electricity generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/70976a4ee40809dede19161c4eb9f4ca.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547879", "eventUri": "eng-9547879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

LONGi said the new technology will provide a major boost for the global transition to clean energy sources.\n\n\"What's more, it retains this performance throughout its life, as the module is designed to the highest standards of reliability,\" said Dennis She, vice president of LONGi Green Energy Technology.\n\n\"Power plant owners can rest assured that a plant built from the HiMO 9 module will help them make the most efficient use of their land and get the most value out of sunlight.\"\n\nThe latest record is still a way off the record set by next-generation solar cells that use perovskite, which have achieved efficiency rates beyond 33 per cent in the lab. However it bodes well for increasing the electricity generation capabilities of solar on a global scale.\n\nThe new record coincides with a report published on Wednesday revealing that renewable energy accounted for more than 30 per cent of the world's electricity for the first time in 2023.\n\nThe surge in clean energy use has largely be driven by the adoption of solar technologies, according to the Global Electricity Review published by climate think tank Ember.\n\n\"The renewables future has arrived,\" said Dave Jones, global insights director at Ember. \"Solar in particular is accelerating faster than anyone thought possible.\"\n\nSolar power accounts for more than 10 per cent of annual electricity generation in more than 30 countries, while now making up 5.5 per cent of global electricity generation in 2023 - up from 4.6 per cent in 2022.\n\n\"Together with wind, solar will form the backbone of the future electricity system, providing nearly 70 per cent of global electricity by 2050,\" Ember's report stated.\n\n\"The continuing cost reductions for solar and wind power, battery storage, EVs and other key technologies show that a clean energy future is also a cheaper energy future.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_panel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solar panel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LONGi_Green_Energy_Technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LONGi Green Energy Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystalline_silicon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crystalline silicon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar cell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LONGi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LONGi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perovskite", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perovskite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_conversion_efficiency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Energy conversion efficiency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electricity generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunlight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_storage_power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Battery storage power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solar power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wind power"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/08/08/solar%20panel%20world%20record%20renewables.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547879", "eventUri": "eng-9547879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

That is the headline finding from the latest Global Electricity Review from think tank Ember, which shows that renewables generated a record 30 per cent of the global electricity mix in 2023. The gains were driven by a 10 per cent increase in wind energy generation and a 23 per cent increase in solar power generation. In contrast, fossil fuel generation grew just 0.8 per cent year-on-year. Record construction of new wind and solar farms last year mean the trend is likely to continue throughout 2024, while any increase in hydro generation following drought conditions in key markets during 2023 should ensure power sector emissions start to fall.\n\nBusiness Green 8th May 2024 read more \"\n\nService designed to provide 'unprecedented' levels of detail to business customers on where and when their electricity is generated. The Soil Association has become one of the first organisations to take advantage of Good Energy's 'hourly-matching' service, which aims to provide \"unprecedented\" levels of detail on how electricity use is matched on an hourly basis with renewable sources of power. Good Energy claims it is the first UK energy supplier to share hourly energy matching data with its larger business customers, allowing them to view which generators - including farms and wind farms - are supplying their renewable electricity for each hour of the day. The hourly-matching data is accessed via an online platform provided in partnership with Granular Energy. It enables businesses and organisations to better understand how their power is generated and simplifies corporate CO2 reporting, Good Energy said.\n\nBusiness Green 8th May 2024 read more \"\n\nWith green policies taking a central role in this election year, the question at the heart of every conversation around achieving net zero emissions is: 'How can we speed up the drive towards net zero while meaningfully supporting local communities?' When it comes to building more renewable energy parks, in particular, some politicians remain sceptical, concerned about sacrificing too much land and resources in the race to net zero. In reality, we can do much more with what we have, carefully stewarding Britain's already-abundant natural resources. A recent Friends of the Earth report shows that England alone could produce 13 times more renewable energy than it does now while using less than 3% of its land. The UK is a densely populated country and every piece of land should be treated with care, especially in London and the south-east, which is the most populous region in the UK. But we have enough lower quality land that offers great potential, and which can be used without compromising agricultural production. We also have excellent natural resources in this country, in the form of high wind speeds and robust irradiance levels. However, we are not using them as thoughtfully as we should. The co-location of solar, wind, and battery storage on a single renewable energy park is one such solution. Only 12% of all UK renewables developments have co-located solar and battery, or wind and battery combinations (according to RenewableUK). Just a fraction of those are currently developing parks that house all three. Despite a strong focus on green energy overall, last year's election manifestos have not given this idea much consideration. As a case in point, the recent government's contract consultation launched in March only briefly looks at co-location as an option.", "source": {"uri": "no2nuclearpower.org.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "No2NuclearPower"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pete@no2nuclearpower.org.uk", "name": "pete", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Energy", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Good Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaic_power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photovoltaic power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydroelectricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soil Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Green politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_farm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wind farm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_generator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric generator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_storage_power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Battery storage power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RenewableUK", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RenewableUK"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends_of_the_Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Friends of the Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.no2nuclearpower.org.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/solar-panels-for-greenhouse.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547879", "eventUri": "eng-9547879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

The firm expects that trend to continue going forward, driven by the proliferation of data centers, factories and electric vehicles. Meanwhile, multiple experts say that many renewable energy stocks to buy are poised to benefit significantly from America's rising electricity consumption.\n\nIn an emailed statement to InvestorPlace, Greg Murphy, a Managing Director at sustainable investment firm Ecofin spoke on the matter. \"There is hardly a market today where electricity is not taking market share from fossil fuels, and we see this potentially accelerating,\" Murphy stated. He added that renewable sources are taking market share in every market because they are cheaper than fossil fuels. Also upbeat on renewable is Ideal Power (NASDAQ:IPWR) CEO, Dan Brdar. In an email to InvestorPlace, he reported that \"Large increases in U.S. electricity demand will help renewable energy companies as two-thirds of new capacity is expected to be in the form of solar and wind.\" Ideal Power provides bidirectional switches which charge and discharge energy storage batteries. Such batteries are often used in conjunction with wind and solar projects because those sources only provide electricity intermittently. Here are three top renewable energy stocks to buy.\n\nGE Vernova (NYSE:GEV) is one of the world's largest producers of wind turbines. Global wind power deployments rose 50% last year to a record 117 gigawatts. As the demand for electricity increases going forward, GE Vernova's revenue from wind turbines should rise tremendously.\n\nThe company also sells equipment used by power producers. As more power plants are built to handle the increased demand for electricity, the firm's revenue should climb. Indeed, Wood McKenzie recently reported that utilities are already experiencing shortages of such equipment.\n\nGE Vernova already appears to be benefiting from these trends as its top line rose 6% last quarter versus the same period a year earlier. Additionally, its adjusted EBITDA increased $300 million.\n\nNextEra (NYSE:NEE) is very well-positioned to benefit from increasing demand for electricity, being one of America's largest renewable energy producers.\n\nContinuing to improve its ability to exploit future increases in the demand for clean energy, NextEra began almost 2,765 MW of new renewable and storage projects in Q1.\n\nAlso boding well for the company's outlook, the customer base of its huge electric utility, Florida Power & Light, rose by 100,000 last quarter versus the same period a year earlier.\n\nAnalysts, on average, expect the company's earnings per share to climb to $3.68 next year from $3.17 in 2023. The shares have a significant dividend yield of 2.85%.\n\nA leading producer of solar panels, First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) is already benefiting a great deal from utilities' strong demand for renewable energy.\n\nLast quarter its revenue jumped 45% versus the same period a year earlier to $794 million, while its operating income soared to a huge $243 million in Q1 versus just $18 million in Q1 of 2023.\n\nAlso impressively, the company had a huge 2.7 gigawatts of booking in the first four months of 2024 alone.\n\nFirst Solar, which has three factories in Ohio and is building two more in the Southeast, will continue to benefit a great deal from America's generous tax credits for the domestic production of solar panels.\n\nGiven the company's strong growth, the shares' forward price-earnings ratio of 14.7 times is very low.", "source": {"uri": "investorplace.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "InvestorPlace"}, "authors": [{"uri": "larry_ramer@investorplace.com", "name":

And billions of people are using clean energy sources daily as the number of solar and wind farms continues to grow.\n\nHydropower\n\nLast year, hydroelectric dams produced most of the clean energy sources - as in most years. Yet dry weather conditions, or droughts, in India, China, and North America meant hydropower hit a five-year low. Research shows climate change is causing droughts to develop more quickly and be more severe.\n\nPeople used more electricity than ever last year, about 2 percent more, an increase of about as much as Canada uses in a year. Some of this new demand was for heat pumps, which are an efficient way to both heat and cool buildings, and for electric vehicles. The demand was also for electrolyzers, special machines used to get hydrogen out of water, for energy. These are all technologies that provide solutions to climate change.\n\nOther increased demand was for electricity to feed new data centers and for air conditioning as places around the world become hotter.\n\nSolar\n\nSolar made up the biggest part of new clean energy last year. More than twice as much solar power was added as coal power. It was the 19th year in a row that solar was the fastest-growing source of electricity generation. A large increase in solar installations happened at the end of the year and the report predicts 2024 will see an even larger jump.\n\nChina added more renewable energy than any other country last year -- 51 percent of the new solar power and 60 percent of the new wind power worldwide.\n\nChina, the European Union, the United States and Brazil together were responsible for 81 percent of new solar generation in 2023.\n\nThe report said some countries burned coal to make up for the loss of hydroelectric power they experienced when drought caused their water supply to dry up.\n\nChina was responsible for 55 percent of coal generation worldwide. And 60 percent of China's electricity generation came from coal. China, India, Vietnam and Mexico were responsible for nearly all of the increase.\n\nThe International Energy Agency says fossil fuels release more carbon dioxide to produce electricity. And scientists say fossil fuel burning needs to decrease quickly to protect Earth's climate.\n\nExperts expect the world to use even more electricity in 2024. However, as renewable energy generation is predicted to grow, it could mean a 2 percent drop in energy generated from fossil fuels.", "source": {"uri": "learningenglish.voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydropower", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hydropower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_farm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wind farm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydroelectricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal-fired_power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coal-fired power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electrolysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat pump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electricity generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solar power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Energy_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://gdb.voanews.com/3f466673-2877-4ebf-863d-f9dd5850ea3a_cx0_cy6_cw0_w1200_r1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547879", "eventUri": "eng-9547879", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 452988246, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 102, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 102}}}

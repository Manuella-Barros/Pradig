Along the way, she also found she had a love for poetry and an eclectic taste in music. Throughout her childhood and teen years, she sang in choirs and in battle of the bands competitions. At 18, Yelich uprooted her life from her native New Zealand to Los Angeles, before relocating to N.Y.C. She published two poetry books 2018's Sticky Notes and 2022's Dudette.\n\nAlong the way she fell in love with musicians like Bon Iver, Holly Humberstone, Blue Nile, Rihanna and Perry, specifically songs like \"Thinking of You\" and \"Waking Up in Vegas,\" which she listens to \"every day.\" But she found herself wanting to pursue a different medium. \"Lyrics aren't really that different to a certain type of prose,\" she states. \"It just felt like the natural direction.\" Last year, she made her musical introduction with her debut EP, Threads, pairing her enchanting poetic lyricism with dark pop numbers and sweeping, soulful anthems.\n\nFor Yelich, \"East Coast\" is \"literally\" what happened right after Threads. \"I don't know if people know that yet,\" she laughs. In some ways, she feels like she's evolved. Now, she's 25, her \"brain's fully-formed,\" her voice is more specific and self-assured and her music palette has expanded. \"I think I just had to grow up a little bit to really find my sound,\" she says.\n\nRelated: Charli XCX and Lorde Unpack Their Complicated Friendship on Vulnerable 'Girl, So Confusing' Remix\n\nWhen it came to working on \"East Coast,\" there was someone whose opinion she supremely valued -- her sister Lorde's. She sent her single -- and other songs -- to her, which, admittedly, make her \"really nervous.\" \"I always value her opinion,\" Yelich says. \"She's my best mate [and], we're pretty similar.\" Still, she believes it's important for her to forge her own path. \"But it's exciting to share a heartfelt piece of music like that with her because she always sends me like the loveliest messages about it,\" Yelich says.\n\nKnowing that both sisters are paving their own way in pop, is it possible there could be a collaboration between the two of them down the line? \"I wouldn't rule it out,\" Yelich says. \"I don't know what the future would hold but for now, I think it's important that I carve out my own creative voice.\" At the moment, she has some other dream pairings in mind. Yelich would love to work with Chappell Roan. \"I was living in that world of The Rise and Fall of a Midwestern Princess for a while [before people caught on], so it's crazy to see it go [viral],\" she says. As a fan of The Japanese House, she'd love to work with George Daniel from The 1975, who produced the English indie artist.\n\nWhile Yelich doesn't elaborate too much on what's next, she says that \"East Coast\" is a \"part of a forthcoming project.\" For now, she's focused on creating her own \"Indy world.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

And it's on the Pacific Coast Highway, sitting in the backseat of her friend's car that she realised that a on-and-off relationship was not healthy.\n\n\"I was just looking at my phone and I was having this text essay argument ... and I just at that moment - the sun was beautiful and the ocean - and I wasn't present there.\n\n\"I wanted to get my phone and throw it out the window and just never think of it again.\"\n\nYelich went to the studio the next day with half the song written.\n\n\"[The song] was just begging to come out.\"\n\nWhen asked if she is now at peace with the relationship, she replies, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\nYelich believes sometimes there isn't peace at the end of a relationship especially if you spend years with someone you love deeply. Peace has to come from within yourself and the only thing that really helps is time, she says. It took at least six months before she realised that she actually loves waking up alone and sleeping in her own bed.\n\n\"Once the tragedy and the loss simmers down a bit, then there's space for positive feelings, but sadly you've just got to feel it.\n\n\"It's agony until one day it's not.\"\n\nYelich says she always loved performing, even as a young child. Her claim to fame in her primary school play was Ursula the sea witch in The Little Mermaid.\n\n\"I was a very loud child, I was definitely the loudest, very cheeky.\"\n\nYelich says that hasn't changed much, except that maybe she's a little more refined.\n\n\"As they said in my family group chat today, Indy is, as a kid, bouncing off the walls, bouncing off the chairs.\"\n\nAs to whether she ever collaborates with her sister Lorde, Yelich says they are pretty separate but she always sent her songs to her sister.\n\n\"Her opinion's really important to me.\"\n\nYelich also used Lorde's piano to teach herself how to play during Covid, by putting sticky tape with letters of the keys to familiarise herself.\n\nShe credits growing up in New Zealand as how she developed her voice. There was creativity \"flowing out of the walls\" in the environment where she was raised and still travels back to New Zealand once or twice a year for a few weeks at a time.\n\nBut home is New York, for now, where Yelich feels \"a strong sense of self\".\n\n\"It's a very walkable city, it's got a lot of character in ways I don't feel like a lot of cities do. I love the spontaneity, the change of seasons ... and honestly a lot of my Kiwi best friends live in New York as well.\"\n\nAnd as for this weekend, you'll find her at a '70s dive bar, drinking a gin gimlet on the rocks, dancing with her girlfriends.\n\n\"I'm going to put on some really cute heels and honestly just relax, because I've worked really hard,\" she laughs.", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Route_1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California State Route 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorde", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lorde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Little Mermaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Primary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tragedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchcraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Witchcraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimlet_(tool)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gimlet (tool)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dive_bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dive bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Piano"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://media.rnztools.nz/rnz/image/upload/s--Ei-vaduc--/t_tohu-badge-twitter/v1719438199/4KQALHW_Indy_Yelich_5_jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693456", "eventUri": "eng-9693456", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

It may be weird to ask this - given that Christian Yelich is the second-leading outfielder in National League all-star voting, given his MVP history - but do these milestone numbers mean anything to the multifaceted athlete?\n\n\"I guess that means I've been around a long time,\" Yelich deadpanned Monday in the Milwaukee Brewers clubhouse.\n\nPressed about it a little more, Yelich admitted, maybe grudgingly, that this is a something special.\n\n\"It's definitely something that's not really easy to do,\" said Yelich. \"You just try your be a balanced player I guess.\"\n\nAnd that brings up two good points for this stage in his career.\n\nFirst, when Yelich got his 200th stolen base Wednesday in the third inning of the Brewers' 6-5, 10-inning victory over the Texas Rangers, he joined a pretty exclusive club. Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez, Mike Trout, Andrew McCutchen and Jos\u00e9 Altuve are recent players on the list of players who've hit 200 or more home runs with at least 200 stolen bases that isn't very long and is loaded with the game's elite.\n\nAnd, at 32 years of age, it is impressive he's still a threat to steal a base. It's just that Yelich doesn't draw up any specific training workouts to maintain this high level of base stealing, at least when it comes to being fast.\n\n\"I've kind of just always had it,\" said Yelich. \"So I try to take care of myself and stay on top of things just like its during the season in the offseason. And be mindful that you need your body for your job.\"\n\nSpeed is one of those topics of conversation with the Brewers a little bit. Rookie Jackson Chourio rounded the bases from hit to home plate in under 15 seconds recently, a blistering fast time. Brice Turang is a speedy runner.\n\nPro baseball teams track these stats - sprint speed, base stealing speed - but Yelich doesn't appear to know what his times are, or if he's ever been timed.\n\n\"I got no idea,\" said Yelich.\n\nSo how does he know he's still fast, like he was eight years ago, without any other comparable information other than the raw facts?\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said. \"You tell me.\"\n\nWell, Yelich already had 15 stolen bases entering play Wednesday. He had 28 last year and 19 the year before. His career high is 30, from the 2019 season. His numbers in fact have only been trending better in stolen bases as Yelich has gained experience.\n\nBut manager Pat Murphy is qualified to answer this.\n\n\"Well, I think it is remarkable,\" said Murphy. \"I think it's a credit to his baseball acumen. You know, he's a baseball player. He doesn't get thrown out because he knows when to run. He keeps his body in great shape, and he still can run.\n\n\"I don't know what his sprint speed is but I bet it's good. ... I don't really care what his sprint speed is, by the way, but it's still pretty good.\n\n\"But he knows how to run the bases and that's the deal. You don't have to be super fast - although he is - you don't have to be super fast to steal bases. It's part of his game. And that's the part of understanding Christian Yelich. It doesn't look like some other star players.\"\n\nIt's only being on his team, and seeing the subtleties and nuances of what Yelich does, that makes it easier to appreciate all that he has accomplished, said Murphy. And that's especially true in this area, whether Yelich is stealing home or stealing 30 bases in a single year.\n\n\"Stealing bases is about way more than just being fast. You can be a bad base stealer and still be fast,\" Yelich agreed. \"There's a lot more that goes into it. It is just something that I've always been able to do my entire life, and I'm continuing to try to do that.\"", "source": {"uri": "wausaudailyherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wausau Daily Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Yelich", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christian Yelich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stolen base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCutchen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew McCutchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Trout", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Trout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Altuve", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Altuve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Rangers_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas Rangers (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Ram\u00edrez_(infielder)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez (infielder)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Murphy_(baseball_coach)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat Murphy (baseball coach)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2023/08/30/PMJS/1699d830-5d87-42b0-8c7a-0c67e20a345a-MJS_brewers03_19.jpg_brewers03.jpg?auto=webp&crop=6561,3688,x5,y455&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693456", "eventUri": "eng-9693456", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Like, for probably about six months I had all my belongings in a little carry-on.\n\n\"The desire to be young and free was just not what the reality of my life was and it was quite cathartic to write it.\"\n\nEast Coast feels like the ultimate road trip song - it evokes the sun in your eyes, rolling down the car windows, turning the volume all the way up.\n\n\"I literally wrote it when I was driving on the PCH [Pacific Coast Highway] in the back seat of my friend's car,\" she says.\n\n\"I was reading these essay-length texts while my friend's in the front seat with the windows down, having fun ... and so the chorus really feels like wanting to push that feeling.\"\n\nFor Yelich, the song sums up \"figuring out what it means to have an identity outside of a relationship and a man\". Through the process of writing it, she says she's learned to speak up for herself - not just when it comes to romantic relationships, but in her career as a musician.\n\n\"It taught me to advocate for myself - believing in my own voice, believing in the melody, and believing that I know, for example, what sounds best for my voice. Believing that I can hear how I want the song to come out.\"\n\nDoes the new single mean there's an album in the works? Yelich smiles. \"All I can say is that it's part of a forthcoming project.\"\n\nPerforming live is also on the radar. \"I would love to be back on stage soon,\" she says, adding that she hopes to play a show in New Zealand one day. \"I would love that. Gosh, doing a festival there sounds like a dream.\"\n\nBefore turning her pen to songwriting, she released two poetry books, Sticky Notes and Dudette. Does the writing process differ between the two mediums?\n\n\"Writing those books really helped me with songwriting, because I had a few years of a chance to explore language in more of a free manner,\" she says, adding with a laugh, \"When you're writing songs you have to really get to the point, 'cause you don't have like 100 words, tons of pages.\"\n\nIt's been six years since she made the move to the US, a step she says was the key to finding her voice.\n\n\"You don't really know that many people, you really have to figure it out for yourself. And I think that vital independence was very necessary to my career.\"\n\nNow, she says, \"I feel most like myself in the city, on the East Coast,\" likening her love of New York to a \"long-term crush\".\n\n\"There is no feeling like when you have just touched down after a really long flight and got off the plane,\" she gushes.\n\n\"Getting in the Uber or a cab, I just put on some really dramatic 70s music, and that rush going into Manhattan over that bridge, it's just amazing. You wind the windows down and you just hear all the people. You could almost cry.\n\n\"And it feels like I'm coming back to myself every time.\"\n\nHer other home, though, is Aotearoa. When she touches down in Auckland, running into the ocean is first up on her to-do list, before spending time with her parents and her dog, Al Pacino.\n\n\"I was there in January and I was there three weeks, and I brought my roommate back with me, and the first thing I did was take my shoes off and run to the vines out the back of our house and get passionfruit,\" she recalls.\n\n\"I just pulled it off the vine and bit it open. She was like, 'Don't you need a knife?' I was like, 'No, just crack it open with your teeth' - the best.\"\n\nMost of her memories of growing up in New Zealand revolve around summer. \"I just miss the water so much ... being like 15 and jumping off a wharf, it was always really cold, but you'd wear your cutest little bikini from probably Supr\u00e9,\" she says, laughing.\n\n\"I miss walking around New World. I just miss how everyone says hi on the street.\n\n\"Randomly, I remember a lot of sausage sizzles, just like my dad's work parties, my primary school fundraisers. That's, like, New Zealand.\"\n\nIt's those moments she treasures more than ever now that she lives on the other side of the world.\n\n\"I really appreciate how I was raised. There's such an air of caution in New York, especially with kids, but being raised in Aotearoa - you kind of realise it a bit more as you get older - it's just so beautiful. You just bike around by yourself, you bike to school.\"\n\nYelich grew up in Devonport, in a home filled with books - mum Sonja is a poet too - and music: Cat Stevens, Bon Iver, Annie Lennox and Simon & Garfunkel.\n\n\"I always listened to what my dad would sing and what my mum would play at dinner parties. I was really inspired by that kind of thing, and by what my sisters would show me.\n\n\"It was really exciting to grow up with books and grow up with music in the house, and then doing music lessons and playing piano and playing clarinet, things like that. And then finding that love again in later life,\" she says.\n\n\"Have you ever had this experience where your parents listen to a certain song, and then you rediscover it like 10 years later?\n\n\"You're like 'oh yeah, this is sick!' Like Talking Heads or The Smiths. My parents had really good taste, I just didn't know it,\" she jokes.\n\nYelich is a self-described \"mischievous middle\" child, between older sister Ella, 27, and 22-year-old brother Angelo, who is based in London.\n\nShe says of her sister, \"It's so awesome to have such a familiar figure in this industry who I feel like I can trust.\n\n\"She really taught me to advocate for your own voice, like, you are a master of your own craft. You are your own person with your own voice and owning that is the best thing you can do, otherwise you might lose that.\n\n\"If there's a problem sometimes, like I'll need her advice and I will take it, because she has such a wisdom, you know, and I really need that sometimes.\"\n\nOutside of the music industry, theirs is a typical sister relationship. \"She's like my best friend. She's never going to be that mad if I steal all her clothes,\" Yelich jokes.\n\n\"The other day, I saw this little lip gloss - I don't think she knew that I took it - it was like this Tower 28 or something. I took it, put it in my bag and then I've used it. You know, things like that.\n\n\"It takes you a little while to realise when you're younger that your sisters will be your best friends when you're older and it's just so special having the familiarity, especially with someone who knows you. It's your blood.\"\n\nThe value of sisterhood is just one of the things Yelich has learned throughout her 20s.\n\n\"They say when you're 25, your brain really forms - I didn't believe that. But it is so much better getting older. I'm so different than I was at 20,\" she says.\n\nIt's that sense of self, of having gone through the growing pains and finally understanding who you are, that she hopes to have captured in East Coast.\n\n\"It feels so good to have nailed this feeling and like, believe it - it's a really good feeling.\"", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"},

Paredes is slugging .452 this season, hitting .327 on batted balls in play against left-handed pitching.\n\nAll season long, Corbin has struggled, posting a 1.53 WHIP. He's in danger of giving up a long ball or two today.\n\nMilwaukee Brewers star Christian Yelich only has seven home runs on the season, but he's in a prime spot to go deep against a division rival on Sunday.\n\nThe Chicago Cubs have Kyle Hendricks on the mound in this game, and he's allowed 11 homers in 14 outings (57.2 innings of work). Hendricks has gotten shelled in 2024, and Yelich has fared well against the Cubs veteran in his career.\n\nAcross 53 at bats, Yelich is hitting .226 with two homers, two doubles, nine walks and six runs batted in. While the batting average isn't great, Yelich has been able to take Hendricks - a sinker-ball pitcher - deep on multiple occasions.\n\nSimilar to Corbin, we're fading a veteran starter that simply hasn't been able to slow batters down this season.\n\nOdds refresh periodically and are subject to change.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Yelich", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christian Yelich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Corbin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Corbin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Paredes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Isaac Paredes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Arozarena", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Randy Arozarena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Hendricks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Hendricks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4137,h_2327,x_0,y_167/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01j1mrrwswvy8mstsfx6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693456", "eventUri": "eng-9693456", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

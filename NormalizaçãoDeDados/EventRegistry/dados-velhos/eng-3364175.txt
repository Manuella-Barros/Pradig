Jahns breaks down the best and worst of the Bears' training camp, which ended Monday at Olivet Nazarene University:\n\nMike Glennon looked ...\n\nLike a quarterback who needs to play more in the preseason. He shouldn't be treated as a typical starter. He needs the work after being the Buccaneers' backup for two full seasons. It was telling to hear Glennon say after the Broncos game that he still needs \"to get used to coming out as the starter and playing and being that guy.\" At best, Glennon's camp was uneven. The Bears liked how he performed after his rough preseason debut, but he still could have been better. The Bears' defensive backs seemed to have a good read on him throughout camp.\n\nMitch Trubisky looked ...\n\nMitch Trubisky threw for 166 yards Thursday. (Brian O'Mahoney/Sun-Times Media)\n\nLike he belonged against the Broncos, but his inexperience still was evident in Bourbonnais. But for all his struggles in camp, Trubisky still flashed his top-five pick talent. His arm talent -- the accuracy, velocity, touch and more -- is special. He can make throws that Glennon can't. The most encouraging aspect might be off the field, though. By all accounts, Trubisky has bought into the Bears' plan for him. He's a team-first guy who knows he has much to learn. He also has natural charisma. His teammates have bought into that.\n\nDo the Bears have a quarterback controversy?\n\nNot yet. One preseason game is too small a sample size to spark major changes. But the best players need to play. It's how you keep your locker room in order. The Bears certainly have their reasons not to rush Trubisky, but Glennon still needs to prove his worth on the field.\n\nHe had a good camp ...\n\nRookie safety Eddie Jackson. From interceptions to pass breakups, he showed off his ball skills and range throughout camp. The Bears really like his instincts. Jackson's tackling ability will determine whether he starts, but his strong play has put him squarely in the mix to play alongside veteran Quintin Demps.\n\nHe had a disappointing camp ...\n\nRunning back Jeremy Langford because he didn't have a camp. He sprained his right ankle during an early walk-through. It's the same ankle that required surgery in the offseason. Langford still is the Bears' best option to back up Jordan Howard, but the running back competition has turned into a good one without him. Rookie Tarik Cohen has earned playing time.\n\nI'll be watching ...\n\nThe players Trubisky plays with and against the rest of the preseason. The Bears might not have a quarterback controversy, but Trubisky has earned the right to play with and against better players. It will determine truly how far along he is in his development. Trubisky moved the ball well with receivers Josh Bellamy and Deonte Thompson against the Broncos. What can he do with Kevin White and Cam Meredith? The Bears already know what Mark Sanchez can do.\n\nDid camp change my opinion of the team's future?\n\nNo. The Bears' roster is more talented than many think it is, especially nationally. The Bears might not be a playoff team, but everyone continues to underrate how devastating their injuries were last season. Matt Barkley started a team-high six games. He wasn't even with the Bears in camp last year.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Time_Period", "wgt": 100, "id": 286, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Time Period"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Camping", "wgt": 100, "id": 367, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Camping"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Gay_Men", "wgt": 100, "id": 429, "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Gay Men"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Bearings", "wgt": 100, "id": 516, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Bearings"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft_Toys", "wgt": 100, "id": 518, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft Toys"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Stuffed_Animals", "wgt": 100, "id": 519, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Stuffed Animals"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "wgt": 100, "id": 533, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North_America", "wgt": 100, "id": 534, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North America"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302505", "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302622", "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304976", "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309405", "label": {"eng": "Safety (American and Canadian football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "310130", "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp_(National_Football_League)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "311049", "label": {"eng": "Training camp (National Football League)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "321592", "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "322056", "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "324224", "label": {"eng": "Running back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "342459", "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Sanchez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "343518", "label": {"eng": "Mark Sanchez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_White_(mayor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "355414", "label": {"eng": "Kevin White (mayor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivet_Nazarene_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "361976", "label": {"eng": "Olivet Nazarene University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Glennon", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "368108", "label": {"eng": "Mike Glennon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintin_Demps", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "370414", "label": {"eng": "Quintin Demps"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbonnais", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bourbonnais"}, "type": "loc", "id": "434647"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Jackson_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "483108", "label": {"eng": "Eddie Jackson (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Howard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1271994", "label": {"eng": "Jordan Howard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Langford_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1274889", "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Langford (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deonte_Thompson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "1292539", "label": {"eng": "Deonte Thompson"}}]}

His teammates still love his take-charge attitude -- he makes them run gassers after practice -- but it won't mean much if he can't perform on game day.\n\nThe Bears are saying the right things about their faith in Glennon, who never looked as bad in practice as he did Thursday. Even a pedestrian performance Saturday will slow any Mitch Trubisky momentum.\n\nBears quarterback Mitch Trubisky scrambles during the second half Thursday. (AP)\n\nMitch Trubisky looked ...\n\nWorlds better on Thursday night than at any point in camp.\n\nThe big question is why: Because he had a play script? Because he's better when the lights come on? Because he was playing against third-stringers for most of the second half?\n\nThe Bears need to sort through those variables when determining exactly what they have in the No. 2 overall pick. Saturday's game against the Cardinals is essential in that regard.\n\nDo the Bears have a quarterback controversy?\n\nTrubisky won't win the job unless he's undeniable. He's the boxer that must win by TKO.\n\nIf he's miles better than Glennon again Saturday, then Trubisky be halfway there -- and the Bears will have a controversy.\n\nAlso, in what world is that a bad thing?\n\nThe Bears threw two darts this offseason -- signing Glennon and drafting Trubisky -- on purpose. If Trubisky hits the bulls' eye out of the gate, that's fabulous news for both him and the team.\n\nHe had a good camp ...\n\nThe lightning-quick, 5-6 Tarik Cohen was the most exciting player to watch in camp.\n\nI feared \"Chicken Salad\" might be just another Training Camp MVP -- see Braverman, Daniel -- until he put on a show in the team's first preseason game. If his speed and elusiveness continues to stand out in preseason games, I'll be sold.\n\nHe had a disappointing camp ...\n\nPernell McPhee couldn't pass the Bears' physical on move-in day, was placed on the physically unable to perform list that night and had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee two days later. There's no timetable for the outside linebacker to return; when he does, it's fair to wonder whether the Bears can count on him as more than a role player.\n\nIt's a major disappointment for both McPhee -- who in April touted his conditioning, saying he was \"more sexier\" -- and the team that invested in him with Ryan Pace's first big free agent deal.\n\nI'll be watching ...\n\nTo see how both quarterbacks handle the pressure of the next week. In the modern NFL, nothing else matters.\n\nDid camp change my opinion of the team's future?\n\nI'm a bit more optimistic, in part because they seemed to escape Bourbonnais without a catastrophic injury.

Everybody gets the awkwardness of the situation the Bears created for themselves by moving up to draft Trubisky second overall one month after guaranteeing veteran free-agent Mike Glennon $18.5 million. Trubisky complicated matters Thursday by looking so polished in his NFL debut while Glennon -- with his 0.0 rating -- reminded Chicago he has thrown 11 passes since 2014.\n\nSuggestions here and elsewhere immediately called for Fox to open the quarterback competition, an obvious conclusion in a results-oriented business, which he has yet to do. But if the trend continues Saturday against the Cardinals, it will be fascinating to see how long it takes Fox to embrace an idea he has preferred to evade.\n\nEventually, Fox might realize the chances to keep his job beyond 2017 improve if Trubisky beats out Glennon and becomes the starter. A difference-making quarterback gives overmatched teams a chance to win games they shouldn't. When that quarterback happens to be a rookie, he can change the context of everything in an organization, including scrutiny of a 62-year-old coach with a 9-23 record after two seasons.\n\nMost objective observers viewed this as a make-or-break season for Fox, that another 3-13 or 4-12 disaster likely will seal his fate. But adding Trubisky potentially forces the Bears to apply new math to the Fox equation. A 6-10 season, for example, with Glennon starting 16 games and Trubisky learning whatever backup quarterbacks learn by watching would cry out for a coaching change likely to coincide with Trubisky's promotion in 2018. But a 6-10 season with Trubisky showing flashes under Fox and his staff might allow the coach to complete the final year of his contract when -- lame-duck status or not -- the continuity could benefit the young quarterback. Maybe positive signs despite a 5-11 or 4-12 record would have a similar effect.\n\nBottom line: A losing record that inspires hope because of Trubisky represents the best-case scenario in 2017 for Fox and the Bears, which is why any organizational resistance to the idea of playing the rookie seems odd. For a franchise on its fourth general manager-coach combination since Chairman George McCaskey took over in 2011, the Bears can avoid another coaching search in January if Trubisky shows promise under Fox and offensive coordinator Dowell Loggains. This has been true since the NFL draft but stopped being a moot point after Trubisky looked like a quarterback ahead of schedule.\n\nThe accelerated evolution of Trubisky also would help Loggains' reputation, which needs as much repair as a rear-ended Prius. In two quarters against the Broncos, Loggains reduced the field, called plays to Trubisky's strengths and demonstrated an ability to affect an outcome never obvious during his first year on the job. Postgame, Trubisky referenced Loggains' play sheet as a big reason for his success, evidence of coaching that will mount the more the kid plays.\n\nThis only will devolve into a quarterback controversy if the Bears insist on making it one. Controversy implies disagreement, but if Trubisky emerges as a more skilled, versatile option than Glennon, a consensus will begin to develop -- and so will badly needed enthusiasm. Nobody will stump for Glennon if Trubisky stands out. Players will see it. Commentators will see it. Fans will see it. Yet the Bears have left the impression they would rather stare into the solar eclipse without glasses than see Trubisky beat out Glennon. Why?\n\nIt's contrary to everything we hear about competition determining who plays. This isn't like the Tim Tebow experience Fox referenced; Tebow wasn't a rookie in 2011 when preseason hype followed the celebrity quarterback's first exhibition game, nor did he possess Trubisky's talent at the position. The headlines might have been just as big, but Tebow's future wasn't as bright to the trained eye as Trubisky's.\n\nThe harder the Bears go out of their way to make clear Glennon remains the No. 1 quarterback, the less believable it appears. If Glennon deserves the job, he will make that apparent as the preseason unfolds. Maybe he will but, so far, that hasn't been the case. So far, he has been underwhelming enough for the Bears to consider rethinking their entire offseason plan at the position for the good of everyone involved.\n\nIf Pace worries about an $18.5 million mistake reflecting poorly on his record, he should know hitting on a quarterback in the first round trumps signing the wrong free agent every time. Trubisky arriving at Halas Hall more prepared for the NFL than expected matters much more than throwing bad money at Glennon. A strong training camp by the 2017 draftees -- on the heels of a solid 2016 draft class -- gives Pace the benefit of the doubt if he and Fox together decide to shift gears and play Trubisky sooner rather than later.\n\nTrouble arises only if Fox and Pace envision different scenarios -- and nothing suggests they do. Granted, it is easier to agree in mid-August than it will be next month if Trubisky establishes that he gives the Bears the best chance to win on Sundays.\n\nWhat a wonderful problem that would be for Fox heading into Week 1. Solving it wisely might increase the odds he returns for Year 4.\n\ndhaugh@chicagottribune.com\n\nTwitter @DavidHaugh", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Gay_Men", "wgt": 100, "id": 429, "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Gay Men"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100, "id": 485, "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 100, "id": 487, "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Bearings", "wgt": 100, "id": 516, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Bearings"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft_Toys", "wgt": 100, "id": 518, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft Toys"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Stuffed_Animals", "wgt": 100, "id": 519, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Stuffed Animals"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "type": "loc", "id": "206540"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305439", "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305661", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "308747", "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_Draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309406", "label": {"eng": "National Football League Draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "310476", "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "326592", "label": {"eng": "Solar eclipse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "342459", "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fox_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "361670", "label": {"eng": "John Fox (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Tebow", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "366586", "label": {"eng": "Tim Tebow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Glennon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "368108", "label": {"eng": "Mike Glennon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowell_Loggains", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "415674", "label": {"eng": "Dowell Loggains"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Halas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "446978", "label": {"eng": "George Halas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_McCaskey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "608529", "label": {"eng": "George McCaskey"}}]}

Here are 10 \"things\" to keep in mind as the Bears get ready for their second preseason game:\n\n1. Mark Sanchez should sit out Saturday's game. The veteran backup quarterback returned to practice Wednesday after an ankle bruise cost him three practices over the weekend and a source said he'll be healthy enough to play in Arizona.\n\nBut he shouldn't. And it has nothing to do with the ankle.\n\nSaturday's game should be all about getting Mike Glennon and Mitch Trubisky as many reps as possible. Glennon needs more than the eight passing attempts he received in the first preseason game and Trubisky needs to be tested more -- both by the Cardinals' defense and his own offensive coordinator (more on this in a minute).\n\nBack in the spring, Dowell Loggains admitted it was going to be a challenge to give all the quarterbacks the reps they needed in practice and the preseason. So this should be a no-brainer: Sanchez doesn't need any reps in the second preseason game. He's the most experienced quarterback in the room and already has a good grasp of the offense. Heck, on Sunday he was calling the plays in practice instead of Loggains.\n\nBut doesn't Sanchez need to get comfortable with his receivers? Sure. He can do that in practice. Good backup quarterbacks get paid to come into games cold and continue to move the offense. During the season, backups barely get reps in practice, let alone games, and yet they are counted on to be ready to go when their number is called. Sanchez is already capable of doing that and 10-15 snaps on Saturday night is not going to change anything.\n\nRemember, Matt Barkley wasn't even with the Bears in training camp last year and even he was a competent fill-in despite having a lot less experience than Sanchez.\n\nIf the Bears insist on playing Sanchez Saturday, it should be in the fourth quarter -- after Trubisky -- because the rookie needs to be playing against the Cardinals' second-team and not their third-team.\n\n2. Glennon should play the entire first half and Trubisky the second half. I actually advocated for this strategy in the first preseason game because Glennon needs the reps too. He hasn't played regularly since 2014. He's on a new team. And now, he's coming off a clunker at Soldier Field with the pressure mounting. Typically, starters play the entire first half in the second preseason game anyway. Glennon needs the work and the Bears need a more complete evaluation of their starter.\n\nAs for Trubisky, his debut was great, so now you want to test him more with a slightly greater challenge. The Bears can't control the blitzes and coverages the Cardinals will show Saturday night, but the coaching staff does have some control over which units each quarterback faces. That's why if the Bears insist on playing Sanchez, they should save him for the fourth quarter. Trubisky needs to playing against the Cardinals' second-team and hope Arizona gets a little more exotic than the vanilla defense the Broncos played last week.\n\n\"(The blitzes and pressures are) tougher in practice than it was in the last game just because I don't think in the preseason they wanted to throw a lot at us or show a lot per se,\" Trubisky said. \"But in practice I'm seeing a lot of different blitzes and I think game-planning on a week-to-week basis will help picking up the blitzes and everything.\"\n\nThe Bears will do a little more game-planning this week and Loggains will once again come up with a plan that puts his rookie quarterback in a position to have success and build more confidence. Of course, it also wouldn't hurt to make Trubisky a little uncomfortable and see how he responds. But more than anything, he can't have game reps taken away from him by Sanchez, who has started 72 NFL games.\n\n\"For me, it's how many reps can I get? I need all the reps I can get,\" Trubisky said.\n\n3. So what happens if Glennon struggles again and Trubisky continues to play well? This is by far the most common question I have received this week, but I'm going to ignore the first part of it because my answer is the same no matter how Glennon plays: If Trubisky plays well against the Cardinals then he should get time with the starters in the third preseason game against Tennessee. In that scenario, I would still start Glennon, but I would alternate series, giving both quarterbacks time with the starting offense against the Titans' starting defense.\n\nIn other words, I would make it an actual quarterback competition.\n\nIdeally for the Bears, Glennon will play well Saturday too, but either way, it's important to keep testing the rookie every week. If Trubisky passes a tougher Week 2 test, then Week 3 should be even harder.\n\nAt this point, pretty much everyone realizes it's a matter of when, not if Trubisky becomes the starter. But that \"when\" is a very important question because you don't want to damage the development of any young quarterback. Should it be Week 1 against the Falcons? Should it be 2018?\n\nTo me, the answer isn't all that complicated. Trubisky should start when the answer to both of the following questions is unequivocally \"YES\":\n\nIf the answer to either of those questions is \"no\" then he shouldn't start.\n\nTake a look at what happened last year in Los Angeles. For Jared Goff, the answer to Question 1 was a definite \"NO\" when the regular season began, even though the answer to Question 2 was probably a \"YES.\" By Week 11, the answer to Question 2 became a resounding \"YES\" because of Case Keenum's struggles and the Rams decided to start Goff even though the answer to Question 1 was not an obvious \"YES\" just yet. As a result, Goff took his lumps and now the Rams are hoping his development hasn't taken a hit as a result.\n\nMeanwhile, in New England, you have the exact opposite scenario. Jimmy Garoppolo answered Question 1 with a \"YES\" a long time ago, but they still have Tom Brady, so the answer to Question 2 is an obvious \"NO.\" Thus, Garoppolo has sat on the bench for most of the last three years.\n\nI understand why everyone is eager to make conclusions after one preseason game, but let's see how the rest of August plays out. And as you evaluate each performance, keep those two questions in mind.\n\n4. Don't forget that the players are watching the quarterback situation just as closely as anyone else.\n\n\"You're interested, you're intrigued,\" defensive end Akiem Hicks said during Trubisky's debut last week. \"He's our No. 2 overall pick. We're just as invested as the organization is.\"\n\nTwo questions later, Hicks delivered this notable response: \"I tell you what, the stuff he's doing on the field right now is something that you hopefully look forward to seeing in the regular season and against better competition. He looks really good right now. He's out here ready to play, he's an athlete and I look forward to seeing him compete further.\"\n\nIn other words, the players want to see more too.\n\n5. It was very interesting to watch new Bears kicker Roberto Aguayo get cut by the Buccaneers on Hard Knocks. Bucs general manager Jason Licht took a big risk when he traded up in the second round to draft Aguayo in 2016, but by last Saturday, he was resigned to the outcome, telling head coach Dirk Koetter on the HBO show that \"it's just such a bigger mistake to keep holding on to him.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, it came down to trust. Licht said on Hard Knocks that even if Nick Folk (who was competing with Aguayo) struggled in practice, he could trust him in a game because \"that's just the way he's wired.\"\n\n\"It's the opposite with Roberto,\" Licht told Koetter with the cameras rolling. \"He could make 20 of his last 20 out here and then go to a game and now nobody is confident he is going to make it, even on a f****** extra point.\"\n\nAguayo was understandably crushed, but he tried hard to remain positive.\n\n\"I let you guys down. Let myself down. But it's a matter of keeping your head up and keep pushing,\" he told Licht and Koetter. \"At the end of the day, I just couldn't get it done. But like you said, I know you guys know what I'm capable of. I know deep down what I'm capable of.\"\n\n48 hours later, Aguayo arrived in Bourbonnais for the Bears' last practice at Olivet Nazarene University and I asked him what he thinks his strengths are. His response?\n\n\"Mentally tough. Just with the highs and lows that I've had during my career,\" Aguayo said. \"Stepping up to the plate and no matter what happens, there might be lows, there might be highs, but at the end of the day I'm just excited and ready to go out there and go and compete and go get better.\"\n\nAguayo now has two and a half weeks to prove himself to the Bears before the rosters are cut to 53 players. It seems like an extremely short period of time to earn the trust he failed to gain in Tampa, and it's worth remembering that the Bears cited Connor Barth's reliability under 40 yards when they decided to cut ties with Robbie Gould last year.\n\n\"If you look at (Barth's) track record, especially under 40 yards, he's extremely accurate. And there's a sureness in that that I respect,\" general manager Ryan Pace said after acquiring Barth.\n\nAguayo seems to go against that \"sureness\" but he does have a bigger leg and Fox said they liked him coming out of Florida State last year. In claiming Aguayo, the Bears are on the hook for $428,000 guaranteed this year, which isn't an insignificant gamble. He'll get a fair shot to win the job and his performance in the next three preseason games will likely decide the competition.\n\n6. The Bears have 25 days to get Kyle Long right -- both physically and mentally. The veteran offensive lineman's frustrations hit a breaking point in Monday's practice, which led to multiple fights and an ejection from practice. Long has not been made available to the media since, but having witnessed what happened Monday, it reminded me of a frustrated baseball manager who had enough and was begging to get sent to the locker room.\n\n\"Obviously there was some remorse there,\" Fox said Wednesday. \"He was embarrassed for himself and for the team. Those things happen. Our guys, we've got a bond and he's one of our family and he'll be treated as such, like any kind of thing that happens in a family. Guys adapt and respond and I think everything's fine.\"\n\nBut Fox also addressed the mental hurdles Long is facing right now:\n\n\"I think any time a player's injured, they get something that they love taken away from them. It's been a minute, there's some pain and suffering that goes along with it and I'm sure those are things. But we have a lot of resources here, Kyle knows he's loved here, by his teammates and by everyone in the building. He'll get through it and we talked about that and I think he feels confident in that.\"\n\nLong missed Wednesday's practice, which created speculation that he had been suspended, but Fox said the left guard was seeing a doctor (for his surgically repaired ankle) and would be back Thursday.\n\nSunday, the day before he was ejected from practice, Long admitted he was frustrated with not being able to practice more.\n\n\"I'll tell you, it sucks,\" he said. \"It sucks when you can't be out there every team rep when you're used to running off the field after a team period with the rest of the (first-team) and I'm sitting over there in a hat watching. It sucks. I'm not going to sit here and lie to you. I love the game of football and when it's taken away from you and when you're limited to just practicing against other O-linemen during individual it's tough.\"\n\nPart of the issue here is that Long is in the process of switching to left guard. If he wasn't switching positions, it would be a lot easier to just sit him during the preseason and throw him out there in Week 1. Fox has hinted that Long could miss all four preseason games, but one would think they would want to get him some live action at left guard if possible.\n\n\"I feel a little awkward, like, just having my feet under me and the timing of certain plays,\" Long admitted. \"You know, subtle techniques that wouldn't look any different to you guys, but to me it's a radical change. I just have to hone in on the details.\"\n\n7. One injured player who did get back on the practice field Wednesday was running back Jeremy Langford, who had been out since rolling his ankle -- the same one that was surgically repaired in the offseason -- in an evening walk-through on July 27.\n\n\"I guess I kind of was just worried about it too much and slipped and it got caught underneath me and I sprained it,\" Langford said.\n\nFortunately, the injury wasn't as bad as the one that limited him to just 62 carries and cost him his starting job in 2016, but it did put him behind in what is a deep running back room.\n\n\"I think my main thing is getting back to 100 percent and being the player that I am and can be, and the rest will take care of itself,\" Langford said.\n\nThe Bears' running back situation has gotten more interesting with the addition of rookie Tarik Cohen, but I don't think Cohen's presence will have much impact on Langford, other than him being another body on the 53-man roster. Langford projects more as a true backup running back, while Cohen is a specialty back who will be worked into the offense. In other words, Langford is competing more with Ka'Deem Carey and Bennie Cunningham, both of whom have special teams value.\n\nI don't think Langford can feel completely safe, but I would still consider him the favorite to be Jordan Howard's backup. Let's not forget that this regime let Matt Forte go and anointed Langford the starter last year. On the other hand, they also made a run at C.J. Anderson during the 2016 offseason and then drafted Howard, so that says something too.\n\nWe'll once again end this week's 10 Bears Things with three players to watch closely in Saturday's preseason game against the Cardinals (other than Glennon and Trubisky):\n\n8. WR Kevin White\n\nI've used the word \"concerning\" to describe White's training camp and that certainly didn't change after he failed to receive a single target in the preseason opener against the Broncos. Granted, he didn't play a whole lot, but one would think that will change Saturday night. Glennon seems to favor Cam Meredith as a target (which is fine), but he and White need to start hooking up more. I wouldn't mind seeing White get some playing time with Trubisky, just to see if anything changes.\n\n9. CB Kyle Fuller\n\nI hate listing two of the same players as last week, but Prince Amukamara's hamstring injury has opened up a bigger opportunity for Fuller, who should play a lot against the Cardinals' starters Saturday. I don't think it would be an exaggeration to call this the biggest game of his career. He's still fighting for a roster spot and needs to play well.\n\n10. C Hroniss Grasu\n\nGrasu's roster spot seems more secure after Eric Kush was lost for the season with a torn hamstring, but I'm still intrigued to see if Grasu can help at guard, where he has received some work in practice. If he can prove to be more versatile, he'll greatly increase his value. If not, the Bears might have to consider moving Cody Whitehair to guard in the event that either Kyle Long or Josh Sitton went down. Considering Whitehair looks like he could be the Bears starting center for a long, long time, keeping him in the middle would be ideal. Let's see if Grasu gets any work at left guard in Arizona.\n\nBonus Thing: If you haven't already, make sure you check out the latest episode of The Hoge & Jahns Podcast.

It seems like there are a lot of bodies at WR they could take. Some with more special teams value too. -- @lstanczyk27\n\nCruz is unlikely to offer much value on special teams and I would not say he is a slam dunk to make the roster. The Bears guaranteed Cruz only $500,000 in the form of a signing bonus in a one-year contract that has a base value of $2 million with the opportunity to earn up to an additional $2 million in incentives. Cruz was on the field for the final play of the preseason opener against the Broncos and that means he's clearly not with the first unit at this point. Had Daniel Braverman been healthy and in uniform, I kind of think Cruz would have been out by then but the point is he is clearly second behind Kendall Wright (guaranteed $1 million in his one-year contract) right now on the depth chart. Cruz still has to perform well in order to secure his spot. He's experienced but my hunch is he's no longer the dynamic performer he was for the Giants before injuries.\n\nIf Mitch Trubisky continues to outplay Mike Glennon in practice and in the last three preseason games, is there any chance he starts Week 1? -- @Chris_Krapek\n\nOne thing you cannot overlook is the fact that the entire starting offense struggled against the Broncos last week. It wasn't just Glennon who performed poorly. The offensive line and wide receivers didn't do a particularly good job either. I wouldn't rule out the possibility Trubisky starts in Week 1 against the Falcons on Sept. 10, but I'd consider Glennon to be the strong favorite based on everything the Bears continue to say. Could that change in the next two weeks after preseason games against the Cardinals and Titans? Sure. The Eagles switched to No. 2 overall pick Carson Wentz just before the season started a year ago after they traded Sam Bradford to the Vikings. The Bears don't figure to be dealingGlennon before the season begins. We need to see howGlennon (and the starting offense) performs before we can jump to conclusions with an assumption the Bears will pull the plug on the veteran and go with the rookie.\n\nWhy would we pick up Roberto Aguayo's contract off waivers? Why not let him clear? Was he going to be in demand? -- @Traderjoeyg\n\nThat's a good question. I was told by an NFL source the Bears were the only team to place a claim for Aguayo. I think the Bears want to see what he can do. Does a new environment where he doesn't have the pressures that were in Tampa Bay help him regain the accuracy he had in college? The Bears obviously claimed him because they were concerned another team would place a claim or Aguayo would choose to sign elsewhere if he cleared waivers. I can't imagine he would have been in high demand but there's no question, based on his performance at Florida State, that teams would have wanted to get a look at him. It will be interesting to see how things shake out for him in the coming weeks. My initial take was Connor Barth has the upper hand and that's still my hunch.\n\nWith Rueben Randle placed on IR, does this give Tanner Gentry a chance to earn more playing time and make the 53 man roster? -- @Greatnxss\n\nGentry is going to have to clear more hurdles than Randle to make the 53-man roster. The undrafted rookie free agent from Wyoming performed well in Bourbonnais and has a few more weeks to really make his mark and state a case for the Bears to keep him on the 53-man roster. I viewed Randle as a longshot to make the team so getting ahead of him isn't a big enough accomplishment for Gentry to feel secure just yet. It's a long road for undrafted rookies to push for a roster spot. It's fair to say Gentry is off to a solid start.\n\nHave the Bears handled Glennon-Trubisky appropriately? Since draft night if I'm Glennon I'm asking, \"Why did I sign?\" -- @orgullodemxico\n\nThere are plenty of reasons Glennon signed. The Bears guaranteed him $18.5 million and that's far more money than he was going to get anywhere else. He also was told he was being signed to be the starter, which he remains right now. The addition of Trubisky after a trade up to the No. 2 selection in the draft was no doubt a huge surprise to Glennon, but he surely knew they would be adding a young passer at some point in the draft. It is what it is for Glennon and when his time at Halas Hall is over, he'll be set up for life financially. How long he remains on the field as the starter depends in large part on how he performs. I don't know how many better situations there truly were for him when free agency opened in March.\n\nWho has been the star of training camp? - Terry L., Des Moines, Iowa\n\nThe Bears had a good number of bright spots in camp during the stay at Olivet Nazarene University and the one player that stood out to me was Leonard Floyd. That's a good thing when the first-round draft pick from the previous year excels at the start of Year 2, a very good thing that bodes well for a defense desperately in need of a star. Floyd showed up about 15 pounds heavier than he was last year and he stayed on the field. Remember, Floyd dealt with the flu at the start of camp last summer, he had some heat-related issues and then he banged up his shoulder. The result was he spent a lot of his rookie training camp standing on the sideline. Floyd participated in every practice in Bourbonnais and you got a glimpse at his freakish ability in the preseason opener when he came screaming around the left side for a sack. If he can become a consistent and dominant presence, the Bears are really going to have something to build around moving forward.\n\nSeen or heard of any special teams performances that may lead to the Bears finally cutting Josh Bellamy and Deonte Thompson? -- @joemoscone77\n\nBellamy gets deserved criticism for his shaky hands as a wide receiver but he's a pretty good special teams player and I don't know if the Bears have many better than him. He still adds value to the roster for what he can do as a core special teams performer. You just don't want to see him playing often as a wide receiver. I've thought the Bears could use an upgrade over Thompson but he had a nice return in the preseason opener against the Broncos and the struggles of the kickoff return team last season were on the entire unit, not just him. We'll see how that group shakes out in the coming weeks but I expect Bellamy to likely make the 53-man roster. Thompson's status is more iffy from my viewpoint.\n\nI have one more Jay Cutler question. Your last one, right? It is my understanding that Cutler was paid through Aug. 31 and the Bears didn't owe him any more money until Sept. 1. Why did they not keep him on the roster through training camp in case of an injury to a playoff team like the Dolphins? Last year Philly got a first-round pick from Minnesota for Sam Bradford in the same situation. -- David D., Lubbock, Texas\n\nThat's a fair question, but you have to consider that the Bears wanted to make a clean break from Cutler after last season. The contract he had didn't guarantee him any money until Week 1 of the regular season. He was due to have a base salary of $12.5 million with the opportunity to earn an additional $2.5 million in per-game roster bonuses ($156,250 per week he was on the 46-man gameday roster). Had the Bears released Cutler after the Tuesday before the first game, he could have claimed termination pay, which would have put the Bears on the hook for that $12.5 million base salary. But the Bears preferred to chart a new course without Cutler at the outset of the offseason and after eight seasons, that was understandable and overdue, in my opinion. The Bears had moved on from Cutler well before they made the transaction to terminate his contract in the offseason. They weren't going to go down that road again and go through the motions with him in the hope they could find a trade partner in July or August that was suddenly desperate because of injury. Plus, it wouldn't have been fair to Cutler to hold on to him up until the start of the regular season with no intent of keeping him.\n\nWith Markus Wheaton's latest injury setback, I've been reflecting on how few bona fide wins Ryan Pace has enjoyed in free agency. For every Akiem Hicks there is a litany of Antrel Rolles, Eddie Royals and Pernell McPhees. Mike Glennon might have the hottest seat in the NFL right now and there's little doubt Alshon Jeffery would still be the WR1 on this roster. Now there's this Roberto Aguayo business. Is this merely attrition/bad luck or a legitimate blind spot for the young GM? -- David D., Rogers Park\n\nI've always said that free agency is no place to build a foundation for a franchise. It can be a nice place to plug a hole here or there or add a little depth but you're not going to successfully build a 53-man roster via free agency. Now, the Bears have had so many roster needs that they've been forced for many years now to be far more active in free agency than they would otherwise like to be. Hicks was an excellent signing for the Bears last season and now could be in line for a contract extension. Linebackers Danny Trevathan and Jerrell Freeman were decent additions when you consider the cost and that they play inside linebacker in a 3-4 scheme, not the greatest of impact positions. Rolle didn't work out and it turned out he didn't have much tread left on the tires. Fortunately, that wasn't a great expense. Royal was a poor signing, in my opinion. The Bears had to know McPhee had knee issues when they brought him on board and is often the case in free agency, players with injuries in their past have durability issues. We'll see how right tackle Bobby Massie, another player who received solid money in free agency, plays this season after a rocky start to 2016. It's further evidence that the biggest winners in free agency aren't always winning when it comes to January. In the Bears' case, they haven't been able to get to January. It's a buyer beware world in free agency. As far as Jeffery, he didn't have a lot of personal interest in returning to the Bears so it's difficult to place blame on Pace for his departure. Had the Bears topped other offers by a wide margin I suppose it's possible he's still with them, but that's rarely prudent. Keep in mind also that free agency is a two-way street.\n\nHeard Kyle Fuller trade rumors. What's the benefit presuming bears only get a late rounder? Isn't he decent injury insurance at CB with upside? -- @KMGreen6\n\nI'd be very surprised if the Bears could get anything more than a late-round pick or conditional pick in exchange for Fuller. He'd be decent insurance for the Bears if they believe he's playing at a solid level. Fuller has had his moments - good and bad - throughout the summer. He needs to play well in preseason. The Bears could certainly use some depth after Prince Amukamara left practice Monday in Bourbonnais with a right hamstring injury. It's not known how serious the injury is but Marcus Cooper had an iffy hamstring in the spring and the Bears were cautious with him when training camp opened. I'm not sure how much upside Fuller offers right now and we'll see what the team thinks about him in a few weeks. Remember, this front office and coaching staff did not bring him in and he's no longer considered a first-round talent.\n\nIs Daniel Braverman going to be cut? I haven't heard much of him this year and I really liked him but it seems people like Tanner Gentry more -- @TommyGlodo\n\nBraverman faces a considerable uphill battle to make the 53-man roster and that was the case before he suffered a quad injury in training camp. I think Braverman and Gentry are a little different. Braverman, in my opinion, has to play in the slot to be most effective. Gentry can play on the outside. The Bears have more experienced and better slot options in veterans Kendall Wright and Victor Cruz. Braverman, a seventh-round pick in 2016, really did not show a lot in training camp and preseason last year. He could potentially stick around on the practice squad but I doubt he makes the 53-man roster and there are other younger receivers who have made more of an impact this summer, including Titus Davis.\n\nWe have always heard that the GM is in charge of the roster and the head coach is in charge of who plays. Same rules apply for Mitch Trubisky? -- @1bcwheeler\n\nThere's no question that Ryan Pace has control of the 90- and 53-man rosters and coach John Fox has control of the depth chart and decisions in terms of personnel usage. That's always been the case in the current regime and although it remains that way, I would imagine Fox would at least consult with Pace on significant moves of that nature. You're correct, ultimately it is Fox's call on who is playing quarterback for the Bears this season.\n\nHow has Adam Shaheen looked so far? Any chance he supplants Dion Sims or Zach Miller as the starting TE sometime this year? -- @AbramBook1\n\nShaheen has gotten plenty of opportunities and seems to be adjusting nicely with the jump from Division II to the NFL. I'm not sure I would be rooting for him to supplant Sims right away. Keep in mind the Bears made a significant investment in Sims in free agency, signing him to a three-year, $18 million contract with $10 million guaranteed. The only free agent signed to more guaranteed money by the club was Glennon. Sims has plenty of NFL experience and will be a better run and pass blocker from the start. Shaheen is expected to develop well in those areas. Miller figures to be more involved in the passing game but his presence could take playing time away from Shaheen and Daniel Brown and that is a factor to keep a close eye on in the coming weeks. I expect Shaheen to receive ample playing time as a rookie.\n\nHaven't heard much about Jordan Howard. How does he look in training camp? -- @micsportstalk\n\nHoward has looked just fine in training camp and should be the most consistent performer on the offense this season. I don't know that he will top his impressive rookie season of 1,313 yards, but the Bears are going to ride Howard as far as he can take them this season. You probably have not heard a ton about Howard because, as you know, there is an appropriate spotlight on the quarterback position after eight seasons of Jay Cutler. The Bears don't do anything live in training camp, either, so it's a little difficult to get a really clear picture of the ground game. Howard is in excellent shape and will be ready to roll Sept. 10 against the Falcons.\n\nCould Deon Bush be the overlooked man in the safety race? -- @BearsEst1920\n\nBush has gotten looks with the first team this summer and certainly he's in the mix. He was underwhelming, in my opinion, when given a starting opportunity as a rookie last season. Bush doesn't have high level instincts in my opinion. I think there is a better chance veteran Adrian Amos or rookie Eddie Jackson start opposite Quintin Demps but maybe Bush shows up in the remaining preseason games and can push for action. This position could very well be one in need of an upgrade at the end of the season. But if the Bears are better on the front end, they can cover up some things on the back end.\n\nWould it have been cheaper to keep Robbie Gould? -- @garcia4cjie\n\nNo. Whatever direction the Bears choose for their kicker this season (Connor Barth, Roberto Aguayo or a player not currently on the roster) will be significantly cheaper than Gould would have been. When the Bears released Gould before Week 1 last season, he had two years and $7 million remaining on the four-year, $15 million extension he signed with the club at the end of the 2013 season. The Bears owed Gould $3 million in base salary in 2016 and 2017 and a $500,000 roster bonus each season. At the time Gould signed the extension, he had the second-highest average salary for a kicker in the NFL, trailing only Sebastian Janikowski of the Raiders. Barth's deal for this season totals $980,000 and if the Bears keep Aguayo, he will earn $634,208. The Bears are carrying a salary cap charge of $600,000 for Gould this season, pro-rated from bonus money he was paid in the old contract.\n\nWhat was the point in claiming Roberto Aguayo from Tampa? Are they trying to push Connor Barth with competition but not trying to push Mike Glennon with one? -- @Swotell\n\nThe Bears added Aguayo to the mix to see what he can do and put a little pressure on Barth. Aguayo was extremely successful at Florida State before he flopped last year for the Buccaneers. If he suddenly regains his accuracy, he presents a potential option. Barth wound up making all 11 kicks he attempted in practice on Monday and if that continues, he's got nothing to worry about. I maintain that the comfort level the coaching staff has with Barth will make it difficult for a newcomer with a shaky track record in the NFL to unseat the incumbent. You raise a fair point, but despite what the Bears have said about Glennon being the starter, the depth chart on the walls of the second floor at Halas Hall are not written in stone. Those can change and Glennon isn't guaranteed a job without going out and performing. Trubisky is going to play and I expect him to play a long time for the Bears. We'll see how soon that day comes.\n\nKeep hearing that the Bears need Markus Wheaton because they lack a deep threat. Why wouldn't Kevin White who runs a 4.3 be a deep threat? -- @roybal5598\n\nWhite set the scouting combine on fire before the Bears drafted him seventh overall in 2015 when he ran in 4.35 seconds. But when you consider the term \"play speed,\" it's clear that White doesn't play that fast. I highly doubt if you lined up White and had him run a 40 right now that he would clock as fast as he did in preparation for the draft. The same can be said about most players, who don't train for the 40 after they are drafted and in the league. White has struggled, in the opinion of scouts I spoke to last season, with crisp route running. There was a notable difference on the field in the season opener last year when you saw Texans rookie wide receiver Will Fuller (who ran a 4.32-second 40 in 2016 at the scouting combine) play very fast. The leg injuries White has suffered could make him a somewhat different player. He didn't show up in the preseason opener against the Broncos but the same can be said about the majority of the first team offense. Wheaton was a speed merchant coming out of Oregon State and his NFL production with the Steelers backed that up as he has averaged 14.1 yards per reception, including 17.0 in 2015 (44 receptions for 749 yards). Let's see what White can do this season. Maybe he possesses the speed and route running to consistently make plays downfield. Like I've said in previous mailbags, we're not going to be able to make a judgment on what White is and is not based on what he does in training camp and preseason. Let's see how he produces when it counts.\n\nI thought both Jonathan Bullard and Mitch Unrein looked good in limited action. Jaye Howard is still rehabbing but has huge upside and Akiem Hicks is entrenched as a starter. Roy Robertson-Harris has been hurt so I'm going to assume he's not in the immediate plans. Two questions: How many DL do you see making the 53-man roster? And can you see a scenario where four DEs make the final roster? My thinking is Hicks can play the nose in a pinch if Eddie Goldman goes down. He did last year a bit if I remember correctly. -- Jesse G., San Diego\n\nWell, I think four defensive linemen are close to locks for the final roster right now and those are Hicks, Goldman, Bullard and Unrein. The hip issue for Howard is a little concerning and is worth keeping an eye on. Howard was shut down midway through last season by the Chiefs. He had offseason surgery to remove bone spurs and coach John Fox revealed on Sunday that Howard was out after receiving an injection. If he can work through the hip issue and improve health-wise, I think he's got upside to help the Bears. I don't know that I would term it as \"huge\" upside as you did, but we'll wait and see. Robertson-Harris is an interesting player but he's out with a concussion now and as you know he missed all last season. He's probably facing an uphill battle at this point. C.J. Wilson is a veteran that the team has brought in on multiple occasions. He's got a little flexibility inside and could very well find himself in the mix. John Jenkins is a reclamation project on a minimum-salary benefit deal and he can fill in at the nose but I'm not sure that he's really flashed this summer. The Bears will keep at least five defensive linemen and if they go with that number you'll be looking at probably two on the practice squad. They could also go with six.\n\nA third-string quarterback outshines a third-string defense and everyone wants him to start. Why are fans so quick to jump on the bandwagon? -- @therealdp80\n\nIt's pretty simple. Trubisky offers Bears fans legitimate hope that the franchise could turn around with a quarterback poised to lead it for the next decade or so. Is Trubisky going to pan out? I don't know. Anyone that tells you they know with certainty is only kidding themselves. Plenty of quarterbacks taken near the very top of the draft ultimately wind up disappointing. But Trubisky is accurate and he's mobile. The first trait is very difficult to coach and the second is impossible to coach. NFL teams are almost always spinning their wheels if they don't have a legitimate franchise quarterback. The margin for error for clubs without an elite passer is razor thin and those clubs struggle to sustain a real Super Bowl threat. Look at the 2006 Bears. They got close, real close and the core of that team never returned to the same stage. The struggle to find a quarterback is decades old for the Bears and their fans. Have some hope.\n\nWill the Bears be back in Bourbonnais again in 2018? The trend seems to be for teams to not go away for training camp and I enjoy making the annual trek to see the Beloved. - Mark S., Schaumburg\n\nYou're right about that trend and you can add another team to the mix of those staying at home for camp next summer as the Vikings will keep their summer operation at their new facility in Eagan, which is scheduled to open in March or April and is supposed to be dynamite. That ends a 52-year run for the Vikings in Mankato, a fun little town, on the campus of Minnesota State University. I saw a terrific Pat Benatar concert there during a camp visit a few summers ago and just missed her on my visit earlier this month. The good news is I am told, yes, the Bears will be back in Bourbonnais in 2018. That's the plan right now anyway.\n\nbmbiggs@chicagotribune.com\n\nTwitter @BradBiggs", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "type": "loc", "id": "199444"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305661", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309400", "label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "310130", "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "310476", "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placekicker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "311350", "label": {"eng": "Placekicker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions#Special_teams", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "322846", "label": {"eng": "Special teams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "329201", "label": {"eng": "Practice squad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "342459", "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bradford", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "345703", "label": {"eng": "Sam Bradford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Cutler_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "355416", "label": {"eng": "Jay Cutler (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_Wright", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "367609", "label": {"eng": "Kendall Wright"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Glennon", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "368108", "label": {"eng": "Mike Glennon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Cruz_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "374430", "label": {"eng": "Victor Cruz (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Aguayo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "380387", "label": {"eng": "Roberto Aguayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Scouting_Combine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "384523", "label": {"eng": "NFL Scouting Combine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markus_Wheaton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "432256", "label": {"eng": "Markus Wheaton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_Barth", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "502800", "label": {"eng": "Connor Barth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Pace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1273081", "label": {"eng": "Ryan Pace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akiem_Hicks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "1274884", "label": {"eng": "Akiem Hicks"}}]}

Woof! Woof!\n\nTrubisky has made the Chicago Bears relevant again, or at least a curiosity. Being debated not just locally but on national shoutfests is whether he is all hype or legitimate hope.\n\nThis Prospect practice is big stuff. One suspicion is that the World Series-champion Cubs scheduled a day game for to avoid competing head-on for attention with the Bears' rookie quarterback.\n\nSeriously, wherever Trubisky goes this week, he's a walking, talking, throwing, rolling out, rocking on legend.\n\nMike Glennon, the Bears' so-called starting quarterback, is about as popular as a soda tax; Trubisky, the Bears' QB of the future, is about as popular as a rock star.\n\nThe clamor is escalating toward a cacophony that Trubisky should be ordained the Bears' starting quarterback.\n\nMaybe Trubisky should be. Then again, maybe everyone should relax and let the situation sort itself out the next few weeks.\n\nThe discussion rages after one preseason game in which Glennon played a couple of discouraging series and Trubisky played little more than a couple of encouraging quarters.\n\nThat's all it takes in this town for a young quarterback to inspire visions of Bowls, both Pro and Super.\n\nFans at Prospect will be able to scan the field for glimpses of a currently third-string quarterback with a strong arm, nimble feet and accurate passes.\n\nBoys will want to be Trubisky. Girls will want to marry him. Adults will want to go \"Tru-u-u-u!\" instead of \"b-o-o-o-o!\"\n\nTru-u-u-u-bisky will have ample time later to validate himself as the tru-u-u-u-th. For now, those two-plus quarters against a collection of Broncos future Uber drivers were enough to stir fans' imagination.\n\nRemember, this team went 3-13 in 2016 and has very few veterans whose names you'd be proud to wear on the back of your Bears shirt.\n\nA good guess is that \"T-R-U-B-I-S-K-Y\" jerseys outsold all other team merchandise combined this week.\n\nIt should be pointed out that Trubisky's debut was the most promising for the Bears since -- yikes! -- Jay Cutler's in 2009.\n\nDuring Cutler's first preseason game as a Bear in Soldier Field he flashed an even stronger arm than Trubisky's, at least as much mobility and overall remarkable physical talent.\n\nI looked down from the press box that night, gasped and bought everything that Cutler was selling.\n\nEight years later Cutler retired, then left retirement for the Dolphins and the opportunity to prove down there that he is more than the disappointment he was up here.\n\nTrubisky already demonstrates some of the intangibles Cutler lacked, making it easy to be excited about the Bears' future of a franchise that hasn't had a superstar quarterback since the 1940s.\n\nAny fresh face is enough to make the faithful believe he is everything they crave in a QB.\n\nSo Thursday night in Mount Prospect a rookie named Mitch Trubisky's presence will be as exciting as a Super Bowl trophy to be won later.\n\nOh, one last thing: \"Tru-u-u-u-u-u-u-u -- u!\"", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply", "wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 136, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hunting", "wgt": 100, "id": 387, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hunting"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Gay_Men", "wgt": 100, "id": 429, "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Gay Men"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Bearings", "wgt": 100, "id": 516, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Bearings"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft_Toys", "wgt": 100, "id": 518, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft Toys"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Stuffed_Animals", "wgt": 100, "id": 519, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Stuffed Animals"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "type": "loc", "id": "206540"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mount Prospect"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Prospect,_Illinois", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mount Prospect"}, "type": "loc", "id": "207374"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302552", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310538", "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_preseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "314202", "label": {"eng": "National Football League preseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "322056", "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soda_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "326617", "label": {"eng": "Soda tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thursday_Night_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "330672", "label": {"eng": "Thursday Night Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "342459", "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Cutler_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "355416", "label": {"eng": "Jay Cutler (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Glennon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "368108", "label": {"eng": "Mike Glennon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "368361", "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woof!", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "678022", "label": {"eng": "Woof!"}}]}

I've still got a lot of work to do. I was pleased with how I played, but plenty more mistakes are going on during practice for me that I need to work on and continue to improve in my game and make sure when I go out there that I'm doing my job to help other people do their job.\n\n\"I think it just showed me that I'm making progress, that I could go out there and lead and do my job like I wanted to show. But it was just a small sample. It was the first game, and you've just got to continue to be consistent in reproducing it. That's why we're out here working and practicing.\"\n\nPractice is where Trubisky can identify the majority of his flaws. Trubisky had no trouble with the vanilla scheme of Denver's second-string defense last week. But on the practice field, Trubisky often is shown looks he's never seen before.\n\n\"[At practice], I've been taking the wrong drop a couple times, [and I'm working on] getting the correct Mike [linebacker call] down so we have it blocked correctly,\" Trubisky said. \"[I'm working on] just being more efficient. The game was actually pretty clean; it's more in practice.\"\n\nSaturday's game against the Cardinals is an even bigger test for Trubisky, who is expected to play sometime after the Bears pull starter Mike Glennon.\n\nArizona coach Bruce Arians won't be bashful about showing stuff in the preseason. Don't be surprised to see the Cardinals go after Trubisky, who's working on blitz recognition in practice but didn't face much extra pressure in the Broncos game.\n\n\"I'm picking it up,\" he said. \"It's tougher in practice than it was in the last game just because I don't think in the preseason they wanted to throw a lot at us or show a lot, per se. But in practice I'm seeing a lot of different blitzes, and I think game-planning on a week-to-week basis will help in picking up the blitzes and everything.\n\n\"But I'm doing a lot better job with the protection and getting it set, helping out my backs, making sure they're either in protection or I'm getting them out in a route to help in the progression of the play. It's all about getting set and getting the protection, so I feel like I'm doing a lot better job of that.\"", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "wgt": 100, "id": 52, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "wgt": 100, "id": 134, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "wgt": 100, "id": 135, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 136, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 137, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "wgt": 100, "id": 205, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 100, "id": 206, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "type": "loc", "id": "206540"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "type": "loc", "id": "207040"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lake Forest"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Forest,_Illinois", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lake Forest"}, "type": "loc", "id": "207130"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "type": "loc", "id": "230018"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302611", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "311933", "label": {"eng": "Vanilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitz_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "340145", "label": {"eng": "Blitz (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "342459", "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Arians", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "357380", "label": {"eng": "Bruce Arians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Glennon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "368108", "label": {"eng": "Mike Glennon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "368361", "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}]}

He worked against a basic defense, against some defenders who no doubt will be starting careers in different fields once cutdown day arrives.\n\nBut so what? No matter the opponent, if you complete 18 of 25 passes for 166 yards with no interceptions and lead three scoring drives in your first NFL game, that's sweet.\n\nHoorah for general manager Ryan Pace, who traded up to get Trubisky with the second pick of the draft. Yay for quarterbacks coach Dave Ragone, who has taught Trubisky how to improve. Boola-boola for the Bears' no-name receivers and offensive line, who allowed Trubisky to shine.\n\nNow make Trubisky the starting quarterback.\n\nYes, he's only 22 and started only 13 college games at North Carolina. And the NFL is mean and vicious and eats its young.\n\nAgain, so what? Life is hard and then you die. Maybe you've heard.\n\nTrubisky ran a 4.67-second 40-yard dash at the NFL combine -- the same as athletic Clemson quarterback Deshaun Watson -- and his feet never will be faster than they are now. His arm is a cannon.\n\nSure, he'll make rookie mistakes. But veterans make veteran mistakes. That's what the NFL is all about -- taking advantage of the other team's mistakes.\n\nSo if Trubisky gets beaten up early, is that not better than getting beaten up late?\n\nEveryone is terrified of starting rookie quarterbacks, as though it's on par with tossing a bunny rabbit into a python exhibit. Yeah, sometimes the rookie gets squashed.\n\nBut I randomly will bring up Dan Marino, Peyton Manning, Andrew Luck, Cam Newton and Dak Prescott, all rookies who had great first NFL seasons. I could bring up others, but you get the point.\n\nIf Trubisky is the real deal, what are we waiting for?\n\nThe NFL isn't like Major League Baseball, where it's fashionable to basically shut down your team for several years, twiddle your thumbs, wheel and deal and tell your fans to hold on because one of these days your team will be -- ta-da -- rebuilt!\n\nNFL teams can go from the bottom to the top in one year. It happens all the time. Examples: The Colts went from 3-13 in 1998 to 13-3 in 1999. The Rams went from 4-12 in 1998 to 13-3 in 1999 and won the Super Bowl.\n\nWant something more recent? The Colts went from 2-14 in 2011 to 11-5 in 2012. The Chiefs went from 2-14 in 2012 to 11-5 in 2013. And so on.\n\nI've heard the Aaron Rodgers cautionary tale a million times: Let your future Hall of Fame quarterback sit for years behind your future Hall of Fame starter (Brett Favre) and have the kid learn the nuances of the game from the master. Right. And Mike Glennon is a Hall of Famer?\n\nNo, if the worried people had their way, Trubisky would sit this season and stay healthy. And he'd get antsy and frustrated and, I'm thinking, freak out when a media creature got him to admit he hates gathering butt splinters and is homicidal with pent-up ''Put me in, Coach'' frustration.\n\nFor those who loathe quarterback controversies, there you have it.\n\nBears coach John Fox is on the plank of a pirate ship with the clock ticking and the ocean beckoning. He can't preside over another terrible season, such as the 3-13 atrocity in 2016, and expect to stay afloat.\n\nHe likely is the one who assured Glennon that he could say, ''This is my year,'' over and over with confidence. But Fox is also the one who might sink if he sticks with Glennon when everyone knows Trubisky is a better player. (Sanchez is a simply a nice guy with a clipboard.)\n\nYou hate to go back on your word, but the NFL is a cruel, semi-moral business. Players often refer to themselves as hunks of meat or chess pieces moved about randomly. Fox can play Trubisky and see where the chips fall. What's to lose?\n\nIf Trubisky gets hurt, that wouldn't be good. But who doesn't get hurt in the NFL? It's a hurt business. Is it better to see him get injured a year from now, three years from now, 10 years from now?\n\nLet this preseason roll along and then do the right thing.\n\nPlay the kid.\n\nJust do it.\n\nFollow me on Twitter @ricktelander.\n\nEmail: rtelander@suntimes.com", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 49, "label": "dmoz/Games"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 138, "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Bearings", "wgt": 100, "id": 516, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Bearings"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft_Toys", "wgt": 100, "id": 518, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft Toys"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Sports", "wgt": 100, "id": 561, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Sports"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303573", "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304976", "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305661", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "308461", "label": {"eng": "Chess"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "308747", "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309225", "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Manning", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "309227", "label": {"eng": "Peyton Manning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_Newton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "309233", "label": {"eng": "Cam Newton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/40-yard_dash", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "311044", "label": {"eng": "40-yard dash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "312087", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Colts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Luck", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "312095", "label": {"eng": "Andrew Luck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Favre", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "337890", "label": {"eng": "Brett Favre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "339018", "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Sanchez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "343518", "label": {"eng": "Mark Sanchez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Marino", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "350344", "label": {"eng": "Dan Marino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fox_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "361670", "label": {"eng": "John Fox (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Glennon", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "368108", "label": {"eng": "Mike Glennon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Scouting_Combine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "384523", "label": {"eng": "NFL Scouting Combine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Ragone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "825241", "label": {"eng": "Dave Ragone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "1269445", "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deshaun_Watson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1269667", "label": {"eng": "Deshaun Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Pace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1273081", "label": {"eng": "Ryan Pace"}}]}

The Broncos won 24-17.\n\nThursday night, for a couple of hours, they'll be the Mount Prospect Bears.\n\nJust like last year they were the Gurnee Bears when they practiced at Warren High School.\n\nThe difference is that Prospect High is the next stop in the rest of Mitch Trubisky's football career.\n\nWoof! Woof! Woof!\n\nTrubisky has made the Chicago Bears relevant again, or at least a curiosity. Being debated not just locally but on national shoutfests is whether he is all hype or legitimate hope.\n\nThis Prospect practice is big stuff. One suspicion is that the World Series-champion Cubs scheduled a day game for to avoid competing head-on for attention with the Bears' rookie quarterback.\n\nSeriously, wherever Trubisky goes this week, he's a walking, talking, throwing, rolling out, rocking on legend.\n\nMike Glennon, the Bears' so-called starting quarterback, is about as popular as a soda tax; Trubisky, the Bears' QB of the future, is about as popular as a rock star.\n\nThe clamor is escalating toward a cacophony that Trubisky should be ordained the Bears' starting quarterback.\n\nMaybe Trubisky should be. Then again, maybe everyone should relax and let the situation sort itself out the next few weeks.\n\nThe discussion rages after one preseason game in which Glennon played a couple of discouraging series and Trubisky played little more than a couple of encouraging quarters.\n\nThat's all it takes in this town for a young quarterback to inspire visions of Bowls, both Pro and Super.\n\nFans at Prospect will be able to scan the field for glimpses of a currently third-string quarterback with a strong arm, nimble feet and accurate passes.\n\nBoys will want to be Trubisky. Girls will want to marry him. Adults will want to go \"Tru-u-u-u!\" instead of \"b-o-o-o-o!\"\n\nTru-u-u-u-bisky will have ample time later to validate himself as the tru-u-u-u-th. For now, those two-plus quarters against a collection of Broncos future Uber drivers were enough to stir fans' imagination.\n\nRemember, this team went 3-13 in 2016 and has very few veterans whose names you'd be proud to wear on the back of your Bears shirt.\n\nA good guess is that \"T-R-U-B-I-S-K-Y\" jerseys outsold all other team merchandise combined this week.\n\nIt should be pointed out that Trubisky's debut was the most promising for the Bears since -- yikes! -- Jay Cutler's in 2009.\n\nDuring Cutler's first preseason game as a Bear in Soldier Field he flashed an even stronger arm than Trubisky's, at least as much mobility and overall remarkable physical talent.\n\nI looked down from the press box that night, gasped and bought everything that Cutler was selling.\n\nEight years later Cutler retired, then left retirement for the Dolphins and the opportunity to prove down there that he is more than the disappointment he was up here.\n\nTrubisky already demonstrates some of the intangibles Cutler lacked, making it easy to be excited about the Bears' future of a franchise that hasn't had a superstar quarterback since the 1940s.\n\nAny fresh face is enough to make the faithful believe he is everything they crave in a QB.\n\nSo Thursday night in Mount Prospect a rookie named Mitch Trubisky's presence will be as exciting as a Super Bowl trophy to be won later.\n\nOh, one last thing: \"Tru-u-u-u-u-u-u-u -- u!\"\n\nmimrem@dailyherald.com", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply", "wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 136, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hunting", "wgt": 100, "id": 387, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hunting"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Gay_Men", "wgt": 100, "id": 429, "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Gay Men"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Bearings", "wgt": 100, "id": 516, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Bearings"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft_Toys", "wgt": 100, "id": 518, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft Toys"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Stuffed_Animals", "wgt": 100, "id": 519, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Stuffed Animals"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "type": "loc", "id": "206540"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mount Prospect"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Prospect,_Illinois", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mount Prospect"}, "type": "loc", "id": "207374"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302552", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310538", "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_preseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "314202", "label": {"eng": "National Football League preseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "322056", "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soda_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "326617", "label": {"eng": "Soda tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thursday_Night_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "330672", "label": {"eng": "Thursday Night Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "342459", "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Cutler_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "355416", "label": {"eng": "Jay Cutler (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Glennon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "368108", "label": {"eng": "Mike Glennon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "368361", "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woof!", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "678022", "label": {"eng": "Woof!"}}]}

This is going to be a work-in-progress, but the pressure is on to hit the ground running in Week 1.\n\nMitch Trubisky looked ...\n\nUndrafted rookie wide receiver Tanner Gentry (19) makes a great catch of a deep ball from quarterback Mark Sanchez in practice at training camp. (Sun-Times illustration by Patrick Finley)\n\nBetter than advertised. Trubisky's obvious skills are enticing -- the quick release, arm strength, accuracy, mobility and ability to throw on the run. He still has a lot to prove, but his performance in the preseason opener might have been an indication he's closer to being ready than the Bears thought. We'll see.\n\nDo the Bears have a quarterback controversy?\n\nNot yet. Unless the disparity in performance in the preseason opener continues, Mike Glennon will be the Week 1 starter. But all bets are off -- or should be -- once the season starts. Then it's the quarterback who gives them the best chance to win.\n\nHe had a good camp ...\n\nWide receiver Tanner Gentry. The 6-2, 209-pound undrafted rookie from Wyoming has consistently made big plays and is not a one-trick pony. He has caught everything short, middle and deep and has shown a knack for coming up with contested balls at each level. Still have to see it in games, though.\n\nHe had a disappointing camp ...\n\nWide receiver Kevin White. The Bears are doing all they can to pump up the former No. 1 draft pick. Glennon even listed White with Cameron Meredith as the two receivers he has developed a rapport with in camp -- something the eye test doesn't confirm. At this point it remains to be seen if White still has the speed and other skills that made him the No. 7 pick of the 2015 draft. We just don't see it out there.\n\nI'll be watching ...\n\nGuard Kyle Long. He's expected to be ready for Week 1. But it remains to be seen how good he'll be after being so limited in the preseason and how well he'll hold up through the grind of a 16-game season.\n\nDid camp change my opinion of the team's future?\n\nNo. There are way too many unknowns. But first impressions were more good than bad: The defense should be better; the rookie class could provide immediate impact; Trubisky might be a factor sooner than the Bears thought; and while Long, Danny Trevathan, Pernell McPhee are question marks, significant on-the-field injuries were limited. But the bar has yet to be raised for this team -- until further notice, 7-9 would be a good season.\n\nFollow me on Twitter @MarkPotash\n\nEmail: mpotash@suntimes.com", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Time_Period", "wgt": 100, "id": 286, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Time Period"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Camping", "wgt": 100, "id": 367, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Camping"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Bearings", "wgt": 100, "id": 516, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Bearings"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft_Toys", "wgt": 100, "id": 518, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft Toys"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Stuffed_Animals", "wgt": 100, "id": 519, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Stuffed Animals"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "wgt": 100, "id": 533, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North_America", "wgt": 100, "id": 534, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North America"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Special_Needs", "wgt": 100, "id": 535, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Special Needs"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wyoming"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wyoming"}, "type": "loc", "id": "235940"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "310130", "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "342459", "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Long", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "342484", "label": {"eng": "Kyle Long"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Sanchez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "343518", "label": {"eng": "Mark Sanchez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_White_(mayor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "355414", "label": {"eng": "Kevin White (mayor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivet_Nazarene_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "361976", "label": {"eng": "Olivet Nazarene University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Glennon", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "368108", "label": {"eng": "Mike Glennon"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbonnais", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bourbonnais"}, "type": "loc", "id": "434647"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_NFL_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1272379", "label": {"eng": "2015 NFL draft"}}]}

SportsBettingDime.com places 12-to-1 odds that the team makes the playoffs, which is 14th out of 16 NFC teams.

But at 45-to-1, oddsmakers don't predict imminent firing, they have 10 coaches ahead of him as the first coach to be fired. The Jets coach Todd Bowles tops that list (5-to-1), followed by the Lions' Jim Caldwell (6-to-1).\n\nChicago Bears quarterback Mitch Trubisky (center) looks to pass as quarterback Mike Glennon (left) and offensive coordinator Dowell Loggains watch during practice May 23, 2017, in Lake Forest. | Nam Y.

The Bears signed Glennon to start; Pace said as much. But Trubisky's arrival changed everything.\n\nWhen the Browns passed on Trubisky with the first overall selection, Pace was emboldened. At that point, Trubisky became the draft. Pace saw a franchise-changing quarterback, as did many others in the Bears organization. It was a franchise-changing opportunity.\n\nMike Glennon is the Bears' starter. (AP)\n\nGlennon, though, still had a place in Pace's franchise. Pace, who is respected by players for his man-to-man approach, wanted him to know that. The opportunity that was promised to Glennon in free agency still existed.\n\n\"I like a lot of things about Mike Glennon,\" Pace said April 29 after the draft concluded. \"But one of the things I really like is the inner confidence that he has. He's a confident guy. He believes in himself, and he should because he's a good player.\n\n\"I'm glad Mike's here. Mike's our starting quarterback as I've stated. I think any quarterback's just got to be able to brush off adversity and fight through, and that's what Mike will do.\"\n\nAs it turns out, that's what the preseason is now about for Glennon.\n\nSince the draft, Glennon has said and done all the right things. He's taken charge of the Bears -- and his second chance to prove himself as a quarterback.\n\nBut Trubisky's impressive debut and Glennon's woes last week against the Broncos changed the conversation.\n\nIn a way, it's the worst thing that could have happened to Glennon, who has had his struggles in practice. The disparity in play was that great. It opened the conversation for a controversy.\n\nBut Bears hope the Broncos game turns out to be the best thing to happen to Glennon. Trubisky's emergence has turned into a direct challenge of Glennon's \"inner confidence.\" It's really an ideal situation. The Bears needed Glennon's resolve to be tested.\n\nRegardless of how much coach John Fox tries to downplay it, there is now pressure on Glennon to perform. He has to prove them right or risk seeing his starting opportunity slip away into a full-blown quarterback controversy. He needs to reward their faith and defense of him on the field.\n\nGlennon should have been prepared for this situation, too. At some point, Trubisky was going to play well and entrall a downtrodden fanbase in the preseason. The defenses are too bland, his competition too unproven. The onus is on Glennon to produce better than a 0.0 passer rating.\n\n\"I watched the preseason games, but I just avoid the possible distraction of hearing what people may say,\" Glennon said. \"The only thing that matters are the coaches and the players in the locker room, and what they have to say. That's where my focus is.\"\n\nDuring a recent interview with the Hoge & Jahns Podcast, Pace reaffirmed his faith in Glennon - \"Mike's our starter, and we're rolling that way\" - but he also said a \"competitive environment\" exists among the quarterbacks.\n\nTrubisky can be thanked for that, and the Bears believe Glennon will respond because of it Saturday against the Cardinals in their second exhibition game.\n\n\"It'll be good to get out there and play again,\" Glennon said.\n\nThe Bears don't want to rush Trubisky. Pace's redshirt plan still remains in place. One preseason game was never going to change that.\n\nBut if Glennon is going to be the Bears' starter, he needs to play like it. Having intangibles and being a leader matters, but so does production.\n\nGlennon's play is the only factor that will force the Bears' hand on Trubisky. The best players must play. Glennon must prove that this preseason.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 136, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hunting", "wgt": 100, "id": 387, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hunting"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Gay_Men", "wgt": 100, "id": 429, "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Gay Men"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Bearings", "wgt": 100, "id": 516, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Bearings"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft_Toys", "wgt": 100, "id": 518, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft Toys"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Stuffed_Animals", "wgt": 100, "id": 519, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Stuffed Animals"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "310098", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310476", "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshirt_(college_sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "310751", "label": {"eng": "Redshirt (college sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_preseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "314202", "label": {"eng": "National Football League preseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "342459", "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fox_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "361670", "label": {"eng": "John Fox (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Glennon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "368108", "label": {"eng": "Mike Glennon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Halas", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "446978", "label": {"eng": "George Halas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NFL_quarterbacks_who_have_posted_a_passer_rating_of_zero", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1183812", "label": {"eng": "List of NFL quarterbacks who have posted a passer rating of zero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Pace", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1273081", "label": {"eng": "Ryan Pace"}}]}

Marquise Williams was the Tar Heels' starting quarterback in 2015, but Trubisky got in late and had a 35-yard TD run, along with 5-for-7 passing for 37 yards.\n\nCohen had one of his less productive college games, but he still rushed for 69 yards on 15 carries and caught a 20-yard pass. It was enough to impress Trubisky.\n\n\"He's fearless,\" the quarterback said. \"I've always said it's all about heart. You've got a bunch of measureables, but it's all about heart, and that's what he goes out there and plays with.\"\n\nCohen, feigning a faulty memory, says he doesn't remember Trubisky's TD run.\n\n\"They won,\" he said. \"That's all I'm going to say.\"\n\nPlaying time for the two rookies will overlap in Saturday night's second preseason game, which means Trubisky won't have many opportunities to appreciate Cohen's accomplishments.\n\n\"It's tough for me because if I hand it off to him, I want to watch him run, but I've got to carry out my fakes,\" Trubisky said. \"He's a great teammate to have, and what I love about him is he always practices hard. No one is outworking him.\"\n\nLooking ahead:\n\nVeteran inside linebacker Jerrell Freeman sees a bright future for outside linebacker Leonard Floyd, the Bears' 2016 first-round (ninth overall) pick, who had 7 sacks in 12 games as a rookie.\n\n\"Leonard's going to be pretty good for a while,\" Freeman said. \"He can do it all. Of course, you see him pass rush (and) that first step. But having a guy like that in coverage -- he can cover just like anybody else -- is definitely a plus.\n\n\"As an offense, you never know if he's coming (as a pass rusher) or dropping (in coverage). He's a good guy to work with because he's willing to listen. He's being a sponge, and him being the athlete that he is, is a great thing to have on that front line.\"\n\nPlaying it cool:\n\nMitch Trubisky's ability to throw accurately on the run is one of the characteristics that impressed the Bears enough to select him second overall in the draft.\n\nWhen Trubisky takes off, he appears to be moving at full speed, but he never seems out of control.\n\n\"I never try to panic,\" he said. \"You just always try to play cool, calm, collected. I've got the ball in my hand, and I've got to make the defense wrong.\"\n\nTrubisky says he also is conscious of the work being done by his offensive linemen.\n\n\"You don't want them working for you all day,\" he said. \"They're out there sacrificing for you anyway, so it's all about getting the ball out of your hands quickly. When I pull it down, I want to make sure I'm being decisive, taking care of the football and picking up yards. It's all about moving the chains and taking care of the ball.\"\n\nTrubisky says it's more a natural reaction than something he's been coached to do\n\n\"I guess it's kind of innate,\" he said. \"You just do it naturally and you just want to protect the ball.\"\n\n* Follow Bob's Bears reports on Twitter @BobLeGere.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 136, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Gay_Men", "wgt": 100, "id": 429, "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Gay Men"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Bearings", "wgt": 100, "id": 516, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Bearings"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft_Toys", "wgt": 100, "id": 518, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft Toys"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Stuffed_Animals", "wgt": 100, "id": 519, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Stuffed Animals"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "type": "loc", "id": "193144"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "302552", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310743", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "313674", "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "319761", "label": {"eng": "Lineman (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "324223", "label": {"eng": "Rush (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "324224", "label": {"eng": "Running back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "335174", "label": {"eng": "Sponge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker#Types_of_linebackers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "336932", "label": {"eng": "Outside linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker#Middle_linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "380073", "label": {"eng": "Middle linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerrell_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "415681", "label": {"eng": "Jerrell Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_Agricultural_and_Technical_State_University", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "601030", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquise_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1327167", "label": {"eng": "Marquise Williams"}}]}

Trubisky is technically still third on Chicago's quarterback depth chart, but he's applying pressure on starter Mike Glennon. It's only a matter of time before Trubisky wins the job outright, but the Bears are taking it slow.\n\nAdam Shaheen, TE, second round (No. 45): Out of Division II Ashland University, Shaheen excelled in Chicago's offseason program after it drafted him. That success carried over to training camp, where Shaheen's expected to have a sizable role on offense alongside fellow tight ends Dion Sims and Zach Miller. Shaheen's got really good hands for a big guy (6-foot-6). If Shaheen proves he can block, he'll play a lot in the regular season.\n\nEddie Jackson, S, fourth round (No. 112): Jackson is pushing starting free safety Adrian Amos. Jackson had several interceptions early in camp that apparently caught the attention of the coaching staff, because lately, Jackson is getting more first-team reps. There is also hope the Alabama product may help on special teams, where he starred as a returner in college.\n\nTarik Cohen, RB, fourth round (No. 119): Cohen was the fan favorite in Bourbonnais. The Bears plan to use Cohen in a variety of ways as their Joker back. Look for the 5-6 speedster to get the ball in space when the regular season rolls around. The Bears ran Cohen between the tackles in the first preseason game, but that was probably by design. Chicago doesn't want to show their hand with Cohen, who has breakaway speed and moves in the open field.\n\nJordan Morgan, OL, fifth round (No. 147): There hasn't been much discussion about Morgan, even after reserve guard Eric Kush suffered a season-ending torn hamstring. There's also concern about Kyle Long's ankle, making the interior of the offensive line a real question mark.

Trubisky himself, who might be one of the few football-minded critics within 100 miles of Chicago who is tapping the brakes on the outside campaign demanding the Bears name him their starter immediately.\n\nSure, Trubisky acknowledged, his exhibition debut against the Broncos last week felt encouraging. He completed his first 10 passes and led three consecutive scoring drives. He threw for 166 yards and a touchdown and didn't turn the ball over.\n\nHis arm was live. His throws were crisp. His talents on the move were fully evident.\n\n\"The game was actually pretty clean,\" Trubisky said.\n\nBut that was, by Trubisky's own estimation, too small of a snapshot to judge definitively.\n\n\"It showed me that I'm making progress,\" Trubisky said, \"that I could go out there and lead and do my job like I wanted to show. But it was just a small sample.\"\n\nTrubisky's second exhibition appearance -- Saturday night against the Cardinals in Glendale, Ariz. -- will offer another progress report. For now, however, the 22-year-old remains in the third slot on the depth chart, still a ways behind starter Mike Glennon.\n\nGlennon's struggles against the Broncos -- 2-for-8, 20 yards, an interception and a 0.0 rating -- understandably intensified the debate on the quarterback pecking order. But the coaching staff and front office have made it clear they're not going to assess three impressive drives by Trubisky in an exhibition and suddenly alter their vision for his development.\n\nMaybe the feelings within the organization would be much different had Trubisky looked ultra-sharp throughout the 15 practices since training camp opened. But he hasn't.\n\nThe \"wow\" moments have come regularly. But there have also been poor reads and late throws and, on occasion, fumbled snaps coming out from under center. Against more complex coverages and pressures, Trubisky has had struggles.\n\nAnd day after day, he has studied his performances with a full understanding of how much more he needs to learn.\n\nIn a forthright manner Wednesday, Trubisky detailed some of the hiccups he has experienced during practices in recent weeks that the outside world should be aware of. He admitted having difficulty at times identifying the middle linebacker. On occasion, he said, he has taken the wrong dropback.\n\n\"It's just being more efficient,\" he said.\n\nCoach John Fox's initial review of Trubisky's solid play last week seemed to be spot on.\n\n\"It beats the alternative,\" he said. \"I'm sure glad he played well and not poorly.\"\n\nBut Fox also understands that one wipeout-free run down the bunny hill doesn't automatically earn Trubisky a chair lift up to a black-diamond trail. In short, Fox asserted, Trubisky will need time to gain comprehensive and detailed understanding of the playbook.\n\n\"A lot of it is knowing what we do,\" Fox said. \"Primarily, as a rookie quarterback, there is so much they have to know. It's what the O-line is doing. Where the protection is going. And now that affects the routes, so it's adjusting that. Sometimes we give the quarterback leeway to change those things. It's a lot to learn for a young quarterback.\"\n\nTrubisky concurs and remains eager to attack the process as the preseason continues. His final assessment of last week's head-turning showing against the Broncos remained measured.\n\n\"It was the first game,\" Trubisky said. \"You have to continue to be consistent in reproducing it.\"\n\ndwiederer@chicagotribune.com\n\nTwitter @danwiederer", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 49, "label": "dmoz/Games"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 50, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "wgt": 100, "id": 641, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100, "id": 1546, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "type": "loc", "id": "206540"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302552", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302611", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304976", "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305661", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "308747", "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309400", "label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "324226", "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski_resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "340322", "label": {"eng": "Ski resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "342459", "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairlift", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "346030", "label": {"eng": "Chairlift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fox_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "361670", "label": {"eng": "John Fox (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Glennon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "368108", "label": {"eng": "Mike Glennon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Halas", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "446978", "label": {"eng": "George Halas"}}]}

I've still got a lot of work to do. I was pleased with how I played.\n\n\"But plenty more mistakes are going on during practice for me that I need to work on and continue to improve in my game and make sure when I go out there that I'm doing my job to help other people do their job.\"\n\nCoach John Fox was pleased but not surprised by Trubisky's 18-for-25 passing, 166 yards, 1 touchdown and no interceptions. But he agreed there's a long way to go.\n\n\"A lot of it is knowing what we do (as an offense),\" Fox said. \"Obviously, knowing your opponent and what they do comes along with that.\n\n\"But, as a rookie, in particular a quarterback, there is so much they have to know. What the O-line's doing, where the protection is going, and how that affects the routes. Adjusting to that.\n\n\"Sometimes we give the quarterback the leeway to change those things. It's a lot to learn for a young quarterback.\"\n\nTrubisky downplayed his performance but admitted it reaffirmed his belief that he's making progress.\n\n\"It just showed me that I could go out there and lead and do my job like I wanted to,\" he said. \"But it was just a small sample, and you've got to continue to be consistent in reproducing it. That's why we're out here working and practicing.\"\n\nAmong his mistakes, Trubisky listed taking the wrong depth on pass drops a couple of times and not getting the correct middle linebacker pointed out so the play gets blocked correctly. He said he needs to be more efficient, but said, \"The game was actually pretty clean; it's more in practice.\"\n\nTrubisky termed his progress steady, though he has made mistakes. One of his biggest goals is not to repeat the same mistake twice.\n\nFox has yet to indicate playing time for the QBs this week, but it's a given that starter Mike Glennon will play more than last week's 17 minutes.\n\nIt should get more difficult for both quarterbacks this week on the road against Arizona.\n\nThe Cardinals' defense led the NFL in sacks per play last season, and it's known for its variety and frequency of blitzes. The Bears attempt to prepare all their quarterbacks for handling blitzes, but it's difficult to duplicate game-type situations in practice.\n\nStill, Trubisky says he's made progress.\n\n\"I'm picking it up,\" he said. \"It's tougher (this week) in practice than it was in the last game just because I don't think in the preseason (opener), they wanted to throw a lot at us or show a lot.\n\n\"But in practice I'm seeing a lot of different blitzes, and I think game-planning will help picking up the blitzes. I'm doing a lot better job with the protection and getting it set, helping out my backs, making sure they're either in protection or I'm getting them out in a route to help in the progression of the play.\"\n\n*\u2009Follow Bob's Bears reports on Twitter @BobLeGere.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 49, "label": "dmoz/Games"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "wgt": 100, "id": 52, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "wgt": 100, "id": 134, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 136, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 137, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "wgt": 100, "id": 205, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "type": "loc", "id": "231860"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302611", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304976", "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305661", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "308747", "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309400", "label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310743", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_preseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "314202", "label": {"eng": "National Football League preseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_lineup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "316239", "label": {"eng": "Starting lineup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passer_rating", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "325480", "label": {"eng": "Passer rating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitz_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "340145", "label": {"eng": "Blitz (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "342459", "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fox_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "361670", "label": {"eng": "John Fox (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Glennon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "368108", "label": {"eng": "Mike Glennon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Halas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "446978", "label": {"eng": "George Halas"}}]}

Nothing is more temporary than faith that the Bears have found their guy.\n\nChicago's favorite quarterback is always the one who is not playing.\n\nThose who would elevate rookie Mitch Trubisky from whim to savior fail to recognize that being unfailed is a safer credential than being exposed.\n\nAll of this will come soon enough. It will come when it counts, against authentic NFL defenses, when both teams are playing the same game.\n\nFor now, whatever happens is all air guitar and shadow boxing. And goodness knows, the Bears have a grand tradition of great shadow boxers.\n\nEvery new Bears quarterback comes with a chorus, voices raised in praise, songs sung in hope, dirges groaned in goodbyes.\n\nIf misjudgment doesn't get him, injuries will. Alas, we think of Jim McMahon and Super Bowls unreached.\n\nWe think of Rex Grossman and his serendipitous season when he managed to do less harm than good, (the Bears' version of the Hippocratic oath) finding himself in the only other Super Bowl that has included the Bears.\n\nWe think of Eric Kramer, my personal favorite, and Jim Harbaugh, good but better after leaving the Bears, and Kyle Orton, the best rookie quarterback the Bears have ever had.\n\nWe think of the lost decade after Orton under the wobbly hand and perpetual scowl of he who shall not be named. A promise is a promise.\n\nBut mostly we think of Cade McNown, not Ryan Leaf miserable, not Johnny Manziel embarrassing, but the most over-anointed quarterback the Bears have ever wasted time on.\n\n(We do not think of Rick Mirer, and who does? Mirer was a disaster and, in essence, a first-round draft choice sent to Seattle, an example of the Bears assuming another team's errors as their own. We think of Mike Glennon as the Mirer of today.)\n\nMcNown came out of UCLA with honors and reputation and self-assurance, all of the things that must be taken on faith in the case of Trubisky.\n\nTrubisky was quietly trying to add to a slim resume at North Carolina when the Bears were gobsmacked by what is yet to become obvious. Trubisky does look like a quarterback, which is usually good enough for the Bears (Doug Flutie aside).\n\nMcNown was a slam dunk for the Bears, a cover-boy darling who could not miss. This was one of the few times the Bears looked like knew what they were doing.\n\nFull of himself, McNown held out, showed up late, never caught up, never caught on, was gone two years later and out of the league in four. As the richest Bear at the time, never has anyone done so little for so much.\n\nWe do not think of Trubisky as McNown, but we do not think of him as, say, Shane Matthews either. Or that he will ever be as good as the guy he has succeeded.\n\nBut the question is not how good he will be. The question is how soon he shall be. Should the Bears not find out what they have while winning is the last thing that matters?\n\nOf course the No. 2 drafted player, the first quarterback taken, the light leading to tomorrow should start. And take his lumps.\n\nRookie Troy Aikman's Cowboys went 1-15, Peyton Manning's Colts 3-13. Terry Bradshaw was benched in Pittsburgh and got the reputation for being a doofus. Rookie John Elway lined up behind his guard to take a snap.\n\nSuch things happen to rookies, though none of it means automatic success later. It is not a case of crummy now, glory later, otherwise the Bears could offer candidates from Steve Walsh to Brian Griese.\n\nThere have been, by various counts, 66 starting quarterbacks for the Bears since Sid Luckman invented the position, 15 drafted by the Bears since McMahon, with Trubisky the highest-drafted Bear quarterback ever.\n\nThis is the bed the Bears have made. Or, to use a different metaphor, rookies are green apples, shiny and auspicious but always sour and maybe full of worms.\n\nJust saying.\n\nBernie Lincicome is a special contributor to the Chicago

(Have you heard about this Trubisky kid?) But John Fox's squad still walked out of Soldier Field with a 24-17 loss.\n\nIn order to establish themselves as a team on the rise, the Bears must soon provide evidence that they have enough talent and cohesiveness to make many more game-changing plays. Their next opportunity comes Saturday night against the Cardinals in Glendale, Ariz.\n\nHere are four things to watch.\n\nMike vs. Mitch\n\nQuarterback is still the most relevant storyline for the 2017 Bears -- by a country mile. So just how will the second exhibition game affect the narrative? One has to figure that starter Mike Glennon will look much sharper than he did against the Broncos, when he posted a 0.0 rating and led the Bears to only three first downs on four possessions. Smart money also says rookie Mitch Trubisky will experience a few bumps in the road after such an encouraging debut. All across Chicago, fans and critics will continue wondering when Trubisky's rise might shoot him past Glennon on the depth chart. Under-the-lights game action like Saturday's can offer a solid measuring stick on where each quarterback stands. But even Trubisky has downplayed the success he had last week. \"I was pleased with how I played,\" he said Wednesday. \"But plenty more mistakes are going on during practice for me that I need to work on.\"\n\nThe receivers\n\nIt won't matter who's playing quarterback if the Bears pass catchers don't begin to emerge as reliable playmakers. And last week's game was a startling reminder of just how ordinary this current cast may be. Both Kevin White and Cameron Meredith were held without a catch. Markus Wheaton, meanwhile, is out of the foreseeable future after breaking his left pinkie finger in practice last weekend. After the loss to the Broncos, Fox lamented his receivers' inability to separate from man coverage. If those struggles persist, the passing attack is in deep trouble.\n\nThe new guy\n\nIt will be interesting to see how special teams coordinator Jeff Rodgers divvies up the workload for his kickers. But you'd have to imagine the Bears will test newcomer Roberto Aguayo as much as possible as they assess whether he's a better option than Connor Barth. The Bears have only three weeks to make that call. And Aguayo's accuracy issues in Tampa -- he missed nine field-goal attempts last season then misfired on both a 47-yard field goal and a PAT in the Bucs' exhibition opener last week -- are worrisome. Still, after landing with the Bears last weekend, Aguayo -- a second-round pick in 2016 -- is determined to put his Florida failures behind him. The sting of being cut -- in front of HBO's \"Hard Knocks\" cameras, no less -- was sharp. \"It hurt,\" Aguayo said. \"But I'm here now, so this is my next opportunity.\"\n\nSplash plays\n\nThe Bears have talked for months about how their 2016 takeaway total (a league-low 11) is unacceptable. That included eight games last season in which the defense failed to create a single turnover. So even with an encouraging defensive performance last week in which they surrendered only three points on the Broncos' first seven possessions, the Bears failed to take the ball away. If this defense is to make the leap from solid to great, at some point they're going to need to become more opportunistic.\n\ndwiederer@chicagotribune.com\n\nTwitter @danwiederer", "date":

Today, the Chicago Bears.\n\nHead coach: John Fox\n\nLast season's record: 3-13 (last in NFC North)\n\nPlayoff result: Better luck next year\n\nKey free agent gains: The Bears' biggest off-season signing is also their most baffling.\n\nQuarterback Mike Glennon played in just 21 games over the past four years with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and hasn't started a game since the 2014 season. While he'll likely start this September ahead of rookie Mitchell Trubisky, he'll surely be on a short leash as he plays in front of a fanbase that's already focused on the future.\n\nThe club also signed Mark Sanchez to a one-year contract, marking the struggling quarterback's fourth stop in eight seasons.\n\nWhoever does end up throwing the pigskin will have a few new targets in wide receivers Victor Cruz, Marcus Wheaton and Kendall Wright, and tight end Dion Sims.\n\nOn the other side of the ball, safety Quintin Demps came in from Houston on a three-year deal while Prince Amukamara signed a one-year contract, though an early pre-season hamstring injury could see the former Jaguar's season debut delayed.\n\nKey free agent losses: Quarterback Jay Cutler retired for all of three months after being released by the Bears in March, but is back on an NFL roster after former Bears offensive coordinator Adam Gase coaxed the polarizing gunslinger out of retirement to join the Dolphins. His former Bears backup, Brian Hoyer, is now in San Fransisco.\n\nGone, too, is one of Cutler's most talented targets, as five-year Bears receiver Alshon Jeffery signed a deal with the Eagles. Defensive end Cornelius Washington is now with the Lions, while receiver Eddie Royal and cornerback Tracy Porter remain free agents.\n\nKey draft picks: Regardless of how they got him, the Bears landed their quarterback of the future in Mitchell Trubisky during this year's draft. (It seems there's a definite theme this off-season in Chicago.)\n\nThe selection of the No. 2-overall pick was met with... let's call it mixed reaction. But the new kid has been steadily chipping away at the fanbase's doubt this off-season thanks to a strong camp and an even stronger pre-season debut.\n\nTrubisky, 22, looked incredibly composed as he completed 18 of 25 passes for 166 yards and a touchdown. He was also surprisingly nimble, rushing for 38 yards.\n\nThe Bears lost to the Broncos, but you wouldn't know it judging by the rave reviews on Chicago sports Twitter.\n\nTight end Adam Shaheen and running back Tarik Cohen also bear watching, and don't sleep on undrafted rookie wide receiver Tanner Gentry, who's building up some solid chemistry with Trubisky in practice.\n\nX-factor: One of the few bright spots in Chicago last season was the emergence of running back Jordan Howard. He rushed for 1,313 yards and six touchdowns in his rookie season, and will most likely have an even bigger year as the Bears smooth out the kinks in their passing game. Fantasy owners are already drooling.\n\n2017 will be a success if: They can establish a clear No. 1 QB. There's always room for an underdog in sports, but this season's success likely won't be measured in terms of wins and losses but rather in progress -- especially at the quarterback position. Pre-season love says it's #TrubiskyTime, but Glennon is likely the guy for now.

The message is the same. The game plan is clear. The goal is minimal but necessary.\n\nJust don't stink.\n\nGlennon doesn't have to be great. He might not even have to be good. He just can't be awful again. No, this is not reaching for excellence, but hey, this is the Bears and quarterbacks, and everybody knows to wear Kevlar.\n\nNot being awful apparently will allow Glennon and the Bears to stave off the hits taken this week in the wake of handcuffing rookie Mitch Trubisky to the third team despite three scoring drives in his debut against the Broncos, two of them TDs, one on a two-minute drill, the other on a 12-play, 75-yard march, and what else are you looking for, pal?\n\nBears coach John Fox didn't rattle off that list after Thursday night's first preseason game, other than complimenting the Denver defense that Glennon faced. Without wanting to see the film the way all coaches default even if you ask how breakfast was, Fox said he wasn't changing his depth chart after one practice game or seemingly for a while, and here might be why:\n\nHe's keeping a promise his general manager foolishly made in the course of some bad negotiating.\n\nIt wasn't so much that Ryan Pace reportedly bid against himself to raise the price for Glennon. No, it was Pace's promise that Glennon would be the starter this season no matter what. That meant no competition. Glennon was handed a bag of money and the starting job with little reason to think he earned either.\n\nAnd now, it looks like Pace's coach has to keep Pace's promise. Remember, this is a coach who says the NFL is a production-based business, but Fox seems to be OK with looking foolish himself when he doesn't demand production from players at the most important position on the field.\n\nThat's a good soldier right there. That's someone who's probably banking a lot of credit with his boss, perhaps enough for his boss to at least let him coach out his deal next season and maybe even get extended.\n\nThere's likely another reason Fox is sucking the joy out of Mitchsteria: The Bears can't come off as lying to players.\n\nAs comical as Glennon's \"It's my year'' statement has been, it's based on what Pace said. What Pace promised. We can debate the stupidity of promising a player a spot -- no, wait, we can't, there's no debate, it's stupid not to make a player earn a position -- but Pace did it and the Bears are stuck abiding by it so they maintain some credibility around the NFL.\n\nBreaking that promise by moving Trubisky ahead of Glennon before the season would prompt talk that you can't trust what the Bears tell you. That's bad for free-agent shopping, although it can be deodorized by money. Just about everything can be deodorized by money. Just look at NFL owners: If they can make money employing domestic abusers, they'll happily do it. But still, bad reputations around a league can force pursuing teams to pay a premium for their stupidity.\n\nSo, best-case scenario against the Cardinals on Saturday, Glennon doesn't go full-metal Todd Collins. Completing only half his passes would make him look like Tom Brady. Keeping the Cardinals defense out of the end zone would make him seem like Aaron Rodgers. And then the Bears can stand by Pace's silly promise publicly for at least a week while exhaling privately.\n\nJust don't stink.\n\nAgain.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Gay_Men", "wgt": 100, "id": 429, "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Gay Men"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100, "id": 485, "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 100, "id": 487, "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Bearings", "wgt": 100, "id": 516, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Bearings"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft_Toys", "wgt": 100, "id": 518, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft Toys"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Stuffed_Animals", "wgt": 100, "id": 519, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Stuffed Animals"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "type": "loc", "id": "230018"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevlar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305465", "label": {"eng": "Kevlar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305661", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "308747", "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thursday_Night_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "330672", "label": {"eng": "Thursday Night Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "342459", "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fox_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "361670", "label": {"eng": "John Fox (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Glennon", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "368108", "label": {"eng": "Mike Glennon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurry-up_offense", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "372334", "label": {"eng": "Hurry-up offense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pace_(transit)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "373121", "label": {"eng": "Pace (transit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NFL_quarterbacks_who_have_posted_a_passer_rating_of_zero", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1183812", "label": {"eng": "List of NFL quarterbacks who have posted a passer rating of zero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Pace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1273081", "label": {"eng": "Ryan Pace"}}]}

The Bears really needed to have some during the preseason, considering a three-win campaign a year ago and low expectations for the upcoming campaign.\n\nEnter Mitchell Trubisky.\n\nTen-straight completions, a touchdown drive in the two-minute drill, 166 yards passing without a single turnover, a quarterback rating of 103.1 vs the Broncos. Even in the preseason, it's a reason a football town with a quarterback problem extending back a few decades to feel happy and even go a bit overboard in their optimism.\n\nThis exchange between NFL Network host Rich Eisen and former Bears linebacker Brian Urlacher was representative of the fan base that was quite pleased with the first round pick's play in the game at Soldier Field. It was enough for some in the media and fans to hint at a possible quarterback competition for the rest of Training Camp, even though Mike Glennon has been assured of the starting spot since March.\n\nMeanwhile this all circles around the 22-year old who is looked at as the face of the franchise for the future, who claims his oblivious to all of the chatter he's generated over the past week.\n\n\"I don't know what hype you're talking about,\" said Trubisky Wednesday at Halas Hall when asked about the buzz created by his first start. \"I don't pay attention to it. It's good to be back at Halas.\"\n\nReally? We'll Trubisky doubled down on his position when asked again.\n\n\"A couple more people texted me after the game, family congratulating me,\" said Trubisky. \"But I think it's just a small step in the right direction.\"\n\nWhether you believe him on not seeing anymore attention this week is up to the beholder, but the young quarterback speaks the truth about his current step in the journey ahead: It's still very early.\n\nAs some quickly buy into the hype of Trubisky's success, the quarterback continues to embed himself in learning the nuances of the professional game. Things like taking the ball under center (which he didn't do in college in a shotgun-heavy offense), making calls at the line and building a rapport with his receivers don't just happen overnight or just over two quarters of an exhibition game.\n\nIn fact Trubisky's mind at the moment is more on the practices held at Halas Hall than the team's second exhibition game Saturday night against the Cardinals in Glendale.\n\n\"The game was actually pretty clean, its more in practice,\" said Trubisky. \"We're still installing a lot of new plays, so it's repping those, getting comfortable with those until I'm calling it and going out and repping it like it's the back of my hand.\"\n\nOne of the things that Trubisky says he can get a better grasp on during the practices as opposed to the games are the different pressures that a team might throw at him. Many teams won't show their entire defensive package in an exhibition game, so the most interesting blitz packages are the ones he'll see on the fields at Halas Hall.\n\n\"In practice, I'm seeing a lot of different blitzes and I think game planning on a week-to-week basis will help picking up the blitzes and everything,\" said Trubisky. \"I'm doing a lot better job with the protection, getting it set, helping out my backs, making sure they are either in protection or I'm getting them out in a route to help in the progression of the play.\n\n\"It's all about getting set and getting the protection set so I'm doing a lot better job of that.\"\n\nSome fans that watched him in his first game might say he's doing even better than that so far in his young career.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 49, "label": "dmoz/Games"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "wgt": 100, "id": 52, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "wgt": 100, "id": 134, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "wgt": 100, "id": 135, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 137, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "wgt": 100, "id": 205, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 100, "id": 206, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302552", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302611", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305217", "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309400", "label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310340", "label": {"eng": "Shotgun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "311040", "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_(American_and_Canadian_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "311351", "label": {"eng": "Center (American and Canadian football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_preseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "314202", "label": {"eng": "National Football League preseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passer_rating", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "325480", "label": {"eng": "Passer rating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitz_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "340145", "label": {"eng": "Blitz (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Glennon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "368108", "label": {"eng": "Mike Glennon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "368361", "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Eisen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "370420", "label": {"eng": "Rich Eisen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurry-up_offense", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "372334", "label": {"eng": "Hurry-up offense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Halas", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "446978", "label": {"eng": "George Halas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Urlacher", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "565108", "label": {"eng": "Brian Urlacher"}}]}

Trubisky completed 18 of 25 passes, plus one attempt a spike to stop the clock, for 166 yards and a touchdown.\n\nOffensive coordinator Dowell Loggains carefully constructed a plan to accentuate Trubisky's strengths. Not including the clock kill, 18 of the 24 passes came from the shotgun formation, and five of the six attempts when the snap was taken under center came off play fakes. Trubisky rolled out of the pocket consistently. The Broncos rushed more than four defenders on six snaps, but Trubisky was never under duress.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges is preparing Trubisky for the avalanche of pressure packages he will face from opposing teams.\n\n\"I'm picking it up,\" he said. \"It's tougher in practice than it was in the last game just because I don't think in the preseason they wanted to throw a lot at us. ... But in practice I'm seeing a lot of different blitzes and I think game-planning on a week-to-week basis will help picking up the blitzes and everything.\n\n\"But I'm doing a lot better job with the protection and getting it set, helping out my backs, making sure they're either in protection or I'm getting them out in a route to help in the progression of the play. It's all about getting set and getting the protection.\"\n\nIt wasn't too long ago that teams showed as little as possible in the preseason to keep their schemes under wraps until the season. Former coach Lovie Smith wanted to see technique, stances, adjustment to motion and played a ton of his base Cover-2 scheme to evaluate his players. Every once in a while there would be wink-wink agreements between coaches to not pressure much. That has changed dramatically for some teams.\n\nThe Packers pressured on 65 percent of their defensive snaps in their exhibition opener against the Eagles. Coach Mike McCarthy explained he wants to get his players accustomed to what they're going to be asked to do during the season, especially because practice time has been reduced by the CBA implemented in 2011. It's not just the players blitzing. He wants to see how defensive backs react when the blitz doesn't get home.\n\n\"Pressure is important to rep in the preseason,\" McCarthy said. \"In the earlier days being a head coach at times you'd save this and you'd save that. Now, you only get the speed in the games. We've tried to pressure more in the preseason.\"\n\nConversely, he likes seeing defenses bring pressure against his offense. Of course, that's probably easier to watch with quarterback Aaron Rodgers on the sideline. He didn't play against the Eagles and saw action in only one exhibition last summer, getting 26 snaps in two series.\n\n\"There is a pace and a tempo and a discipline and a time clock that goes with pressure packages that you really want your guys to feel, especially when the time clock of the play gets extended,\" McCarthy said. \"If you have an extended play on offense versus a pressure call on defense, obviously the opportunity for a big play goes way up so the coverage unit is stressed. Those are great examples to learn from. The stress point is really on the coverage unit.\"\n\nThe stress for Trubisky is understanding where the extra rushers are coming from and ensuring the line call will accommodate the pressure. It's setting the line and adjusting if needed, something he wasn't asked to do at North Carolina. Trubisky can watch film incessantly, but the best way to prepare for zealous defensive coordinators intent on testing a young quarterback is to be thrown into the fire.\n\nThe Broncos had a Cover-0 pressure -- no safety was in the middle of the field -- on the 2-yard touchdown pass to Victor Cruz. They showed pressure with two outside edge rushers, pinched the tackles and had a safety showing pressure. It was easy to diagnose. The Bears worked a flat/corner route and it was a good read and throw afterJosh Bellamy set a pick, but the Broncos played it poorly and the opening likely wouldn't have been there had cornerbacks Chris Harris Jr. and Aqib Talib been on the field.\n\nTrubisky deserves praise for what he accomplished in a brief outing, but he hasn't seen anything like what the regular season will bring. Maybe he will get an introduction Saturday against the Cardinals as Arizona's base defense relies on a lot of pressure.\n\n\"A lot of it is knowing what we do,\" Bears coach John Fox said. \"As a rookie at any position and in particular quarterback, there is so much they have to know. What the O-line's doing. Where the protection is going. And now that affects the routes. Adjusting that. Sometimes we give the quarterback the leeway to change those things. It's a lot to learn for a young quarterback.\"\n\nThe process continues with many interested in seeing the Bears speed it up.\n\nbmbiggs@chicagotribune.com\n\nTwitter @BradBiggs", "date":

There's still not a full-blown quarterback controversy -- Mike Glennon remains No. 1 on the depth chart -- but plenty of intrigue surrounds Glennon (still a relative unknown), Mark Sanchez (former high-profile starter) and Mitchell Trubisky (No. 2 overall pick of the 2017 NFL draft).\n\nWow moment: Glennon strung together a handful of impressive throws in one of Thursday night's final 11-on-11 drills. Glennon's best moment of practice came when he sold a fake handoff right, then bootlegged outside the pocket to his left. Despite throwing across his body, Glennon fired a perfect pass to tight end Zach Miller, who was streaking toward the left sideline. Glennon also completed back-to-back balls to Kevin White in the same drill.\n\nMitchell Trubisky\n\nWow moment: Trubisky stood out in Chicago's red zone drill, firing touchdown passes on consecutive throws. On Trubisky's first touchdown, he stood tall in the pocket and waited for tight end Ben Braunecker to come open over the middle. Next, Trubisky connected with Daniel Braverman, who promptly spiked the football to the delight of the 4,713 fans in attendance at Prospect High School.\n\nWhoa moment: Trubisky threw an errant pass behind Tanner Gentry, who unsuccessfully tried to turn and catch the ball in 7-on-7. Had that been a real game, Gentry would've been knocked out.\n\nMark Sanchez\n\nWow moment: Sanchez looked good in the red zone drill, targeting wide receiver Titus Davis on a pair of completions.

Ignoring the attention Chicago has paid on its third-string quarterback is a tougher task than merely rolling right and throwing an accurate out route.\n\n\"I don't know what hype you're talking about,\" Trubisky said with a straight face after Wednesday's practice. \"I don't pay attention to it.\"\n\nMitch Trubisky was the No. 2 overall pick (Getty Images)\n\nMaybe, he admitted, he got a few more text messages from family members after he completed 18-of-25 passes for 166 yards and a touchdown in the Bears' first preseason game against the Broncos.\n\n\"I think it's just a small step in the right direction,\" he said.\n\nAsked to define how he's progressed this summer, Trubisky's words were far less flashy than his play.\n\n\"Steadliy,\" he said.\n\nHe's right -- but what is it they say about first impressions?\n\nAnother star turn against the Cardinals on Saturday night would vault the Bears into a full-fledged quarterback controversy. The rookie could see more time with the second string than he did Thursday, though it appears Mark Sanchez will play; the second-stringer returned Wednesday after taking two practices off with a bruised ankle.\n\nThe Bears have been intrigued by Trubisky's play, of course, and want to see more.\n\nBut rather than talking about what's at stake, Trubisky detailed the things he needs to fix. He actually called the first game a \"small sample,\" and stressed the importance of practice to fix his mistakes. He made the wrong number of steps on his drop-backs a few times, and struggled at times to identify the middle linebacker -- common mistakes for rookie quarterbacks.\n\n\"You can make a mistake, and that's going to happen, especially for rookies,\" he said, \" But it's all about overcoming that, learning from it and don't let it happen again. And I think I've done a pretty good job of that so far.\"\n\nPicking up blitzes has actually been harder in practice than in the first game, when the Broncos, as most teams do, played a vanilla scheme in the second half.\n\n\"In practice I'm seeing a lot of different blitzes, and I think game-planning on a week-to-week basis will help picking up the blitzes and everything,\" Trubisky said. \"But I'm doing a lot better job with the protection and getting it set, helping out my backs, making sure they're either in protection or I'm getting them out in a route to help in the progression of the play.\n\n\"It's all about getting set and getting the protection, so I feel like I'm doing a lot better job of that.\"\n\nThe Bears simplified Trubisky's responsibilities last week by preparing a play sheet for him in the days before the Broncos game. He spoke with offensive coordinator Dowell Loggains about the plays he was comfortable with, and will do the same this week.\n\nThere are subtleties Trubisky he needs to master before he can start. That won't change, even with a good showing Saturday.\n\n\"A lot of it is knowing what we do,\" coach John Fox said. \"I mean, obviously, knowing your opponent and what they do comes along with that.\n\n\"But primarily, I think as a rookie at any position, and in particular quarterback, there is so much they have to know. What the O-line's doing. Where the protection is going. And now that affects the routes. Adjusting that. Sometimes we give the quarterback the leeway to change those things.

Flynn threw for 480 yards and a team-record six touchdowns in a 45-41 victory over the Lions.\n\nThe 27-year-old clipboard caddy with two career starts was suddenly the best quarterback available in a thin market. The Seahawks felt Flynn gave them a better chance over incumbent starter Tavaris Jackson.\n\nBut then something funny happened on the way to Century Link Field.\n\nThe Seahawks drafted Russell Wilson, a transfer quarterback out of Wisconsin, with the 75th pick in the third round. After giving up on baseball, the 5-11 Wilson decided to try his luck with a bigger ball. Good career move.\n\nFlynn started the first and second games of the preseason for the Seahawks in 2012 and played OK, but Wilson was outstanding in relief.\n\nEven though the Seahawks had committed a ton of money to Flynn, GM John Schneider and Carroll went into training camp with an open mind.\n\nWith Flynn nursing a sore elbow, the Seahawks started Wilson in the preseason dress-rehearsal. The rookie connected on 13-of-19 passes for 185 yards and two TDs in a 44-14 victory over the Chiefs. Flynn, who would make as much in one game as Wilson made for the entire season, never got off the sideline.\n\nRussell Wilson has started every game for the Seahawks since they drafted him in 2012. (Getty Images)\n\nWilson has started every game for the Seahawks since, including consecutive Super Bowls in 2013 and 2014.\n\nWhen asked about taking the inexperienced Wilson over the high-priced free agent at the time, Carroll said: \"The right thing is to get the best players out there.\"\n\nWhich brings us to the Bears.\n\nWhen GM Ryan Pace signed free agent Mike Glennon to a three-year, $45 million deal with $19 million guaranteed, it signaled the end of the Jay Cutler era.\n\nPace was handing the keys of mediocrity over to a 27-year-old backup who had taken 11 snaps since 2014. Still, Pace exclaimed: \"Mike Glennon is our starting quarterback and we're fired up about that.\"\n\nPace added: \"He's got all the traits that you want in a quarterback -- height, arm strength, accuracy, the ability to quickly process. So I don't know how high the ceiling is. I'm just glad we have him in the mix as our starting quarterback to compete and get better.\"\n\nBut in April, Pace fell in love with another quarterback. In a stunning move, fully lambasted by social media and NFL experts alike, Pace traded up to the second pick of the NFL Draft to take Mitch Trubisky, an untested quarterback with just 13 starts at North Carolina.\n\nBears fans are absolutely devastated pic.twitter.com/hrVG7VaRvF\n\n-- Sports Illustrated (@SInow) April 28, 2017\n\nPace quickly calmed the masses, though, and assured everyone that Glennon was still the Bears' guy. Trubisky would be brought along slowly and likely wouldn't see the field this regular season. Just to be doubly sure, they signed veteran Mark Sanchez to be their No. 2.\n\nThen something funny happened at Soldier Field.\n\nOn the night of the first preseason game again the Denver Broncos, Glennon laid an egg -- literally -- throwing a pick-6 and completing just two of eight passes for 20 yards and a 0.0 passer rating. Trubisky on the other hand, led the Bears on three scoring drives, going 18 of 25 for 166 yards and a TD with a 90.9 passer rating. Trubisky brought excitement to Beardom that hadn't been seen since Devin Hester crossed the goal line in the Super Bowl in 2007.\n\nAn unwavering Pace, stuck to his gameplan, telling the Sun-Times: \"There's a lot of things that go into that other than just one player. [But] there's a lot of evidence that supports that we really like him as a starting quarterback, Mike Glennon. I want to convey that support as we're talking here. Again, [it's] one preseason game, and he's going to respond well from that.\"\n\nPace is right. One preseason game is a very small sample size. But what if Trubisky comes back with another solid performance? Should money and not going back on your word trump football smarts?\n\nHeck, even Mike Ditka and Madden 18 say Trubisky should start.\n\nInterestingly, many of the same experts and fans who skewered Pace for trading up and drafting Trubisky are now imploring him to play the rookie. It's still uncertain how the Bears' dilemma is going to play out, but so far the similarities to the Wilson-Flynn situation are certainly there.\n\nOh, and one more note about the Trubisky-Wilson connection. Wilson began his college football career at North Carolina State before transferring to Wisconsin his final year and leading the Badgers to the Rose Bowl. Wilson started three years for the Wolfpack, all the while pursuing a pro baseball career. But the Wolfpack had an up-and-coming junior quarterback that had been pushing Wilson. Miffed over Wilson's baseball pursuits, coach Tom O'Brien told Wilson April 27, 2011, that he was no longer the starting QB. The new starter: Mike Glennon.\n\nRussell Wilson lost his starting job at North Carolina State to Mike Glennon.

Everything gets more amplified Week 1 to 2, 2 to 3 and then ultimately the season opener. Obviously I want to go out and play well, but I don't want to make too big a deal and put too much pressure on a preseason game.\"\n\nGlennon's image took a beating after he went 2-for-8 for 20 yards with an interception that was returned for a touchdown against Denver last week, but he wasn't the only culprit.\n\n\"Our whole first unit was not very good,\" Bears coach John Fox said. \"I don't think we blocked very well. I thought we had some drops. We didn't get off man coverage, which wasn't something we were surprised about. So all in all, I think there are a lot of things that we saw on the tape, the players saw.\"\n\nThe offensive line in particular failed to establish the run when Jordan Howard was in the game. Howard rushed for only three yards on four attempts. Make no mistake, the Bears -- led by Howard -- are supposed to be a power-running team. Chicago has little to no shot to thrive on offense in 2017 without a strong rushing attack. Running backs Tarik Cohen, Ka'Deem Carey and Benny Cunningham all looked pretty good against the Broncos, but most of that came after Fox pulled the starters.\n\nAnd the pass protection was subpar. Left tackle Charles Leno was beaten multiple times, which contributed to Glennon's lackluster night in the pocket. At 6-foot-6, Glennon doesn't have Mitchell Trubisky's mobility. He has to be protected in order to run the offense the right way.\n\n\"I think I did a fine job preparing mentally, it was just more the execution side of it,\" Glennon said. \"And the more we get in these preseason games, preseason two we spend more time game planning; preseason three we spend even more time. That's just kind of the flow of the preseason.\"\n\nStill, Glennon is the focal point. He needs an efficient night in Arizona to slow down the Trubisky express that's roaring through Chicago, but he can't do it alone.\n\n\"I just really don't get online,\" Glennon said of tuning out criticism. \"I watched the preseason games but I just avoid the possible distraction of hearing what people may say. The only thing that matters are the coaches and the players in the locker room and what they have to say. That's where my focus is.\n\nI understand as writers, you guys have a job to do.

It's his ankle, that's what he's been kind of working on.\"\n\nPushed on whether or not the fights were an issue his coach assured everyone, \"Our guys, we've got a bond and he's one of our family and he'll be treated as such, like any kind of thing that happens in a family. Guys adapt and respond and I think everything's fine.\"\n\nI don't doubt Fox but here's what is becoming an issue: Long is looking more and more like a long shot to be ready for the opener against the Falcons.\n\nThe assumption throughout the offseason has been that Long, Cody Whitehair and Josh Sitton give the Bears one of the best interior lines in football.\n\nBut the weak link in the offensive line is left tackle Charles Leno, and if Long is out with No. 3 guard Eric Kush already on injured reserve for the year, suddenly the line becomes very iffy.\n\nThen there is White, who so far in training camp would be very easy to miss if everyone wasn't so focused on him.\n\nLoggains says of White, \"He's missed a lot. The growing experience, he might have got it mentally, but he needs to go out there and experience that and feel what it's like to go against a press corner.\n\n\"We got to figure out, 'Hey, this is what Kev does well.' And maybe it's everything. Maybe, it's seven or eight routes. Maybe, it's three or four, but we have to figure what that is.\"\n\nFair enough but here's the problem: Cam Meredith proved last year he could be a solid second option when teams were focused on Alshon Jeffery, but he is not a No. 1 receiver.\n\nIf White isn't that guy, then Meredith could be a problem, too.\n\nVictor Cruz appears to have something left in the tank but strictly as a No. 3 in the slot, and no other pass catcher other than the undrafted rookie free agent Tanner Gentry has really shown anything. And nobody is scheduling Gentry's party to celebrate him making the team yet.\n\nIf White can be the No. 1 the whole group might be good enough. But if White can't get it done, the whole receiver unit could render the question of Glennon or Trubisky moot.\n\nVisit ProFootballWeekly.com | View Latest E-Edition", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 100, "id": 31, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Gay_Men", "wgt": 100, "id": 429, "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Gay Men"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Bearings", "wgt": 100, "id": 516, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Bearings"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft_Toys", "wgt": 100, "id": 518, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft Toys"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Stuffed_Animals", "wgt": 100, "id": 519, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Stuffed Animals"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "type": "loc", "id": "207040"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302552", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305661", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "305794", "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "310476", "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "319761", "label": {"eng": "Lineman (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(American_and_Canadian_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "322621", "label": {"eng": "Guard (American and Canadian football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "324464", "label": {"eng": "Offensive line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_reserve_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "342457", "label": {"eng": "Injured reserve list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "342459", "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Long", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "342484", "label": {"eng": "Kyle Long"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_White_(mayor)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "355414", "label": {"eng": "Kevin White (mayor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alshon_Jeffery", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "361975", "label": {"eng": "Alshon Jeffery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivet_Nazarene_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "361976", "label": {"eng": "Olivet Nazarene University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Glennon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "368108", "label": {"eng": "Mike Glennon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Cruz_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "374430", "label": {"eng": "Victor Cruz (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Sitton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "379293", "label": {"eng": "Josh Sitton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowell_Loggains", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "415674", "label": {"eng": "Dowell Loggains"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Kush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "665194", "label": {"eng": "Eric Kush"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1269622", "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leno,_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1280478", "label": {"eng": "Charles Leno, Jr."}}]}

In five of those seven games he threw two or more interceptions, and all five were losses. In his clean games, the Bears managed to go 1-1, including a narrow 20-17 loss to the Lions and a 26-6 beatdown of the pathetic San Francisco 49ers. Barkley was just about as bad as a quarterback can be, and served as a microcosm of what went wrong for Chicago both in terms of execution and luck last season.\n\nThe Bears have been a joke to Packers fans for awhile now, and last year's 3-13 record wasn't exactly unexpected. But underneath the surface of this bottom-feeder, GM Ryan Pace has been quietly implementing John Fox's boring, dependable system. What many have failed to notice (with good reason) is that this rebuild is farther along than anyone realizes. The Bears are not threats to contend just yet, but don't be surprised if they rise to the level of \"mediocre-pain-in-the-ass\" in 2017. So why should you believe me when I say that the Bears are about to take a titanic leap forward?\n\nFootball Outsiders has a metric called \"Adjusted Games Lost\" which tracks just how hard injuries hit a team in a given year. AGL goes beyond simply counting up missed games; it also weights starters more heavily, and used the pre-game injury designations to identify players who are likely playing hurt. From year-to-year, injuries do show some trends and aren't strictly random, but there is a lot of randomness involved, and it is a near certainty that the Bears will be healthier in 2017.\n\nIn 2016, Chicago suffered the worst AGL of any team in 17 years, with 155.1 games lost.\n\nFor comparison, the Packers, who were almost exactly average, lost 70.5 adjusted games to injury.\n\nThe Bears' injuries were devastating and widespread. They were the 2nd-most-injured team in the league on offense, due only to a record-setting effort from the VIkings, and the most-injured team on defense, where no individual unit was within the top 20 in health. This is especially devastating for a team led by John Fox, who builds his teams around defense, and in this case around an excellent defensive coordinator in Vic Fangio. Make no mistake, the Bears have good individual pieces on their defense, and if those same injuries don't manifest in 2017, they will be a force.\n\nThe team is particularly stacked at EDGE, where Pernell McPhee, Willie Young, Lamarr Houston, and Leonard Floyd figure to make life miserable for opposing quarterbacks. Young is coming off of a 7.5 sack season, with McPhee chipping in 4 sacks in just 9 games (a shoulder injury required offseason labrum surgery). Lamarr Houston suffered a torn ACL and missed virtually all of 2016 after an 8-sack effort in 2015, and Leonard Floyd will enter his second season after a very impressive, though injury-shortened 7 sack season.\n\nWhile it's easy to see Houston taking some time to return to 100%, the other 3 should all be back to normal at the start of the regular season, and Floyd displayed enough potential in his rookie campaign to make opposing NFC North quarterbacks very nervous. Danny Trevathan, Jerrell Freeman, and Nick Kwiatkowski, if healthy, should provide solid play in the middle at inside linebacker. The Bears are only average up front, but a healthy Eddie Goldman should competently anchor the middle while the underrated Akiem Hicks causes even more trouble at end. The backups in the front 7 are an excellent collection of potential (Jonathan Bullard in particular) and useful skill players.\n\nIn the secondary, the Bears were legitimately weak in 2016. The one area in which Chicago was actually healthier than Green Bay produced lackluster results as only safety Adrian Amos exceeded expectations. Kyle Fuller had as disappointing a season as any Packer corner, and the rest of the squad was completely decimated. The Bears tapped the free agent market to address this problem, adding Prince Amukamara from Jacksonville and Quintin Demps from Houston. The secondary has potential, but in reality it probably only needs to be average if the pass rush delivers. Fox and Fangio know what they're doing on this side of the ball and GM Ryan Pace has given them the pieces to put together a good one; they just need to be on the field. If this unit can maintain average health, they will beat people up and stymie good offenses. They may not be a top five unit quite yet, but top ten isn't out of the question.\n\nLet's start with the fact that the Chicago offense isn't great, but it's probably better than you might think. It was as ravaged by injury as the defense last season, and while they didn't put up a ton of points they also weren't miserable, finishing a respectable 17th in DVOA.\n\nIt's easy to focus on the debacle that existed at quarterback and the injury problems endured by Alshon Jeffery and Kevin White, but the disaster in the receiving corps undercut a standout season from an excellent offensive line anchored by former Packer guard Josh Sitton. Despite injuries, bad quarterback play, and awful skill position players, the Bear line was 7th in the league in Adjusted Sack Rate last season while also providing outstanding run blocking for rookie sensation Jordan Howard, who did everything Ezekiel Elliott did without half of the supporting cast. The power game for the Bears enters the season second to none. The questions on offense center around the quarterbacks and pass catchers, but it's worth keeping in mind that with a good defense and running game, those questions are far less important than they would be for a team like Green Bay.\n\nWhat no one seems to realize about the Bears is that Pace and Fox already have what they want in place. This team is equipped, right now, to play high-level defense while they control the game on the ground, protect the ball, and play field position. The receivers and quarterback, should they offer anything at all, are merely icing on the cake.\n\nIn my Viking preview I called Minnesota \"boring trendsetters\" for their focus on limiting interceptions. Here again, we see that philosophy rear its boring head. Mike Glennon isn't a great or even a good quarterback, but for his career he throws a pick on 2.4% of his passes. Jay Cutler could move an offense, but his 3.3% INT rate would always serve to provide easy points for the opposing team and undercut good defenses. Matt Barkley's 6.8% INT rate (and general terribleness) completely doomed the team last season. Glennon, if he is the starter, will be called upon to act as a caretaker in service to the defense and running game, and his history suggests he can flourish in that role.\n\nIf that was the sum total of the Bear offensive preview they would be interesting enough as a rebuilding team poised to make a decent jump in the standings, but there is some sizzle to go along with this steak. When the Bears were drafting, I and many others were highly critical of their trade up to get Mitchell Trubisky, and several subsequent draft picks also seemed to be, frankly, insane. The Bears only made five picks total, many on skill position players that seemed like small school reaches. However, I have come to appreciate this particular draft even though it violated almost every rule I have about conducting a successful draft.\n\nI thought the Bears would go with defensive players early and often, capitalizing on one of the deepest defensive drafts in years to build a truly dominant unit. However, while the 2017 draft was loaded, it was mostly loaded with EDGE players, of which the Bears already have many. While the league zigged, the Bears instead zagged. They trusted in the fact that injury regression alone would be enough to help the defense, bolstered by free agency, and instead, they went for high-risk, high-ceiling offensive talent.\n\nTrubisky is one of many aces in the hole they now have at their disposal. While the Bears undoubtedly overpaid, he was my favorite quarterback prospect in the draft and should he develop into even a league average player, this team instantly becomes a perennial playoff contender. The Bear line is also well-suited to develop a quarterback as they will provide Trubisky with ample time to read defenses and make easy, rookie throws, while Howard puts him in manageable down-and-distance situations. In the second round the Bears reached for raw but athletic tight end Adam Shaheen of of Ashland (and who is known for his love of Chipotle) while also grabbing teeny-tiny running back Tarik Cohen out of North Carolina A&T in the 4th. Both were strange picks of small school players with odd physical characteristics, but both are also potential stars. Shaheen is a physical monster, and Cohen has the look of a Sproles-ian receiving back and complement to Howard, though that role is currently occupied by Jeremy Langford.\n\nThe returning Bears all have questions hovering over them. Former first-round pick Kevin White has never been healthy, Cameron Meredith is a decent 3rd or 4th receiver at best, and everyone else is replacement level or worse. The Bears brought in the remains of Victor Cruz, as well as Markus Wheaton, who has yet to live up to his considerable talents. At tight end, Zach Miller has his moments and can still be useful until Shaheen is ready. At worst it's a group of complementary players that can operate around the running game, but there is enough potential in young players to be intriguing.\n\nThe Bears remind me a bit of the Milwaukee Brewers. They've created a base that's at least good enough to linger around .500, but they've also given themselves a few lottery tickets that could pay off even more. No one expected the Brewers to get All-Star level seasons from the likes of Travis Shaw, Eric Thames, or Domingo Santana, but they did, and are in contention because of it. Even if they hadn't, the future would still have looked bright.\n\nThe Bears injected a solid base with some star potential. Fox did what he does in building a defense and they should rival the Vikings in short order. If they want to be boring and mediocre, that option is available immediately, and is still a decent stepping stone towards better things. If Trubisky can develop on top of everything else, the Bears may have something special, and sooner than you probably think.\n\nI expect that they will finish ahead of the Lions this year, somewhere in the 7-9 or 8-8 range, and if the Packers hold off the Vikings to win the division, don't be surprised if the Bear power rushing attack overwhelming a suspect Minnesota interior plays a part.",

On a breezy evening, an announced crowd of 4,713 people attended the 90-minute session.\n\nHere are two things we learned as the Bears continued preparing for Saturday night's road exhibition against the Cardinals.\n\nThe Bears aren't changing their quarterback depth chart for Saturday.\n\nIt has been eight days since Mitch Trubisky's encouraging exhibition debut. Eight long days to overcook his simplified set of 44 plays and blow his 103.1 passer rating out of proportion. Of course, the reaction is understandable given the quarterback purgatory the Bears have been stuck in for years.\n\nBut John Fox apparently reached his limit Thursday. In his final media availability before the game, he was asked whether the Bears would keep their quarterback order the same against the Cardinals, playing Mike Glennon, Mark Sanchez and then Trubisky.\n\n\"I think I've answered that, like, 20 times,\" Fox said. \"But yes.\"\n\nIn fairness to Fox, he said immediately after the Broncos game that the depth chart wouldn't change. But as the Trubisky hype machine has churned in top gear over the last week, a significant portion of the fan base hoped Fox would reconsider, that he would at least have Trubisky play immediately after Glennon exits.\n\nThe rookie himself doesn't seem to mind. And, in truth, he did finish the first half against the Broncos with the second-string offense around him.\n\n\"I don't really see a difference from the twos and threes,\" Trubisky said Wednesday. \"For me, it's how many reps can I get? I need all the reps I can get.\"\n\nSaturday is shaping up to be important for two homegrown backups.\n\nCenter Hroniss Grasu and cornerback Kyle Fuller could have grand opportunities in the starting lineup against the Cardinals to prove their roster value.\n\nLeft guard Kyle Long (right ankle) did not participate in practice Thursday. He received a treatment at a doctor's appointment Wednesday that requires 24 hours of rest, Fox said. But Long did attend the high school practice and watched with his teammates from the sideline.\n\nWith Long out of team drills for most of the preseason so far, the Bears have been experimenting with offensive line combinations. One is having Grasu play center and moving second-year lineman Cody Whitehair back to left guard, where he practiced the entire 2016 preseason before moving to center in Week 1.\n\nGrasu was positioned to be the starting center last season until he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee Aug. 6. He has been healthy all of this camp and trying to reestablish his strength at the point of attack.\n\nMeanwhile, Fuller would be a candidate to replace cornerbacks Prince Amukamara (right hamstring) and Bryce Callahan (ankle) if they don't play. Neither practiced Thursday. The Bears are eager to see if Fuller, the 2014 first-round draft pick, can turn and run fluidly and stick to his receiver in man coverage.\n\nIn other injury news Thursday, defensive end Akiem Hicks (Achilles), linebacker Danny Trevathan (right knee), linebacker Nick Kwiatkoski (concussion), running back Jeremy Langford (right ankle), defensive lineman Roy Robertson-Harris (concussion), cornerback Johnthan Banks (left knee) and receiver Alton Howard (undisclosed) were limited.\n\nDefensive end Mitch Unrein (concussion), receivers Markus Wheaton (left pinkie) and Josh Bellamy (ankle) and defensive lineman Kapron Lewis-Moore (undisclosed) did not practice.\n\nrcampbell@chicagotribune.com\n\nTwitter @Rich_Campbell", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri":

Jahns breaks down the Bears' practice Thursday night at Prospect High School.\n\nQB Update\n\nQuarterbacks Mike Glennon, Mark Sanchez and Mitch Trubisky all had strong moments during a light practice Thursday night at Prospect High School.\n\nGlennon's best showing came late in practice when he completed four consecutive passes down the field off of play action to tight end Zach Miller and receivers Cam Meredith and Kevin White (two).\n\nBears quarterback Mitch Trubisky passes against the Broncos during a preseason game at Soldier Field on Thursday.(Photo by Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images)\n\nTrubisky, though, made the throw of the day when he deftly beat a blitz during a red-zone drill with a quick throw to slot receiver Daniel Braverman. Trubisky released his pass before Braverman turned. The pass was perfect.\n\nBraverman, who was covered by safety DeAndre Houston-Carson, celebrated by spiking the ball in the end zone.\n\nTrubisky also displayed some poise during the same drill. With pressure coming, he stood strongly in the pocket before firing a touchdown pass to tight end Ben Braunecker over the middle.\n\nSanchez connected with receiver Titus Davis for two touchdowns in their red-zone drill.\n\nObservations\n\nThere were 4,713 fans in attendance at Prospect.\n\n\"Kudos to all our fans,\" coach John Fox said. \"They're great. They want a winner bad, and we're going to try to do everything we can to give them one. We're really pleased with the turnout.\"\n\nSaid Meredith, who played at St. Joseph High School in Westchester. \"Coming out here and seeing everybody have a good time, it was like Friday Night Lights all over again. We had a great time. It was a fast-paced practice.

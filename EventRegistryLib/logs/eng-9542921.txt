Abdullah dared Lone to commit publicly that he will not help the BJP in case he is elected to Parliament.\n\n\"The organisation which has spread hate and poison against Muslims in this country, why does he not dissociate himself from that party? Why does he not announce that if elected, he will never support the BJP? He will never do it because he cannot do it,\" he said.\n\nOmar Abdullah claimed that while the BJP had launched an \"onslaught\" on the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their identity, the political parties here have reserved all criticism for the National Conference.\n\n\"Every wrong done to Jammu and Kashmir has been done by the BJP. Article 370 was removed by the Centre, our identity is under attack by Delhi (Centre). But they (Sajad Lone) will still target the NC. You will never find them criticising the BJP.

What favours are they trying to return to the BJP?\" he said at the rally.\n\nAbdullah claimed the BJP wanted to make the Lone the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir in 2018 after the party pulled out of the coalition government with the PDP.\n\n\"The situation at that time was such that Altaf Bukhari, on behalf of the PDP, came to meet the National Conference. He sought help saying that they wanted to stop the conspiracy of the Centre. The National Conference extended support for making Altaf Bukhari the chief minister.\n\n\"Who came to support my opponent in this election, who is trying to defame me everywhere? Who wrote the letter to the Governor to make him the CM? It was the BJP. Can Lone deny that he was not the CM candidate of the BJP in 2018? Today also it is the BJP that is helping him. (BJP's J-K chief) Ravindra Raina comes here (Kupwara). What for? They do not have a candidate here,\" he added.\n\n(This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir_(union_territory)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Abdullah", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Omar Abdullah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waqf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Waqf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinagar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Srinagar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Srinagar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langate_Assembly_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Langate Assembly constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmanirbhar_Bharat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmanirbhar Bharat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sajjad_Gani_Lone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sajjad Gani Lone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kashmir"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baramulla", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baramulla"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baramulla"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir_Peoples_Democratic_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altaf_Bukhari", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Altaf Bukhari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_370_of_the_Constitution_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Article 370 of the Constitution of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kupwara_district", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kupwara district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://st1.latestly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/default-img-02.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542921", "eventUri": "eng-9542921", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Srinagar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 10, "textEnd": 15}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

Our lands are in danger and our youth are unemployed. If you visit a government office, you will not find any locals. All the officers come from outside.

Article 370 was removed by the Centre, our identity is under attack by Delhi. But these parties will still target the NC. You will never find them criticising the BJP. You will have to ask them what is their compulsion for all this.

Senior BJP leaders are campaigning in Anantnag, Rajouri, Poonch, Srinagar and Baramulla.\n\nAnother national party, Indian National Congress, is campaigning for the National Conference (NC) candidates in the valley where the PDP, JK Apni Party, Peoples Conference, DPAP and a couple of other parties are also in the fray.\n\nNC, PDP, Peoples Conference, JK Apni Party and DPAP of Ghulam Nabi Azad are publicly calling each other a proxy of BJP. The BJP is being painted a villain because of the abrogation of Article 370 and splitting of the state into two union territories (UTs) in August 2019.\n\nBeing the first major election after 2019, the NC and PDP are asking the electorate to vote to display their annoyance against abrogation of Article 370. NC vice-president Omar Abdullah questions the BJP why it has not fielded candidates on the Lok Sabha seats in Kashmir despite claiming to have put Jammu and Kashmir on the path of development following abrogation of Article 370.\n\nAbdullah has accused Mehbooba Mufti-led PDP of being the \"C-team\" of BJP as Mehbooba was herself contesting the election against the INDIA bloc from Anantnag. Abdullah alleged that the PDP candidate fighting election against him in Baramulla, who was earlier a Rajya Sabha member, did not vote against abrogation of Article 370 and directly helped the Modi government by abstaining.\n\nNC activists also accuse Peoples Conference chief Sajad Lone of having enjoyed ministership from the BJP quota in the PDP-BJP coalition government. Hitting out at Abdullah, Lone accuses National Conference of having shared power with the BJP when the NC vice-president was a minister in the Atal Behari Vajpayee led government from 1999 to 2002.\n\nAfter pulling himself out of the contest, Ghulam Nabi Azad, who has floated the Democratic Progressive Azad Party (DPAP) after parting ways from the Congress, claimed that the NC was \"seeking time\" to meet the BJP's central leaders. Abdullah was quick in reacting and accusing Azad of hobnobbing with the BJP to damage INDIA bloc's electoral prospects in the Chenab Valley which is his home turf.\n\nThe JK Apni Party of Altaf Bukhari, which has fielded its candidates in Anantnag and Srinagar, is being accused of being the \"B-team of BJP\".\n\nAnother talking point is deferment of polling for the Anantnag-Rajouri seat to 25 May from the earlier 7 May. It is being alleged that the move was aimed to benefit the BJP backed candidate as most voters belonging to the Gujjar-Bakerwal communities would have moved out to the high pastures with their cattle heads by the date of the poll.\n\nNC leaders Dr Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti have already extensively toured Rajouri and Poonch where they held a series of poll meetings.\n\nPolling for the Srinagar Lok Sabha constituency that is currently represented by Dr Farooq Abdullah (NC) will be held on 13 May, Baramulla seat on 20 May and Anantnag-Rajouri on 25 May.",

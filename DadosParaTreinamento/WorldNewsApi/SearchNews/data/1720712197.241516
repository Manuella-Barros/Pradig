The actress rose to fame in the 1950s as the heir apparent to Marilyn Monroe\u2019s status as the ultimate silver screen siren, starring in films like The Girl Can\u2019t Help It in 1956 (which won her a Golden Globe), The Wayward Bus in 1957 and Too Hot to Handle in 1960. She married publicist Paul Mansfield in 1950 and they had their daughter Jayne Marie Mansfield the same year. The couple moved to Hollywood in 1954 so Mansfield could pursue her acting career, and they separated shortly after. The Golden Age star married Mikl\u00f3s \u201cMickey\u201d Hargitay in 1958. They had son Mikl\u00f3s \"Mickey\" Hargitay, Jr. that same year, followed by son Zolt\u00e1n Hargitay in 1960. The couple were already in the midst of divorcing when Mansfield discovered she was pregnant again, and they briefly reconciled. Daughter Mariska Hargitay was born in 1964, and they divorced that year. Mansfield married for a third time, to Italian movie director Matt Cimber, in 1964 and they welcomed their son Antonio \u201cTony\u201d Cimber a year later. The pair were in the middle of divorce proceedings in 1967 when Mansfield died at only 34 years old, in a car accident that permanently changed highway safety standards. Her five children were all young at the time but many of them have shared fond memories of Mansfield. \u201cMy mother was this amazing, beautiful, glamor-ous sex symbol \u2014 but people didn\u2019t know that she played the violin and had a 160 IQ and had five kids and loved dogs,\u201d Mariska told PEOPLE in 2018. \u201cShe was just so ahead of her time. She was an inspiration, she had this appetite for life, and I think I share that with her.\u201d Here is everything to know about Jayne Mansfield\u2019s five children: Jayne Marie Mansfield, Mikl\u00f3s \"Mickey\" Hargitay, Jr., Zolt\u00e1n Hargitay, Mariska Hargitay and Antonio \u201cTony\u201d Cimber. They grew up in a \u201cPink Palace\u201d Pink was Mansfield\u2019s signature color \u2014 she turned heads with her pink wedding gown when she married Mickey Sr. \u2014 and she wanted it all around her. After their 1958 wedding, she and Mickey Sr. moved into a home on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles that they remodeled themselves and called the \u201cpink palace,\u201d according to Architectural Digest. The all-pink aesthetic extended to everything from the wall surrounding the compound to the sparkling pink paint they used on the home\u2019s exterior. The maximalist property even had a heart-shaped pool that Mickey Sr. tiled with \u201cI love you, Jaynie\u201d at the bottom. Zolt\u00e1n was involved in a serious accident at a zoo On Nov. 23, 1966, Mansfield took Zolt\u00e1n to Jungleland U.S.A., a private zoo in Sherman Oaks, Calif. According to the Associated Press, the actor was posing for photos when a lion attacked Zolt\u00e1n from behind, biting his neck and head, causing severe enough injuries for the boy to need brain surgery. The then-6-year-old made a full recovery and Jungleland U.S.A. closed shortly after. Three of Mansfield\u2019s kids were in the car accident that killed her Early in the morning on June 29, 1967, Mansfield was traveling from a nightclub show in Biloxi, Miss. to New Orleans, where she was scheduled to make a television appearance that afternoon, according to The New York Times. Ronald Harrison, a driver for the nightclub, was behind the wheel; Mansfield and her attorney, Samuel Brody, were also in the front seat. Mickey Jr., Zolt\u00e1n and Mariska were all asleep in the back seat. The car collided with the back of a trailer truck, killing the adults instantly. The kids were treated for minor injuries but were relatively unharmed. According to Mansfield's obituary in the Times, Harrison couldn\u2019t see the truck because it was obscured by a thick cloud of mosquito spray. In the wake of her death, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration called for mandatory underride bars, called \"Mansfield bars\" to be installed on the back of trailer trucks to prevent similar accidents. Mariska is an accomplished actress Mariska made her first television appearance in 1966, on an episode of The Merv Griffin Show, when she was just 2 years old \u2014 but it took many more years before she would land her breakout role on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. Mariska has now been on the show for over 25 years. \u201cI could have quit a million times, but my dad drilled into me that our family doesn\u2019t quit,\u201d she told Parade in 2019. \u201cSo if you don\u2019t get it, it means you\u2019re not ready and you have to get up and try again.\u201d The actress has since starred in Chicago P.D. and Law & Order: Organized Crime and received a Golden Globe just like her mother. Mickey Jr. owns a plant store Mickey Jr. opened Mickey Hargitay's Plants in 1980. \u201cAmong all the stars in Hollywood California, at Mickey's we are all reaching for the Earth!\u201d the plant nursery's website reads. \u201cFounded in 1980 we have come a long way; from collecting cactus, succulents and handmade macrame; to now an eclectic garden oasis in the heart of Los Angeles.\u201d Mickey Jr. spoke to the Los Angeles Times in 2016 about not following in his mom's acting footsteps. \u201c[My family] made decisions to reach for the stars and I\u2019ve wanted to keep my feet on the ground,\" he explained. \"I\u2019ve wanted to do something that seems more grounded and is more real.\u201d For Mickey Jr.'s birthday in December 2023, Mariska posted a photo of the duo on Instagram, and wrote, \u201cI love this guy so much. Best big bother. Soulful. Protective. Nurturing ... To watch somebody nurture plants is a thing of beauty.\u201d Mariska credits her father with teaching her to \u201clisten and learn\u201d After Mansfield\u2019s death, Mariska and her siblings lived with Mickey Sr. and his wife Ellen. \u201cI called her Mom,\u201d Mariska told Good Housekeeping in 2012. \u201cWe were blessed that she really embraced us and loved us so quickly. And I was very fortunate to have a maternal figure in my life after such a horrific accident.\u201d Mickey Sr. died in 2006, but Mariska has spoken extensively about her upbringing and the valuable lessons she learned from her father. \u201cMy dad taught me to listen and to learn,\u201d she told PEOPLE in 2018. \u201cAs a young kid, I had my antennas out for who had wisdom and why, and what was I supposed to learn from them, and why were they there? The way I\u2019ve been able to make sense of the cards I was dealt was to follow those signs.\u201d Jayne Marie appeared in Playboy Mansfield appeared in Playboy several times, including being Playmate of the Month in February 1955.

But Mariska said she wasn't interested in books about the actor. \u201cWhy should I read those? I lived with an encyclopedia\u2014my dad,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd my mom [Ellen] calls me up to tell me when one of her movies is on TV. My mother was a young knockout but she was also brilliant. She just gave the public what they wanted.\u201d Zolt\u00e1n works behind the scenes in the film industry Unlike his famous mother and sister, Zolt\u00e1n prefers to be behind the scenes.

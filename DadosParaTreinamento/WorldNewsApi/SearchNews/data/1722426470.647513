With advanced capabilities and performance that outdoes OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o, Google\u2019s Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Meta\u2019s LlaMA-400b, Claude 3.5 has been impressing scores of users across the Internet. Upon its launch, Anthropic said that the all-new Claude 3.5 Sonnet operates at twice the speed of the Claude 3 Opus introduced earlier this year. The company said that this performance boost, combined with cost-effective pricing, makes Claude 3.5 Sonnet the perfect AI model to handle complex tasks such as context-sensitive customer support and orchestrating multi-step workflows. Ever since its launch, various users on X have shared their experience with Claude 3.5 and have showcased its unique capabilities. In this article, we will explore how Anthropic\u2019s latest model is giving tough competition to OpenAI\u2019s most advanced model, GPT-4o. Artifacts feature Perhaps the most standout feature of Claude 3.5 Sonnet, apart from the performance, is the Artifacts feature, which expands how users can interact with Claude. This never-seen-before feature offers a dedicated window alongside conversations. While generating content like code snippets, text documents, or web design, users can now see a preview of the output. The feature creates a dynamic workspace where users can see, edit, and build upon Claude\u2019s creations in real-time while integrating AI-generated content into their workflows and projects. According to Anthropic, the new feature marks Claude\u2019s evolution from a conversational AI to a collaborative work environment. We're also launching a preview of Artifacts on You can ask Claude to generate docs, code, mermaid diagrams, vector graphics, or even simple games. Artifacts appear next to your chat, letting you see, iterate, and build on your creations in real-time. pic.twitter.com/ow77Jh7ebO \u2014 Anthropic (@AnthropicAI) June 20, 2024 Claude 3.5 Sonnet can play sound This feature is gaining a lot of attention in the AI community. Ammaar Reshi, design head at ElevenLabs, a software company, in his post on X, said that Claude 3.5 Sonnet is capable of playing sound. In his post, Reshi said that the Anthropic AI model used Eleven Labs API to create a functional AI sound effects generator app. He said that all he did was paste in the API documentation. Claude Sonnet 3.5 with Artifacts can also play sound! Using the @elevenlabs API it created a functional AI sound effects generator app, all I did was paste in the API documentation. I'm mind blown ?@AnthropicAI crushed it with this one. pic.twitter.com/tNmB23XYz3 \u2014 Ammaar Reshi (@ammaar) June 20, 2024 Insane coding abilities Another X user demonstrated Claude's incredible ability to generate code. Joao Montenegro created a 3D solar system simulation using the JavaScript libraries Three.js and Cannon.js in a single conversation. For the uninitiated, Three.js is a JavaScript library that allows users to create and display 3D graphics in the browser, while Cannon.js is a JavaScript physics engine that offers realistic physics simulations including collisions and other physical interactions. Joao, combined these two libraries to create a 3D model of the solar system where planets, moons, and other celestial objects are represented visually and also seen to interact with each other according to the laws of physics. claude 3.5 sonnet's coding abilities are insane. just made a threejs+cannonjs 3d solar system with physics and collisions in single conversation. \u2600\ufe0f?? pic.twitter.com/WJkHDP9vPK \u2014 Jo\u00e3o Montenegro (@JohnMontenegro) June 20, 2024 Unmatched reasoning capabilities Another user shared his experience with Claude Sonnet 3.5, hailing its exceptional reasoning capabilities. Canada-based marketing professional Muratcan Koylan uploaded a complex chat with prices of the US Dollar, S&P 500, and bank interest rates, along with a prompt for advanced reasoning. Based on his post, Claude accurately extracted the information and created a JSON file (a file format for storing and transporting data). The AI model offered a detailed correlation analysis, explaining relations and conditions that may alter them. He revealed that the predictions for interest rates, the US Dollar Index, and the S&P 500 were detailed and scenario-based. In his tweet, he highlighted how Claude Sonnet 3.5 surpasses GPT-4 in technical reasoning and prediction accuracy. I'm speechless. The new Anthropic model, Claude Sonnet 3.5 is the greatest model in reasoning capabilities. Here\u2019s my initial experiment: Setup and Context First, I uploaded a complex chat showing the prices of: - US Dollar - S&P 500 Index - Bank interest rate I added this\u2026 pic.twitter.com/EYrXQ6nGUz \u2014 Muratcan Koylan (@youraimarketer) June 20, 2024 Developing games from scratch It seems Claude 3.5 Sonnet is capable of much more than text generation and coding. Entrepreneur Pietro Schirano prompted Claude 3.5 Sonnet to create a quick-session game. The AI model came up with Colour Cascade, a game where players catch the correct colour from falling shapes. In his post, he hinted at the advanced capabilities of AI with this creation. I asked Claude 3.5 Sonnet to create a new and original game, designed to be played in quick sessions. It created Color Cascade: A game where you are supposed to catch the right color from a series of falling shapes. Feel the AGI yet? pic.twitter.com/IC3xhXrLAK \u2014 Pietro Schirano (@skirano) June 20, 2024 Solving pull requests Alex Albert from Anthropic AI took to his X account to demonstrate a pull request. He shared a demo video of Claude 3.5 Sonnet in action solving a simple pull request. In simple words, a pull request is when a developer asks to add code changes to a main project. The developer submits his updates for review, and his teammates can check the changes, discuss them, and decide if they should be added to the main code. Pull requests help in keeping the project organised ensuring good quality output. To start, if you want to see Claude 3.5 Sonnet in action solving a simple pull request, here's a quick demo video we made.

His demo shows a visually-appealing dashboard that offers real-time analysis. He also states that the Anthropic AI model cannot directly read formulas from the sheet, but it can understand the data and recreate the necessary formulas or logic on its own to give accurate outcomes. Claude 3, take this Excel Reverse Income Statement & make it a dashboard Make it nicer. Add the ability to do sensitivity analysis. All of this is real time. It diverges a bit from the spreadsheet because Claude can't read formulas, so it reconstructs the formulas itself (well) pic.twitter.com/uV92vX1cDH \u2014 Ethan Mollick (@emollick) June 20, 2024 Deep learning with Claude 3.5 Sonnet Elvis S an entrepreneur used Claude 3.5 Sonnet to create visualisations for deep learning concepts. He had to make many adjustments to improve the images\u2019 style and layout. However, he had to take a break as he reached the limit on the AI model. In his post, Elvis said that he found the tool to be amazing and hoped that it would make an animated version of the \u2018Dive into Deep Learning\u2019 book someday. Visualizing Deep Learning with Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Need to pause now because I will soon hit a message capacity on Claude. ? pic.twitter.com/TK3C0iXn5h \u2014 elvis (@omarsar0) June 20, 2024 In conclusion, Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.5 Sonnet seems to have emerged as a tough competitor in the AI landscape. Its advanced capabilities, from creating dynamic workscapes to making interactive content, show its superiority over its contemporaries. Claude 3.5 Sonnet is now available for free Claude.ai and the Claude iOS app. Moreover, subscribers to the Claude Pro and Team plans will get significantly higher rate limits. The AI model is also available via Anthropic API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud's Vertex AI.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/anthropic-claude-3-5-sonnet-vs-openai-gpt-4o-features-ai-model-9422240/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/Claude-1.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:39:30", "author": "Bijin Jose", "authors": ["Bijin Jose"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.312}

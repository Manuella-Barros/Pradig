What to know about Florida wrestling legend", "body": "Former president Donald Trump was seen with Ohio Senator J.D. Vance and embracing members of his family off stage at the Republican National Convention (RNC) in Milwaukee on Monday.\n\nProfessional wrestler and Florida man Hulk Hogan will speak tonight at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, according to reports from NBC.\n\nHogan, 70, is set to speak ahead of Donald Trump during the final day of the convention. The former president is expected to formally accept the Republican nomination for November's presidential election tonight as well.\n\nWho is Hulk Hogan?\n\nBorn Terry Gene Bollea in Augusta, Georgia, Hulk Hogan is one of the greatest -- certainly one of the most attention-getting -- professional wrestlers of all time.\n\n\"The key figure in WWE's rise from regional attraction to worldwide entertainment leader in the 1980s, The Hulkster's superhuman size and undeniable charisma set the standard for what a Superstar should be,\" WWE writes in Hogan's biography. \"A larger-than-life icon, he packed 93,173 WWE fans into the Pontiac Silverdome, won six WWE Championships, starred in movies, television shows and his own animated series and became an idol to a vast legion of fans he dubbed his Hulkamaniacs.\"\n\nAccording to Pro Wrestling Wiki, Hogan is a 12-time World Champion, including six WWF/WWE championships, six WCW World Heavyweight championships, and is a former WWE World Tag Team Champion with fellow wrestler Edge.\n\nIs Hulk Hogan retired from wrestling?\n\nAfter a 35-year career, Hogan officially retired from wrestling in 2012.\n\nIs Hulk Hogan a Republican?\n\nHogan is a registered Republican and has shared some of his voting history (supporting Obama in 2008 and Romney in 2012) and even declared his potential aspirations for running for office.\n\nAccording to The Hill, he said if he ever ran, he would run as a Republican but at the moment, he doesn't have any plans to actually run for president.\n\n\"I've thought about it -- as of late, people calling my phone, driving me crazy about running for Senate. They want me to run for governor, they want me to run for mayor,\" the former professional wrestling star told TMZ's Harvey Levin\n\nHow are Hulk Hogan and Donald Trump connected?\n\nAccording to the Ashbury Park Press, this won't be the first time Trump and the controversial pro wrestling star are teaming up.\n\nHogan competed at Wrestlemania IV and V, which were both held at Trump's Taj Mahal. Those events were held in 1988 and 1989. They're also both part of the WWE Hall of Fame.\n\nDoes Hulk Hogan live in Florida? Wrestler has restaurant in Clearwater Beach\n\nHe also owns \"Hogan's Hangout,\" a casual restaurant that has \"become a Clearwater Beach institution, brother.\"\n\nLast year, Hogan was baptized at Indian Rocks Baptist Church in Largo with his third wife, Sky.\n\n\"Total surrender and dedication to Jesus is the greatest day of my life. No worries, no hate, no judgment... only love,\" he wrote on Instagram.\n\nUSA TODAY will provide livestream coverage on YouTube each night of the RNC, Monday through Thursday.\n\nEach television network will handle coverage slightly differently.

in WWE broadcasts in the 1980s but became a part of the show's plot in the late 2000s.\n\nHe and McMahon acted out a feud on WWE's Monday Night Raw that climaxed at WrestleMania 23 when Trump shaved

But I just want to give you a taste. I'm here tonight because I want the world to know that Donald Trump is a real hero,\" he said.\n\nHogan's speech came less than a week after a shooter tried to assassinate Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania. \"What happened last week when they took a shot at my hero and they tried to kill the next President of the United States?\" Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, said. \"Enough was enough. Run wild brother.

Milwaukee that also includes Dana White, CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship and Linda McMahon, former CEO of WWE, the professional wrestling promotion company.\n\nEarlier this week, Republican senator Byron Donalds referenced the WWE star when he said delegates should expect Trump's entrance on Thursday to look like \"Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania\".\n\nThe 70-year-old, who captivated millions of wrestling fans worldwide at the peak of his career in the 1980s and early 1990s, has often spoken of his interest in presidential politics.\n\n\"We need somebody in there that's got some common sense, you know what I'm saying?\" Mr Hogan, 70, told Fox & Friends last month. \"So if you need a president or a vice president, I'll volunteer and take this country over, and I'll rule with an iron fist.\"\n\nMr Hogan is also a longstanding Trump supporter who recently joined the chorus of condemnation over the attempted assassination of the former president.\n\nPreviously, he backed then Democrat presidential hopeful Barack Obama in 2008 but switched to Mitt Romney, his Republican opponent, in 2012.\n\nBeyond the ring, Mr Hogan has been involved in a string of high-profile controversies.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, he was implicated in a federal investigation into steroid distribution by WWE.\n\nIn 1991, he admitted on the Arsenio Hall Show to using steroids for medical purposes but denied using them to enhance his wrestling performance.\n\nIn 2015, a video made public by The National Enquirer revealed Mr Hogan making controversial remarks, including using a racial slur while discussing his daughter's partner.\n\nIn the video, recorded in 2007, Mr Hogan said: \"I guess we're all a little racist.\"\n\nWWE terminated Mr Hogan's contract and removed references to him from their website and Hall of Fame, but he was reinstated in 2018 after the company said he deserved a \"second chance\".\n\nIn 2012, a sex tape featuring Mr Hogan and Heather Clem, the wife of his friend Bubba the Love Sponge, was leaked, with Gawker Media publishing a portion of it.\n\nMr Hogan sued Gawker for invasion of privacy, leading to a highly publicised trial.\n\nIn 2016, Mr Hogan won the lawsuit, resulting in a $140 million (\u00a3107 million) judgment against Gawker, which led to the company's bankruptcy.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo

speech since assassination attempt", "body": "Wrestling icon will appear on final day of Republican National Convention as Donald Trump formally accepts party's nomination for president\n\nWrestling icon Hulk Hogan will warm-up the crowd before Donald Trump formally accepts the Republican Party's nomination for president.\n\nHe will join a fight-themed speaking line-up on the final day of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee that also includes Dana White, CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship and Linda McMahon, former CEO of WWE, the professional wrestling promotion company.\n\nEarlier this week, Republican senator Byron Donalds referenced the WWE star when he said delegates should expect Trump's entrance on Thursday to look like \"Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania\".\n\nThe 70-year-old, who captivated millions of wrestling fans worldwide at the peak of his career in the 1980s and early 1990s, has often spoken of his interest in presidential politics.\n\n\"We need somebody in there that's got some common sense, you know what I'm saying?\" Mr Hogan, 70, told Fox & Friends last month. \"So if you need a president or a vice president, I'll volunteer and take this country over, and I'll rule with an iron fist.\"\n\nMr Hogan is also a longstanding Trump supporter who recently joined the chorus of condemnation over the attempted assassination of the former president.\n\nPreviously, he backed then Democrat presidential hopeful Barack Obama in 2008 but switched to Mitt Romney, his Republican opponent, in 2012.\n\nBeyond the ring, Mr Hogan has been involved in a string of high-profile controversies.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, he was implicated in a federal investigation into steroid distribution by WWE.\n\nIn 1991, he admitted on the Arsenio Hall Show to using steroids for medical purposes but denied using them to enhance his wrestling performance.\n\nIn 2015, a video made public by The National Enquirer revealed Mr Hogan making controversial remarks, including using a racial slur while discussing his daughter's partner.\n\nIn the video, recorded in 2007, Mr Hogan said: \"I guess we're all a little racist.\"\n\nWWE terminated Mr Hogan's contract and removed references to him from their website and Hall of Fame, but he was reinstated in 2018 after the company said he deserved a \"second chance\".\n\nIn 2012, a sex tape featuring Mr Hogan and Heather Clem, the wife of his friend Bubba the Love Sponge, was leaked, with Gawker Media publishing a portion of it.\n\nMr Hogan sued Gawker for invasion of privacy, leading to a highly publicised trial.\n\nIn 2016, Mr Hogan won the lawsuit, resulting in a $140 million (\u00a3107 million) judgment against Gawker, which led to the company's bankruptcy.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "verity_bowman@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Verity Bowman", "type": "author",

But after everything that's happened to our country over the past four years and everything that happened last weekend, I can no longer stay silent.\"\n\nThen, in a fired-up wrestling-style promo, Hogan removed his suit jacket and said, \"But what happened last week, when they took a shot at my hero, and they tried to kill the next president of the United States, enough was enough!\"\n\nHe then ripped off his vest to reveal a red Trump-Vance tank top underneath. \"Let Trump-a-mania run wild, brother. Let Trump-a-mania rule again. Let Trump-a-mania make America great again,\" he continued as the crowd erupted in cheers.\n\nTrump was seen raising his fist in the air in reaction to Hogan's speech, and he even blew him a kiss. Of course, the Republican presidential candidate is no stranger to wrestling; he is also a member of the WWE Hall of Fame and famously appeared at WrestleMania 23, where he took a Stone Cold Stunner from Steve Austin.\n\nTrump blowing Hulk Hogan a kiss is one of the greatest 10 seconds ever pic.twitter.com/FandUXf56C -- meme bastard (@mask_bastard) July 19, 2024\n\nOnline reactions to Hogan's speech ranged from ridicule to shock that this was actually happening.\n\n\"Wrestling historians will note this is actually the first time in history Hulk Hogan is putting someone over,\" quipped one X user, referring to how Hogan rarely lost his wrestling matches.\n\n\"Now is a good time to remind everyone that Hulk Hogan was fired from WWE because he got caught calling black people the n-word,\" wrote another.\n\n\"Hulk Hogan is on stage now, in case you're wondering how serious this country is,\" said one commenter.\n\nAnother added, \"We are close to Idiocracy becoming a full fledged prophecy.\"\n\n\"The final season of America is getting even more insane.

That includes former Trump cabinet member Linda McMahon, fellow WWE Hall of Fame star Hulk Hogan, and UFC's head honcho Dana White, per John Pollock.\n\nNBC Chicago provides a schedule of when you can expect to see them on stage. McMahon's speech is listed at 7:29 pm ET, Hogan is at 8:54 pm ET, and White goes on at 9:53 pm ET, as the last speaker before Donald Trump.\n\nFor what it's worth, WWE Hall of Famer Kid Rock is expected to perform between White and Trump's speeches.\n\nHogan has a reputation in the wrestling world for telling lies and putting himself over, so he'll likely fit right in on the political stage. During the handful of times I've heard Hogan discuss politics from the 1990's through today, he always brings up his support for a flat tax in the United States. Perhaps he'll find a way to slip tax reform into his speech tonight as he tries to help Donald drop the leg on Joe Biden and win the 2024 election, as the former president is favored to do based on current polling.\n\nDo you plan to check out what Hulk Hogan has to say at the RNC tonight, Cagesiders?", "source": {"uri": "cagesideseats.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cageside Seats"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cain_a_knight@cagesideseats.com", "name": "Cain A.

Hulk Hogan gave a speech on stage in his familiar style supporting Trump.\n\nIn a viral moment, Hogan ripped off his shirt to reveal a Trump-Vance T-shirt underneath, sending the crowd into a frenzy. Hogan, whose real name is Terry Gene Bollea, compared the partnership of Trump and his vice-presidential running mate JD Vance to his legendary tag team -- The Mega Powers. His tag \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage: The Mega Powers.\n\nHogan mentioned Trump's assassination bid. \"They took a shot at my hero. They shot to kill the next President of the United States,\" he said.\n\nWith his signature bravado, Hogan said, \"Let Trump-a-mania run wild, brother! Let Trump-a-mania make America great again!\" \"With our leader up there, my hero, that gladiator, we're gonna bring America back together,\" the 1980s icon said on stage at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. The superstar's high-energy speech whipped up the audience, cementing his support for Trump's presidential bid.\n\nWWE is popular not only in America but all over the world.

claiming \"we never had it better than the Trump years.\"\n\n\"He's going to win in November, and we're all going to be champions again when he wins,\" Hogan said. \"When he's back in our White House, America is going to start winning again.\"\n\nTrump, still wearing a bandage over his wounded ear, smiled and clapped along with the audience, before blowing his air-kiss to Hogan as the wrestler left the stage to rapturous applause.\n\nBut several more users also found the gesture odd, with user Harry Sisson writing: \"EW EW EW!\"\n\n\"Trump blowing a kiss to Hulk Hogan is such a weirdo

All those stories pale in comparison today, however, as the Hulkster entered the news again for a reason that will surely be, in no shape or form, controversial to his millions of Hulkamaniacs.\n\nIn a tweet early Thursday morning, MSNBC reported that two senior campaign officials of former Presidential candidate Donald Trump had confirmed Hogan would be speaking today at the final day of the Republican National Convention. Not only that, but Hogan would be featured in a prime spot, speaking just before Trump would appear to formally accept the Republican nomination.\n\nAs it turns out, Hogan is one of several speakers today that are connected, or formerly connected, with WWE. John Pollock of POST Wrestling later tweeted that also scheduled to speak are Linda McMahon, former WWE President and wife of disgraced former WWE Chairman Vince McMahon, and Dana White, CEO and President of UFC, WWE's sister company via TKO Holdings.\n\nThis is not the first time Hogan has come out in support of his fellow WWE Hall of Famer, as the Hulkster had previously endorsed Trump when he successfully ran for President in 2016, with Hogan even jokingly suggesting that he could be Trump's running mate. Hogan himself is no stranger to Presidential campaigns, having announced in 1998 that he would be running for President while a member of WCW, though it was later revealed to be a publicity stunt.", "source": {"uri": "wrestlinginc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wrestling Inc."}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulk Hogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WWE Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Audio_Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Live Audio Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_McMahon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linda McMahon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publicity_stunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Publicity stunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_authority_figures", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling authority figures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_McMahon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vince McMahon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Championship_Wrestling", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Championship Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_White", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dana White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.wrestlinginc.com/img/gallery/report-wwe-hall-of-famer-hulk-hogan-to-speak-at-republican-national-convention/l-intro-1721316345.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744072", "eventUri": "eng-9744072", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Hogan said his speech came from the heart and wound up not using the teleprompter. Hogan shared that after he came off the stage, he was so emotional and when he ran into Eric Trump, whom he hadn't seen since he was six years old, he broke down and cried like a baby.\n\nWhen asked about his initial reaction to seeing the assassination attempt on Donald Trump, Hogan says he had all these questions: Who dropped the ball? Why did this happen? Hogan added, he used to be afraid to wear a Trump shirt or put a Trump poster in his yard but after Trump was shot, those days are over. Hogan concedes that while Trump has a personality some don't love, he believes Trump loves America and is a quality person. Hogan also discussed his long friendship with Donald Trump, going back to when Trump Plaza hosted Wrestlemania 4 & 5 and how Trump helped him when he was getting Hulkamania rolling.\n\nListen here", "source": {"uri": "radio.foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX News Radio"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_caterina@radio.foxnews.com", "name": "Peter Caterina", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulk Hogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprompter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Teleprompter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kilmeade", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Kilmeade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eric Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania_IV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania IV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Plaza_Hotel_and_Casino", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://static.foxnews.com/radio.foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/07/Hulk-Hogan-BK-scaled.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744072", "eventUri": "eng-9744072", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Trump is expected to accept his nomination tonight as the GOP presidential candidate facing President Joe Biden in November.\n\nTerry Gene Bollea, far better known by his ring name Hogan, helped propel the professional wrestling promotion and media organization World Wrestling Entertainment, or WWE, to fame. He won six WWE championships, starred in movies and television shows and cultivated a mass of fans he dubbed his \"Hulkamaniacs,\" according to his WWE bio.\n\nIn 2015, WWE cut ties with Hogan after audio was released of him repeatedly using a racial slur to describe a man his daughter was involved with at the time. Three years later, the company reinstated him into its Hall of Fame, saying he deserved a second chance after apologizing.\n\nIn mid-June, Hogan said in an interview with Fox News he'd be willing to enter the political arena.\n\n\"If you need a president or vice president, I'll volunteer and take this country over, and I'll rule with an iron fist,\" he told hosts of the show \"Fox and Friends.\"\n\nThat wasn't the first time he's raised the idea. He was urged in 2018 to make a run for U.S. Senate in Florida, including by former Trump adviser Roger Stone. And in 1998, he famously announced he was stepping down from the world of professional wrestling to run for president, which later turned out to be a publicity stunt.\n\nOn Monday, Republican U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida made a prescient remark to a reporter from The Hill -- that Trump would make a heroic appearance at the first night of the convention following an attempt on his life in Pennsylvania over the weekend, saying, \"It's gonna be Hulk Hogan at Wrestlemania.\"", "source": {"uri": "jsonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Journal Sentinel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WWE Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulk Hogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_name", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ring name"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigger", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nigger"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Donalds", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Byron Donalds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Stone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roger Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_&_Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox & Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard Wrestling", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.jsonline.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/11/USAT/74053003007-1179076923.jpg?crop=4270,2402,x0,y427&width=1600&height=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744072", "eventUri": "eng-9744072", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Of course, the Republican presidential candidate is no stranger to wrestling; he is also a member of the WWE Hall of Fame and famously appeared at WrestleMania 23, where he took a Stone Cold Stunner from Steve Austin.\n\nOnline reactions to Hogan's speech ranged from ridicule to shock that this was actually happening.\n\n\"Wrestling historians will note this is actually the first time in history Hulk Hogan is putting someone over,\" quipped one X user, referring to how Hogan rarely lost his wrestling matches.\n\n\"Now is a good time to remind everyone that Hulk Hogan was fired from WWE because he got caught calling black people the n-word,\" wrote another.\n\n\"Hulk Hogan is on stage now, in case you're wondering how serious this country is,\" said one commenter.\n\nAnother added, \"We are close to Idiocracy becoming a full fledged prophecy.\"\n\n\"The final season of America is getting even more insane.

Vance to the dynamic duo act he once performed with \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage, known as The Mega Powers. Emulating his wrestling persona, the 70-year-old Hogan tore off his outer T-shirt to reveal a red one underneath, showcasing the Trump-Vance presidential ticket.\n\nAs he entered the packed auditorium filled with Republican delegates who had just nominated Trump as the party's presidential candidate, Hogan said he felt like he was in front of \"real Americans.\"\n\nHogan's endorsement comes despite a controversial past. Over a decade ago, he was involved in a scandal after an intimate video of him was leaked. Additionally, he faced backlash for his use of racist language, which led to his firing from World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in 2015, where he had won numerous major titles during his career.

The former president is expected to formally accept the Republican nomination for November's presidential election tonight as well.\n\nThe RNC has been taking place in Milwaukee since Monday, and Hogan joined a long slate of celebrities and political leaders who praised Trump, calling for voters to elect him as the the next president.\n\nBorn Terry Gene Bollea in Augusta, Georgia, Hulk Hogan is one of the greatest -- certainly one of the most attention-getting -- professional wrestlers of all time.\n\n\"The key figure in WWE's rise from regional attraction to worldwide entertainment leader in the 1980s, The Hulkster's superhuman size and undeniable charisma set the standard for what a Superstar should be,\" WWE writes in Hogan's biography. \"A larger-than-life icon, he packed 93,173 WWE fans into the Pontiac Silverdome, won six WWE Championships, starred in movies, television shows and his own animated series and became an idol to a vast legion of fans he dubbed his Hulkamaniacs.\"\n\nAccording to Pro Wrestling Wiki, Hogan is a 12-time World Champion, including six WWF/WWE championships, six WCW World Heavyweight championships, and is a former WWE World Tag Team Champion with fellow wrestler Edge.\n\nAfter a 35-year career, Hogan officially retired from wrestling in 2012.\n\nHogan is a registered Republican and has shared some of his voting history (supporting Obama in 2008 and Romney in 2012) and even declared his potential aspirations for running for office.\n\nAccording to The Hill, he said if he ever ran, he would run as a Republican but at the moment, he doesn't have any plans to actually run for president.\n\n\"I've thought about it -- as of late, people calling my phone, driving me crazy about running for Senate. They want me to run for governor, they want me to run for mayor,\" the former professional wrestling star told TMZ's Harvey Levin\n\nAccording to the Ashbury Park Press, this won't be the first time Trump and the controversial pro wrestling star are teaming up.\n\nHogan competed at Wrestlemania IV and V, which were both held at Trump's Taj Mahal. Those events were held in 1988 and 1989. They're also both part of the WWE Hall of Fame.\n\nUSA TODAY will provide livestream coverage on YouTube each night of the RNC, Monday through Thursday.\n\nContributing: C. A.

The former wrestler a bizarre speech as he spoke highly of the former President. However, the crowd didn't stop cheering until Hogan made a theatrical statement by taking his blazer off and ripping the t-shirt as he endorsed the business mogul. While many welcomed Hogan's gesture for Trump, few others wondered how much 'he got paid' to do so.\n\nRevealing an orange Trump-Vance t-shirt underneath Hogan screamed, \"Enough is enough. Let Trumpamania rule again. Let Trumpamania make America great again!\" as reported by Politico. The spotlight of the night fell on Hogan when he condemned the recent rifle attack on Trump at the Butler rally. \"I think about how Donald Trump and his family were compromised. When I look out there and I see Donald Trump, I think about how his business was compromised.\" Roaring louder on the mic Hogan said, \"But what happened last week when they took a shot at my hero, and they tried to kill the next president of the United States, enough was enough!\"\n\nTaking up the stage congratulating the ex-POTUS on his formal nomination by the Republican Party Hogan said, \"When I came here tonight, there was so much energy in this room, I felt maybe I was in Madison Square Garden getting ready to win another world title... but what I found out was I was in a room full of real Americans, brother. And at the end of the day, with our leader up there, my hero, that gladiator, we're gonna bring America back together, one real American at a time, brother,\" according to Entertainment Weekly. One Internet user questioned, \"I wonder how much they paid Hulk Hogan to rip off his shirt awkwardly.\" Another one said. \"Hulk Hogan literally admitted he is a paid entertainer.\"\n\nComparing Trump to his running mate J.D. Vance to himself and his old pal Mancho Man Randy Savage Hogan said, \"You know somethin', I've seen some great tag-teams in my time: Hulk Hogan and oooh yeah, the Macho Man Randy Savage. But you know somethin'? I see the greatest tag team of my life standing upon us, getting ready to straighten this country out for all the real Americans.\" Giving the Republican frontrunner a stage name Hogan continued, \"Even though you guys are real Americans, you better get ready because when Donald Dick J. Trump becomes the president of the United States, all the real Americans are gonna be nicknamed Trumpites.\"\n\nThrowing shade on the Democrats, Hogan cheered calling Trump supporters Trumpites, which is infamously used by the Democrats supporters. \"Because all the Trumpites are gonna be runnin' wild for four years. So with the power of Donald J. Trump and all the Trumpites runnin' wild, America is gonna get back on track, as Donald J. Trump said: America is gonna be great again,\" he said. The former entertainer called the 45th President the \"toughest of them all.\" \"They've thrown everything at Donald Trump -- all the investigations, the impeachments, the court cases -- and he's still standing and kicking their butts.

Let Trump-a-mania rule again. Let Trump-a-mania make America great again,\" he continued as the crowd erupted in cheers.\n\nTrump was seen raising his fist in the air in reaction to Hogan's speech, and he even blew him a kiss.

The shooter was killed by Secret Service countersnipers.\n\nOther figures from the wrestling and combat sports worlds are slated to speak at the convention Thursday, including Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White, and Linda McMahon, who co-founded WWE with her husband, Vince McMahon, and who served as Trump's small business administrator during his first term.\n\nHogan has himself previously toyed with a political run and even said earlier this year that he would consider entering the political ring if he's asked to do so.\n\n\"Hey, you never know,\" Hogan said in a NewsNation interview in June when asked if he could take up a role at the White House. \"Right now, I'd make a great vice president, brother, because I do have common sense.

Check out the wild clip of his promo here...\n\nUnless you've been living under a rock, chances are you've heard about the recent assassination attempt on former U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nNow wearing a bandage on his ear following the incident, Trump has been taking centre stage at the Republican National Convention this week and has had plenty of noteworthy supporters on hand. However, we'd be willing to bet you didn't count on WWE Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan being among them!\n\nHogan is a longtime supporter of Trump, but in a clip that's gone viral over the past 12 hours or so, he's seen hitting the Republican National Convention stage to his classic WWE theme song before delivering a rousing promo about the Republican nominee.\n\nThe impassioned Hogan told attendees, \"What happened last week...when they took a shot at my hero...They tried to kill the greatest president of the United States! Enough was enough!\"\n\nWith that, he tore off his shirt to reveal another - a Trump/Vance 2024 t-shirt - beneath it.\n\nHe'd also tell the crowd, \"Over my career, I've been in the ring with some of the biggest, some of the baddest dudes on the planet, and I've squared off against warriors, ooh yeah, savages.\"\n\n\"And I've even, like I said, body-slammed giants in the middle of the ring. And I know tough guys, but let me tell you something, brother, Donald Trump is the toughest of them all,\" Hogan continued. \"All you criminals, all you lowlifes, all you scumbags... Whatcha gonna do when Donald Trump and all the Trumpamaniacs run wild on you, brother?\"\n\nAfter explaining why he's chosen to openly campaign for someone he claims to have been friends with for 35 years (it's always hard to say with Hogan; he's become infamous for telling tall tales and once said he worked 400 days in a single year), the wrestler bellowed, \"Let Trump-O-Mania rule again, let Trump-O-Mania make America great again!\n\nIf you're wondering why Hogan was there to introduce Trump, it's likely because the Presidential candidate is a longtime pro wrestling fan. He's been involved in a few high-profile WWE storylines, primarily with his longtime friend and former WWE Chairman Vince McMahon.\n\nHogan remains a divisive figure among wrestling fans; a 2015 leaked video saw him making racist comments about his daughter's then-boyfriend, prompting WWE to cut ties with him.

Hulk Hogan to speak at RNC on behalf of Donald Trump", "body": "According to published reports, Hulk Hogan will speak tonight (July 18) at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. Former President Donald Trump is expected to formally accept the Republican nomination for November's presidential election tonight as well.\n\nThis isn't the first time Trump and the controversial pro wrestling star were a tag team.\n\nHogan competed at Wrestlemania IV and V, which were both held at Trump's Taj Mahal. Those events were held in 1988 and 1989.\n\nThey're also both part of the WWE Hall of Fame.\n\nHogan has plenty of pros and a lot of cons, which makes him an odd choice as a speaker.\n\nOne of the most popular athletes of all time, Hogan's star faded in recent years after he was caught using a racial slur on video -- the same video that was released of him having consensual sex with his friend's wife.\n\nGawker released the video. Hogan won $31 million in a lawsuit with the media company, but it cost him some of his credibility.\n\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment distanced itself from Hogan after the incident, which happened a little over a decade ago. But since then he has worked to rebuild his reputation, and is now back with WWE during big events.\n\nHulk Hogan Sayings\n\nThis isn't the first time a wrestle spoke at the RNC.\n\nIn 2000, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson spoke at the Republican National Convention at the First Union Center in Philly. But Hogan has a unique speaking style. So let's take a look at things the \"Immoral\" one might say.\n\nWhatcha Gonna Do, USA?\n\nThis is probably his most famous saying. I guess this would be a good way to survey who people are voting for. Chances are most of the RNC are siding with Trump, so this is a safe one.\n\nBrother\n\nHogan calls everyone brother, brother! Sometimes he throws Jack in there, but most people are his brother. He's never used sister, but that could be problematic tonight because there will be women there. Oh brother!\n\nTrain, say your prayers and vote for Donald!\n\nThe third part of that saying, of course is \"take your vitamins,\" but it's 2024, people know what they have to take to stay healthy. Throwing Donald in there would keep the bulk of the same message while including the reason he's there.\"\n\nBiden doesn't work for me, brother!\n\nDon't tell anyone but wrestling is fixed. Rumor has it whenever Hogan, who was one of the most popular wrestlers of all time and a master politician behind the curtain, would say \"this doesn't work for me, brother\" when his character was to look bad and, gasp, lose a predetermined match.\n\nTouting Donald's 24-inch pythons\n\nHogan's pythons are his biceps. He says they measure 24 inches around. Trump's don't, but neither did Hogan's. Wrestling is a lot like politics.\n\nTrumpamania running wild\n\nHogans fans were Hulkamaniacs.

Hogan referred to all of these so-called real Americans as \"Trumpites\" multiple times.\n\nThe most memorable part of the speech happened before the mid-way point, where Hogan focused on this past weekend's failed assassination attempt on Trump before raising his voice and ripping his shirt off, declaring that Trumpamania will run wild and rule again:\n\nHogan went on to say Trump has \"always been the biggest patriot, and he still is,\" somehow forgetting the part where Trump has been lying to every American for nearly four years about losing the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden, and incited an insurrection on the US Capitol in an effort to promote that lie and protect his fragile ego.\n\nHogan ended the speech by saying that Trump and all the Trumpamaniacs will run wild on \"all you criminals, all you lowlifes, all you scumbags, all you drug-dealers, and all you crooked politicians\" when Donald wins the presidency again, somehow forgetting the part where Trump is the only former president who later became a convicted felon.\n\nAt any rate, here's the full speech from the Hulkster if you want to check it out:\n\nWhat's your reaction to Hogan's wild RNC speech, Cagesiders?", "source": {"uri": "cagesideseats.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cageside Seats"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cain_a_knight@cagesideseats.com", "name": "Cain A.

He performed his iconic T-shirt rip, exciting the crowd with chants of 'USA!' and declared Trump his hero, promising to 'bring America back together.'\n\nRetired professional wrestler Hulk Hogan brought back his World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) persona on stage Friday at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee to support former President Donald Trump. Before Trump accepted the Republican nomination, the WWE Hall of Famer, dressed in a navy blue suit, sunglasses, and a red bandana, took to the stage to endorse him.\n\nHogan, sporting his trademark blond handlebar mustache, delivered a highly energetic speech. He removed his jacket to reveal a sleeveless black shirt emblazoned with 'real American.' He then performed his iconic T-shirt rip.\n\nBeneath the black shirt, he showcased a Trump/Vance Red Hulk Hogan T-shirt, declaring he'd seen 'the greatest tag team of my life.' Pointing to Trump in the audience, Hogan exclaimed, 'With our leader up there, my hero, that gladiator, we are gonna bring America back together. One real American at a time, brother!'\n\nThe crowd roared 'USA, USA' at Hogan's antics. Hogan, whose real name is Terry G. Bollea, called Trump his 'hero' and added, 'But what happened last week when they took a shot at my hero and tried to kill the president of the United States, enough was enough,' Hogan said.\n\n'Let Trump-O-Mania rule again; let Trump-O-Mania make America great again,' he roared to cheers from the crowd. Trump attended the convention after a shooter attempted to assassinate him at a Milwaukee rally last week.\n\nAfter ducking to the ground as a bullet grazed his ear, Trump rose and raised his fist, shouting 'fight! fight! fight!' before U.S. Secret Service personnel formed a protective ring around him and escorted him away safely. Earlier this week, Trump selected J.D. Vance as his running mate for the November 5 presidential election.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WWE Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulk Hogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "T-shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tag team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Days later, on July 18, Hogan brought Hulkamania to the Republican National Conference by speaking on how the shooting at the Trump rally had left him enraged. \"When they took a shot at my hero. And they tried to kill the next president of the United States. Enough was enough,\" Hogan said during his speech. \"And I said, 'Let Trumpamania run wild, brother,'\" he added while taking off his blazer and tearing off his t-shirt to reveal a Trump-Pence shirt underneath.\n\nThe WWE theatrics left people both buzzing, and befuddled. \"It really feels like we are living in a giant movie right now,\" one X, formerly Twitter, user wrote. Several pro-Trumpers thought it was a patriotic gesture. \"God this gets my American blood PUMPING,\" an X user commented. \"I am sorry, but [Hulk Hogan] is one of the most American things there is,\" another added. \"Why does watching Hulk Hogan hulk out never get old?\" a person wrote.\n\nTrump showed his softer side at the RNC, and was so moved by the speech that he rose to his feet and blew an air-kiss to show his appreciation.

In his address, Hogan urged, \"I want All the Hulkmaniancs to live the American dream too.\"\n\nHogan rallied against the Biden administration, saying: \"We never had it better than the Trump years, we had safety, we had peace...

I said 'Let Trumpmania run wild brother, let Trumpmania rule again, let Trumpmania make America great again',\" before ripping his shirt in two.\n\nBehind the scenes, two top campaign aides disclosed to NBC that the 70 year old wrestling veteran would make an appearance at the RNC's last day to make remarks before Trump's eagerly awaited acceptance speech. The evening marked Trump's first public speaking event since an assassination attempt was made against him at a Butler, Pennsylvania rally, reports the Mirror US.\n\nAnd while Trump escaped with only minor injuries, the dreadful assault tragically claimed the life of 50 year old Corey Comperatore and critically injured two others. In response to this tragedy, Hogan aired his condemnation of the brutal act on social media as he expressed support for Trump.\n\nThat Saturday night, Hogan quickly took to Instagram to post a trending picture of an embattled Trump, head held high and fist raised, whilst blood streamed down from a grazed ear inflicted by a bullet on stage.\n\nUnderneath the harrowing image, Hogan delivered a message to his 2.5 million followers that stated: \"Today's events in Butler, Pennsylvania are deeply disturbing. No President, past or present, should face such a horrific act.\"\n\nThe wrestler-turned-actor who hails from Florida continued: \"Our thoughts and prayers are with President Trump, law enforcement and the Secret Service who bravely protect and uphold our shared values.\"\n\nHogan was expected too to the stage at the Republican National Convention on Thursday, July 18, between 7.30pm and 8pm CT.\n\nThe wrestling star and '80s icon shared the stage with two other distinguished guest speakers - Carrie Ruiz, GM of golf at Trump National Doral in Miami, and Annette Albright, a previous

The can depicts a wrestler waving an American flag, and Hogan said he hopes to \"bring America back together, one beer at a time.\"\n\nIn 2015, he was fired from WWE for using the N-word to describe his daughter's then-boyfriend years earlier. He released a brief statement at the time apologizing for using \"language that is offensive and inconsistent with my beliefs.\"\n\nHogan speaking at the RNC emphasizes the degree to which Trump has turned Republican politics into something akin to professional wrestling, injecting it with name-calling, ostentatious theatrics, and a glitzy cast of characters. One of those characters is Kid Rock, who will also appear at the RNC on Thursday. \"You fuck with Trump, you fuck with me!\" Kid Rock said in a video posted to X following the assassination attempt against the former president on Saturday.\n\nMAGA lawmakers are on board with all of this. On Monday, Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) said people should expect Trump's entrance to look like \"Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania.\"", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "catherina_gioino@rollingstone.com", "name": "Catherina Gioino", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulk Hogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_&_Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox & Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Beer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Mulvaney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dylan Mulvaney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Donalds", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Byron Donalds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WWE Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_Rock", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kid Rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigger", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigger"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand_Games/Thumb_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand Games/Thumb Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/hulk-hogan-at-rnc.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744072", "eventUri": "eng-9744072", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

During his speech, Hogan also pronounced the Republican presidential nominee -- and WWE Hall of Famer -- a \"hero\" and \"gladiator.\"\n\n\"When I came here tonight, there was so much energy in this room I felt maybe I was in Madison Square Garden getting ready to win another world title,\" said Hogan, born Terry Bollea, in kicking off his speech. \"But what I found out was I was in a room of real Americans, brother.\" (Thus arrived the first of many references to Hogan's longtime entrance theme, \"Real American.\")\n\nThe WWE in 2015 terminated its contract with Hogan after it was reported that he had been videotaped using a racial slur. That year, the wrestling star told TMZ he had no \"hard feelings\" toward the organization -- and expressed a desire to be Trump's running mate. Still, Hogan on Thursday gave his blessing to vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance, calling the Republican ticket \"the greatest tag team\" he'd ever seen.\n\nThen, when he broached Saturday's attempted assassination of Trump, Hogan went full-throttle on the theatrics.\n\nTearing his shirt to reveal a MAGA-red Trump-Vance muscle tank underneath, he cried, \"Let Trumpamania run wild, brother. Let Trumpamania rule again. Let Trumpamania make America great again.\" Trump blew him a kiss.\n\n\"As an entertainer, I try to stay out of politics, but after everything that's happened to our country over the past four years, and everything that happened last weekend, I can no longer stay silent,\" Hogan said. \"I'm here tonight because I want the world to know that Donald Trump is a real American hero, and I'm proud to support my hero as the next president of this United States.\"\n\nHogan went on to laud Trump for his commitment to running for office despite his dual impeachments and criminal and civil cases: \"I know tough guys, but let me tell you something, brother. Donald Trump is the toughest of them all.\"\n\nHe capped off his endorsement with a play on his catchphrase, \"Whatcha gonna do when Hulkamania runs wild on you?\"\n\n\"Whatcha gonna do when Donald Trump and all the Trumpamaniacs run wild on you, brother?\" he roared, to the crowd's delight.\n\nBut Hogan was only the first of two sports-entertainment figureheads to take the RNC stage Thursday night.\n\nLater in the evening, at Trump's personal request, Dana White, president and chief executive of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, introduced the presidential nominee, calling him a \"fighter\" and \"real American badass.\"\n\n\"I'm in the tough-guy business, and this man is the toughest, most resilient human being that I've ever met in my life,\" White said.\n\nTrump then addressed the RNC's 50,000 attendees -- many of whom had donned ear bandages to match his own.\n\n\"Together, we will save this country, we will restore the republic, and we will usher in the rich and wonderful tomorrows that our people so truly deserve,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulk Hogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "WWE Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gladiator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

One man that joined in on the praise was one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time, Hulk Hogan.\n\n'Hulkamania' is a two-time WWE Hall-of-Fame inductee for the incredible work he put in over the years. Though retired, the 70-year-old remains a global star, and he just used his electrifying stature to deliver a fiery speech for former President Trump.\n\nSince getting shot and demanding Americans fight, Donald Trump has been the center of attention, and rightly so. As Trump battles to be reinstated into the White House, supporters are beginning to speak up and Hulk Hogan is just the latest.\n\n\"Well, let me tell you something, brother...\" a fired up Hogan said during his speech for Trump. \"At the end of the day, with our leader up there, my hero, that gladiator, we're going to bring America back together. One real American at a time.\"\n\n\"I've seen some great tag teams in my time. Hulk Hogan and 'The Macho Man' Randy Savage. But you know something, I see the greatest tag team of my life, standing upon us, getting ready to straighten this country out for all the real Americans.\"\n\n\"You better get ready because when Donald J. Trump becomes the president of the United States, all the real Americans are going to be nicknamed 'Trumpites'.\"\n\n\"So, with the power of Donald J. Trump, and all the 'Trumpites' running wild, America is going to get back on track. And like Donald J. Trump said, America is going to be great again.\"\n\nHogan then ramped up his speech, cutting a memorable promo and tearing his top apart, reminiscent of the old days.\n\n\"I think about how Donald Trump, his family was compromised. When I look out there and I see Donald Trump, I think about ow his business was compromised.\"\n\n\"But what happened last week, when they took a shot at my hero, and they tried to kill the next president of the United States. Enough was enough and I said, let Trumpamania run wild, brother. Let Trumpamania rule again. Let Trumpamania make America great again.\"\n\n\"As an entertainer, I tried to stay out of politics. But after everything that's happened to our country over the past four years, and everything that happened last weekend, I can no longer stay silent.\"\n\n\"I'm here tonight because I want the world to know that Donald Trump is a real American hero. And I'm proud to support my hero as the next president of this United States.\"\n\nHogan continued, discussing the 2024 election and reminiscing on an old encounter with Trump.\n\n\"I've known Donald Trump for over 35 years...\" Hogan said. \"The last time I was up on stage, Donald Trump was sitting at ringside at the Trump Plaza. I was bleeding like a pig and I won the world title, right in front of Donald J. Trump.\"\n\n\"And you know something, he's going to win in November, and we're all going to be champions again when he wins. And like I said, I've known that man for over 35 years and he's always been the biggest Patriot, and he still is...\"\n\n\"No matter the odds, he always finds a way to win. And when he's back in our White House, America is going to start winning again.\"\n\nHogan's praise for Trump continued.\n\n\"I know tough guys, but let me tell you something, Donald Trump is the toughest of them all. They've thrown everything at Donald Trump. All the investigations, the impeachments, the court cases, and he's still standing and kicking their birth.\"\n\n\"You know, we've never had it better than the Trump years. Back then, we has a thriving economy, we had strong borders, we had safe streets, we had peace and respect around the world.

Much like his wrestling matches of the past, his speech drew an enthusiastic response from the convention crowd.\n\nHogan's speech came less than a week after a shooter tried to assassinate Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania. \"What happened last week when they took a shot at my hero and they tried to kill the next President of the United States?\" Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, said. \"Enough was enough.

The wrestling icon's history of political involvement and support for Trump adds complexity to his legacy. Fans await Hogan's prominent role at the event, highlighting his enduring influence in both wrestling and politics.Hulk Hogan has used a variety of strategies to maintain his notoriety in recent years. Hogan has maintained his notoriety through a variety of actions, such as his public baptism, spousal opinion sharing, and even hints that he would enter the ring again despite getting close to seventy. These tales, though, pale in comparison to his most recent headline, which is expected to be noteworthy and maybe polarizing among his horde of adoring followers, or Hulkamaniacs.\n\nHogan's speech on the last day of the Republican National Convention was verified by two top campaign executives of former presidential candidate Donald Trump, MSNBC announced via Twitter early on Thursday morning.Not only will Hogan be speaking, but he will also be featured in a prominent position right before Trump officially accepts the Republican nomination, making this development noteworthy.\n\nHogan's participation is a part of a larger pattern of speakers at the event who have ties to the WWE. According to a tweet from John Pollock of POST Wrestling, Linda McMahon -- the ex-president of the WWE and the wife of the disgraced former chairman of the company -- will also be speaking with Hogan. Dana White, the CEO and President of the UFC -- a WWE sibling business via TKO Holdings -- joins them.\n\nNeither Hogan's entry into politics nor his support of Trump are new experiences for him. The Hulkster had previously backed Trump in his victorious bid for president in 2016. Hogan even made jokes at the time about becoming Trump's running mate. Moreover, Hogan has experience running for president. He declared his intention to run for president in 1998, while still affiliated with WCW, but it was eventually exposed as a publicity gimmick.\n\nHogan's complicated legacy will take on a new chapter with his impending participation at the Republican National Convention. Even though he is still adored by many fans of professional wrestling, controversy has arisen from his political supports and actions.\n\nIt is possible that his fan base's differing opinions will be amplified by his speech at such a prominent political gathering. While some will regard Hogan's involvement as just another example of his ability to maintain public visibility, others may see it as a continuation of his long-standing support for Trump.\n\nAll things considered, Hogan's speech at the Republican National Convention is a noteworthy occasion in the wrestling legend's career. It emphasizes his continuing impact and charisma, both on the political scene and in the wrestling ring. Hulk Hogan will once again be in the spotlight as millions of spectators tune in, demonstrating his exceptional ability to combine the realms of politics and entertainment.\n\nHulk Hogan fought his last match with Stone Cold Steve Austin on the 40th anniversary of his WWE Championship win against the Iron Sheik. He had said on The MMA Hour that he would fight one last match as he neared a old age of 70.\n\n\"Anything's possible,\" Hogan remarked, mentioning that his newfound focus on health and wellness has him feeling optimistic enough to entertain the idea. He expressed a willingness to wrestle \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin, explaining that his primary motivation for returning to wrestle The Rock in 2002 was the hope of eventually facing Austin in the ring. \"Me as a bad guy, as Hollywood Hogan, I could've tore the house down with him, because he was the ultimate good guy at that time,\" Hogan stated. He noted that Austin was in poor physical condition in 2002 and that Austin's infamous departure from WWE that summer prevented them from ever engaging in a significant storyline together.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "raunak_bose@timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "name": "Raunak Bose", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulk Hogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "WWE Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Pollock_(journalist)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Pollock (journalist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimmick_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gimmick (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Audio_Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Live Audio Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_McMahon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Linda McMahon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Championship_Wrestling", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Championship Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_White", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dana White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMA_Fighting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MMA Fighting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Iron_Sheik", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Iron Sheik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Cold_Steve_Austin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stone Cold Steve Austin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand_Games/Thumb_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand Games/Thumb Wrestling", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111845267,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-53402,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744072", "eventUri": "eng-9744072", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

The comments included the repeated use of the N-word and other derogatory language. The recording was discovered during his lawsuit against media outlet Gawker for releasing a sex tape of Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea.

We all watched as Hogan spoke at the 2024 Republican National Convention and took off his shirt so everyone could see his Trump/Vance t-shirt.\n\nSince Hogan made it back into the news cycle, everyone is wondering about his life since his wrestling days and his VH1 series Hogan Knows Best. This includes the place that he calls home. So let's find out where he keeps all his wrestling trophies.\n\nHulk Hogan lives in Florida, and according to Sportskeeda.com, he has a house located in Clearwater. The Tampa Bay Times reported that he purchased the home in 2012, and that it cost $3.3 million. While he's lived in other parts of Florida, from Miami to Tampa, he's been in Clearwater ever since.\n\nHogan seems to love living in Florida, from what we can tell, and has embraced the sunny lifestyle. He and his younger wife, Sky, had baptisms in December 2023 in Florida, and he's been there for quite a few years. He also runs Hogan's Beach Shop, so if you're ever in Orlando or Clearwater, you can check it out.\n\nWhen we think of Florida, we of course picture beautiful beaches and sparkling water and an overall chill vibe... but in the past few years, we can't help but think of Trump and Mar-a-Lago (even if we don't want to).\n\nHulk Hogan even wondered about a bid for the senate in Florida. According to The Hill, he said in 2018 that he decided not to and added that the two political parties are like \"a wrestling match\" and no one gets along. (We could say it's only gotten worse since then.) Hogan said, \"I've thought about it -- as of late, people calling my phone, driving me crazy about running for Senate\" or mayor or governor. It seems like instead, he's become a huge fan of Trump.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aya_tsintziras@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Aya Tsintziras", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulk Hogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearwater,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clearwater, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Clearwater, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogan_Knows_Best", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hogan Knows Best"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VH1", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "VH1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/hulk-hogan.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744072", "eventUri": "eng-9744072", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

The final shot of the episode was him getting into the car, which then blew up, and the broadcast faded to black. Trump allegedly called the company in a panic to ask if Vince was okay, because he thought the explosion was real.\n\nThat man is a candidate for president. He's already been president.\n\nAs funny and weird as that story is, I always had trouble believing it. Trump would never be tricked by a wrestling storyline. After all, his entire life has been one big pro wrestling storyline. He's a WWE Hall of Famer. He was one half of the \"battle of the billionaires\" at WrestleMania 23. And now, in a moment almost too stupidly perfect to be true, he's been endorsed for president at the Republican National Convention by Hulk Hogan, brother.\n\nIn case you missed it, Hogan took to the stage at yesterday's RNC to give a ringing endorsement for Diamond Don. Hogan came on stage to his signature theme song \"Real American\" - they accept nothing less at the RNC, after all - and ended the speech by tearing his shirt off, only to reveal a second Trump/Vance 2024 shirt underneath. \"Let Trump-o-mania run wild, brother!\", screamed the six-time WWE champion, before leading the crowd in a chant of \"USA! USA!\" It was a spectacle as uplifting as it was dignified, and served as a perfect convergence of both men's lives and careers.\n\nThey're both former reality TV stars - Trump with The Apprentice, Hulk with Hogan Knows Best. They both rose to prominence in the eighties, making a name for themselves in iconic New York venues: Trump Tower and Madison Square Garden, respectively. They're both also extremely good friends with former WWE company chairman Vince McMahon - a similarly problematic character who probably deserves his own article.\n\nThey're also both seemingly immune to cancellation. We all remember Trump's \"grab 'em by the p****\" audio leak, which we told ourselves would be the end of his divisive 2016 campaign (spoiler: it very much was not). But Hogan had a similar issue in 2015, when audio tapes surfaced which featured him saying some deeply racist things about his daughter's boyfriend, including repeatedly using the n-word and even calling himself a \"racist\" - he later apologised, acknowledging that his conduct had been \"offensive\" and \"unacceptable\". WWE cut ties with Hogan over the incident, but like with Trump, it didn't stick - just this past January, he was the face of the company's Royal Rumble event.\n\nNot to mention the fact that they're both known for, well, let's say \"stretching the truth\". Of course you probably know that Trump likes to exaggerate, and even make things up wholesale, to serve whatever narrative he's trying to push that day. But did you know that Hulk Hogan was asked to play bass for Metallica? No? Well neither did James Hetfield, the band's lead guitarist, who when told that Hogan had been going around making the claim responded \"Huh? Definitely not\".\n\nOr how about the fact that Hogan claims Elvis was a huge fan of his, despite the King dying in 1977 - well before Hogan became famous. Or there's my personal favourite: that due to the time difference between the US and Japan, Hogan - who frequently flew between the two for work - once ended up wrestling 400 days in a single year. Yeah. Take a moment to really drink that one in.\n\nIt's a perfect fit. Not just Hogan and Trump, but pro wrestling and politics. In the US, there isn't really much difference between the two. You know how wrestlers will keep playing their part even when the cameras aren't rolling, to help maintain the illusion? Like they know it isn't real, and we know it isn't real, but we all pretend that it is to help sell the lie? There's a word for that. In wrestling, it's called \"kayfabe\". In politics, it's called a \"policy position\".\n\nHogan wasn't even the only wrestler at the convention. Remember Kane? The Undertaker's brother? The giant, shambling Jason Voorhees knock-off who wore a red leotard and never spoke? Well his real name is Glenn Jacobs, and he's currently the Republican mayor of Knox County, Tennessee. Fun fact: despite wearing a mask for much of his career, he came out as staunchly against face coverings during the pandemic - and despite his character being mute, he never shuts up about it on Twitter.\n\nThis has all been known for a long time, though. If you've seen the 2006 film Idiocracy, in which a future version of Earth is populated entirely by idiots, you'll remember that a big part of the plot revolves around the fact that their president is a pro wrestler. Why? Because people like big, stupid spectacles. I should know, I'm one of them. Sure, we're not quite at the stage where we're electing the wrestler himself - he's just making a key speech at a major party conference - but if you ask me, it's close enough.\n\nAnd don't think we're immune to it here in the UK. Sure, we didn't have Big Daddy come out and endorse Keir Starmer for PM, but remember when Boris Johnson did his little zipline stunt a few years ago? Or how about Ed Davey's grand Center Parcs tour during the recent election campaign?\n\nPeople like Nigel Farage, Suella Braverman and Kemi Badenoch have pretty much made careers out of acting like classic wrestling heels. \"You may not like me, but I'll make you love me\" is wrestling bad guy 101. All Jacob Rees-Mogg needs is a pet snake and a valet and he's set to take on Cody Rhodes at next month's SummerSlam.\n\nAs a huge wrestling fan and politics nerd, let me be the first to say that I hope the two stay far apart from one another. One is a violent, dangerous spectacle performed by conceited maniacs for the pleasure of a braying, bloodthirsty mob, and the other is professional wrestling. Is that too obvious a joke? Maybe, but Trump is probably going to be president again soon, so I guess big, obvious jokes are back in vogue.\n\nHopefully this is the last time politics and wrestling come quite this close to one another. Although if the news is to be believed, the Rock has hinted that he might run for president soon; so don't rule anything out just yet, brother.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

It's part of our new reality.\"\n\n-- Brianne Pfannenstiel\n\nBrutal split screen: Biden holed up with COVID while Trump accepts nomination\n\n'The ghost of Cornpop': Who was Donald Trump Jr. referring to?\n\nDonald Trump Jr. questioned who is really running the country during his RNC speech Wednesday, alluding to concerns about President Joe Biden's age and mental acuity after his poor debate performance last month.\n\n\"Is it Jill? Is it Hunter? Barack Obama?,\" Trump Jr. asked. \"Maybe it's the ghost of Cornpop,\"\n\nWho is Cornpop? The reference refers to a story Biden tells about an encounter he had with a Delaware gang member named William Morris, whose nickname was Cornpop, while working as a swimming pool security guard one summer.\n\n-- Karissa Waddick\n\nWhy won't George W. Bush talk publicly about Donald Trump? It's simple.\n\nMany Republican convention delegates like to salute the heritage of their party, but few of them these days talk about the next-to-last GOP president, George W. Bush.\n\nAnd that suits Bush just fine.\n\nFor while Bush still keeps up with politics - including the resurgence of Republican successor and fervent critic Donald Trump - he doesn't like to talk about it publicly.\n\nIn paid private speeches, the long-retired 43rd president has been known to joke that both Trump and President Joe Biden are too old for the demands of the office.\n\nRead more on the Bush political dynasty and the current Republican Party.\n\n-- David Jackson\n\nDonald Trump's face dominates merch at 2024 Republican convention\n\nAt least that's what the Trump 2024: Make American Great candle would have you believe - for sale this week at a merchandise table at the Republican National Convention.\n\nThe Republican Party faithful have snapped up snarky T-shirts, MAGA hats and elephant pins at the political event that has taken over downtown Milwaukee.\n\nWhile staid official merchandise in simple reds, whites and blues are for sale, many are flocking to the sideline booths to pick up lapel pins dripping with rhinestones and new T-shirts, hot off the presses, featuring a bloodied Donald Trump photographed after Saturday's assassination attempt.\n\nRead more on all the merchandise for sale at the RNC.\n\n-- Melissa Brown\n\n'Actual poetic genius?' Donald Trump's social media posts sold as poetry at GOP convention\n\nGOP makes its case to Latino voters at convention, sets sights past 2024 election\n\nLatino voters in the United States are crucial to cementing a conservative voting majority for the next generation, according to Latino Republican and conservative operatives at the Republican National Convention.\n\nWith the Nov. 5 general election more than 100 days away, they're detailing plans for aggressive engagement efforts beyond traditional conservative circles such as South Florida, home to historically Republican-leaning Latino voters whose origins trace to socialist-led countries in Latin America.\n\nOperatives say they will focus their resources on 21 battleground counties around the U.S. with significant Latino voter populations.\n\nThose include two of the fastest growing areas in the country: Arizona's Maricopa County, which encompasses the Phoenix metro area and is home to most of the state's voters, and Nevada's Clark County, home to sprawling Las Vegas.\n\nMelania Trump expected to be in family box Thursday night\n\nThere's a mystery guest for Donald Trump's acceptance speech: Former first lady Melania Trump.\n\nThe low-profile spouse is expected to be in the family box for her husband's remarks, officials said, but they would not otherwise comment on her activities.\n\nShe has no public schedule.\n\nMelania Trump has rarely be seen in public during her husband's 2024 campaign; she did issue a lengthy written statement after Saturday's assassination attempt.\n\n\"A monster who recognized my husband as an inhuman political machine attempted to ring out Donald's passion - his laughter, ingenuity, love of music, and inspiration,\" she wrote.\n\n-- David Jackson\n\nRNC guests: Melania Trump not seen at RNC through first three days, will she appear Thursday?\n\nJD Vance introduces himself as father, author -- and MAGA convert\n\nJD Vance, introducing himself to the American people for the first time Wednesday night, wanted to make this much clear: He's not a pol.\n\nHe is the survivor of a childhood marked by violence and his mother's drug addiction. He is a Marine veteran, a husband and father, an entrepreneur, an author whose Hillbilly Elegy told the story of the decline of his grandparents' Appalachia with such pathos that it became a national bestseller and a Netflix movie.\n\nPol or not, though, James David Vance has scored one of the fastest rises in modern American politics of anyone not named Trump.\n\nRead more on how JD Vance used his speech to introduce himself to a national audience.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump will have that big bandage on his ear tonight as he delivers his speech formally accepting the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, according to daughter-in-law Lara Trump.\n\nLara Trump, who is a co-chair of the Republican National Committee, also told CBS News' morning show that her father is not on medication.\n\nTrump's ear bandage has become an icon at the Republican convention. Some delegates have bandaged their own ears in solidarity.\n\n-- David Jackson\n\nWill assassination attempt change the way people view Trump?\n\nConvicted but never imprisoned, Donald Trump and his reputation have nonetheless been locked in place in the minds of many Americans after eight fractious years of turmoil, impeachments, insurrection and criminal charges.\n\nThe attempt on his life may give him the best chance at breaking free, offering a kind of political parole from voters sympathetic to the bandage on his bullet-grazed ear, and possibly a second look from those who normally oppose him, all while elevating his reputation with true believers to near martyr status.\n\nFor three days here at the Republican National Convention, Trump's family, surrogates and supporters have said the shooting changed the 78-year-old former president, giving him a new outlook; that he tore up an aggressive speech aimed at dismantling his opponent's administration in favor of one aimed at national unity.\n\nTrump's remarks Thursday night will be the first time Americans will have a chance to hear if his change of tone has stuck.\n\nRead more on whether views of the former president are changing.\n\nVice Presidential nominee JD Vance was met with fanfare Wednesday in his debut as the heir apparent to the Republican Party under its new MAGA banner.\n\nThe 39-year-old Ohio senator was selected to be Donald Trump's running mate earlier this week in a process that was more like his boss's old reality TV show, \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nAllies advertise their newly minted vice presidential pick as the millennial messenger to a conservative cause that is looking to expand its electoral map as it beams with confidence in the last leg of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nTrump is the \"last, best hope to restore\" the country, he said, before listing a series of issues at stake this year.\n\nRead our Day 3 takeaways from the Republican National Convention.\n\n-- Phillip M. Bailey\n\nNever-Trump Republican launches Anti-Psychopath PAC\n\nGeorge Conway, a prominent anti-Trump Republican, launched a new political action committee called the Anti-Psychopath PAC on Thursday to portray Donald Trump as a danger to democracy and mentally unfit for a second term.\n\nThe PAC is running 10 billboards around the RNC in Milwaukee that read: \"Thanks for nominating a CONVICTED FELON,\" and a billboard truck that says \"Thanks for nominating a PSYCHO.\" Trump was convicted in May on 34 felony counts in his New York hush money trial.\n\nConway, who also founded the Lincoln Project, told USA TODAY that he isn't worried about being accused by the Trump campaign of targeting incendiary political rhetoric at the former president after the assassination attempt against him.\n\n\"We expect Trump and his allies to accuse us of anything they can think of,\" Conway said in a statement. \"We condemn violence in all its forms. But we won't back away from calling out the danger that a second Trump term poses to America. Facts are facts.\"\n\nJD Vance, 39, is a first-term senator from Ohio, who skyrocketed to fame after publishing his memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy.\"\n\nVance was first elected to the Senate in 2022 with no prior political experience, but he had widespread name recognition in light of his bestselling book. \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" later turned into a Netflix feature film, detailed Vance's journey from a childhood riddled with abuse to a Yale Law School degree that opened doors for him in Silicon Valley.\n\nWhile Vance was previously critical of Trump, at one point comparing him to an opioid and saying he could be \"America's Hitler,\" he changed his tune ahead of his 2022 Senate race. Since then, Vance has become a loyal ally to Trump. He is also close with one of Trump's sons, Donald Trump Jr.\n\n-- Haley BeMiller and Riley Beggin\n\nVance and his faith: Will JD Vance's religious background sway Catholic voters? What experts say.\n\nKai Trump, Donald Trump's 17-year-old granddaughter, addresses RNC\n\nKai Trump, Donald Trump's 17-year-old granddaughter, told convention attendees that she sees a side of her grandfather that most people don't see.\n\n\"He calls me during the middle of the school day to ask how my golf game is going and tells me all about his... even when he's going through all these court cases, he always asks me how I'm doing. He always encourages me to push myself to be the most successful person I can be. Obviously, he sets the bar pretty high but who knows, maybe one day I'll catch him.\"\n\nShe said she was \"shocked\" when she heard the former president had been injured in a shooting on Saturday at his Pennsylvania rally.\n\n\"I just wanted to know if he was okay,\" she said. \"It was heartbreaking that someone would do that to another person.

Hulk Hogan rips off his shirt in wild RNC speech", "body": "Wrestling icon Hulk Hogan fired up an excited crowd with his WWF antics and references at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on Thursday.\n\nThe former reality star called on voters to support Donald Trump, another veteran of reality TV, as he led the crowd in chants of \"USA! USA!\" and hammed it up for the cameras.\n\nTaking to the stage to his wrestling theme tune \"Real American\", Hogan roared: \"Well, let me tell you something brother!!\" - one of his biggest catch phrases during his professional career.\n\n\"What happened last week...when they took a shot at my hero....They tried to kill the greatest president of the United States!\" he bellowed. \"Enough was enough!!\"\n\nAs he spoke, he threw off his suit jacket and tore a black tank top in half to reveal a bright red Trump/Vance shirt underneath.\n\nHogan was one of many hype acts brought on during the final night of the RNC. He was followed by both Kid Rock, and UFC president Dana White.\n\nRemarking on the atmosphere in the convention hall, Hogan said: \"You know something, when I came here tonight, there was so much energy in this room, I felt maybe I was in Madison Square Garden getting ready to win another world title... the vibe was so intense.\"\n\n\"The energy was so crazy, it felt like maybe I was gonna press that no good sticky giant over my head and slam him through the mat, Brother!\" - a reference to his famous body-slam of late, fellow wrestler Andre the Giant, with whom he shared an onstage rivalry.\n\nHe continued: \"Over my career, I've been in the ring with some of the biggest, some of the baddest dudes on the planet, and I've squared off against warriors, ooh yeah, savages.\n\n\"And I've even, like I said, body-slammed giants in the middle of the ring. And I know tough guys, but let me tell you something, brother, Donald Trump is the toughest of them all.\"\n\nHe added: \"All you criminals, all you lowlifes, all you scumbags... Whatcha gonna do when Donald Trump and all the Trumpamaniacs run wild on you, brother?!\"\n\nHogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, was known throughout his wrestling career for his flamboyant moves and acting in the ring. He spoke of his wrestling days and tag-team with \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage before calling Trump's partnership with running mate JD Vance the \"greatest tag-team\" he'd ever seen.\n\nLater, in a more candid moment, he said that had known Trump for over 35 years, describing him as \"a real American hero.\" He fondly recalled winning the World Title right in front of the former president, who had watched him \"bleeding like a pig\" on the mat.\n\nHe also made reference to the attempted assassination of the former president at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday.\n\n\"As as an entertainer, I tried to stay out of politics, but after everything that's happened to our country over the past four years and everything that happened last weekend, I can no longer be silent,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm here tonight because I want the world to know that Donald Trump is a real American hero, and I'm proud to support my hero as the next president of this United States.\"\n\nHe added: \"I've known that man for over 35 years, and he's always been the biggest patriot, and he still is. He's always told you exactly what he thought, and he still does brother.\"\n\n\"Let Trump-O-Mania rule again, let Trump-O-Mania make America great again!\" Hogan yelled to the crowd in his conclusion.\n\nHis address was well received by a chuckling Trump, who was spotted laughing and clapping as Hogan ripped his shirt. The ex-president even blew Hogan a kiss after he finished speaking.\n\nLater, during his official acceptance speech, Trump gave a shout out to Hogan, describing him as \"one strong son-of-a-gun.\"\n\n\"I know about entertainment, but when he used to lift a 350 pound man over his shoulders and then bench press him two rows into the audience, I said, that maybe entertainment, but he is one strong son-of-a-gun,\" Trump said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulk Hogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_Rock", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kid Rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theme music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_White", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dana White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catchphrase", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catchphrase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Wide Fund for Nature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr\u00e9_the_Giant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andr\u00e9 the Giant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Trump is a close friend of former WWE chairman Vince McMahon, who handpicked Hogan to be the face of the company during the wrestling boom in the '80s.\n\nDonald Trump survived an assassination attempt during a really near Butler, Pennsylvania last Saturday. He was shot in the ear by Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old man that was killed by Secret Service Counter Assault Team.\n\nIf Trump defeats Joe Biden in this year's election, he'll join Grover Cleveland in the exclusive club of U.S. Presidents who served two non-consecutive terms. Cleveland was in office from 1885 to 1889 and from 1893 to 1897, with Benjamin Harrison serving as president in between his two terms.\n\nThe 2024 election also marks the first presidential rematch since 1956, when Republican Dwight D.

Who can forget the family members of the 13 servicemen and women who lost their lives in Kabul, the WWII vet, or the sweet, old rancher couple talking about the border crisis?\n\nThere have been some interesting celebrities on the program, too. When I was at the barbershop this morning, the woman who cuts my hair said, \"Who would've thought we'd see Amber Rose at the RNC?\" Who would've thought, indeed?\n\nWhen I saw the list of speakers for Thursday's final night, my inner kid got excited. Hulk Hogan was on the schedule!\n\nISideWith points out that \"Hogan's speech is anticipated to draw considerable attention, underscoring the former wrestler's influence and the ongoing relationship between celebrity culture and political endorsement.\"\n\nI wondered about the Hulkster's conservative bona fides. I remember seeing how he got baptized last year, and he has talked about his faith for years. He's also friends with Trump pal Peter Thiel, who helped bankroll his lawsuit against the execrable fools at Gawker.\n\nHogan also recently launched a patriotic-themed beer, but what might have sold me on his conservatism was when the New Republic asked, \"Why the Hell Is Hulk Hogan Speaking at the RNC?\" (My answer: none of your business.)\n\nRecommended: DeSantis Torches the Left in RNC Speech\n\nAfter the RNC showed a clip of Hogan's theme song, \"Real American\"...\n\n...Hogan came out in full effect:\n\nLet me tell you something, brother. You know something? When I came here tonight, there was so much energy in this room. I thought maybe I was in Madison Square Garden, getting ready to win another world title. The vibe was so intense. The energy was so crazy. It felt like maybe I was gonna press that no-good stinky Giant over my head and slam him through the mat, brother.\n\nBut what I found out was I was in a room full of real Americans, brother.\n\nHe continued to extol Donald Trump \"in character\" as Hulk Hogan, even stripping off his sportcoat and ripping his \"Real American\" T-shirt to reveal a Trump-Vance shirt with ripped sleeves.\n\nIt was sooooo cool. Twelve-year-old Chris would be so jealous.\n\nBut it got more real when Hogan dropped the character (somewhat) and addressed the party as himself:\n\nI didn't come here as Hulk Hogan, but I just had to give you a little taste. You know my name. My name is Terry Bollea, and as an entertainer, I try to stay out of politics, but after everything that's happened to our country over the past four years, and everything that happened last weekend. I can no longer stay silent.\n\nI'm here tonight because I want the world to know that Donald Trump is a real American hero. And I'm proud to support my hero as the next president of these United States.\n\nThe former WWF/WWE champion recalled Trump sitting on the front row as Hogan won one of his many championships. He recalled the glories of the Trump years and expressed his belief that a second Trump term can bring them back.\n\n\"I really, really love this country, and I've lived the American dream. And I want my kids, your kids, and all those little teeny maniacs out there to live the American dream too,\" he said. \"This November, guys, we can save the American Dream for everyone. And Donald Trump is the president who will get the job done.\"\n\nHe closed by issuing a challenge as only the Hulkster could: \"So all you criminals, all you lowlifes, all you scumbags, all you drug dealers, and all you crooked politicians need to answer one question, brother. Whatcha gonna do when Donald Trump and all the Trumpamaniacs run wild on you, brother? God bless you.\"\n\nIf you had told me years ago that a pro wrestler would make a compelling case for a Republican president at the RNC, I wouldn't have believed you. But dang it, Hulk Hogan made it work.", "source": {"uri": "pjmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PJ Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_queen@pjmedia.com", "name": "Chris Queen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulk Hogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kabul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kabul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peter Thiel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gawker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gawker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baptism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WWE Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Wide Fund for Nature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illegal drug trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/200/8ee2c276-dd3f-4981-8f42-4800c6b806a1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744072", "eventUri": "eng-9744072", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

As he stumped for Trump, Hogan tore the shirt off his chest, revealing a MAGA message underneath.\n\nThe legendary former WWE star, known for his larger-than-life persona, received thunderous cheers at the Republican National Convention as he prepared the stage for Trump. In his address, Hogan urged, \"I want All the Hulkmaniancs to live the American dream too.\"\n\nHogan rallied against the Biden administration, saying: \"We never had it better than the Trump years, we had safety, we had peace... And then we lost it... Crime is out of control,\" He then went on to warn, \"So all you criminals, all you lowlives, all you scumbags... whatcha gonna do when Donald Trump is president again.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Donald Trump's assassination attempt was 'top of Putin's wishlist' as US hit by 'political chaos'\n\nReaching a frenzy in his speech, Hogan began to undress, while shouting: \"When they took a shot at my hero and they tried to kill the next President of the United States, enough was enough. I said 'Let Trumpmania run wild brother, let Trumpmania rule again, let Trumpmania make America great again',\" before ripping his shirt in two.\n\nBehind the scenes, two top campaign aides disclosed to NBC that the 70 year old wrestling veteran would make an appearance at the RNC's last day to make remarks before Trump's eagerly awaited acceptance speech. The evening marked Trump's first public speaking event since an assassination attempt was made against him at a Butler, Pennsylvania rally, reports the Mirror US.\n\nAnd while Trump escaped with only minor injuries, the dreadful assault tragically claimed the life of 50 year old Corey Comperatore and critically injured two others. In response to this tragedy, Hogan aired his condemnation of the brutal act on social media as he expressed support for Trump.\n\nThat Saturday night, Hogan quickly took to Instagram to post a trending picture of an embattled Trump, head held high and fist raised, whilst blood streamed down from a grazed ear inflicted by a bullet on stage.\n\nUnderneath the harrowing image, Hogan delivered a message to his 2.5 million followers that stated: \"Today's events in Butler, Pennsylvania are deeply disturbing. No President, past or present, should face such a horrific act.\"\n\nThe wrestler-turned-actor who hails from Florida continued: \"Our thoughts and prayers are with President Trump, law enforcement and the Secret Service who bravely protect and uphold our shared values.\"\n\nHogan was expected too to the stage at the Republican National Convention on Thursday, July 18, between 7.30pm and 8pm CT.\n\nThe wrestling star and '80s icon shared the stage with two other distinguished guest speakers - Carrie Ruiz, GM of golf at Trump National Doral in Miami, and Annette Albright, a previous contender for an at-large position on the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education last autumn.\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

USA!\" and hammed it up for the cameras.\n\nTaking to the stage to his wrestling theme tune \"Real American\", Hogan roared: \"Well, let me tell you something brother!!\" - one of his biggest catch phrases during his professional career.\n\n\"What happened last week...when they took a shot at my hero....They tried to kill the greatest president of the United States!\" he bellowed. \"Enough was enough!!\"\n\nAs he spoke, he threw off his suit jacket and tore a black tank top in half to reveal a bright red Trump/Vance shirt underneath.\n\nHogan was one of many hype acts brought on during the final night of the RNC. He was followed by both Kid Rock, and UFC president Dana White.\n\nRemarking on the atmosphere in the convention hall, Hogan said: \"You know something, when I came here tonight, there was so much energy in this room, I felt maybe I was in Madison Square Garden getting ready to win another world title... the vibe was so intense.\"\n\n\"The energy was so crazy, it felt like maybe I was gonna press that no good sticky giant over my head and slam him through the mat, Brother!\" - a reference to his famous body-slam of late, fellow wrestler Andre the Giant, with whom he shared an onstage rivalry.\n\nHe continued: \"Over my career, I've been in the ring with some of the biggest, some of the baddest dudes on the planet, and I've squared off against warriors, ooh yeah, savages.\n\n\"And I've even, like I said, body-slammed giants in the middle of the ring.

Whatcha gonna do when Donald Trump and all the Trumpamaniacs run wild on you, brother?!\"\n\nHogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, was known throughout his wrestling career for his flamboyant moves and acting in the ring. He spoke of his wrestling days and tag-team with \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage before calling Trump's partnership with running mate JD Vance the \"greatest tag-team\" he'd ever seen.\n\nLater, in a more candid moment, he said that had known Trump for over 35 years, describing him as \"a real American hero.\" He fondly recalled winning the World Title right in front of the former president, who had watched him \"bleeding like a pig\" on the mat.\n\nHe also made reference to the attempted assassination of the former president at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday.\n\n\"As as an entertainer, I tried to stay out of politics, but after everything that's happened to our country over the past four years and everything that happened last weekend, I can no longer be silent,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm here tonight because I want the world to know that Donald Trump is a real American hero, and I'm proud to support my hero as the next president of this United States.\"\n\nHe added: \"I've known that man for over 35 years, and he's always been the biggest patriot, and he still is. He's always told you exactly what he thought, and he still does brother.\"\n\n\"Let Trump-O-Mania rule again, let Trump-O-Mania make America great again!\" Hogan yelled to the crowd in his conclusion.\n\nHis address was well received by a chuckling Trump, who was spotted laughing and clapping as Hogan ripped his shirt. The ex-president even blew Hogan a kiss after he finished speaking.\n\nLater, during his official acceptance speech, Trump gave a shout out to Hogan, describing him as \"one strong son-of-a-gun.\"\n\n\"I know about entertainment, but when he used to lift a 350 pound man over his shoulders and then bench press him two rows into the audience, I said, that maybe entertainment, but he is one strong son-of-a-gun,\" Trump said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_bowden@yahoo.com", "name": "John Bowden", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "mike_bedigan@yahoo.com", "name": "Mike Bedigan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulk Hogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_Rock", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kid Rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theme music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_White", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dana White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catchphrase", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catchphrase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr\u00e9_the_Giant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andr\u00e9 the Giant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Savage", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Randy Savage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

He closed his speech with a rhetorical challenge to political opponents: \"Whatcha gonna do when Donald Trump and all the Trump-a-maniacs run wild on you, brother?\"\n\nBeyond his wrestling career spanning five decades, Hogan has appeared in films such as \"Rocky III\" and TV shows like \"Thunder in Paradise.\" According to Fox News, his life has not been without controversy, including a notable legal battle with Gawker over a leaked sex tape and a temporary expulsion from the WWE Hall of Fame due to racially insensitive remarks.\n\nDespite these challenges, Hogan remains a prominent figure in both pop culture and political circles, endorsing Trump as a candidate poised to restore what he sees as America's greatness.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulk Hogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tag team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WWE Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Savage", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Randy Savage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_in_Paradise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thunder in Paradise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gawker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gawker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Popular culture"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand_Games/Thumb_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand Games/Thumb Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/07/untitled-design-1-2024-07-4ae3179b7eaca5173734ba0cfeacf8bb-16x9.png?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744072", "eventUri": "eng-9744072", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Is his third marriage heading in the same direction?\n\nIt was announced that the controversial WWE legend Hulk Hogan would speak at the RNC before Trump accepted the GOP nomination.\n\nIt's been awhile since Hogan has been on the world stage like that, as disgraces in his personal life have kept him squarely out of the limelight.\n\nAmong them include a sextape, getting fired from the WWE for using the N-Word, and two failed marriages.\n\nOf the latter, the details of his divorces are both messy and sad.\n\nIn the 1980's, there was no bigger name in wrestling than Hulk. In fact, some will argue that without Hogan, the WWE wouldn't be what it is today.\n\nBecause of that, when Hulk Hogan married Linda Claridge in 1983, the wedding was reportedly attended by everyone from Vince McMahon to Andre The Giant .\n\nTo the world, it appeared like the pair had the perfect marriage. They went on to welcome two children together: daughter Brooke and son Nick.\n\nThen came Hogan Knows Best, one of the first family reality shows of its kind. For 4 seasons, legions of fans tuned in to VH1 (is that still a channel?!) to watch Hulk and Linda wrangle their children and keep their marriage together.\n\nIn the end, the show was canceled - as was their marriage.\n\nIn November 2007, People Magazine reported that Linda had filed for a divorce. She apparently did so without telling Hulk Hogan, which will be ironic as this saga continues.\n\nA year later, Linda's publicist Gary Smith told E! News that Linda filed for divorce after she found out that Hulk had an affair with one of his daughter Brooke's close friends, Christine Plante.\n\n\"Almost every statement that comes out of Hulk's mouth is a diversionary tactic to deflect attention away from the real reason Linda filed for divorce, two words: HULK'S CHEATING!\" her publicist insisted.\n\nHulk has vehemently denied these claims, both in public through his own reps, and in his own words. In his autobiography, My Life Outside The Ring, Hulk acknowledged that Linda had repeatedly suspected him of having numerous infidelities, nothing romantic ever happened with any of the women he was \"friends\" with.\n\nThat became a hard pill to swallow when Brooke's friend Christine confirmed the affair herself.\n\n\"My relationship with [Hulk] began at a time when [Hulk] and Linda [Hogan] privately knew their marriage was ending,\" she told the National Enquirer.\n\n\"She had left him already, although no official papers had been filed. [Hulk] is a good man, good father, and good friend, and he and I grew close at a time when he was going through a very difficult period. It seemed right then, but I know it was wrong.\"\n\nThree years after Linda called it quits with Hulk, he married his second wife, Jennifer McDaniel, in 2010.\n\nAfter two years of dating, the pair pledged their love during a ceremony in Clearwater, Florida.\n\nThey stayed together for 11 years, and were seemingly very happy together.\n\nIn 2022, he posted a photo of himself and another woman (enter Sky Daily) on social media, and called her his \"girl\". Fans immediately flooded his accounts, confused over how he could have a new girlfriend when he was supposed to be married to Jennifer.\n\nThe answer? He \"forgot\" to mention he was divorced.\n\n\"Yo Maniacs just for the record, the Facebook and Instagram posts are of me and my girlfriend Sky, I am officially divorced,\" he wrote on then Twitter. \"Sorry I thought everyone already knew, love my Maniacs4Life\"\n\nIt was then that court documents were obtained by TMZ Sports that revealed they filed for divorce in October 2021.\n\nNo real reason ever came to light on why they split.\n\nWith the news of his second marriage being finished finally out of the way, Hulk pushed on with getting serious with his new girl, Sky Daily.\n\nTwo years after his last divorce, he married Sky in October 2023. Sky is reportedly a yoga instructor, and has three children from a previous marriage.\n\nSpeaking of kids, Brooke Hogan made it crystal clear that she had no interest in her father's new marriage and thus, did not attend his wedding.\n\n\"As many of you know, I value my privacy but unfortunately, a lot of media outlets are making assumptions as to why I did not attend my father's third wedding.

Why his 1998 publicity stunt backfired", "body": "Former wrestler Hulk Hogan's latest publicity stunt is reminiscent of his mortifying bid to run for the 2000 Presidential campaign\n\nWalrus-moustached wrestling icon Hulk Hogan took the idea of a rip-roaring good time to the limit at the national convention of Donald Trump's Republican party this week. Standing at the podium on Thursday, he roared, then ripped open his shirt to reveal a second shirt bearing Trump's name. \"Let Trumpmania run wild, brother,\" said Hogan, hype-man to the former President ahead of Trump's address that evening. \"Let Trumpmania rule again! Let Trumpmania make America great again!\"\n\nHogan's heroics in Wisconsin have have generated international headlines but for long-time followers of this mainstay of Nineties wrestling, the display may have carried a hint of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Hogan, after all, attempted much the same stunt 26 years ago at Nassau County Memorial Coliseum on Long Island. On November 9, 1998, flanked by \"secret service\" agents in dark suits and wearing his full wrestling kit, \"Hollywood\" Hogan stomped into the ring and, amid a riot of red, white and blue confetti, addressed the sold-out audience at the World Champion Wrestling \"Nitro\" event.\n\n\"If I can get America behind me... we shall turn the page, we shall give America a brand new start,\" said Hogan, striking the same beats of bull-headed triumphalism he would summon when introducing Trump. \"All my people that love America shall take us into the new millennium on a brand new start. I am here not only to serve but to protect my country.\"\n\nFans bawled their approval - but did they know what they were cheering? His ambitions would soon be spelt out. Hogan, the biggest force in wrestling, was announcing his run for the 2000 Presidential election campaign. Mr Hollywood was going to Washington.\n\nThree weeks later, Hogan - real name Terry Gene Bollea - clarified his plans during an appearance on a Thanksgiving night edition of Jay Leno's Tonight Show. He confirmed he was retiring from wrestling and putting on hold the movie career that had earned him the \"Hollywood\" nickname and had seen him star in blockbusters such as Three Ninjas, Mr Nanny and Suburban Commando.\n\n\"I had to come to the crossroads here,\" he told Leno. \"I've accomplished everything I wanted to do in wrestling. My family is secure. I've had a great career. I wanted to come on your show tonight and officially announce my retirement.\"\n\nLeno - who presumably had missed the announcement at Nassau County Coliseum - looked shocked. \"All good things must come to an end. I had a great career,\" continued Hogan. \"The fans have been great. I love you guys and thanks for sticking with me. And this really helps me segue into being the next President of the United States.\"\n\nHogan didn't have many specific policies to share with viewers - though he received a cheer when he announced one of the first things he would do if elected would be to institute a federal flat tax. That got a huge yell. The people were on his side.\n\nThe idea of a human bendy toy such as Hulk Hogan seeking the Presidency seems ludicrous in 2024. In 1998, it was genuinely plausible. One of Hogan's rivals, Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura, had already started what would become a successful run for Governor of Minnesota. Five years later, another Hollywood action star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, would use Leno's talk show to announce he was running for governor of California. Hulk Hogan fancying a tilt at the White House might have been a surprise, but it wasn't a joke.\n\nOr at least that is what Leno and his audience thought. However, it would quickly become apparent that Hogan's designs were not on the Oval Office but on boosting his profile in wrestling. He didn't make any further TV appearances to plug his candidacy, and he certainly didn't hold any campaign rallies. It was all just a publicity stunt to hype the next WCW event in January 1999.\n\nThe WCW needed the exposure. Established in 1988 by CNN's Ted Turner as a rival to the all-powerful WWF (later the WWE), it had enjoyed a brief period of popularity - but by the late 1990s, its profile was on the slide, despite the involvement of Hogan. The WCW needed the ineffable Hulk to put it in the spotlight once again.\n\nIt helped that Hogan talked a good game. Criticised by Ventura for riding on his coattails, he would later dismiss his competitor as \"a very small minnow in a big lake\".\n\n\"We all know the difference between John Wayne and an extra who gets a little part,\" he told radio interviewer Todd Alan Clem (aka Bubba The Love Sponge). \"We all know the difference between Jesse The Body Ventura and Hollywood Hulk Hogan.\"\n\nHe also claimed to have received support from Willie Nelson and Ted Turner. \"We want a real America,\" he said. \"Not one of the plastic politicians.\"\n\nHogan's heart may never have been in the Presidential race, but he nonetheless felt he had a chance. His campaign manager, WCW President Eric Bischoff, later pointed to a poll in Atlanta which he said showed that, had he gone up against Bill Clinton or Al Gore, Hogan would have won 61 per cent of the vote.\n\nStill, there was widespread scepticism within wrestling. An early 1999 edition of The Wrestler magazine openly queried how serious he was, with the headline, \"Hogan's Retirement: White House or White Lie?\"\n\nBy the time The Wrestler hit the shelves, that question had already been answered. On January 4 1999, Hogan made a surprise appearance at the WCW Monday Nitro event, where he tangled with WCW champion Kevin Nash, felling the younger wrestler with a single prod of his finger - what become known as \"the finger poke of doom\".\n\nThe square-off was immediately notorious - not because it undermined Hogan's claim to have retired but because of the ludicrous sight of a finger-prod felling the six-foot-10 inch tall Nash. So absurd was the stunt not even American wrestling fans could swallow it - the New York Post said the incident was \"widely considered the beginning of the end for WCW\", which was acquired by the WWE in 2001.\n\nHogan went back to his day job but never formally renounced his presidential campaign. In late 1999, appearing on Larry King Live, he suggested he might still run. \" It's something that's not out of the question because with everybody having a different agenda and everybody owing everybody something in the political arena, it would be nice to have somebody that could put America first,\" he said. \"The way I look at it, if Jesse Ventura could become governor of Minnesota, I mean, I basically beat Jesse at everything he's done anyway in his life, so I might as well run for the President.\"\n\nThis was just more hot air - though it fell far short of the smoke he blew at Donald Trump's RNC appearance this week. Hogan has since had his ups and downs: in 2015 he issued a public apology after he was caught using the \"n\" word in a leaked sex tape. But he was visibly having the time of his life as Trump's cheerleader. After a lifetime of pretend-tossing people around the ring, the thrill he felt at joining Trump in a real-life political cage fight was there for the whole world to see.", "source": {"uri":

Birds of a feather flock together. Racists will find other racists to be racist with. I made that last one up, but it doesn't make it any less true. Bigoted pricks need to find other bigoted pricks to hobnob with. They have to share their s****y points of view with each other and laugh about how right they think they are. They need to rip off their shirts in an arena full of screaming fans as they introduce a former President and attempted Insurrectionist like he's the World Heavyweight Champion.\n\nThat was the scene at the RNC last night! As if Nick Lutsko's smash hit song wasn't accurate enough, the RNC has fully devolved into hate-fueled rants and explicitly racist rhetoric. This week, there have been calls for mass deportation. People have claimed that Donald Trump will be more appealing to African American voters because he was shot. If those instances weren't evidence enough that the RNC is a haven for racists, allow me to inform you that Hulk Hogan was present at the event.\n\nIf you are only familiar with Hogan as a pro-wrestler or subpar movie star, he is also a full-blown racist (and selfish union buster). Most notably, Hogan was caught on tape liberally using the N-word to lament the fact that his daughter was dating African American men. Hogan was fired from the WWE (where he still enjoyed occasional appearances) and sued Gawker for releasing the tape. He was back in the wrestling world within three years. However, since fellow scumbag Vince McMahon remained in charge, Hogan was welcomed back a few years later.\n\nSince Vince McMahon has finally been outed as a fellow racist and otherworldly monster, the WWE has distanced themselves from Hogan. He campaigned to be a presence at this year's Wrestlemania (one of the biggest ever) and was relegated to a video package (still too much). While Hogan hasn't been in the ring, that hasn't stopped him from being a super, mega-racist!\n\nHogan hired influencer Essence Jenai to promote his All American Beer (which, I assumed, is his canned piss mixed with HGH). Jenai claims she was fired by the Hulkster after one day, despite being hired for a week. She was told by Hogan's team that he would not be holding any more events, so her services weren't needed. The next day, Hogan was back to promoting his beer with a team of white female influencers instead. This happened within the last few weeks.\n\nIf anything, Hogan's blatant racism made him a welcome addition to the RNC. He got up on stage, ripped off his shirt, and touted Donald Trump as his hero. I'd say his schtick is making a mockery of the political process, but it would be more appropriate to say he's meeting the moment. We are in hell. Hulk Hogan and Donald Trump are our torturers, and Republicans are sitting in a dark chair in the corner, watching as society gets f***ed into oblivion.", "source": {"uri": "pajiba.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pajiba"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_sanford@pajiba.com", "name": "Andrew Sanford", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulk Hogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heavyweight_Championship_(WWE,_2002\u20132013)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Heavyweight Championship (WWE, 2002\u20132013)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_busting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Union busting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WWE Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_McMahon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vince McMahon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gawker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gawker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigger", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nigger"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Growth hormone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.pajiba.com/assets_c/2024/07/GettyImages-2162616143-thumb-700xauto-264090.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744072", "eventUri": "eng-9744072", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Plus: You can watch live video coverage from NPR of tonight's speeches. Here's how.\n\nA Florida man famous for his deep tan, outsized lifestyle and lucrative knack for blending entertainment and reality will speak at the Republican National Convention Thursday night.\n\nHulk Hogan, the longtime pro wrestler whose real name is Terry Bollea, is on the recently released roster of speakers for the convention's final night, slated to speak in the run up to former President Donald Trump's address.\n\nThe official RNC program identifies Hulk Hogan as a \"professional entertainer and wrestler.\" He was also involved in a momentous legal case in the media world: His lawsuit against Gawker Media resulted in a $140 million jury award after the company published a sex tape featuring Bollea in 2015. An ensuing settlement sent the company and its founder into bankruptcy.\n\nAfter the sex tape emerged, there was abrupt fallout for Hulk Hogan: World Wrestling Entertainment spiked its contract with him over reports that he used racist language in the sex tape.\n\nIt may seem unexpected, but Hulk Hogan's prominent role at this year's RNC is another sign of the influence of billionaire Peter Thiel -- who bankrolled Hogan's fight against Gawker, and who has more recently been a key patron of Trump's new vice presidential pick, Sen. J.D. Vance.\n\nHogan is slated to speak sometime between 7:30 and 8 p.m. CT. He's bookended by two speakers that the RNC program identifies as \"everyday Americans.\"\n\nThose speakers are Carrie Ruiz, who is the general manager of golf at Trump National Doral in Miami; and Annette Albright of North Carolina, who lost her race last fall for an at-large seat on the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education.\n\nLoading...\n\nAlbright drew notice in that nonpartisan election after she and other candidates were accused of being \"Trojan horse Republicans,\" as member station WFAE reported.\n\nWWE is a professional wrestling promotion and media company, known for its scripted feats, ringside drama and zealous showmanship.\n\nVince McMahon bought an earlier version of the company in 1982, and, along with his wife Linda McMahon, is credited with bringing its unique blend of wrestling and entertainment into the mainstream. One of WWE's first -- and most enduring -- main attractions was none other than Hogan.\n\nTrump also had a hand in WWE's rise, hosting the fourth and fifth Wrestlemania events. And it was Trump's Apprentice catchphrase, \"You're fired,\" that a suited-up McMahon would shout in the ring. Trump has appeared at numerous WWE events over the years, including as a guest ring announcer and on-screen talent.\n\nTrump \"became part of some of the most compelling and highest-rated storylines in the company's history,\" McMahon said on the RNC stage. That includes in 2007 when Trump shaved McMahon's head.\n\nLinda McMahon left the company for politics, serving as Trump's small business administrator from 2017 to 2019 before leaving to join a pro-Trump super PAC.\n\nVince resigned from his leadership role at the company in January after a former employee filed a lawsuit accusing him of sexually assaulting her in the workplace, sex trafficking and pressuring her into threesomes. That lawsuit was paused earlier this year at the request of the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nThe Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), in contrast, is a mixed martial arts promotion company. It came on the scene in 1993, but wasn't a hit right away. In the early 2000s, Trump let UFC's new president, Dana White, use his Atlantic City casino. His endorsement helped the company become the world's largest MMA promotion, as of 2023.", "source": {"uri": "kpbs.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KPBS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity_sex_tape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Celebrity sex tape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulk Hogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gawker_Media", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gawker Media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-partisan_democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-partisan democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_McMahon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Linda McMahon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Why his 1998 publicity stunt backfired", "body": "Walrus-moustached wrestling icon Hulk Hogan took the idea of a rip-roaring good time to the limit at the national convention of Donald Trump's Republican party this week. Standing at the podium on Thursday, he roared, then ripped open his shirt to reveal a second shirt bearing Trump's name. \"Let Trumpmania run wild, brother,\" said Hogan, hype-man to the former President ahead of Trump's address that evening. \"Let Trumpmania rule again! Let Trumpmania make America great again!\"\n\nHogan's heroics in Wisconsin have have generated international headlines but for long-time followers of this mainstay of Nineties wrestling, the display may have carried a hint of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Hogan, after all, attempted much the same stunt 26 years ago at Nassau County Memorial Coliseum on Long Island. On November 9, 1998, flanked by \"secret service\" agents in dark suits and wearing his full wrestling kit, \"Hollywood\" Hogan stomped into the ring and, amid a riot of red, white and blue confetti, addressed the sold-out audience at the World Champion Wrestling \"Nitro\" event.\n\n\"If I can get America behind me... we shall turn the page, we shall give America a brand new start,\" said Hogan, striking the same beats of bull-headed triumphalism he would summon when introducing Trump. \"All my people that love America shall take us into the new millennium on a brand new start. I am here not only to serve but to protect my country.\"\n\nFans bawled their approval - but did they know what they were cheering? His ambitions would soon be spelt out. Hogan, the biggest force in wrestling, was announcing his run for the 2000 Presidential election campaign. Mr Hollywood was going to Washington.\n\nThree weeks later, Hogan - real name Terry Gene Bollea - clarified his plans during an appearance on a Thanksgiving night edition of Jay Leno's Tonight Show. He confirmed he was retiring from wrestling and putting on hold the movie career that had earned him the \"Hollywood\" nickname and had seen him star in blockbusters such as Three Ninjas, Mr Nanny and Suburban Commando.\n\n\"I had to come to the crossroads here,\" he told Leno. \"I've accomplished everything I wanted to do in wrestling. My family is secure. I've had a great career. I wanted to come on your show tonight and officially announce my retirement.\"\n\nLeno - who presumably had missed the announcement at Nassau County Coliseum - looked shocked. \"All good things must come to an end. I had a great career,\" continued Hogan. \"The fans have been great. I love you guys and thanks for sticking with me. And this really helps me segue into being the next President of the United States.\"\n\nHogan didn't have many specific policies to share with viewers - though he received a cheer when he announced one of the first things he would do if elected would be to institute a federal flat tax. That got a huge yell. The people were on his side.\n\nThe idea of a human bendy toy such as Hulk Hogan seeking the Presidency seems ludicrous in 2024. In 1998, it was genuinely plausible. One of Hogan's rivals, Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura, had already started what would become a successful run for Governor of Minnesota. Five years later, another Hollywood action star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, would use Leno's talk show to announce he was running for governor of California. Hulk Hogan fancying a tilt at the White House might have been a surprise, but it wasn't a joke.\n\nOr at least that is what Leno and his audience thought. However, it would quickly become apparent that Hogan's designs were not on the Oval Office but on boosting his profile in wrestling. He didn't make any further TV appearances to plug his candidacy, and he certainly didn't hold any campaign rallies. It was all just a publicity stunt to hype the next WCW event in January 1999.\n\nThe WCW needed the exposure. Established in 1988 by CNN's Ted Turner as a rival to the all-powerful WWF (later the WWE), it had enjoyed a brief period of popularity - but by the late 1990s, its profile was on the slide, despite the involvement of Hogan. The WCW needed the ineffable Hulk to put it in the spotlight once again.\n\nIt helped that Hogan talked a good game. Criticised by Ventura for riding on his coattails, he would later dismiss his competitor as \"a very small minnow in a big lake\".\n\n\"We all know the difference between John Wayne and an extra who gets a little part,\" he told radio interviewer Todd Alan Clem (aka Bubba The Love Sponge). \"We all know the difference between Jesse The Body Ventura and Hollywood Hulk Hogan.\"\n\nHe also claimed to have received support from Willie Nelson and Ted Turner. \"We want a real America,\" he said. \"Not one of the plastic politicians.\"\n\nHogan's heart may never have been in the Presidential race, but he nonetheless felt he had a chance. His campaign manager, WCW President Eric Bischoff, later pointed to a poll in Atlanta which he said showed that, had he gone up against Bill Clinton or Al Gore, Hogan would have won 61 per cent of the vote.\n\nStill, there was widespread scepticism within wrestling. An early 1999 edition of The Wrestler magazine openly queried how serious he was, with the headline, \"Hogan's Retirement: White House or White Lie?\"\n\nBy the time The Wrestler hit the shelves, that question had already been answered. On January 4 1999, Hogan made a surprise appearance at the WCW Monday Nitro event, where he tangled with WCW champion Kevin Nash, felling the younger wrestler with a single prod of his finger - what become known as \"the finger poke of doom\".\n\nThe square-off was immediately notorious - not because it undermined Hogan's claim to have retired but because of the ludicrous sight of a finger-prod felling the six-foot-10 inch tall Nash. So absurd was the stunt not even American wrestling fans could swallow it - the New York Post said the incident was \"widely considered the beginning of the end for WCW\", which was acquired by the WWE in 2001.\n\nHogan went back to his day job but never formally renounced his presidential campaign. In late 1999, appearing on Larry King Live, he suggested he might still run. \" It's something that's not out of the question because with everybody having a different agenda and everybody owing everybody something in the political arena, it would be nice to have somebody that could put America first,\" he said. \"The way I look at it, if Jesse Ventura could become governor of Minnesota, I mean, I basically beat Jesse at everything he's done anyway in his life, so I might as well run for the President.\"\n\nThis was just more hot air - though it fell far short of the smoke he blew at Donald Trump's RNC appearance this week. Hogan has since had his ups and downs: in 2015 he issued a public apology after he was caught using the \"n\" word in a leaked sex tape. But he was visibly having the time of his life as Trump's cheerleader. After a lifetime of pretend-tossing people around the ring, the thrill he felt at joining Trump in a real-life political cage fight was there for the whole world to see.", "source": {"uri":

None could possibly bring the amount of energy, enthusiasm, and some might say, exuberance, like former wrestling legend Hulk Hogan.\n\nHogan gave a fiery, but mostly peaceful speech reinforcing why he supports Trump for president this year, and how the failed assassination attempt inspired him to speak publicly about his \"hero.\"\n\nREAD: Hulk Hogan Says Assassination Attempt On His 'Hero' Donald Trump Made Him Speak Out\n\n\"I think about how his family was compromised, how his business was compromised. But what happened last week when they took a shot at my hero -- and tried to kill the president of the United States -- enough was enough,\" Hogan said.\n\n\"Let Trump-O-Mania rule again, let Trump-O-Mania make America great again,\" he continued, ripping off layer after layer of clothing to reveal a \"Trump-Vance\" tank top. Well, just enjoy.\n\nOutKick's Riley Gaines was at the event, and shared video from the floor during Hogan's speech with a short, simple message: \"We're so back.\"\n\nMeanwhile, over at MSNBC, where the mood continues to get worse as poll after poll shows President Joe Biden slipping, even in formerly blue states, they didn't even show Hogan's speech.\n\nThey missed an eventful afternoon in Milwaukee, where Hogan's speech exemplified the phenomenon many have noticed after the assassination attempt. A renewed enthusiasm and willingness to publicly support the often-controversial Trump.\n\n\"When I saw him stand up with [his] fist in the air and the blood on his face, as a warrior and as a leader, I realized that's what America needs,\" Hogan said in a pre-speech Fox News interview.\n\n\"I knew it all along, I was just afraid to speak out,\" he added.\n\nNo one could call Thursday's speech \"afraid.\" And with others to come, the party at the RNC is just getting started.

Plus: You can watch live video coverage from NPR of tonight's speeches. Here's how.\n\nA Florida man famous for his deep tan, outsized lifestyle and lucrative knack for blending entertainment and reality will speak at the Republican National Convention Thursday night.\n\nHulk Hogan, the longtime pro wrestler whose real name is Terry Bollea, is on the recently released roster of speakers for the convention's final night, slated to speak in the run up to former President Donald Trump's address.\n\nHogan, who has been known to make a dramatic entrance in the ring, walked onstage against a montage of videos and photos of himself in various patriotic poses.\n\nHe took to the podium wearing a red bandana and sunglasses on his head, gesturing to the crowd that he couldn't hear their chants of \"USA.\"\n\nThe retired professional wrestler said the \"vibe was so intense, the energy was so crazy, it felt like maybe I was gonna press that no-good stinky giant over my head and slam him into the mat, brother.\"\n\nThe official RNC program identifies Hulk Hogan as a \"professional entertainer and wrestler.\" He was also involved in a momentous legal case in the media world: His lawsuit against Gawker Media resulted in a $140 million jury award after the company published a sex tape featuring Bollea in 2015. An ensuing settlement sent the company and its founder into bankruptcy.\n\nAfter the sex tape emerged, there was abrupt fallout for Hulk Hogan: World Wrestling Entertainment spiked its contract with him over reports that he used racist language in the sex tape.\n\nIt may seem unexpected, but Hulk Hogan's prominent role at this year's RNC is another sign of the influence of billionaire Peter Thiel -- who bankrolled Hogan's fight against Gawker, and who has more recently been a key patron of Trump's new vice presidential pick, Sen. J.D. Vance.\n\nHogan remarkes were bookended by two speakers that the RNC program identifies as \"everyday Americans.\"\n\nCarrie Ruiz, who is the general manager of golf at Trump National Doral in Miami; and Annette Albright of North Carolina, who lost her race last fall for an at-large seat on the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education.\n\nLoading...\n\nAlbright drew notice in that nonpartisan election after she and other candidates were accused of being \"Trojan horse Republicans,\" as member station WFAE reported.\n\nWWE is a professional wrestling promotion and media company, known for its scripted feats, ringside drama and zealous showmanship.\n\nVince McMahon bought an earlier version of the company in 1982, and, along with his wife Linda McMahon, is credited with bringing its unique blend of wrestling and entertainment into the mainstream. One of WWE's first -- and most enduring -- main attractions was none other than Hogan.\n\nTrump also had a hand in WWE's rise, hosting the fourth and fifth Wrestlemania events. And it was Trump's Apprentice catchphrase, \"You're fired,\" that a suited-up McMahon would shout in the ring. Trump has appeared at numerous WWE events over the years, including as a guest ring announcer and on-screen talent.\n\nTrump \"became part of some of the most compelling and highest-rated storylines in the company's history,\" McMahon said on the RNC stage. That includes in 2007 when Trump shaved McMahon's head.\n\nLinda McMahon left the company for politics, serving as Trump's small business administrator from 2017 to 2019 before leaving to join a pro-Trump super PAC.\n\nVince resigned from his leadership role at the company in January after a former employee filed a lawsuit accusing him of sexually assaulting her in the workplace, sex trafficking and pressuring her into threesomes. That lawsuit was paused earlier this year at the request of the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nThe Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), in contrast, is a mixed martial arts promotion company. It came on the scene in 1993, but wasn't a hit right away. In the early 2000s, Trump let UFC's new president, Dana White, use his Atlantic City casino.

Let Trump-a-Mania rule again! let Trump-a-Mania make America great again!\"\n\nFox News cameras followed Trump's reaction to the speech.

So many people have asked me: 'What happened? Tell us what happened, please,'\" Trump said.\n\nHe promised to tell the crowd \"exactly what happened\" but swore that he would \"never\" share it a second time \"because it's actually too painful to tell.\"\n\nTrump waxed poetic about the \"warm, beautiful day in the early evening\" and the \"cheering\" crowd in Pennsylvania, which then he said was cut off by a \"loud, whizzing sound\" and the feeling of the bullet hitting his ear \"really, really hard.\"\n\nTrump was wearing a white bandage over the ear that had been wounded in the incident. In the crowd, some RNC attendees sported similar ear coverings, which one woman said was done \"in solidarity\" with the former president.\n\nThough he described a \"terrible evening\" and a tense brush with death as \"many bullets\" were fired, he said he felt \"serene.\" He thanked God for his survival and said it was \"probably\" a \"providential moment.\"\n\nThe crowd was riveted by Trump's tale and broke into chants of \"fight\" as the now-viral photo of the former president surrounded by Secret Service agents and raising his fist in the air flashed on the screen behind him.\n\nTrump was his old self\n\nEarlier speakers had seemed to lay the groundwork for a softer version of Trump to take the stage.\n\nA Wednesday night appearance from Trump's granddaughter, Kai Madison Trump, presented the former president as a \"normal grandpa\" who \"gives us candy and soda when our parents aren't looking\" and \"always wants to know how we're doing in school.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Linda McMahon, who served as Trump's small business administrator, shared an anecdote about Trump and his 4-year-old granddaughter at his Mar-a-Lago residence, in which he \"smiled with the love that only a grandfather could have given\" when the girl \"mussed his hair.\"\n\nMcMahon acknowledged the anecdote was \"probably not the typical Donald Trump story\" and said the former president was \"a good man\" with \"the heart of a lion and the soul of a warrior.\"\n\nBut the Trump who spoke Thursday night was the same one seen at every rally since he launched his campaign in 2015.\n\nText of the speech released ahead of time mostly focused on Trump's plans for a potential second term and discussions about the problems he views as facing the country, but he strayed from the planned remarks frequently, pivoting instead to praise allies and attack his enemies.\n\nEven though the script as written did not include President Biden's name, Trump seemingly couldn't resist taking a direct jab at his opponent, saying that \"if you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of the United States ... added them up, they will not have done the damage that Biden has done.\"\n\nHe also dinged former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), calling her \"crazy Nancy\" and yielding boos from the audience toward her. A spokesperson for Pelosi later responded that Trump did not take a \"new tone\" as some expected him to and is the same candidate that he was.\n\nTrump also slammed the leader of United Auto Workers for jobs being sent abroad to countries like China, saying he should be \"ashamed\" and \"fired.\"\n\nAt the same time, Trump leaned into the \"unity\" theme of the week, especially toward the end of his speech when he was back on script, saying that the country's \"destiny\" will be out of reach if people spend their energy fighting each other.\n\n\"We must instead take that energy and use it to realize our country's true potential -- and write our own thrilling chapter of the American story,\" he said.\n\nThe event was like a rock concert\n\nThe crowd was electric throughout Thursday night's lineup, which included celebrity appearances from music star Kid Rock, fight promoter Dana White and wrestling legend Hulk Hogan.\n\nHogan, whose legal name is Terry Bollea, prompted chants of \"USA\" during remarks that praised Trump and his newly-named running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, as \"the greatest tag team of my life.\"\n\nHe also pointed out the raucous, celebratory crowd.\n\n\"When I came here tonight, there was so much energy in this room, I thought maybe I was in Madison Square Garden getting ready to win another title,\" Hogan said. \"But what I found out was I was in a room full of real Americans, brother.\"\n\nKid Rock, meanwhile, had the audience chanting \"fight\" and \"Trump\" as he sang his song \"American Bad Ass.\"\n\nAt the end of the night, Trump made a flashy entrance to a live performance of Lee Greenwood's \"God Bless the U.S.A.\" and wandered the stage, waving at the audience and clapping his hands as the song wrapped up before taking the podium.\n\nThe night ended in a cinematic drop of reportedly more than 100,000 red, white, blue and gold balloons as Trump's family joined him on stage and the Fiserv Forum crowd went wild.\n\nHulk Hogan almost stole the spotlight\n\nIt's a tall task to outshine Trump, but Hogan almost did it.\n\nThe wrestler brought the house down in Milwaukee while delivering a speech praising the former president.\n\nThe crowd burst into a \"USA\" chant as soon as Hogan came to the stage.\n\nBut perhaps the most thrilling moment during his appearance came when the wrestling legend tore his shirt off while speaking to the crowd, unleashing an almost deafening collective roar from the audience.\n\n\"When they tried to kill the next president of the United States, enough was enough, and I said let Trumpamania run wild, brother,\" he said to thunderous applause, in a play on the catchphrase \"Hulkamania.\"\n\nHogan later sat in Trump's box with the former president's family, and Trump himself appeared to acknowledge how much Hogan energized the crowd.\n\n\"How about the Hulkster?\" Trump asked later in the night, which attendees responded to with cheers.\n\nBiden's woes were an undercurrent\n\nAs Republicans reveled in Trump's first post-shooting speech and celebrated his formal acceptance of the party nomination, Democrats continued to see internal battles around Biden and their 2024 ticket.\n\nIn the middle of the RNC, Montana Sen. Jon Tester became the second Democratic senator to call on Biden to withdraw from the presidential race.\n\nTester, a vulnerable Democrat running for reelection in a red state, said he appreciates the incumbent's \"commitment to public service and our country,\" but that Biden \"should not seek reelection to another term.\"\n\nThe Montana senator's move added to ongoing Democratic drama that had been dulled slightly in the wake of the rally shooting but that was renewed when more prominent party names piled on earlier this week.\n\nOn Wednesday, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) shared \"serious concerns\" about Biden's ability to beat Trump in November and Rep. Jim Costa (D-Calif.) joined the calls, saying it's time for Biden to \"pass the torch.\"\n\nTrump brought up Biden by name just once in his RNC speech -- though the reference was notably not in the remarks that were released ahead of time.\n\n\"Only gonna use the term once, Biden. I'm not gonna use the name anymore. Just one time,\" Trump said, and though his speech went after the administration, he avoided talk of the drama playing out across the aisle.\n\nTalk is ramping up about Vice President Kamala Harris potentially replacing her boss at the top of the ticket, and Democratic Party insiders are murmuring that a decision about Biden's political future could come in a matter of days as their own August convention nears.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jared_gans@thehill.com", "name": "Jared Gans", "type": "author", "isAgency": false},

It was exactly what you would expect.\n\nHulk Hogan entered the stage waving an American Flag, while his classic \"Real American\" theme blared through the convention speakers.\n\nIn his speech, which is posted in full on Twitter, he rolled back the years and cut a classic Hulk Hogan promo. The only thing missing was Mean Gene holding the microphone for him.\n\n\"Well let me tell you something, brother! You know something? When I came here tonight, there was so much energy in this room. I thought, maybe, that I was in Madison Square Garden getting ready to win another world title. Or maybe I thought I was gonna press that no good, sticky giant over my head and slam him to the mat, brother.\"\n\n\"But what I found out was I was in a room filled with real Americans, brother. And at the end of the day, with our leader up there, my hero, that gladiator, we're going to bring American back together. One real American at a time, brother!\"\n\nHulk Hogan brought back another classic move from his repertoire - the iconic shirt rip.\n\nHe called Donald Trump and J.D Vance \"the greatest tag team of all time\", referencing his time with \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage in the Mega Powers.\n\nHe mentioned the recent assassination attempt on Trump's life, before ripping off his shirt to reveal a Trump/Vance t-shirt. The crowd erupted as he declared enough was enough, and that \"Trumpamania\" will rule again.\n\n\"They tried to kill the next President of the United States. Enough was enough! I said, 'Let Trumpamania run wild! Let Trumpamania rule again and let Trumpamania make America great again!'\"\n\nLater on the speech, Hulk Hogan spoke as only he can.\n\nHe spoke, once again, about body slamming giants, but proclaimed Donald Trump as the toughest of them all. He warned the criminals and scumbags that Donald Trump, along with his \"Trumpamaniacs\" will run wild on them, referencing his famous catchphrase.\n\nThis was despite referring to Trump's fans as \"Trumpites\" throughout the speech.\n\n\"Over my career, I've been in the ring with some of the biggest, some of the baddest dudes on the planet, and I've squared off against warriors, ooh yeah, savages. And I've even, like I said, body-slammed giants in the middle of the ring. And I know tough guys, but let me tell you something, brother, Donald Trump is the toughest of them all. All you criminals, all you lowlifes, all you scumbags... Whatcha gonna do when Donald Trump and all the Trumpamaniacs run wild on you, brother?!\"", "source": {"uri": "wrestlezone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wrestlezone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hamish_woodward@wrestlezone.com", "name": "Hamish Woodward", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulk Hogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WWE Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Savage", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Randy Savage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tag team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catchphrase", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catchphrase"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://www.wrestlezone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2024/07/hulk-hogan-GettyImages-2162606960-copy.jpg?resize=1200,630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744072", "eventUri": "eng-9744072", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

At 70, Hogan recently mentioned on \"Fox & Friends\" that he is considering entering politics now that he has retired from wrestling. \"We need somebody in there that's got some common sense,\" Hogan said. \"So, if you need a president or vice president, I'll volunteer and take this country over, and I'll rule with an iron fist, a flat tax - nothing but common sense.

The only other living former Republican president, George W. Bush, last addressed a GOP convention remotely from the White House in 2008.\n\nOther speakers include Tucker Carlson, Trump attorney Alina Habba, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Franklin Graham.

Trump becomes the president of the United States, all the real Americans are going to be nicknamed Trumpites because all the Trumpites are going to be running wild for four years,\" the Hulkster said.\n\n\"So with the power of Donald J. Trump and all the Trumpites running wild, America is going to get back on track, and like Donald J. Trump said, America is going to be great again,\" he said.\n\nHis speech was peppered with callbacks and turns of phrase referencing his wrestling career during the 1980s.\n\nMr. Hogan referred in his speech to \"savages,\" \"warriors\" and \"giants,\" alluding to the names of such rivals and allies -- it was pro wrestling, after all -- as Randy Savage, the Ultimate Warrior and Andre the Giant.\n\nMimicking his signature move, Hogan tore away his shirt to reveal a Trump Vance muscle-shirt underneath and sent the crowd into a frenzy by flexing in the exact poses he did when was World Wrestling Federation champion.\n\nHe closed out his speech by giving notice to liberals and riffing off his signature warning to his opponents back then.\n\n\"And what you gonna do when Donald Trump and all the Trumpamaniacs run wild on you!\" he said.\n\nThere is precedent for speakers like the Hulkster, who briefly reminded the audience that his real name is Terry Bollea.\n\nNational conventions have included a variety of quasi-surprises over the years.\n\nActor Clint Eastwood assumed the role at the 2012 convention and scored an array of headlines after addressing an empty chair that represented President Obama.\n\nBefore his speech, Mr. Hogan said he \"got tired of remaining silent\" as he watched the increasing chaos at the border, and inflation raise the cost of groceries and gas.\n\n\"When they took a shot at my hero Donald Trump, I realized that I couldn't be silent any more,\" he said on Fox News. \"You know, I had to step up. I had to be a real American just like all these real Americans here and Donald Trump.\"\n\nHe said he was giddy about vouching for his friend.\n\n\"This is going to be like body-slamming the Giant at WrestleMania,\" he said then, a line he repeated during the Thursday evening speech.\n\nHogan addressed delegates on the final day of the convention and served as part of the warm-up act for Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Trump has dabbled in the art of wrestling himself.\n\nWearing his signature shirt and tie, he slammed World Wrestling Federation CEO Vince McMahon to the group during the Battle of the Billionaires at WrestleMania 23 in 2007 in Detroit.\n\nMr. Hogan was at the center of a 2013 legal dispute over a sex tape that forced the owners of the liberal Gawker website to file for bankruptcy. Peter Thiel, who helped finance the rise of Mr. Trump's vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance, helped bankroll Mr. Hogan's lawsuit.\n\nThe final speaker lineup also included Dana White, CEO of the UFC, and Linda McMahon, head of the Small Business Administration in the Trump White House and former head of World Wrestling Entertainment.\n\nMr. Hogan, 70, brought professional wrestling to the center of American popular culture in the 1980s with his charismatic persona, fabled leg drop, \"24-inch python\" biceps and for sending his fans into a frenzy with a walkout that included musician Rick Derringer's song \"Real American.\"\n\n\"I am a real American,\" the lyrics say. \"Fight for the rights of every man.

The former TV star, who once identified as left-wing and urged Britons to vote for the Labour Party, sparked an outrage in September 2008 when he called the then President George W. Bush a \"re***ded cowboy\" at the MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nThe former Big Brother's Big Mouth host then begged Americans to elect Democrat candidate Barack Obama as their President in the following November. But it looks like Brand has well and truly switched allegiances and found new common ground with the Republican Party.\n\nBrand has kept a low-profile in the UK since September, when he found himself at the centre of numerous allegations of rape, assault and emotional abuse that are said to have taken place between 2006 and 2013. Brand vehemently denied all the allegations at the time and still does to this day.\n\nStepping out in American on Thursday, Brand donned a pair of dark sunglasses, a crucifix necklace and low-cut black shirt as he attended the fourth day of the Republican National Convention at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The British celebrity was amongst delegates, politicians, and the Republican faithful as they showed their support for Donald Trump, 78, and his bid to return to the White House.\n\nTrump, who will be up against President Joe Biden when Americans head to the polls later this year, was rushed offstage after shots were fired at his rally in Butler over the weekend. Trump was roughly six minutes into a speech in Butler when he suddenly reached for the side of his face as gunfire rang out. He then crouched and ran for cover before being rushed off the stage surrounded by Secret Service agents. Blood could be seen on his face and ear and the former US president has been sporting a fetching white bandage right ear ever since.\n\nAt the Republican National Convention on Thursday, Hulk Hogan ripped his shirt off during a speech as he emotionally showed professed his love for Trump. The veteran wrestler - who has known the former US President for more than 35 years - took to the stage to speak at the event after Trump was confirmed as the party's official nominee for the US election in November.\n\nHe drove the crowd wild by taking off his suit jacket and ripping off a tank top to reveal a red Trump/Vance shirt underneath. After coming on stage to the tune of his wrestling theme Real American, he pumped the audience up with his catchphrase, saying: \"Well, let me tell you something brother!\" before referencing the assassination attempt on Trump in Pennsylvania last Saturday when a gun man opened fire on the politician leaving Trump with a wounded ear and killing a crowd-member.\n\nHogan continued: \"What happened last week ...when they took a shot at my hero ....They tried to kill the greatest president of the United States. Enough was enough!!\" He also recalled winning a wrestling world title in front of keen fan Trump and went on to pledge his support to his old friend, adding: \"Over my career, I've been in the ring with some of the biggest, some of the baddest dudes on the planet, and I've squared off against warriors, ooh yeah, savages.\n\n\"And I've even, like I said, body-slammed giants in the middle of the ring. And I know tough guys, but let me tell you something, brother, Donald Trump is the toughest of them all. All you criminals, all you lowlifes, all you scumbags ... Whatcha gonna do when Donald Trump and all the Trumpamaniacs run wild on you, brother?\"\n\nHogan added: \"As as an entertainer, I tried to stay out of politics, but after everything that's happened to our country over the past four years and everything that happened last weekend [the assassination attempt], I can no longer be silent. I'm here tonight because I want the world to know that Donald Trump is a real American hero, and I'm proud to support my hero as the next president of this United States. I've known that man for over 35 years, and he's always been the biggest patriot, and he still is. He's always told you exactly what he thought, and he still does brother. Let Trump-O-Mania rule again, let Trump-O-Mania make America great again!\"\n\nTrump - who is a longtime wrestling fan and has long been involved with the WWE - was seen blowing Hogan a kiss as he finished his speech and later gave him a shout-out as he officially accepted the Republican nomination. He said of Hogan: \"I know about entertainment, but when he used to lift a 350 pound man over his shoulders and then bench press him two rows into the audience, I said, that maybe entertainment, but he is one strong son-of-a-gun.\"\n\nTrump previously hosted WWE's flagship event WrestleMania IV and WrestleMania V at his Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, New Jersey and was a regular ringside. He also took part in 2007's WrestleMania 23 - which was dubbed 'Battle of the Billionaires' - as Trump chose a champion fighter to take on a wrestler chosen by WWE Chairman Vince McMahon with the loser being forced to shave his head.\n\nTrump won and got to keep his famous head of hair and was later seen shaving McMahon's head. The reality TV star-turned-politician was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2013 with his old foe McMahon doing the honours.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zoe_delaney@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Zoe Delaney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulk Hogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Brand", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russell Brand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiserv_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fiserv Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Mouth_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Mouth (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV_Video_Music_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MTV Video Music Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Aldean", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Aldean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cowboy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George W.

However, the former POTUS isn't the only high-profile speaker on tonight's schedule.\n\nPer the New York Post, Hogan was asked on Fox & Friends in June about whether he would consider running for office, to which he replied, \"We need somebody in there that's got some common sense.\"\n\n\"So, if you need a president or vice president, I'll volunteer and take this country over, and I'll rule with an iron fist, a flat tax - nothing but common sense. I know right from wrong, brother,\" he said.\n\nAccording to The Daily Beast, Hogan teased to TMZ in 2016 that he wanted to be Trump's running mate. Ahead of the presidential debate that took place on June 27, Hogan spoke with NewsNation, and was asked who his presidential pick was for the upcoming election.\n\n\"At the end of the day, I'm just wanting somebody to straighten out the gas prices, the food prices, out nation's security,\" he explained. \"I want peace in the Middle East. I just want common sense that knows right from wrong, brother. That's who I want to be president.\"\n\nWhen asked once again for his choice, he couldn't give an answer, saying at the time that he'd \"probably have to put [him]self in there somewhere\" and that the debate's \"going to be the tell-all.\"\n\nWant to know when Hogan is up to speak tonight and how to watch live? Keep reading to find out.\n\nHogan is slated to speak at around 7:54 p.m. CT, per NBC Chicago. Meanwhile, the outlet lists White's speech at 8:53 p.m. CT, just ahead of Donald Trump's scheduled speaking time.\n\nLivestreams of this year's RNC are available via the event's YouTube channel and X. Among the outlets streaming speeches are C-SPAN, CBS News 24/7, NBC News and ABC News.

So many people have asked me: 'What happened? Tell us what happened, please,'\" Trump said.\n\nHe promised to tell the crowd \"exactly what happened\" but swore that he would \"never\" share it a second time \"because it's actually too painful to tell.\"\n\nTrump waxed poetic about the \"warm, beautiful day in the early evening\" and the \"cheering\" crowd in Pennsylvania, which then he said was cut off by a \"loud, whizzing sound\" and the feeling of the bullet hitting his ear \"really, really hard.\"\n\nTrump was wearing a white bandage over the ear that had been wounded in the incident. In the crowd, some RNC attendees sported similar ear coverings, which one woman said was done \"in solidarity\" with the former president.\n\nThough he described a \"terrible evening\" and a tense brush with death as \"many bullets\" were fired, he said he felt \"serene.\" He thanked God for his survival and said it was \"probably\" a \"providential moment.\"\n\nThe crowd was riveted by Trump's tale and broke into chants of \"fight\" as the now-viral photo of the former president surrounded by Secret Service agents and raising his fist in the air flashed on the screen behind him.\n\nEarlier speakers had seemed to lay the groundwork for a softer version of Trump to take the stage.\n\nA Wednesday night appearance from Trump's granddaughter, Kai Madison Trump, presented the former president as a \"normal grandpa\" who \"gives us candy and soda when our parents aren't looking\" and \"always wants to know how we're doing in school.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Linda McMahon, who served as Trump's small business administrator, shared an anecdote about Trump and his 4-year-old granddaughter at his Mar-a-Lago residence, in which he \"smiled with the love that only a grandfather could have given\" when the girl \"mussed his hair.\"\n\nMcMahon acknowledged the anecdote was \"probably not the typical Donald Trump story\" and said the former president was \"a good man\" with \"the heart of a lion and the soul of a warrior.\"\n\nBut the Trump who spoke Thursday night was the same one seen at every rally since he launched his campaign in 2015.\n\nText of the speech released ahead of time mostly focused on Trump's plans for a potential second term and discussions about the problems he views as facing the country, but he strayed from the planned remarks frequently, pivoting instead to praise allies and attack his enemies.\n\nEven though the script as written did not include President Biden's name, Trump seemingly couldn't resist taking a direct jab at his opponent, saying that \"if you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of the United States ... added them up, they will not have done the damage that Biden has done.\"\n\nHe also dinged former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), calling her \"crazy Nancy\" and yielding boos from the audience toward her. A spokesperson for Pelosi later responded that Trump did not take a \"new tone\" as some expected him to and is the same candidate that he was.\n\nTrump also slammed the leader of United Auto Workers for jobs being sent abroad to countries like China, saying he should be \"ashamed\" and \"fired.\"\n\nAt the same time, Trump leaned into the \"unity\" theme of the week, especially toward the end of his speech when he was back on script, saying that the country's \"destiny\" will be out of reach if people spend their energy fighting each other.\n\n\"We must instead take that energy and use it to realize our country's true potential -- and write our own thrilling chapter of the American story,\" he said.\n\nThe crowd was electric throughout Thursday night's lineup, which included celebrity appearances from music star Kid Rock, fight promoter Dana White and wrestling legend Hulk Hogan.\n\nHogan, whose legal name is Terry Bollea, prompted chants of \"USA\" during remarks that praised Trump and his newly-named running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, as \"the greatest tag team of my life.\"\n\nHe also pointed out the raucous, celebratory crowd.\n\n\"When I came here tonight, there was so much energy in this room, I thought maybe I was in Madison Square Garden getting ready to win another title,\" Hogan said. \"But what I found out was I was in a room full of real Americans, brother.\"\n\nKid Rock, meanwhile, had the audience chanting \"fight\" and \"Trump\" as he sang his song \"American Bad Ass.\"\n\nAt the end of the night, Trump made a flashy entrance to a live performance of Lee Greenwood's \"God Bless the U.S.A.\" and wandered the stage, waving at the audience and clapping his hands as the song wrapped up before taking the podium.\n\nThe night ended in a cinematic drop of reportedly more than 100,000 red, white, blue and gold balloons as Trump's family joined him on stage and the Fiserv Forum crowd went wild.\n\nIt's a tall task to outshine Trump, but Hogan almost did it.\n\nThe wrestler brought the house down in Milwaukee while delivering a speech praising the former president.\n\nThe crowd burst into a \"USA\" chant as soon as Hogan came to the stage.\n\nBut perhaps the most thrilling moment during his appearance came when the wrestling legend tore his shirt off while speaking to the crowd, unleashing an almost deafening collective roar from the audience.\n\n\"When they tried to kill the next president of the United States, enough was enough, and I said let Trumpamania run wild, brother,\" he said to thunderous applause, in a play on the catchphrase \"Hulkamania.\"\n\nHogan later sat in Trump's box with the former president's family, and Trump himself appeared to acknowledge how much Hogan energized the crowd.\n\n\"How about the Hulkster?\" Trump asked later in the night, which attendees responded to with cheers.\n\nAs Republicans reveled in Trump's first post-shooting speech and celebrated his formal acceptance of the party nomination, Democrats continued to see internal battles around Biden and their 2024 ticket.\n\nIn the middle of the RNC, Montana Sen. Jon Tester became the second Democratic senator to call on Biden to withdraw from the presidential race.\n\nTester, a vulnerable Democrat running for reelection in a red state, said he appreciates the incumbent's \"commitment to public service and our country,\" but that Biden \"should not seek reelection to another term.\"\n\nThe Montana senator's move added to ongoing Democratic drama that had been dulled slightly in the wake of the rally shooting but that was renewed when more prominent party names piled on earlier this week.\n\nOn Wednesday, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) shared \"serious concerns\" about Biden's ability to beat Trump in November and Rep. Jim Costa (D-Calif.) joined the calls, saying it's time for Biden to \"pass the torch.\"\n\nTrump brought up Biden by name just once in his RNC speech -- though the reference was notably not in the remarks that were released ahead of time.\n\n\"Only gonna use the term once, Biden. I'm not gonna use the name anymore. Just one time,\" Trump said, and though his speech went after the administration, he avoided talk of the drama playing out across the aisle.\n\nTalk is ramping up about Vice President Kamala Harris potentially replacing her boss at the top of the ticket, and Democratic Party insiders are murmuring that a decision about Biden's political future could come in a matter of days as their own August convention nears.", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It won't be remembered like the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1968, where activist violence and political horse trading made for a memorable event for all the wrong reasons.\n\nIt won't be potentially remembered like, um, the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month, where the specter of activist violence and political horse trading could make for a memorable event for all the wrong reasons.\n\nNo, the RNC in Milwaukee saw four nights of harmony, fun, solemnity, entertainment and, most of all, patriotism.\n\nThere were heartfelt tributes to the fallen firefighter who died Saturday trying to protect his family from bullets during the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump. There was a powerful speech from Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance. There was a performance by Kid Rock.\n\nAnd, yes, there was even Hulk Hogan ripping his shirt off on stage in a fit of \"Trumpmania\" and declaring the GOP nominee his \"hero.\"\n\nHogan, legal name Terry G. Bollea, is best known for his professional wrestling persona -- which he didn't shed during his appearance on Thursday night in Milwaukee. According to The New York Times, while both he and Trump have had close ties to World Wrestling Entertainment for decades and even participated in events together, Hogan was undecided as to whom he would support in the election as recently as a month ago.\n\nThat changed after the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"When I saw him stand up with that fist in the air and the blood on his face -- as a warrior, as a leader -- I realized that's what America needs,\" Hogan told Fox News.\n\nHogan's speech contained similar sentiments.\n\n\"You know something, when I came here tonight, there was so much energy in this room, I felt maybe I was in Madison Square Garden getting ready to win another world title,\" he told the crowd. \"The vibe was so intense.\"\n\n\"The energy was so crazy, it felt like maybe I was gonna press that no-good sticky giant over my head and slam him through the mat, brother!\" he exclaimed, referencing his legendary, 1987 body-slam of the 7'4'', 500-pound wrestler Andr\u00e9 the Giant, who died in 1993.\n\n\"Over my career, I've been in the ring with some of the biggest, some of the baddest dudes on the planet, and I've squared off against warriors, ooh yeah, savages,\" he continued, referencing two more WWE legends -- the Ultimate Warrior and \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage.\n\n\"And I've even, like I said, body-slammed giants in the middle of the ring. And I know tough guys, but let me tell you something, brother, Donald Trump is the toughest of them all.\n\n\"All you criminals, all you lowlifes, all you scumbags ... Whatcha gonna do when Donald Trump and all the Trumpamaniacs run wild on you, brother?\"\n\nAnd then came the shirt-ripping moment:\n\n\"What happened last week, when they took a shot at my hero -- they tried to kill the greatest president of the United States!\" he yelled. \"Enough was enough!\"\n\nAnd with that, he did his trademark shirt-rip -- to reveal a Trump/Vance 2024 T-shirt:\n\nIn an interview with Fox News before the appearance, a noticeably calmer Hulk said the deteriorating state of the country is what got him to support Trump publicly.\n\n\"I got tired of remaining silent,\" Hulk said. \"I sat back and watched the borders collapse. I watched the economy collapse. I watched the price of gas, I watched the price of food, everything just do an upside down flip.\n\n\"And when they took a shot at my hero, Donald Trump, I realized I couldn't be silent any more.\"", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "c_douglas_golden@westernjournal.com", "name": "C.

But a video has recently resurfaced of the wrestler enjoying himself making fun of the former reality TV star.\n\nIn the video, which was posted to X (formerly Twitter) by PatriotTakes, Hogan walks viewers through how to do a proper impersonation of Trump. He notably mentioned that it was important to emphasize that a Trump impression requires not being \"cool\" and to \"turn your back on everyone.\"\n\n\"First thing we gotta do is get of anything that's cool,\" Hogan said, taking off his signature sunglasses. \"So sunglasses gotta go.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Fox News suffers body blow as billionaire spends millions to bolster defamation lawsuit\n\n\"Next thing we gotta do is turn our back to everybody or on everybody. So let me turn my back on everybody that's close to me,\" he continued, commenting on how his back \"looks like the Brooklyn Bridge, brother.\"\n\n\"So now that I got my back turned, I'm definitely in character. And in my opinion, Donald Trump, the first thing he would do, would be to pull out the comb. For the over! So we can get the comb... over, brother,\" Hogan said, putting a paper bag on top of his head in an imitation of Trump's hair.\n\n\"And now we pucker them little lips up,\" he added. \"So now I got the combover and I'm officially Trump-itized, Trump-a-mania runnin' wild with the combover -- oh wait a minute, there's a flap of wind covering the bald spot, hold on brother! Whoa, whoa whoa, God, turn the wind down, this is Donald Trump! Whoa, don't blow my hair up! -- Alright, now that I got the combover, the first that I'm gonna do is: 'Ivana, you're fired! Melania, you're fired! ... the new wife, you're f -- wait, I can't fire the new wife, she'll take the other half of my stuff!'\"\n\n\"Anyway, that's how you imitate Donald Trump, chump!\" Hogan said, blowing up the paper bag and popping it in his hands.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Not all peaches and cream': RNC stumped on how to 'soften' Trump's image at convention\n\nThe final night of the RNC, which is typically when the most high-profile speakers take the stage, is decidedly devoid of elected Republican leaders. Instead, singer Kid Rock and Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White will be speaking along with Hogan before Trump gives his nomination speech. White in particular has drawn controversy over his speaking slot, given that he was seen on video slapping his wife at a New Year's Eve party.\n\nTrump's speech on Thursday night will be his first public speech since he was nearly assassinated last Saturday at a Pennsylvania rally. While he has appeared at Fiserv Forum wearing a bandage over his ear, he has notably not yet released medical records, which would confirm that he was struck by a bullet rather than grazed by shrapnel.\n\nWatch Hogan's video below, or by clicking this link.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Sleight of hand': How one RNC speech 'laid bare' what 'law and order' actually means to GOP", "source": {"uri": "alternet.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Alternet.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulk Hogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WWE Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impersonator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Impersonator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiserv_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiserv Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

And at the end of the day, with our leader up there, my hero, that gladiator, we're gonna bring America back together, one real American at a time, brother,\" Hogan said.\n\nHogan went on to compare Trump and his running mate, Hillbilly Elegy's J.D. Vance, to himself and a former ally. \"You know somethin', I've seen some great tag-teams in my time: Hulk Hogan and oooh yeah, the Macho Man Randy Savage,\" he said. \"But you know somethin'? I see the greatest tag-team of my life standing upon us, getting ready to straighten this country out for all the real Americans.\"\n\nLater, Hogan called the former president \"Donald Dick J. Trump\" for some reason. \"Even though you guys are real Americans, you better get ready, because when Donald Dick J. Trump becomes the president of the United States, all the real Americans are gonna be nicknamed Trumpites,\" he explained. \"Because all the Trumpites are gonna be runnin' wild for four years. So with the power of Donald J. Trump and all the Trumpites runnin' wild, America is gonna get back on track, like Donald J. Trump said: America is gonna be great again.\"\n\nThe most memorable moment in Hogan's speech came with an instantly-memeable (and mockable) visual cue: He ripped open his Hulk Hogan shirt to reveal a Trump-Vance 2024 top beneath it.\n\n\"I think about how Donald Trump, his family was compromised,\" he said. \"When I look out there and I see Donald Trump, I think about how his business was compromised. But what happened last week when they took a shot at my hero, and they tried to kill the next president of the United States, enough was enough! And I said, let Trumpamania run wild, brother. Let Trumpamania rule again. Let Trumpamania make America great again.\"\n\nSign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\nHogan also argued that Trump is stronger than all of his former opponents in the ring, invoking some of the 45th president's most shameful moments as if they're prideful battle scars. \"Donald Trump is the toughest of them all,\" he said. \"They've thrown everything at Donald Trump -- all the investigations, the impeachments, the court cases -- and he's still standing and kicking their butts. You know, we never had it better than the Trump years.\"\n\nThe wrestler concluded his remarks by directly addressing a very strange set of viewers. \"All you criminals, all you low-lifes, all you scumbags, all you drug dealers, and all you crooked politicians need to answer one question, brother: Whatcha gonna do when Donald Trump and all the Trumpomaniacs run wild on you, brother?\" he posited. \"God bless you, and thank you.\"\n\nThe live-stream then cut to Trump smiling, pumping his fist, and even blowing a kiss to the wrestler.\n\nThe RNC has also heard speeches from Amber Rose, Dana White, and Tucker Carlson.", "source": {"uri": "ew.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Weekly"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulk Hogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

The convention band, Nashville-based Sixwire, banged out hit after hit. Attendees saw a video montage of Trump's long history of cultivating friendships with celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey and fat Al Sharpton.

More info\n\nMelania Trump revealed what she really thought at the Republican National Convention after she struggled to control her facial expression.\n\nThe former first lady accompanied husband Donald Trump, 78, as he accepted the GOP nomination at the event in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on Thursday (July 18) and gave a passionate speech. The gathering saw him speak out publicly for the first time since he survived an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally which saw him sustain an injury to the ear.\n\nWWE icon Hulk Hogan and musician Kid Rock were among the celebrity attendees to the event - Kid Rock even performed at the event. However it seemed Melania wasn't keen on the All Summer Long singer's set.\n\nPosting a video of the moment to X (formerly Twitter) one critic said: \"Melania Trump trying not to laugh at Kid Rock is the funniest thing I've ever seen.\"\n\nAnother added: \"He's an acquired taste.\" Someone else echoed the sentiment, adding: \"It is difficult not to laugh at him, I understand her struggle.\"\n\nA third agreed: \"I don't blame her,\" while another said they found the situation \"so funny.\"\n\nWWE star Hulk Hogan, real name Terry Gene Bollea, also made waves at the convention as he ripped off his shirt on stage. He went on to dub Trump a \"hero\" and condemn his would-be killer.\n\n\"What happened last week... when they took a shot at my hero... They tried to kill the greatest president of the United States! \" he exclaimed. \"Enough was enough!\"\n\nHogan then called for \"Trump-o-mania [to] make America great again.\"\n\nThe assassination attempt on the former President came last week, when five bullets were fired into a crowd gathered at a rally. The Republican nominee survived the incident with a pierced ear while two additional people were injured.\n\nFirefighter Corey Comperatore died during the attack. The perpetrator, identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks, was also shot dead.\n\nFollowing the ordeal, Trump took to social media to describe what happened. \"I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin,\" he said.\n\n\"Much bleeding took place.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lizzie_mcallister@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Lizzie McAllister", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_Rock", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kid Rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WWE Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hulk Hogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Summer_Long_(Kid_Rock_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All Summer Long (Kid Rock song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33282173.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screenshot-2024-07-19-at-093835-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744072", "eventUri": "eng-9744072", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 429, "textEnd": 436}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

So I started out playing guitar, and as things go as a music kid, you start playing in bands.\"\n\nAfter another guitarist joined one of his early bands Hogan switched to playing bass. \"All of a sudden, I got in a really good band playing guitar, but then this different, really good guitar player came along -- and this guy was really great,\" said Hogan. \"I had a choice: leave the band or start playing bass. So I chose to become a pretty darn good bass player.\"\n\nYears later, Hogan can be seen playing guitar again in the music video for his wrestling theme song \"Real American.\"\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\nYears later, Hogan dropped out of college to give more attention to his band Ruckus, which he formed in 1976. \"[Ruckus] was my last band,\" said Hogan. \"I had been on the road for ten years, and I was a studio musician in Atlanta, a century artist.\"\n\nRuckus gained a following of fans from some of the regional wrestlers around Florida that Hogan came across at Hector's Gym in Tampa, Florida. Hogan's gigs with Ruckus ultimately led to his being recruited into wrestling by late wrestler Jack Brisco after he caught a glimpse of the long-haired and ripped bass player at a club one night.\n\nAfter moving on to the WWF, Hogan's career skyrocketed and even stretched into acting with roles in Rocky III (1982), No Holds Barred, Mr. Nanny, and more throughout the decades. He returned to music with the release of The Wrestling Album, the debut WWF soundtrack album from 1985, which featured cameos by the once-wrestling sidekick and manager Cyndi Lauper along with the Bernard Kenny and Rick Derringer-penned Hogan theme song \"Real American.\"\n\n[RELATED: 'The Voice' Season 24 Winner Huntley on his Win and Creating a fan base of Huntley Maniacs]\n\nBy the late-'80s, Hogan started getting back into music and appeared in Dolly Parton's music video for \"Headlock on My Heart,\" a song she wrote for her short-lived Dolly TV show, about marrying a wrestler. Hogan also sang on the Green Jelly cover of Gary Glitter's 1973 hit \"I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am)\" in 1993 before fronting the Wrestling Boot Band, featuring his then-wife Linda Bollea, former manager, wrestling legend \"Mouth of the South\" Jimmy Hart, and John J. Maguire -- the writer behind many of wresters' iconic theme songs, including Shawn Michael's \"Sexy Boy,\" The Million Dollar Man Ted Dibiase's \"It's All About the Money,\" and Koko B. Ware's 'Do the Bird.\"\n\nIn 1995, the band released a sole album, Hulk Rules, a collection of 10 songs composed by Hogan, Hart, and Maguire. The album later peaked at No. 12 on the Billboard Top Kid Audio chart and had an earlier supporter: Simon Cowell.\n\n\"Hulk and everybody else there just chipped in, sat around for a few weeks, and wrote ten songs,\" said Hart of how the album came together. \"All of a sudden, we got a major record deal on Select Records, and the next thing you know, we're over in Europe knocking on a few doors with the album while Hulk was doing a big promotional thing for one of his movies at the time. Then we had a magic phone call from this A&R guy, Simon Cowell, who we'd never heard of before. He brought us in and said, \"I love this album.'\"\n\nTo celebrate the Hulkster and the music he once made, here's a look at three songs Hogan had a hand in writing.\n\n1. \"The Hulkster's in the House\"\n\nThe opening track on Hulk Rules, \"The Hulkster's in the House\" is a motivational song about getting back up when the going gets tough. The song was featured in Malcolm in the Middle episode \"The Bully\" in 2000.\n\nThe Hulkster's in the house\n\nCheck him out; check him out\n\nGet up off your seat\n\nHe's got a brand new beat\n\nWhen the going gets tough\n\nThe tough get rough\n\nHey hey, oh oh, come on, let's go\n\nHey hey, oh oh, come on, let's go\n\nThe Hulkster's in the room\n\nYou know he's on the move\n\nI can feel it in my feet\n\nWe're moving to the beat\n\n2. \"Bad to the Bone\"\n\nHogan's \"Bad to the Bone\" had nothing to do with the George Thorogood and the Destroyers' 1982 classic. His was more heavy metal-bent rocker about getting on the highway with your Harley Davidson and your woman.\n\nCome on baby, we're a-going for a ride\n\nPut your arms around me and a-hold on tight\n\nTurn up the music cuz we wanna hear it loud\n\nThe girls all know it's a boys' night out\n\nCuz we're bad, bad, bad\n\nTo the bone\n\nTo the bone\n\nHead out on the highway, let that Harley rip and roar\n\nHammer down the throttle, give that baby some more\n\nTurn up the volume cuz we like to rock n' roll\n\nThe girls all know that we're outta control\n\n3. \"American Made\"\n\nThe anthemic \"American Made\" gives a quick nod to Hogan's \"Real American\" theme song. Hogan later used \"American Made\" as a new theme song after signing over to WCW in 1994.\n\nHe's got the red white and blue running through his veins\n\nHe was born and raised in the U.S. of A\n\nHe's government inspected, he's U.S. grade\n\nIf you mess with the flag, it's like a slap in his face\n\nHe's American made (American)\n\nHe's American made (A real American)\n\nHe's American made (American)\n\nHe's American, 'merican, made\n\nHe's got the stars and stripes running through his veins\n\nHe was born and raised the American way\n\nHe wears the heart of his country on his sleeve\n\nHe'll fight for your freedom if you really believe\n\nPhoto: MediaPunch/Shutterstock", "source": {"uri": "americansongwriter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Songwriter"},

Donald Trump is the toughest of them all. They've thrown everything at Donald Trump, all the investigations, the impeachments, the court cases, and he's still standing and kicking their butts,\" Hogan said during the event in Fiserv Forum.\n\nNotably, the legendary wrestler has a long relationship with Trump, who is a big fan of professional wrestling. Hogan performed at both WrestleMania IV and WrestleMania V events that were sponsored by Trump, according to Politico.\n\n\"What happened last week when they took a shot at my hero... They tried to kill the next president of the United States? Enough was enough. I said, let Trump-a-mania run wild, brother! Let Trump-a-mania, rule again.

The event also featured mixed martial arts executive Dana White, the rapper and singer Kid Rock. Before Trump was due to take the stage for his keynote address, the convention paused to welcome his wife, Melania Trump, who has rarely been seen during the campaign.\n\nIn his highly-awaited address, the former US President described on Thursday how he narrowly survived an attempt on his life, telling the audience that he was only there \"by the grace of Almighty God\". \"I heard a loud whizzing sound and felt something hit me really, really hard on my right ear. I said to myself, 'Wow, what was that? It can only be a bullet'.\"\n\nThe former president struck an unusually conciliatory tone during the speech's opening moments, when he formally accepted the party's presidential nomination. He also attacked current President Joe Biden for \"destroying\" the country. He said that the Republicans will secure an \"incredible victory\" in the presidential elections in November this year.\n\n\"I stand before you this evening with a message of confidence, strength and hope. Four months from now we will have an incredible victory, and we will begin the four greatest years in the history of our country,\" he said amid the roaring crowd.\n\nThe Republican candidate appealed to the country to unify and said that the best way to do it would be for Democrats to drop criminal cases against him. \"We must not criminalise dissent or demonise political disagreement, which is what's been happening in our country lately at a level that nobody has ever seen before,\" Trump said.\n\n(with inputs from agencies)", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_Hogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulk Hogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiserv_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiserv Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania_IV", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania IV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_Rock", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kid Rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_White", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dana White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Impeachment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2024/07/hulk-hogan-1721364076.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9744072", "eventUri": "eng-9744072", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

He displayed the former fire chief's uniform and helmet, which he kissed.\n\n\"Tragically, the shooter claimed the life of one of our fellow Americans, Corey Comperatore -- an unbelievable person, everyone tells me -- and seriously wounded two other great warriors,\" Trump said.\n\nThe crowd chanted, \"Corey, Corey.\"\n\nTrump said he had spoken to Comperatore's widow earlier in the day and announced a $1 million contribution to the family from Florida lawyer Dan Newlin.\n\n\"I ask that we observe a moment of silence in honor of our friend, Corey,\" the 45th president said.\n\nDemocrats and many in the media repeatedly have claimed that Trump is an existential threat to democracy, political commentator Tucker Carlson told the conventional hall.\n\nBut, Carlson noted, politicians in Washington have refused to respond to the will of the people for generations.\n\n\"Democracy, in case you're a little sick of being beaten in the face with 'democracy' on television, actual democracy is the proposition that the citizens of the country own that country,\" Carlson said, referring to Democrats' Trump-is-a-threat-to-democracy narrative.\n\n\"They are not renters, not slaves, not serfs,\" he said of Americans. \"They are the owners.\"\n\nCarlson talked about the moment after Trump was shot, when he stood back up and put a hand in the air to reassure and inspire his watching supporters.\n\n\"The effect that it had on Donald Trump -- he was no longer a political party's nominee or a former president or a future president. This was the leader of a nation,\" Carlson said.\n\nEric Trump Slams Biden for Fentanyl, Border Crisis\n\nEric Trump, Trump's middle son and the man who now heads his business empire, told Americans that the Biden administration isn't responsive to Americans' plight, but that it doesn't have to be this way.\n\n\"Energy prices are soaring. Interest rates are crippling. Everything is unaffordable,\" Eric Trump said. \"The U.S. dollar has been diminished. Inflation has made it impossible for Americans to live, to save for their future.\"\n\nHe accused the Biden administration of inaction to secure the southern border, among other examples.\n\n\"Fentanyl is killing our youth and destroying families, while the current administration stands idly by, hoping their inaction will import illegal votes,\" the younger Trump said. \"Crime terrorizes our cities and our suburbs as far-left policies handcuff police. Male athletes, guys my height, 6-foot 5 inches, are swimming in women's sports, destroying the dreams of young girls who have trained every minute of their lives.\"\n\nHe said that can change if his father is elected president again.\n\n\"He stood tall, fueled not by personal ambition but by a profound love for this country and a love for all of you -- the American people,\" the former president's son said. \"That man is the 45th president and soon to be 47th president of the United States.\"\n\nThe Rev. Franklin Graham, son of the famous evangelist Billy Graham, told the convention crowd that Trump had a near-death experience Saturday evening.\n\n\"God spared his life,\" Graham said. \"When we go through these experiences, it changes us. It can cause us to examine our lives and to reevaluate our priorities, as it should.\"\n\n\"When President Trump rose from that platform,\" Graham said, \"he rose with his fist raised in strength, showing Americans his unshakeable resolve to fight for them and this nation.\"\n\n\"I cannot explain why God would take one life and allow another to be taken,\" the preacher said. \"One thing I do know is that God loves us, and he wants us to be in heaven with him one day.\"\n\nPro wrestling legend Hulk Hogan told the convention hall that he recalled Donald Trump being in the front row for one of his world championship victories.\n\nIn typically enthusiastic fashion, Hogan went on to call Trump his hero.\n\n\"When they took a shot at my hero and they tried to kill the next president of the United States, enough was enough,\" Hogan said, as he did a characteristic ripping of his shirt to reveal a red Trump-Vance T-shirt.\n\n\"And I said, let Trumpamania run wild. Let Trumpamania rule again. Let Trumpamania make America great again.\"\n\nHogan said that as an entertainer, he tried to stay out of politics, but he said he no longer could stay silent.\n\n\"We had a strong economy, a secure border, and peace abroad, and we lost it in the blink of an eye,\" he told the GOP delegates and an audience across the nation.\n\nHogan again used one of his trademark slogans to ask a question of criminals and drug dealers.\n\n\"Whatcha gonna do when Donald Trump and all the Trumpaniacs run wild on you, brother?\" he said.\n\nPompeo Compares Foreign Policy Records of Trump, Biden\n\nMike Pompeo, also a former Kansas congressman, said it was his \"greatest honor\" to serve as secretary of state and director of the Central Intelligence Agency in the Trump administration.\n\n\"There were no new American wars. Our southern border, closed. It may seem like a long time ago, when we took office, there were people's heads being cut off at the beaches. We destroyed [the terrorist group] ISIS and its caliphate,\" Pompeo told the crowd.\n\nHe addressed two current wars under Biden, one stemming from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the other from Hamas' terrorist attacks inside Israel.\n\n\"For those four years, the evil of [Russian President] Vladimir Putin was held at bay,\" Pompeo said. \"When we walked out, January of 2021, the Iranian regime was afraid and the people of Israel were strong and secure and we treated them like the friend and ally that they need to be.\"\n\nHe added that China never flew a spy balloon over America during Trump's presidency, as occurred during the Biden administration.\n\n\"Had I been secretary of state and a China spy balloon flew across our country, I would have been the former secretary of state, and rightfully so,\" Pompeo said to cheers.\n\nDetroit pastor Lorenzo Sewell, an urban supporter of the former president, fired up the crowd as he recalled Trump's visit to his church last month, which sparked controversy among some.\n\n\"Can you imagine Donald Trump coming to our city and calling a pastor like me, a pastor who was raised on the East Side of Detroit?\" Sewell asked from the stage. \"I was mentored by murderers. I was a student of the streets. But I had a radical experience with Jesus Christ that changed my life forever.\"\n\nSewell continued:\n\nPresident Trump came to a church that is in a Democratic stronghold. He came to a church to listen to average, everyday Americans like you and like me. He came to a church, not to speak to us, but to listen to us.\n\nHe came into a church and a lot of people were upset. A lot of people would ask me questions. Why would you allow Donald Trump to come to your church?\n\nHow many know that the Bible says we are all sinners and we all need the grace of God? How many know that the Bible says he who has not sinned, cast the first stone?\n\nAs delegates cheered, Sewell also suggested that Jesus Christ spared Trump's life for a reason Saturday evening in Butler, Pennsylvania.", "source": {"uri": "theminnesotasun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Minnesota Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson",

After seeing the dollar signs in the budging company, Trump decided he wanted a piece of the action.\n\nHulk Hogan will speak at the RNC in Milwaukee before Donald Trump accepts his nomination\n\nTrump's relationship with WWE goes back to the height of Hulkamania in 1998\n\nRead MoreBREAKING NEWS John Cena announces his retirement from WWE after 22 years\n\nHaving hosted Mike Tyson bouts at The Atlantic City Convention Hall (later promoted as Trump Plaza), Trump opened the doors for the company and provided a venue for WrestleMania IV.\n\nThe four-hour spectacular featured Hogan and Andre the Giant on the poster. The pair would meet in the quarterfinals of the WrestleMania Tournament, a match that ended in a double disqualification in front of 19,199 fans.\n\n'I just wanted a piece of it,' Trump said on The True Story of WrestleMania. 'Everybody in the country wanted this event, and we were able to get it.'\n\nFollowing the success of WrestleMania IV, Trump got a kick out of hosting the pro wrestling extravaganza and decided to do it again the following year. Atlantic City welcomed WrestleMania V in 1989 thanks to Trump's efforts. Those two years marked the only time the a city hosted consecutive WrestleMania cards.\n\nSince hosting back to back WrestleManias, Trump maintained a good relationship with WWE\n\nTrump and McMahon starred in the Battle of the Billionaires at WrestleMania 23 in 2007\n\nTrump's pick, Bobby Lashley, defeated Umaga with Stone Cold Steve Austin as the referee\n\nRead More Tiger Woods' major misery continues at The Open as he struggles to catastrophic eight-over\n\nFrom there, Trump became a looming presence in the promotion. In 1991, Trump attended WrestleMania VII in Los Angeles with Chuck Norris. Announcer Gene Okerlund briefly spoke to the pair during the program after they were shown on screen.\n\nIn 2004, Trump was at WrestleMania XX in Madison Square Garden and provided an interview that would foreshadow future events. In an interview, Jesse Ventura told Trump: 'I think that we may need a wrestler in the White House in 2008.'\n\nLittle did he know, he was speaking to the future occupant of the Oval Office.\n\nThe peak of his involvement perhaps came during the 'Battle of the Billionaires' at WrestleMania 23 in 2007.\n\nAs a result, Trump shaved McMahon's head bald in front of the Detroit crowd\n\nTrump was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2007 for his decades of involvement\n\nRead More UFC's Dana White calls Donald Trump 'the ultimate American bada**'\n\nTrump and McMahon agreed to each pick a superstar to pin against the other's at the event. The loser would then get their head shaved bald in front of the Detroit crowd.\n\nTrump picked ECW champion Bobby Lashley, who would pin McMahon's pick Umaga - a tattooed Samoan heavyweight - in the match officiated by Stone Cold Steve Austin. However, in true Rattlesnake fashion, nobody was safe and Trump took a Stone Cold Stunner after shaving McMahon's head.\n\nIn 2009, WWE writers ran with a storyline in which Trump bought Monday Night Raw and promised changes to how the show was ran.\n\nWhile the thread did not last as long, Trump was still inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2013, shortly before he ran and won the presidential

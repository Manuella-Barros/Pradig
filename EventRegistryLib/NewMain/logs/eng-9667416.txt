The challenges and crises, how they were resolved - or not - and how he nearly died from Covid.\n\n\"Riots, knife crime, bikes, buses, the London Olympics and so much more. He writes about his role in Brexit and the constitutional sea-change that took place in British politics in 2019 - with his landslide election victory and the massive expansion in the groups that think of themselves as Conservative. \"\n\nBoris Johnson said: \"I am honoured that HarperCollins is publishing my personal account of the huge realignment that took place in UK politics in the last 15 years - and what may lie ahead. So stand by for my thoughts on Britain's future to explode over the publishing world like a much shaken bottle of champagne.\"\n\nWilliam Collins Publishing Director Arabella Pike said: \"Unlike most top politicians, Boris Johnson is also a writer.

He was forced out of office in September 2022 after overseeing repeated scandals including Partygate and his handling of groping allegations against former Tory whip Chris Pincher.\n\nHis memoir will come six months after his successor Liz Truss published her own book, Ten Years to Save the West.\n\nBritain's shortest-serving prime minister filled the memoir with jaw-dropping anecdotes from her time in Downing Street including the admission she thought \"why me, why now?\" after learning the Queen had died.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HarperCollins", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "HarperCollins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_London", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downing Street"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clwyd_South_(UK_Parliament_constituency)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clwyd South (UK Parliament constituency)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henley_(UK_Parliament_constituency)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Henley (UK Parliament constituency)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Livingstone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ken Livingstone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Wales"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Pincher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Pincher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partygate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Partygate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Truss", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liz Truss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brexit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whip_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Whip (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Jack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Union Jack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cameron", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Cameron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_May", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Theresa May"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Publishing_and_Printing/Publishing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Publishing and Printing/Publishing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Publishing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Publishing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Book_Writing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Book Writing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/20/14/boris%20book%20unleashed.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667416", "eventUri": "eng-9667416", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Thankfully, a third (and fourth) helping of the beloved series will be served on Hulu shortly. Find out everything about The Bear Season 3, from the release date to the plot. Plus, watch the first teaser that reveals whether or not Carmy made it out of the freezer.\n\nCreated by Christopher Storer, the Emmy-winning series The Bear follows the food industry through the eyes of a talented young chef named Carmen (Carmy) Berzatto. After his brother's death, he has to leave his career in fine dining to run a local Chicagoan sandwich shop. Jeremy Allen White, Ayo Edebiri, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Matty Matheson, Abby Elliott, Liza Colon-Zayas, and Lionel Boyce also star in the hit show.\n\nThe second season of the series, released in June 2023, won several accolades during the most recent award season, including Best Comedy at the Primetime Emmy Awards, Best Television Series (Musical or Comedy) at the Golden Globe Awards, and Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble (Comedy Series) at the SAG Awards.\n\nFX and Hulu swiftly renewed the cooking drama for a third season in November 2023. \"The Bear, which wowed audiences in its first season only to achieve even greater heights in season two, has become a cultural phenomenon,\" the president of FX Entertainment, Nick Grad, said in a statement at the time. \"We and our partners at Hulu join fans in looking forward to the next chapter in the story of The Bear.\"\n\nIn April 2024, The Bear was quietly renewed for a fourth season, which will film right after Season 3. Production for the third season officially began in February 2024 following delays from the now-resolved writers' and actors' strikes.\n\nKeep reading for everything to know about The Bear Season 3.\n\nIt's official: The third season of The Bear will be released on Hulu on June 27, 2024. All 10 episodes of the forthcoming season will drop all at once on the streamer.\n\nSeason 3 will also debut on June 27 exclusively on Disney+ in the UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Gibraltar, the Balkans, Singapore, Hong Kong and the Philippines, and be available on Disney+ in all other territories at a later date.\n\nBack in December, White revealed on the Today show that filming for the third season would begin around February. \"I think we're going to get started up in like February, March,\" he said.\n\nThe 33-year-old star added that he'd have to refine his skills before reentering the cooking world. \"I'm going to get together with some chefs in January and start prepping in the kitchen again, sharpening up the skills,\" White said.\n\nWhen asked if restaurant staff would recognize him and his Bear costars and \"send out free food,\" White responded, \"Yeah, they kept us fed.\"\n\nMost original cast members from Season 2 are expected to return for The Bear Season 3, including lead stars Jeremy Allen White and Ayo Edebiri. See the anticipated Season 3 cast list below:\n\nThe second season had numerous exciting cameos; Jamie Lee Curtis guest starred as Carmy's mother Donna Berzatto, Molly Gordon appeared as Carmy's (almost) girlfriend Claire, and Jon Bernthal returned for a flashback scene as Carmy's deceased brother, Mikey. It's unknown whether any of last season's guest stars will return for Season 3.\n\nSeason 3 of The Bear will likely pick up with Carmy's restaurant's re-opening. We last saw the talented chef and his crew in the Season 2 finale during Friends and Family Night. A few unanswered questions remain after season two, including where Carmy and Claire's relationship stands, whether The Bear will be profitable, and if Carmy will need to pay back Uncle Jimmy's massive loan.\n\nThe official description for Season 3 reads, \"Carmy pushes himself harder than ever and demands excellence from his crew, who do their best to match his intensity. Their quest for culinary excellence will propel the crew to new levels and stress the bonds that hold the restaurant together. As the team grows in size, each member will strive to reach a greater level of service within their role.\"\n\nThe synopsis continues, \"In the restaurant industry, you're never on solid ground, and with that ever-changing landscape comes new challenges and opportunities. Our chefs have learned that every second counts, but this season we'll find out if they have what it takes to make it to tomorrow.\"\n\nAlthough FX has not yet released an official trailer for The Bear Season 3, the network released a teaser on May 9. FX posted the clip on YouTube, and White also shared it on his Instagram account. The video shows Carmy back in the kitchen (and out of the freezer, thankfully).\n\nWatch the new teaser for The Bear Season 3, below.\n\nThe official teaser comes after a clip from the upcoming season -- which was initially presented at a Disney shareholders meeting -- was leaked to X (formerly Twitter) in Apriland picked up by media sites. Following the leak, FX requested that media channels remove the unauthorized clip from circulation.\n\n\"Today during The Walt Disney Company's Annual Shareholder Meeting, a clip from the upcoming third season of FX's The Bear was shown as part of the presentation,\" FX said in a statement, according to The Hollywood Reporter. \"The clip was subsequently captured and shared publicly without permission. This clip is not authorized for use beyond the shareholder meeting and we request that you and/or your outlet do not post or share it in any manner. If it has already been posted, we request that it be removed immediately.\"\n\nThe first two seasons and the upcoming third season of The Bear are exclusively available to stream on Hulu -- or Disney+ if you have the Disney Bundle.\n\nWant to learn more about Hulu plans?

Yep, The Bear is back for its third season on June 27, when all 10 episodes will be available for viewing on Hulu. When so many Peak TV series are taking multiple years between seasons, it's nice to have a streaming hit that's actually reliable. (We're looking at you, Severance!)\n\nThe Bear release date news was accompanied by the first teaser for the season, which features an isolated, unhappy-looking Carmy alone in the restaurant's kitchen. He unfolds his knives and hits us with a thousand-yard stare before the camera pans all the way out of the building and onto the Chicago city skyline, moody music playing all along. The whole thing is a real barrel o' laughs, befitting an Emmy winner for Outstanding Comedy Series. (Yeah, yeah, the \"Is The Bear funny?\" debate is tired, sorry.)\n\n\"Season three of FX's The Bear follows Carmen 'Carmy' Berzatto (Jeremy Allen White), Sydney Adamu (Ayo Edebiri) and Richard 'Richie' Jerimovich (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) as they do what it takes to elevate The Bear, their beef stand turned fine dining establishment, to the highest level, all while doing their best just to stay in business. It's a losing battle every single day in the restaurant business. Carmy pushes himself harder than ever, and demands excellence from his crew, who do their best to match his intensity,\" reads a synopsis for the new season. \"Their quest for culinary excellence will propel the crew to new levels and stress the bonds that hold the restaurant together. As the team grows in size, each member will strive to reach a greater level of service within their role. In the restaurant industry, you're never on solid ground, and with that ever-changing landscape comes new challenges and opportunities. Our chefs have learned that every second counts, but this season we'll find out if they have what it takes to make it to tomorrow.\"\n\nThe Bear has a lot to prove after its aforementioned Emmy win -- and reminder, by a quirk of timing, last year's Emmys sweep was for the first season of the show. The second season will compete at this year's Emmys, after we've already seen the third season, which is a tad confusing. To discombobulate you further, the show reportedly already filmed its fourth season back-to-back with the third. There were rumors the show would conclude with four, but those have so far been unsubstantiated. Of course, the cast is incredibly in demand right now, but that doesn't mean they won't be back for more Beef. But let's take things one season at a time, shall we?", "source": {"uri": "avclub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The A.V.

Production began in Chicago in February, and the third season is set to debut on FX and Hulu in June.\n\nIn December, White, 33, revealed that shooting would begin in February during an interview on the Today show, as he said, \"I'm going to get together with some chefs in January and start prepping in the kitchen again, sharpening up the skills.\"\n\nIt's a practice he's done before. He told Gold Derby in June that he \"spent a lot of time as a fly on the wall\" at a French restaurant in Santa Monica prior to the show's first season in order to gain some real-life experience in the kitchen.\n\nRelated: Jeremy Allen White Says He 'Won't Be Doing As Much' Elaborate Cooking in Season 2 of 'The Bear'\n\n\"I'd help them prep where you can't really screw up anything too badly,\" he told the outlet, before sharing that on one particularly \"busy night,\" the restaurant's chef told him to \"start cooking\" and he was \"so, so scared.\"\n\nThe experience shaped how he sees restaurants now, he said. \"I just started looking at restaurants as little miracles. It's such a difficult and competitive world to enter.\"\n\nWhite's costars got in some prep work, too. Courtney Storer, the show's culinary producer, told PEOPLE that Ayo Edebiri, who plays aspiring chef Sydney, came to visit her in L.A. before shooting began on season 1 to learn a thing or two.\n\nRelated: 'The Bear's Ayo Edebiri Admits 'Eggs Are Tough for Me Right Now' After Making So Many Omelets (Exclusive)\n\n\"She really got to see how I move, how I navigate in a space, how I prep things, how I prioritize. I talked a lot to her about confidence, carrying my shoulders, how I move, to kind of get respect or have this position of leadership,\" Storer said of Edebiri's time in the kitchen with her.\n\n\"I think I was always really tiny in a space, and I could feel really small and I had to find ways to use my voice to get attention,\" she added. \"So we spent a lot of time on that.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bear_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Bear (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Allen_White", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Allen White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayo_Edebiri", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ayo Edebiri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian_(season_2)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian (season 2)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebon_Moss-Bachrach", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ebon Moss-Bachrach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FX_(TV_channel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FX (TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_dining", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fine dining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_If...?_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "What If...?

The Bear season 3 is returning this summer -- FX finally gave us a taste of it. In a new teaser for the series (above), Carmy (Jeremy Allen White) is alone in his restaurant -- and finally out of the damn fridge! -- before the camera zooms all the way out to show the Chicago skyline. Plus, we have an official release date. All 10 episodes of The Bear season 3 will stream on June 27.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, Deadline reported earlier this year that seasons 3 and 4 filmed back to back. FX hasn't officially confirmed that the hit culinary drama will return for a fourth season, but audiences are clearly hungry for more of Carmy and co. Now, it appears The Bear plans to serve up at least two more courses. \"Our crew is amazing -- like very amazing,\" creator Christopher Storer told Esquire last summer. \"Our actors know how fast we drill and are able to make this thing feel incredibly alive and incredibly nerve-wracking, which isn't easy. I'm in awe of them every day.\"\n\nThe Bear won big at both the Emmys and the Golden Globes, taking home top acting honors for both of its main stars. Honestly, we're not surprised. It's impossible to resist the allure of Carmy, Sydney, and the rest of the impeccable Chicago restaurant staff. The Bear won Outstanding Comedy Series, Lead Actor (Jeremy Allen White), Supporting Actress (Ayo Edebiri), and Supporting Actor (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) at the Emmys, with With and Edebiri nabbing the top Golden Globes awards as well. Thankfully, we'll be reunited with all of them soon. The Bear season 3 is heading back to the kitchen for a release later this June.\n\nIn season 2, Carmy (White) and his team attempt to open a new restaurant just 12 weeks after his family's sandwich shop, The Original Beef of Chicagoland (AKA The Beef), shut down. The season finale concludes several journeys of self-discovery. Sydney (Ayo Edibiri) has been schooled in the tao of Coach K, Cousin Ritchie (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) learned to appreciate the finer things in life, Marcus (Lionel Boyce) studied desserts in Copenhagen, and Tina (Liza Col\u00f3n-Zayas) went to culinary school. Their individual improvements came together for an incredible team effort -- but Carmy still has a lot to work on, including his new relationship with Claire (Molly Gordon).\n\nNow that The Bear may very well continue for two more seasons, you might be wondering what comes next. Will Carmy finally learn to let go and work on himself? Is a romance between Marcus and Sydney brewing? Could Coach K actually have a cameo? We'll find out this summer. But don't worry, things are already looking up. Edibiri will reportedly direct one of the new episodes, with the new back to back filming schedule forcing the actress to drop out of Marvel's Thunderbolts. In an interview with Deadline, White also said he's hoping for another episode full of zany guest stars, like the tense Christmas episode, \"Fishes.\" We're ready.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bear_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Bear (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FX_(TV_channel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FX (TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Allen_White", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Allen White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden Globe Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Storer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Storer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayo_Edebiri", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ayo Edebiri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebon_Moss-Bachrach", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ebon Moss-Bachrach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Comedy_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esquire_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Esquire (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Gordon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Molly Gordon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liza_Col\u00f3n-Zayas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liza Col\u00f3n-Zayas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odd_Future", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Odd Future"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_metropolitan_area", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago metropolitan area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonym", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pseudonym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/98.SA.kfJmdsAgeiOgHI0A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/esquire_269/1f6a3b67b46ebe86f4f971339721c619", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554201", "eventUri": "eng-9554201", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 402, "textEnd": 409}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Along with the release date announcement, White posted a new teaser on his Instagram account.\n\nIn the very brief teaser, we see a determined-looking Carmy (White) walk into the newly renovated kitchen of The Bear (formerly The Beef). After Carmy sets down his knife set and notebook, the camera closes in on his eyes, and then pans out to the restaurant's stylish dining room before showing the Chicago cityscape.\n\nSeason 2 of The Bear saw Carmy and the other characters going through some momentous changes. In season 1, Carmy took over The Beef, the sandwich shop formerly owned by his deceased brother Michael. But by season 2, Carmy, his sous-chef Sydney (Ayo Edeberi), and the cantankerous Richie (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) transformed The Beef into a more upscale restaurant, The Bear. In the season 2 finale, The Bear has its soft opening, with plenty of things going sideways.\n\nLast December, White spoke with Variety about what fans can expect in season 3. \"We all did a lot of preparation before the first season,\" White said. \"I went to culinary school and I spent a lot of time in restaurants. And then, for the second season, so much of it was about putting the restaurant together, so there wasn't that much cooking.

Star Jeremy Allen White posted the teaser on Instagram. In it, we see White's Carmy back in the kitchen, alone and intense. You can watch it below.\n\nWhen we last saw Carmy in the Season 2 finale, he was locked in a walk-in fridge during the restaurant's Friends and Family Night. The teaser confirms he escaped.\n\nAs we reported in March, multiple sources confirmed to Deadline that The Bear was quietly renewed for a fourth season to film back to back in Chicago. FX declined comment.\n\nThe Bear was created by Christopher Storer and also stars Ayo Edebiri, Lionel Boyce and Liza Col\u00f3n-Zayas. Matheson was upped for Season 2, while Edwin Lee Gibson, Corey Hendrix, Platt, Bernthal, Jos\u00e9 Cervantes, Richard Esteras, Carmen Christopher, Chris Witaske, Joel McHale, Curtis, Gillian Jacobs, Robert Townsend, Molly Gordon, Alex Moffat, Ricky Staffieri, Mitra Jouhari and Maura Kidwell recur.\n\nThe first season of The Bear won 10 Emmys, including for Outstanding Comedy and Outstanding Writing.

Landgraf also confirmed that, like the first two seasons, Hulu will drop all the episodes on one day as opposed to a week-to-week release.\n\nSeason 2 of the restaurant dramedy followed the kitchen crew as they transformed their family-owned sandwich shop into a fine dining spot. The cast is led by White, who stars alongside Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Ayo Edebiri, Lionel Boyce, Liza Col\u00f3n-Zayas, Abby Elliott and Matty Matheson.\n\nAt this year's strike-delayed Emmys, \"The Bear\" Season 1 -- which first streamed on Hulu in June 2022 -- walked away with 10 wins, including best comedy series, lead comedy actor for White, supporting comedy actor for Moss-Bachrach and supporting comedy actress for Edebiri. Season 2 has also picked up awards traction, winning for best comedy series at the Golden Globes, along with White and Edebiri earning wins in their respective acting categories. The series also took home the series prize at the Critics Choice Awards, with White, Edebiri and Moss-Bachrach also winning.\n\nSpeaking to Variety in December, White revealed how he was planning to prepare for Season 3: \"I do know in January I'm going to spend a fair amount of time getting together with some chefs. There'll be a menu set, I believe, that's going to be for the restaurant in the third season. And I know that I'm going to start putting together that menu with different chefs. We all did a lot of preparation before the first season. I went to culinary school and I spent a lot of time in restaurants. And then, for the second season, so much of it was about putting the restaurant together, so there wasn't that much cooking. But now, in the third season, I think we're going to go back to that functioning kitchen atmosphere that we had in the first.\"\n\nCreator Chris Storer executive produces \"The Bear\" alongside Joanna Calo, Hiro Murai of Super Frog, Josh Senior and Matheson.

It's now been revealed with the release of the new teaser that the third season officially premieres on June 27, 2024. The teaser showcases White's return as Carmy with the character alone in the kitchen in the middle of the night.

There are also rumors that the new season would be filmed back-to-back with Season 3, which would suggest that a wait for the fourth season would not be very long. The confidence held in the series is partly due to its very high praise, with Season 1 holding a perfect Rotten Tomatoes score while Season 2 is nearly perfect at 99%.\n\nSeason 3 Will Go Back to the Roots of The Bear\n\n\"We all did a lot of preparation before the first season,\" White told Variety about how Season 3 will be going back to the roots of the series. \"I went to culinary school and I spent a lot of time in restaurants. And then, for the second season, so much of it was about putting the restaurant together, so there wasn't that much cooking. But now, in the third season, I think we're going to go back to that functioning kitchen atmosphere that we had in the first.\"\n\nClose\n\nThe Bear Season 3 will debut all episodes on Hulu on June 27, 2024.\n\nSource: FX Networks\n\nThe Bear TV-MA DramaComedy Release Date June 23, 2022 Cast Jeremy Allen White , Ebon Moss-Bachrach , Ayo Edebiri , Liza Col\u00f3n-Zayas , Abby Elliott Main Genre Drama Seasons 2 Studio FX on Hulu Creator Christopher Storer Distributor Disney Platform Distribution Production Company FX Productions", "source": {"uri": "cbr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeremy_dick@cbr.com", "name": "Jeremy Dick", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bear_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Bear (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Allen_White", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Allen White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Iron_Claw_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Iron Claw (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matty_Matheson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matty Matheson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critics'_Choice_Television_Award_for_Best_Comedy_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Comedy Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebon_Moss-Bachrach", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ebon Moss-Bachrach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FX_(TV_channel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FX (TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayo_Edebiri", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ayo Edebiri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden Globe Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liza_Col\u00f3n-Zayas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liza Col\u00f3n-Zayas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiro_Murai", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hiro Murai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critics'_Choice_Movie_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Critics' Choice Movie Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abby_Elliott", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abby Elliott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odd_Future", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Odd Future"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographical_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biographical film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FX_Networks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FX Networks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Platform_Distribution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disney Platform Distribution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Storer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Storer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_If...?_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "What If...?

The first season was a frenetic, energy-fueled adrenaline ride where the ticking of the order tapes set us all on edge.\n\nTurning around the restaurant to start over is no small feat, and it required everyone to come together and get out of each other's way to do the job.\n\nSeason three of FX's The Bear follows Carmen \"Carmy\" Berzatto (White), Sydney Adamu (Ayo Edebiri), and Richard \"Richie\" Jerimovich (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) as they do what it takes to elevate The Bear, their beef stand turned fine dining establishment, to the highest level, all while doing their best just to stay in business.\n\nIt's a losing battle every single day in the restaurant business. Carmy pushes himself harder than ever and demands excellence from his crew, who do their best to match his intensity.\n\nTheir quest for culinary excellence will propel the crew to new levels and stress the bonds that hold the restaurant together. As the team grows in size, each member will strive to reach a greater level of service within their role.\n\nIn the restaurant industry, you're never on solid ground, and with that ever-changing landscape comes new challenges and opportunities.\n\nOur chefs have learned that every second counts, but this season, we'll find out if they have what it takes to make it to tomorrow.\n\nThe teaser suggests that they're ready to make their mark on Chicago, the city also playing a role in the teaser, reminding us of the stakes ahead.\n\nOpening a restaurant anywhere is taking a chance most cannot afford, and when you see the vastness of the city, it drives home how difficult it is to grab people's attention.\n\nTheir success or failure will be revealed on Thursday, June 27, when all episodes of the series drop.\n\nThat's not the release we'd choose, as the show has proven it can pack a lot of dense material demanding discussion in its short episodes.\n\nBut, that's the drop we're going to get, so we'll do what we can to cover it in as much detail as possible.\n\nMaybe we'll even find a recipe or two on Food Fanatic that we can share with our readers to make the experience more immersive.\n\nCarissa Pavlica is the managing editor and a staff writer and critic for TV Fanatic.

The announcement also comes with a new look at season three and an official teaser, though little is revealed in the clip's enigmatic 30 seconds.\n\nThere's more to be discerned in the new promo photo, which sees a suited-up Neil Fak (real-life chef Matty Matheson) staring at something of apparent keen interest to him and brother Ted Fak (Ricky Staffieri) and Carmen \"Carmy\" Berzatto (Jeremy Allen White).\n\nNews of \"The Bear\" premiere follows months of anticipation from fans and viewers.\n\nThe 10-time Emmy Award-winning comedy series began filming its upcoming season at the end of February, just about two months after being renewed -- and there's speculation that season four is simultaneously in the works, although FX and cast members haven't confirmed those rumors.\n\nChicagoans quickly discovered various filming locations after hot pink flyers started popping up around the city -- despite the show using a fake name, \"Kubelik\" -- and some applied to be extras after calls from a local casting agency garnered attention online.\n\nSeason three of \"The Bear\" picks up where the previous two left off, having followed Carmy (White) as he works to transform a Chicago Italian beef stand into a fine-dining establishment. The season two finale featured the new restaurant's long-awaited (and typically chaotic) opening as well as the dissolution of Carmy's relationship with girlfriend Claire (Mollie Gordon). Season one and season two aired in June 2022 and June 2023, respectively.\n\nThrough its 18-episode run, \"The Bear\" has spotlighted a variety of local eateries, including Publican Quality Meats, Lao Peng You, Pizza Lobo and Roeser's Bakery, who saw business skyrocket. A local enterprise even created a popular culinary tour based on the show.\n\nSeason three dives back into the life of Carmy and fellow restaurateurs Sydney Adamu (Ayo Edebiri) and Richard \"Richie\" Jerimovich (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) as they work to make their restaurant, The Bear, a reality.\n\nDespite its comedic label, Carmy, Sydney and Richie often find themselves in losing battles trying to not only create a successful restaurant, but simply stay afloat.\n\n\"Their quest for culinary excellence will propel the crew to new levels and stress the bonds that hold the restaurant together,\" FX shared in a press release Thursday. \"In the restaurant industry, you're never on solid ground, and with that ever-changing landscape comes new challenges and opportunities. Our chefs have learned that every second counts, but this season we'll find out if they have what it takes to make it to tomorrow.\"\n\nThe series also stars Abby Elliott, Lionel Boyce, Liza Col\u00f3n-Zayas and Matty Matheson, with Oliver Platt and Molly Gordon in recurring roles.\n\nAlongside its Emmy wins, \"The Bear\" swept awards season with three Golden Globes for its second season. It was received nominations and wins for Screen Actors Guild Awards, Peabody Awards, Critics Choice Awards, Writers Guild Awards, Directors Guild Awards, Producer Guild Awards, NAACP Image Awards, Independent Spirit Awards, MPSE Golden Reel Awards, CAS Awards, ACE Eddie Awards and TCA Awards, amongst others.\n\nUnder FX, \"The Bear\" was created by Christopher Storer, who executive produces the show alongside Josh Senior, Joanna Calo, Cooper Wehde, Tyson Bidner, Matty Matheson and Hiro Murai.

Jeremy Allen White's Chef Carmy Returns to the Kitchen in Season 3 Teaser", "body": "Stephanie Wenger is a TV Writer/Reporter at PEOPLE. She joined the brand in 2021 as a digital news writer, covering stories spanning across the site's verticals. She previously contributed E! Online, Hollywood Life and Oscar.com.\n\nChef Carmy is bringing the heat back to the kitchen.\n\nOn Thursday, May 8, Jeremy Allen White shared a teaser from The Bear's hotly anticipated third season, which is set to premiere June 27.\n\nIn the video, Carmy -- dressed in chef's whites -- returns to the restaurant's kitchen alone and unpacks his knives before looking directly into the camera. The clip then zooms out to the Chicago skyline.\n\nAs fans may recall, season 2 of the Emmy-winning series left off with Carmy locked in a walk-in fridge during the restaurant's Friends and Family Night, so the teaser seemingly confirms he escaped and is back in action.\n\nAccording to an official synopsis from FX, season 3 of The Bear will chronicle Carmy, Sydney Adamu (Ayo Edebiri) and Richard \"Richie\" Jerimovich (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) as \"they do what it takes to elevate The Bear, their beef stand turned fine dining establishment, to the highest level, all while doing their best just to stay in business.\"\n\n\"It's a losing battle every single day in the restaurant business,\" the description continues. \"Carmy pushes himself harder than ever, and demands excellence from his crew, who do their best to match his intensity.\"\n\n\"Their quest for culinary excellence will propel the crew to new levels and stress the bonds that hold the restaurant together,\" the description concludes. \"As the team grows in size, each member will strive to reach a greater level of service within their role. In the restaurant industry, you're never on solid ground, and with that ever-changing landscape comes new challenges and opportunities. Our chefs have learned that every second counts, but this season we'll find out if they have what it takes to make it to tomorrow.\"\n\nDeadline reported in March that the cast will film a subsequent fourth season back-to-back with the third. Production began in Chicago in February, and the third season is set to debut on FX and Hulu in June.\n\nIn December, White, 33, revealed that shooting would begin in February during an interview on the Today show, as he said, \"I'm going to get together with some chefs in January and start prepping in the kitchen again, sharpening up the skills.\"\n\nIt's a practice he's done before. He told Gold Derby in June that he \"spent a lot of time as a fly on the wall\" at a French restaurant in Santa Monica prior to the show's first season in order to gain some real-life experience in the kitchen.\n\n\"I'd help them prep where you can't really screw up anything too badly,\" he told the outlet, before sharing that on one particularly \"busy night,\" the restaurant's chef told him to \"start cooking\" and he was \"so, so scared.\"\n\nThe experience shaped how he sees restaurants now, he said. \"I just started looking at restaurants as little miracles. It's such a difficult and competitive world to enter.\"\n\nWhite's costars got in some prep work, too. Courtney Storer, the show's culinary producer, told PEOPLE that Ayo Edebiri, who plays aspiring chef Sydney, came to visit her in L.A. before shooting began on season 1 to learn a thing or two.\n\n\"She really got to see how I move, how I navigate in a space, how I prep things, how I prioritize. I talked a lot to her about confidence, carrying my shoulders, how I move, to kind of get respect or have this position of leadership,\" Storer said of Edebiri's time in the kitchen with her.\n\n\"I think I was always really tiny in a space, and I could feel really small and I had to find ways to use my voice to get attention,\" she added. \"So we spent a lot of time on that.\"", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bear_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Bear (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Life", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood Life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Allen_White", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Allen White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FX_(TV_channel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FX (TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E!", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "E!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayo_Edebiri", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ayo Edebiri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_dining", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fine dining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebon_Moss-Bachrach", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ebon Moss-Bachrach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_If...?_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "What If...?

The clip opens with Carmy flicking the lights on in The Bear and laying out his knife roll as the camera zooms in tighter on his face. The chef is staring straight ahead when the shot zeros in on his eyes, flips outward, and quickly zooms out -- zipping from the back of his head, through the restaurant, and over the city of Chicago.\n\nThe Bear was renewed for its third season in November 2023, five months after the premiere of its electifying second season. And while the Golden Globe-winning cast -- which also consists of Ayo Edebiri and Ebon Moss-Bachrach -- was in the process of completing season three in March, the series was renewed for its fourth season which will film directly after the upcoming season.\n\nIn February, FX chairman John Landgraf told Variety that the network will be sticking with its binge approach to releasing The Bear, releasing each episode in the season at once rather than pivoting to a week-to-week schedule. \"It wasn't lost on me or anyone who worked on the show that it was anxiety-inducing,\" he said. \"So we made a decision to drop the whole thing because it has a beautiful, uplifting ending.\"\n\nAt the time, White didn't have much to reveal in regards to the season three script, but shared some insight into his preparation process.\n\n\"I do know in January I'm going to spend a fair amount of time getting together with some chefs. There'll be a menu set, I believe, that's going to be for the restaurant in the third season.

After a gut renovation that included some wild inspection, so many permits, and some long drives to make sure paperwork gets in on time, our favorite chefs have their dream place up and running. But will it last? While we'd love to get a third course served, there's always a chance that it doesn't pass on minute inspection and has to shut down for good. So is this the end of our new favorite dinner spot?\n\nHere's everything we know about The Bear season 3.\n\nFX announced that The Bear season 3 will be happening on November 6, 2023. After weeks of speculation, fans can now breathe easily as they wait for their favorite chefs to come back to the kitchen! In their press release announcing its return, FX noted that the show will return in 2024, despite the delay due to the SAG-AFTRA strike. It's also set to be released on Hulu like its previous seasons, although Disney is now set to own all of Hulu after buying out Comcast.\n\nEven though we had to wait until FX and Hulu made their decisions, we definitely took all the Will Poulter fancams as a good sign.\n\nAnd then there were also the 2023 Emmy Award nominations which confirmed The Bear as a heavy competition hitter, even over a year after season 1's release. Season 2 won't be eligible until the 2024 competition, but it all just proves that everyone is hungry for The Bear even after its release.\n\nAnd to add to the show's long list of accomplishments, it just won a ton of trophies at the 2024 Golden Globes. Jeremy Allen White and Ayo Edebiri both won for Best Actor and Actress in a Comedy, respectively. And the show overall won for Best Comedy Series. Yes, it is categorized as a comedy for awards season. Feel free to take your arguments to X.\n\nNot yet, but Carmy himself basically confirmed that filming will be underway in the new year. At the LA premiere of The Iron Claw, Jeremy Allen White confirmed that he's preparing for the upcoming season of the FX series.\n\n\"I haven't read scripts yet, that's the truth,\" he told Entertainment Tonight. \"But, yeah, we will be going back [into production] in, like, late February, early March. I'm gonna get together with some chefs starting in January and start doing some prep.\"\n\nThe cast are set to begin filming later in February, according to Screen Magazine.\n\nActual footage of me realizing that our faves at The Bear will be reunited oh-so soon:\n\nThe show's second season ends on Friends & Family night, so the restaurant technically isn't officially open to the public yet. However, there's no doubt that more will come to light, especially with Carmy and Sugar's mom. Also, there's the fact that they still gotta pay Uncle Jimmy all his money back so business better get booming soon, or else they'll be in trouble.\n\nDespite the fact that it hasn't even started filming yet, FX is also setting us up for a hot Chicago summer thanks to a reveal the 2024 Television Critics Association Press Tour that the series will be back in June, according to Variety. And despite the mix reaction to dropping it all at once last season, the show has no plans to change its current release plan.\n\n\"It wasn't lost on me or anyone who worked on the show that it was anxiety-inducing,\" FX chairman John Landgraf said. \"So we made a decision to drop the whole thing because it has a beautiful, uplifting ending.\"\n\nAnd now the official date has been announced! The series will officially be back on June 27th, according to a new teaser that FX released on their socials. We see Carmy back in The Bear restaurant and it looks like things are tense in the new kitchen.\n\nLuckily for us, we won't have to wait weekly as all the episodes will drop all at once.

This is a quick turnaround for a show that just started filming in February, but this show is pretty notorious for being able to get episodes together in a pretty darn short period of time.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to Matt & Jess on YouTube for more THE BEAR videos!\n\nSo what lies ahead in the new episodes? Well, we know that Carmy managed to make his restaurant dreams into a reality thanks to the help of Sydney and others. However, much of his life blew up on Friends & Family Night, he accidentally told the truth to Claire while locked inside a freezer, and then after that blew up on Cousin. He has to find a way to repair some of these relationships and keep the restaurant afloat -- and yet, there are also some questions about his own psyche. Can Carmy actually find a way to be happy? That's not something he really knows how to do. Sure, he may be extremely accomplished as a chef but at the same exact time, that does not mean that he finds personal fulfillment in what he does.\n\nIn a way, it seems to be a deliberate strategy to almost treat the show as a multi-course meal, one that you could potentially even enjoy in a few extended settings.\n\nRelated - Be sure to get some more news on The Bear right now, including the reports of a season 4!\n\nAre you just glad to see Carmy out of the freezer?

The hit FX and Hulu series that's dominated award season since it premiered in 2022 (it's so far won 10 Emmys and counting, plus dozens of other accolades) is back for a third peek into the kitchen of a chaotic Chicago restaurant.\n\nNew episodes of the series are set to premiere on Hulu on Thursday, June 27, 2024, close to a year exactly after the show's sophomore season dropped. Despite plenty of fans insisting that the series would be better as a weekly release, the new season is poised to continue its tradition of a single-batch drop, and all 10 episodes will be available that Thursday.\n\nThe last season of \"The Bear\" ended with depressed, highly decorated chef Carmy (Jeremy Allen White), his intrepid sous-chef turned partner Sydney (Ayo Edebiri), hotheaded cousin Richie (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), and the rest of the team behind sandwich joint The Beef poised to successfully open their high-end restaurant. While we didn't actually get to see what The Bear's opening looked like, the finale showed that a pre-opening \"family and friends night\" managed to succeed despite a series of problems including Carmy getting stuck in the walk-in freezer, a line cook disappearing mid-shift, the appearance of Carmy's unstable mother (Jamie Lee Curtis), and a fork shortage.\n\nThe second season of the hit series subtly transformed the show from a close-up of a high-octane train wreck to a look at something more introspective and, through its dysfunctional characters' rigorous study, hard work, and attempts at healing their psychic wounds, even competent. Like most FX teasers, the first promo for season 3 doesn't actually include any footage hinting at what's next, but it does feature a stylized look at what's going on inside Carmy's mind.", "source": {"uri": "slashfilm.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slashfilm"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bear_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Bear (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FX_(TV_channel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FX (TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beef (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayo_Edebiri", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ayo Edebiri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sous-chef", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sous-chef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebon_Moss-Bachrach", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ebon Moss-Bachrach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Allen_White", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Allen White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Lee_Curtis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Lee Curtis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/yes-chef-the-bear-season-3-teaser-promises-even-more-stress/l-intro-1715277504.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554201", "eventUri": "eng-9554201", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

The fact that The Bear -- Christopher Storer's supremely chaotic, incredibly moving comedy-drama, which delivered two of the best episodes of television in recent memory (the Christmas flashback \"Fishes\" and the Richie-centric \"Forks\") back-to-back last season -- will be returning for a third installment. Still, we're relieved to know that Carmy will eventually make it out of that walk-in fridge that he became trapped in as his new restaurant soft opened, and, presumably, be forced to deal with the consequences of his actions.\n\nThe confirmation came from the show's network, FX/Hulu, on November 6, 2023. Then, in March 2024, it was reported that a fourth season was also in the works, and being filmed back-to-back with Season 3. It's safe to assume that the main cast -- Jeremy Allen White, Ayo Edebiri, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Abby Elliott, Lionel Boyce, Liza Col\u00f3n-Zayas, and Matty Matheson -- will all be back for both, as The Bear opens to the public, raising yet more questions about kitchen power dynamics, profit sharing, and whether or not Carmy and Sydney will ever actually get together or if they are in fact, as the show's cast and creators keep telling us, just friends. We hear you, writers, but that scene between the pair under the table in the ninth episode, \"Omelette,\" had more sexual tension than any other in the show's entire run. Just sayin'.\n\nI also have other questions: once Carmy emerges from the walk-in, will he continue to spiral and begin working even more obsessively than he has in the past? Or, did his blowout with Richie help him see the error of his ways? Will Carm reconcile with Claire and, more importantly, will Claire (as played by the wonderful Molly Gordon) finally be given the space to be a fully realised character beyond simply serving as an idealized love interest? And what about Richie's future as the now meticulous and sharply dressed front of house manager; Syd's as the restaurant's rising culinary star; and Natalie's as its project manager, especially as she prepares to give birth? Oh, and after her heartbreaking cameo in the Season 2 finale, will we see more of the force of nature that is Jamie Lee Curtis's Donna Berzatto? I certainly hope so -- though I'm not sure her kids could handle that.\n\nOn May 9, a first teaser arrived -- and while it offers no answers, the sight of Carm getting down to work is certainly tantalizing. It also revealed the release date: June 27.

In my defense, I really needed a break after finishing the intense \"Fishes,\" episode and I ended up getting busy. However, Jeremy Allen White's announcement of The Bear Season 3's release date has prompted a bunch of inspired comments on social media, and I've realized I need to fix this mistake at once.\n\nThe 2024 TV schedule looks like it's going to get hotter, as we now know dinner services will resume at FX's restaurant as of June 27th. So anyone else who's lagged behind, or hasn't even started on their journey with The Bear has plenty of time. And with that, feel free to let 'er rip with this short but sweet video tease:\n\nNow seeing as I'm not caught up on one of Hulu's best shows, my first thought after watching this trailer is that my wallet is already hurting just imagining a dinner service in a place like this. Not that it wouldn't be worth it, but let's face it: fine dining has its costs.\n\nThat being said, I know all about Carmy's incident with the freezer and how the season ends. And honestly, I'm surprised Jeremy Allen White wasn't shown melting that freezer door down with pure heat blasts of anger.\n\nYou can be sure that Sydney, Richie, and the rest of The Bear's characters are probably going to have some choice comments when the action picks up. I see so many ice puns in the future. Meanwhile, you die-hard fans out there started saying things like this, and the comedy warms my heart:\n\nYes friends, (and chefs) Carmy looks like he's gotten out of the freezer. So who knows what the fallout will look like when he's warmed up for whatever Season 3 brings his way? It certainly looks fantastic, as The Bear is finally ready to roar once more for all to hear, and taste. Trust me, it makes sense.\n\nWhile the restaurant at the heart of The Bear looks like it requires business casual attire, at least, the dress code is much more forgiving when watching the actual series. All you'll need is the right amount of time on your schedule, and access to a Hulu subscription.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I have a hit streaming drama to finish, before my career as an entertainment journalist is the next thing locked in the walk-in.

The camera continues to zoom out, revealing Chicago's beautifully lit skyline.\n\nNo TV show loves a Chicago architecture beauty shot more than \"The Bear.\" (Well, except for one.)\n\nIt was previously announced that the new season will drop all its episodes at once on Hulu.\n\nThe show is returning after a critically lauded second season that saw the crew working to transform the beloved but shabby beef stand into a fine dining restaurant. In doing so, the show expanded its Midwest setting with an episode set in Copenhagen. Another pivotal episode proved a family Christmas Eve dinner could be even more stressful than a short-staffed and cramped restaurant kitchen.\n\nWhile the show focuses on the interpersonal drama of a restaurant's staff, Chicago's culinary scene also gets a starring role.\n\nThe show frequently features real restaurants, ranging from small-plate stalwart Avec to the now even more jam-packed Kasama.\n\nWe'll have to wait until the end of June to see which local spots get their moment in the sun. Still, it's a quick turnaround from Chicago to Hulu screens, as the show reportedly started filming just a few months ago in March.", "source": {"uri": "news.wttw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WTTW News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bear_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Bear (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Allen_White", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Allen White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FX_(TV_channel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FX (TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_dining", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fine dining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_beef", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italian beef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Eve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christmas Eve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Dining_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Dining Guides", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events_and_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events and Shows", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://news.wttw.com/sites/default/files/field/image/The_Bear_Teaser_CreditFC.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554201", "eventUri": "eng-9554201", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 136, "textEnd": 143}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

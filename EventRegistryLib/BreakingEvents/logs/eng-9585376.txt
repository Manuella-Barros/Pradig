Boudreaux and State Assembly member Vince Fong, both Republicans, are vying for the vacant 20th Congressional District seat in the state's Central Valley farm belt. That's the seat formerly held by Kevin McCarthy.\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- Vince Fong, a California State Assembly member backed by former President Donald Trump, won a special election Tuesday to complete the remainder of the term of deposed former U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, which runs through January.\n\nA McCarthy protege who also had the former speaker's endorsement, Fong defeated fellow Republican and Tulare County Sheriff Mike Boudreaux in the 20th Congressional District, in the state's Central Valley farm belt.\n\nBecause of Trump's involvement, the race will be watched as a possible proxy vote on the former president's clout as he heads toward an all-but-certain matchup against President Joe Biden in November.\n\n\"With the campaign over, the real work now begins,\" Fong said in a statement, adding that he will focus on border security, supporting small business and investing in water storage critical to the region's agriculture.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear when Fong will be sworn in -- that decision falls to current House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\nTurnout appeared to be light for the unusual May election, for which mail-in voting began last month.\n\nTrump endorsed Fong in February, calling him \"a true Republican.\" Boudreaux's supporters include Richard Grenell, a former acting director of national intelligence in the Trump administration, and Republican state Sen. Shannon Grove of Bakersfield, Fong's home turf.\n\nRepublicans occupy only 11 of the state's 52 U.S. House seats. With the district once held by McCarthy remaining in GOP hands, it will give Republicans 12 seats in the state delegation and boost the party's fragile edge in Congress by a single vote.\n\nThere are 217 Republicans in the House, 213 Democrats and five vacancies, including McCarthy's former seat.\n\nThe special election only covers the time remaining in McCarthy's term. Fong and Boudreaux will reprise their contest again in November for a full two-year term in the district, though the winner of the special election will gain the advantage of incumbency.\n\nIn a statement Boudreaux said he congratulated Fong in a phone call, thanked volunteers and donors for their support and signaled that he already was gearing up for November.\n\n\"California faces a crime crisis unlike any other in its history. That's why I will be stepping up the fight for a safer Valley and safer California,\" Boudreaux said.\n\nSome voters might be confused, since Fong and Boudreaux already have appeared on two House ballots this year -- the March 5 statewide primary for the full House term, and the March 19 primary in the special election to fill out McCarthy's term.\n\nThe two conservative Republicans and Trump supporters occupy much of the same policy terrain. Boudreaux has spotlighted his decades of law-and-order experience and promised to harden the nation's porous border. Fong also promised to \"end the chaos\" at the border with Mexico while prioritizing water and energy needs in the farm belt.\n\nFong, a onetime McCarthy aide, entered the contest with advantages beyond the endorsements from Trump and McCarthy.\n\nHe carried 42% of the vote in the March primary, with Boudreaux getting nearly 26% and the remainder divided among other candidates. Fong hails from the most populous part of the district, Kern County, and he outraised the sheriff by about 3 to 1 in campaign funds, according to federal records through the end of March.\n\nMcCarthy's dramatic fall in the House -- he is the only speaker in history to be voted out of the job -- left behind a messy race to succeed him that exposed rivalries within his own party. He has worked behind the scenes to promote Fong's candidacy -- a political action committee linked to McCarthy steered over $700,000 into the 20th District contest to boost Fong's campaign.\n\nMcCarthy resigned last year after being ousted as speaker.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Boudreaux and State Assembly member Vince Fong, both Republicans, are vying for the vacant 20th Congressional District seat in the state's Central Valley farm belt. That's the seat formerly held by Kevin McCarthy.\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- Vince Fong, a California State Assembly member backed by former President Donald Trump, won a special election Tuesday to complete the remainder of the term of deposed former U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, which runs through January.\n\nA McCarthy protege who also had the former speaker's endorsement, Fong defeated fellow Republican and Tulare County Sheriff Mike Boudreaux in the 20th Congressional District, in the state's Central Valley farm belt.\n\nBecause of Trump's involvement, the race will be watched as a possible proxy vote on the former president's clout as he heads toward an all-but-certain matchup against President Joe Biden in November.\n\n\"With the campaign over, the real work now begins,\" Fong said in a statement, adding that he will focus on border security, supporting small business and investing in water storage critical to the region's agriculture.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear when Fong will be sworn in -- that decision falls to current House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\nTurnout appeared to be light for the unusual May election, for which mail-in voting began last month.\n\nTrump endorsed Fong in February, calling him \"a true Republican.\" Boudreaux's supporters include Richard Grenell, a former acting director of national intelligence in the Trump administration, and Republican state Sen. Shannon Grove of Bakersfield, Fong's home turf.\n\nRepublicans occupy only 11 of the state's 52 U.S. House seats. With the district once held by McCarthy remaining in GOP hands, it will give Republicans 12 seats in the state delegation and boost the party's fragile edge in Congress by a single vote.\n\nThere are 217 Republicans in the House, 213 Democrats and five vacancies, including McCarthy's former seat.\n\nThe special election only covers the time remaining in McCarthy's term. Fong and Boudreaux will reprise their contest again in November for a full two-year term in the district, though the winner of the special election will gain the advantage of incumbency.\n\nSome voters might be confused, since Fong and Boudreaux already have appeared on two House ballots this year -- the March 5 statewide primary for the full House term, and the March 19 primary in the special election to fill out McCarthy's term.\n\nThe two conservative Republicans and Trump supporters occupy much of the same policy terrain. Boudreaux has been spotlighting his decades of law-and-order experience and is promising to harden the nation's porous border. Fong also promises to \"end the chaos\" at the border with Mexico while prioritizing water and energy needs in the farm belt.\n\nFong, a onetime McCarthy aide who also has the former speaker's endorsement, entered the contest with advantages beyond endorsements from Trump and McCarthy.\n\nFong carried 42% of the vote in the March primary, Boudreaux got nearly 26% and the remainder was divided among other candidates. Fong hails from the most populous part of the district, Kern County, and he outraised the sheriff by about 3-to-1 in campaign funds, according to federal records through the end of March.\n\nMcCarthy's dramatic fall in the House -- he is the only speaker in history to be voted out of the job -- left behind a messy race to succeed him that exposed rivalries within his own party. He has worked behind the scenes to promote Fong's candidacy -- a political action committee linked to McCarthy steered over $700,000 into the 20th District contest to boost Fong's campaign.\n\nMcCarthy resigned last year after being ousted in the House.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_r_blood@eagletribune.com", "name": "Michael R.

Boudreaux and State Assembly member Vince Fong, both Republicans, are vying for the vacant 20th Congressional District seat in the state's Central Valley farm belt. That's the seat formerly held by Kevin McCarthy. (Ron Holman/The Times-Delta via AP, File)LOS ANGELES (AP) - State Assembly member Vince Fong, a California legislator backed by former President Donald Trump, has captured a special election to complete the remainder of the term of deposed former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, which runs through January. Fong - a McCarthy protege who also had the former speaker's endorsement - defeated fellow Republican and Tulare County Sheriff Mike Boudreaux on Tuesday in the 20th Congressional District in the state's Central Valley farm belt. Because of Trump's involvement, the race will be watched as a possible proxy vote on the former president's clout as he heads toward an all-but-certain matchup against President Joe Biden in November. Trump endorsed Fong in February, calling him \"a true Republican.\"\u009d Boudreaux's supporters include Richard Grenell, a former acting director of national intelligence in the Trump administration, and Republican state Sen. Shannon Grove of Bakersfield, Fong's home turf. Republicans occupy only 11 of the state's 52 U.S. House seats. With the district once held by McCarthy remaining in GOP hands, it will give Republicans 12 seats in the state delegation and boost the party's fragile edge in Congress by a single vote. There are 217 Republicans in the House, 213 Democrats and five vacancies, including McCarthy's former seat. The special election only covers the time remaining in McCarthy's term. Fong and Boudreaux will reprise their contest again in November for a full, two-year term in the district, though the winner of the special election will gain the advantage of incumbency. A light turnout is expected. Mail-in voting for the special election began last month. Some voters might be confused, since Fong and Boudreaux already have appeared on two House ballots this year - the March 5 statewide primary for the full House term, and the March 19 primary in the special election to fill out McCarthy's term. The two conservative Republicans and Trump supporters occupy much of the same policy terrain. Boudreaux has been spotlighting his decades of law-and-order experience and is promising to harden the nation's porous border. Fong also promises to \"end the chaos\"\u009d at the border with Mexico while prioritizing water and energy needs in the farm belt. Fong, a onetime McCarthy aide who also has the former speaker's endorsement, entered the contest with advantages beyond endorsements from Trump and McCarthy. Fong carried 42% of the vote in the March primary election, Boudreaux nearly 26%, with the remainder divided among other candidates. Fong hails from the most populous part of the district, Kern County, and he has outraised the sheriff by about 3-to-1 in campaign funds, according to federal records through the end of March. McCarthy's dramatic fall in the House - he is the only speaker in history to be voted out of the job - left behind a messy race to succeed him that exposed rivalries within his own party. He has worked behind the scenes to promote Fong's candidacy - a political action committee linked to McCarthy steered over $700,000 into the 20th District contest to boost Fong's campaign. McCarthy resigned last year after being ousted in the House.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

BLOOD - AP Political Writer\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- A California legislator backed by former President Donald Trump and a county sheriff promising to fight for tougher border security are matched in a special election Tuesday to decide who will complete the remainder of the term of deposed former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, which runs through January.\n\nState Assembly member Vince Fong and Tulare County Sheriff Mike Boudreaux, both Republicans, are vying for the vacant 20th Congressional District seat in the state's Central Valley farm belt. The district, which cuts through parts of Bakersfield and Fresno, is the most strongly Republican House seat in heavily Democratic California.\n\nBecause of Trump's involvement, the race will be watched as a possible proxy vote on the former president's clout as he heads toward an all-but-certain matchup against President Joe Biden in November.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Shannon Grove of Bakersfield, Fong's home turf.\n\nRepublicans occupy only 11 of the state's 52 U.S. House seats. With the district once held by McCarthy remaining in GOP hands, it will give Republicans 12 seats in the state delegation and boost the party's fragile edge in Congress by a single vote.\n\nThere are 217 Republicans in the House, 213 Democrats and five vacancies, including McCarthy's former seat.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe special election only covers the time remaining in McCarthy's term. Fong and Boudreaux will reprise their contest again in November for a full, two-year term in the district, though the winner of the special election will gain the advantage of incumbency.\n\nA light turnout is expected. Mail-in voting for the special election began last month.\n\nSome voters might be confused, since Fong and Boudreaux already have appeared on two House ballots this year -- the March 5 statewide primary for the full House term, and the March 19 primary in the special election to fill out McCarthy's term.\n\nThe two conservative Republicans and Trump supporters occupy much of the same policy terrain. Boudreaux has been spotlighting his decades of law-and-order experience and is promising to harden the nation's porous border. Fong also promises to \"end the chaos\" at the border with Mexico while prioritizing water and energy needs in the farm belt.\n\nFong, a onetime McCarthy aide who also has the former speaker's endorsement, entered the contest with advantages beyond endorsements from Trump and McCarthy.\n\nFong carried 42% of the vote in the March primary election, Boudreaux nearly 26%, with the remainder divided among other candidates. Fong hails from the most populous part of the district, Kern County, and he has outraised the sheriff by about 3-to-1 in campaign funds, according to federal records through the end of March.\n\nMcCarthy's dramatic fall in the House -- he is the only speaker in history to be voted out of the job -- left behind a messy race to succeed him that exposed rivalries within his own party. He has worked behind the scenes to promote Fong's candidacy -- a political action committee linked to McCarthy steered over $700,000 into the 20th District contest to boost Fong's campaign.\n\nMcCarthy resigned last year after being ousted in the House.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield) in Congress, San Joaquin Valley voters on Tuesday chose Republican Assemblymember Vince Fong, a state lawmaker who was endorsed by President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Associated Press called California's 20th Congressional District race for Fong at 8:17 p.m. Fong bested fellow Republican Mike Boudreaux, the Tulare County Sheriff.\n\nMcCarthy resigned from Congress at the end of 2023 after being voted out as House speaker. Fong will complete McCarthy's term, which ends in January, representing a vast agricultural district that stretches through Kern, Tulare, Kings and Fresno counties.\n\nIn a prepared statement, Fong said that he was \"filled with humility and gratitude\" at the early results.\n\n\"With the campaign over, the real work now begins,\" Fong said. \"In Congress, I will remain focused on solving the tough issues facing our community -- securing the border, supporting small business, bringing investment in water storage and infrastructure, unleashing our energy industry, and keeping the United States safe amidst the grave security threats facing our nation.\"\n\nFong, 44, began his career working for McCarthy's predecessor, then-Rep. Bill Thomas, then worked for nearly a decade as McCarthy's district director before winning a seat in the Assembly in 2016.\n\nBoudreaux, 57, has been the sheriff of Tulare County for more than a decade and serves as the head of the California State Sheriffs' Assn.\n\nBoudreaux said in a prepared statement that he called to congratulate Fong Tuesday night. He added that he was \"absolutely humbled by the outpouring of support from family, friends, and neighbors across Fresno, Tulare, Kings, and Kern counties who stepped up to volunteer their time and energy to our campaign and donated generously to spread our message for a better Valley.\"\n\nFong and Boudreaux will meet again in November, when voters will choose a representative for a full two-year term in Congress. Being the incumbent will give Fong a significant advantage.\n\nAlthough McCarthy was not on the ballot, the former House speaker had a hand in boosting Fong, using his political influence and fundraising prowess to help his handpicked successor.\n\nFong placed first in the March primary for the full two-year term and the remainder of McCarthy's term, and raised more than three times as much money as Boudreaux.\n\nFong also had support from a political action committee called Central Valley Values, which reported raising $950,000 from McCarthy's Majority Committee PAC and a new PAC funded by major Republican donors, including longtime McCarthy ally Barbara Grimm-Marshall of Bakersfield's Grimmway Farms, the world's largest carrot grower.\n\nFong was also boosted by the endorsement from Trump in March, widely seen as orchestrated by McCarthy. The endorsement was a coup for Fong, who has largely avoided the culture wars that dominate factions of the GOP and sought to win over right-wing Republicans skeptical of the political establishment.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McCarthy_(actor)", "type":

Boudreaux thinks his campaign represents accountability based on his status as a lawman.\n\n\"I represent the 'Law and Order' safety candidate,\" Boudreaux said. \"So if you want a safer district, then Mike Boudreaux is your vote.\"\n\nFong has the so-called 'Big 2' endorsements. Those are the seat's former officeholder, Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy and former President Donald Trump. While Fong has the 'Big 2', Boudreaux has the 'Local 2' endorsements. Those are Kern County Sheriff Donny Youngblood and Central Valley State Senator Shannon Grove (R-12). In addition, Fong posts endorsements from other California congress members in D.C. Boudreaux's other notable endorsements come from numerous law enforcement agency staffing associations.\n\nThe big question is ultimately turnout. The majority of the voters in the district are in Kern County but voters in Fresno, Kings, and Tulare Counties helped propel Boudreaux into the runoff. Unlike Boudreaux, Fong's current office has overlaps with other counties. Boudreaux only represents Tulare County as their sheriff but nearly beat Fong in Fresno and did win Kings. Fong defeated Boudreaux by a wide margin in Kern County.\n\n8 p.m. on Tuesday, May 21 is the deadline for votes to be cast.

BLOOD - AP Political Writer\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- State Assembly member Vince Fong, a California legislator backed by former President Donald Trump, has captured a special election to complete the remainder of the term of deposed former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, which runs through January.\n\nFong -- a McCarthy protege who also had the former speaker's endorsement -- defeated fellow Republican and Tulare County Sheriff Mike Boudreaux on Tuesday in the 20th Congressional District in the state's Central Valley farm belt.\n\nBecause of Trump's involvement, the race will be watched as a possible proxy vote on the former president's clout as he heads toward an all-but-certain matchup against President Joe Biden in November.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Shannon Grove of Bakersfield, Fong's home turf.\n\nRepublicans occupy only 11 of the state's 52 U.S. House seats. With the district once held by McCarthy remaining in GOP hands, it will give Republicans 12 seats in the state delegation and boost the party's fragile edge in Congress by a single vote.\n\nThere are 217 Republicans in the House, 213 Democrats and five vacancies, including McCarthy's former seat.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe special election only covers the time remaining in McCarthy's term. Fong and Boudreaux will reprise their contest again in November for a full, two-year term in the district, though the winner of the special election will gain the advantage of incumbency.\n\nA light turnout is expected. Mail-in voting for the special election began last month.\n\nSome voters might be confused, since Fong and Boudreaux already have appeared on two House ballots this year -- the March 5 statewide primary for the full House term, and the March 19 primary in the special election to fill out McCarthy's term.\n\nThe two conservative Republicans and Trump supporters occupy much of the same policy terrain. Boudreaux has been spotlighting his decades of law-and-order experience and is promising to harden the nation's porous border. Fong also promises to \"end the chaos\" at the border with Mexico while prioritizing water and energy needs in the farm belt.\n\nFong, a onetime McCarthy aide who also has the former speaker's endorsement, entered the contest with advantages beyond endorsements from Trump and McCarthy.\n\nFong carried 42% of the vote in the March primary election, Boudreaux nearly 26%, with the remainder divided among other candidates. Fong hails from the most populous part of the district, Kern County, and he has outraised the sheriff by about 3-to-1 in campaign funds, according to federal records through the end of March.\n\nMcCarthy's dramatic fall in the House -- he is the only speaker in history to be voted out of the job -- left behind a messy race to succeed him that exposed rivalries within his own party. He has worked behind the scenes to promote Fong's candidacy -- a political action committee linked to McCarthy steered over $700,000 into the 20th District contest to boost Fong's campaign.\n\nMcCarthy resigned last year after being ousted in the House.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Matt Gaetz, who prompted the movement to oust McCarthy.\n\nKevin McCarthy-backed Vince Fong has beat out a Republican challenger to take the former speaker's congressional seat\n\nFong, 44, served as McCarthy's district director for more than a decade.\n\nMcCarthy had taken the seat in 2007 after the retirement of his former boss, Rep. Bill Thomas, then chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee. Fong worked for Thomas alongside McCarthy for a time.\n\nThe full force of McCarthy's campaign dollars, fundraisers, consultants and affiliated PACs made the race against local sheriff Mike Boudreaux not particularly close.\n\nFong also won former President Donald Trump's endorsement, with McCarthy's help, in a district where 47 percent of registered voters are Republicans and 27 percent are Democrats.\n\nBoudreaux acknowledged the forces working against him ahead of the election.\n\n'I am the underdog,' Boudreaux told a crowd of supporters. 'I am pushing back against a machine that is so powerful that it's very challenging, to say the least.'\n\nMike Boudreaux, Tulare County sheriff, lost to Fong\n\nRead MoreEXCLUSIVE How Trump ally Jim Jordan could be secretively plotting to take Speaker Mike Johnson's top job\n\n'The McCarthy machine is huge,' Boudreaux said, adding it is 'daunting, to say the least,' to run against it.\n\nThe two candidates had highly similar policy platforms: securing the border, cutting taxes and working on water improvement and energy production for the region.\n\nFong nearly tripled Boudreaux's fundraising numbers by May 1: $1.5 million to $425,000.\n\nMcCarthy's backing proved to be a win for establishment-type Republicans over burn-it-all down types like Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, who prompted the movement to oust McCarthy.\n\nBoudreaux, though not as hard right as some already in the House GOP conference, was up against the Bakersfield political machine that has propelled longtime political operators to Congress in Fong and McCarthy and ex-Rep. Bill Thomas before them.\n\nJust between a McCarthy-linked PAC and Nevada-based Conservatives for American Excellence, a pro-Fong PAC collected nearly a million dollars ahead of the race. Conservatives for American Excellence seeks to boost mainstream Republicans to counter the anti-establishment Club for Growth and the far-right Freedom Caucus.\n\nThe top two vote getters, regardless of party, advance to a runoff if none get a plurality of votes under California's system. Fong and Boudreaux were the top two vote getters in a March special election.\n\nFong will face off against Boudreaux again in the November race for the full term.", "source": {"uri":

Kevin McCarthy's term after defeating Tulare County Sheriff Mike Boudreaux in Tuesday's runoff election for California's 20th Congressional District.\n\nFong, R-Bakersfield, will serve in his former boss' seat for about seven months -- and potentially longer, depending on the outcome of November's election.\n\nThe Associated Press called the race for Fong at 8:17 p.m. Pacific time on Tuesday. He had 60.5% of the votes with an estimated 83% of them counted, per the AP. Boudreaux, also a Republican, had 39.5% of the votes.\n\nFong was McCarthy's chosen successor in the area that has been represented by powerful GOP congressmen for more than four decades.\n\nMcCarthy left Congress in December two months after his ouster as Speaker of the House. Speaker was a role he long coveted and held for nine months.\n\nMcCarthy won the seat in 2006 ahead of the retirement of his former boss, retiring Rep. Bill Thomas, then chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, which writes legislation on tax policy, trade, Social Security and other big issues. Thomas had endorsed McCarthy.\n\nFong worked for both. He served as McCarthy's district director for almost a decade and began his political career as an aide to Thomas, who was first elected to Congress in 1978.\n\nIn Sacramento, Fong has represented the area that's now the 32nd Assembly District since 2016 and is the top Republican on the powerful budget committee. He'll resign his seat to serve in Congress.\n\nBoudreaux, 57, has been Tulare County Sheriff for over a decade, having started in law enforcement there as a cadet when he was 19. He is currently president of the California State Sheriffs' Association.\n\nThe two Republicans are expected to face each other again in the Nov. 5 general election for a two-year term to begin in January 2025.\n\nTonight's result was expected. Fong had the support of McCarthy allies and his home base is in Kern County, where most of the voters in California's 20th live.\n\nCalifornia's 20th is the state's most heavily GOP congressional district, where 47% of registered voters are Republican and 27% are Democrats. It covers parts of Kern, Kings, Fresno and Tulare counties.\n\nThe May 21 runoff was expected to have low turnout. By Monday, less than 15% of mail-in ballots had been returned, according to California's secretary of state.\n\nMail-in ballots postmarked and sent on or before Election Day that are delivered by May 28 will be counted. California's secretary of state must certify election results by or on June 28.\n\nBut Fong can be sworn in far sooner than that deadline, even within a week, if California's secretary of state confirms there is a member-elect in a letter to the House Clerk that quickly to start the process.\n\nFong will boost the GOP's razor-thin majority in the House of Representatives.", "source": {"uri":

While Ms. Weber attempted to disqualify the Assemblyman from running for state and federal offices at the same time, multiple state courts found for Mr. Fong and allowed his congressional campaign to continue.\n\nHe noted on his website that the choice to run for Congress was a difficult one.\n\n\"However, it is my strong belief that the Central Valley must continue to be represented by proven, conservative leaders in Congress,\" Mr. Fong said. \"In light of recent developments and in an attempt to unite our community in this critical moment in our nation's history, I have decided to run for Congress in 2024.\"\n\nWith a lengthy career in politics, he said he is committed to serving his constituents and fighting for water and energy resources, securing the border, opposing new taxes, and working to stifle inflation.\n\n\"In Congress, I will focus on the pressing issues impacting our quality of life,\" Mr. Fong said.\n\nEarlier this year, he received an endorsement from former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"In Congress, Vince will work with me to grow the economy, lower your taxes, cut burdensome regulations, champion American energy, and protect and defend the Second Amendment, which is under siege by the radical left,\" Mr. Trump posted on the Truth social media platform March 17. \"I am proud to join California's congressional Republican delegation and give Vince Fong my complete and total endorsement.\"\n\nMr. Boudreaux -- sheriff and president of the California State Sheriff's Association -- has a distinguished 37-year career with the Tulare County Sheriff's Office and has served as sheriff since October 2013.\n\n\"I will ensure that my leadership in Congress -- just like it has as sheriff -- will reflect the values of limited government, a safer California, and a stronger border,\" Mr. Boudreaux said on his campaign website.\n\nThe sheriff said his career prepared him for a role in politics and suggested his unique background will help him serve Californians.\n\n\"I have fought and pushed back,\" Mr. Boudreaux posted March 30 on X. \"Elect strength and not the swamp.\"\n\nHe has received numerous endorsements, including from the California Republican Assembly -- a volunteer run organization established in 1935 and dubbed the \"conscience of the Republican Party\" by former President Ronald Reagan.\n\n\"While all of the candidates had much to offer and would represent us well, only one stood ready to tackle the main issue on everyone's mind: rampant out of control crime coupled with a porous border fueling it,\" Greg Perrone, president of the greater Bakersfield Republican Assembly, said on the sheriff's campaign website. \"That someone is Sheriff Mike Boudreaux. The [California Republican Assembly] endorsed Mike Boudreaux because we believe he is ready to represent the district with experience and integrity on Day 1.\"\n\nAfter the polls close, results could take weeks to determine in the event of a close race due to mail-in ballots.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Kevin McCarthy left Congress at the end of last year after being ousted as the House speaker. A special election on Tuesday will determine his Central Valley successor.\n\nFor the third time this year, voters in California's most conservative congressional district will choose whom they want to replace Kevin McCarthy, the ousted speaker of the House -- and this time the winner will head straight to Washington.\n\nIn a special runoff election on Tuesday, voters will determine who will finish Mr. McCarthy's term for the remainder of the congressional session. The choice is between two Republicans: Vince Fong, a state assemblyman and former aide to Mr. McCarthy, and Mike Boudreaux, the sheriff of Tulare County. The two men qualified for Tuesday's runoff after a special election in March in which they were the two top finishers, but neither candidate took 50 percent of the vote.\n\nMr. Fong entered Tuesday as the favorite. He has benefited not just from Mr. McCarthy's estimable sway in the Bakersfield region, but also from an endorsement from former President Donald J. Trump.\n\nThe winner of the special election will have the benefit of incumbency in the November election for a full term representing the southern end of the Central Valley in the next congressional session. The same candidates, Mr. Fong and Mr. Boudreaux, are facing off in that contest after emerging as the top two finishers in a separate March primary contest. Mr. Boudreaux has indicated that he could decide to withdraw from the November race if he does not win Tuesday, according to KFSN-TV, a Fresno-based ABC outlet.\n\nBoth candidates have called for tighter border controls, abortion restrictions, more California oil production and more water for farmers. Mr. Boudreaux, who serves as the president of the California State Sheriffs' Association, has emphasized his experience on public safety. Mr. Fong, who is the vice chairman of the California State Assembly budget committee, has highlighted economic issues, saying he would oppose new taxes and reduce regulations on businesses.\n\nThe two March votes locked Democrats out of the seat, as the state's \"jungle\" primary system allows the two top finishers to advance to the general election regardless of party affiliation.\n\nMr. Fong secured about 42 percent of the vote in each of the March elections. Mr. Boudreaux won 24 percent of the vote in the primary, and made an incremental gain of two percentage points in the first contest to finish Mr. McCarthy's term. Mr. Fong is also ahead in fund-raising, having pulled in about $1.5 million, more than three times the roughly $425,000 raised by Mr. Boudreaux.\n\nMr. Fong's fought off an earlier threat: an initial determination in April by the California secretary of state that he was ineligible to run for Congress because he had already submitted re-election paperwork for his Assembly seat. Mr. Fong sued the secretary of state and state courts determined he could remain on the congressional ballot.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"},

It's Tuesday, May 21. Here's what you need to know to start your day. I'm Laura J. Nelson, a political reporter at The Times. Here's what you need to know to start your day.\n\nWhen former Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield) left Congress last year, it was the end of an era -- but far from the end of his involvement in politics.\n\nToday is election day in McCarthy's old district in the Central Valley, which stretches up State Route 99 and the 5 Freeway between Bakersfield and Fresno. The seat has been vacant in the conservative agricultural district since the end of 2023, when McCarthy resigned after being voted out as House speaker.\n\nAs I reported this week, McCarthy isn't on the ballot in the 20th Congressional District. But he has been an influential presence in the race, lending his connections and his significant fundraising prowess to help his chosen successor. McCarthy's pick is Assemblymember Vince Fong, 44, a Republican, who started his career working for McCarthy's predecessor, then-Rep. Bill Thomas, and worked as McCarthy's district director before being elected to the state Legislature to represent Bakersfield in 2016. Fong's opponent is longtime Tulare County Sheriff Mike Boudreaux, 57, also a Republican, and the head of the California State Sheriffs Assn. Boudreaux is best known in the northern half of the district, which stretches through portions of Kern, Kings, Tulare and Fresno counties. Whoever wins Tuesday's election will finish McCarthy's term, which ends in January. They will also go into the November election as the incumbent, a significant advantage. They will be representing an area that has become accustomed to electing representatives who stay in Washington for years and rise to powerful positions.\n\nCentral Valley legacies\n\nMcCarthy spent nearly 18 years in Congress and became House speaker. His predecessor, Thomas, was in office for 28 years and chaired the powerful Ways and Means Committee. And in neighboring Fresno, former Rep. Devin Nunes was in Congress for 18 years, including a stint chairing the House Intelligence Committee.\n\n\"A lot of the big cities and the urban centers get a lot of the attention,\" Fong told me. But, he said, he would hope to follow in the footsteps of McCarthy, Thomas and Nunes, who were \"able to make sure that the Central Valley had a seat at the table.\" Fong is best known in Kern County, which is home to more than half of the district's registered voters. He and his supporters say that he's the best and most experienced candidate, who could easily transition from Sacramento to Washington. \"I've been on the streets, on patrol, enforcing issues of immigration and crime resulting from bad legislation,\" Boudreaux said. \"I have 38 years of real-life experiences that I can take to the Hill.\"\n\nHow some voters see the race\n\nAt a fundraiser for Boudreaux's campaign, on a beautiful patio overlooking a Visalia golf course, his friends and supporters ate skewers of feta cheese and watermelon with balsamic drizzle while I quizzed them about how they saw the race. Several put it almost exactly the same way: They see Boudreaux as a principled conservative and an experienced leader who is facing down a freight train of money from McCarthy and his allies. (And just because they're all Republicans doesn't mean they always get along -- it's complicated.) Retired Republican Rep. Connie Conway, who replaced Nunes in Congress, said -- to laughter in the crowd -- that she had encountered \"just a little pressure\" not to endorse the sheriff.\n\n\"Kern County thinks they're kingmakers,\" said Mariann Bettencourt, a former chair of the Tulare County Republican Party. \"They don't much like it when you run against them.\" Fong has raised nearly $1.5 million, more than three times as much as Boudreaux. Running against the \"McCarthy machine,\" Boudreaux said, has been \"daunting, to say the least.\" McCarthy has contributed $450,000 from his political action committee into a pro-Fong PAC called Central Valley Values. (The PAC has also received $500,000 from a new political group funded by major Republican donors, including Barbara Marshall-Grimm of Bakersfield's Grimmsway Farms, the world's largest carrot grower.) Another sign of McCarthy's involvement: President Trump's endorsement of Fong in March.\n\n\"The Kern County GOP really is a machine,\" said Greg Perrone, president of the Greater Bakersfield Republican Assembly. And Fong, he said, has \"got it all behind him.\"\n\nFor more from the Central Valley, check out my story: \"How Kevin McCarthy is influencing this congressional race -- without being on the ballot.\"\n\nFrom unhoused to high school grad: L.A. ceremony honors students who overcame the odds.

He endorsed Fong, a former staffer, as his successor.\n\nFong will serve out the remainder of McCarthy's term through January next year. The pair are set for another rematch in November, when they compete for a full two-year term.\n\nThe first round of the special election took place in March with all candidates, regardless of party, running on the same ballot. Fong, who also had the support of former President Donald Trump, finished first in that race ahead of Boudreaux and Democrat Marisa Wood. But as he did not take a majority of the vote, the race moved to this month's face-off between the top two finishers.\n\nThe 20th District contest was the first of three House special elections taking place for vacant GOP seats over the next five weeks.\n\nThe next is on June 11 in Ohio's 6th Congressional District. Voters there will decide on a successor to former Rep. Bill Johnson, who resigned to become the president of Youngstown State University. Then, on June 25, Colorado's 4th District will hold a special election to succeed former Rep. Ken Buck, a hard-line conservative who clashed with his own party at times.

If Fong beats Tulare Sheriff Mike Boudreaux tonight and becomes Congressman Fong, he'll wield a potent advantage in the November contest for a full two-year term.\n\nThat would be a win for McCarthy, who has worked hard to boost the Central Valley state lawmaker. It would also vindicate GOP officials and funders who are promoting establishment-friendly Republicans over the kinds of far-right insurgents that drove McCarthy from the speakership and out of his safe red seat.\n\nThe Nevada-based Conservatives for American Excellence dropped $500,000 into the pro-Fong PAC as part of a larger strategy to boost mainstream Republicans over conservatives allied with the anti-establishment Club for Growth and the far-right Freedom Caucus.\n\nMcCarthy -- who has embarked on a retribution operation against the Freedom Caucus dissidents who pushed him from power -- has fundraised for Fong in person and helped to broker a critical endorsement from former President Donald Trump. A McCarthy-linked PAC has poured $450,000 into a pro-Fong Super PAC that boosted the candidate and hit Boudreaux in the March primaries.\n\nAs he works to secure Fong's victory, McCarthy is also thinking about his own legacy closer to home.\n\n\"He saw what happened with Boehner -- a Freedom Caucus person took over his seat,\" said a person familiar with McCarthy's thinking who was granted anonymity to describe the former speaker's motives. \"He looks at this and wants to make sure his kind of person takes this seat.\" (California Republican Party Chair Jessica Millan Patterson described McCarthy this weekend as still \"heavily engaged in California Republican Party politics.\")\n\nBoudreaux may not be a card-carrying Freedom Caucus member, but he is running against the Bakersfield Republican machine that propelled Fong, McCarthy, and ex-Rep. Bill Thomas before that.\n\nLike McCarthy, Fong is running for his ex-boss's open House seat. Like McCarthy when his career cut through Sacramento, Fong is seen as more of a conventional conservative than a radical agitator.\n\nBut the Republican Party has changed since McCarthy got to Washington -- in large part because of the norm-discarding, establishment-defying president whom McCarthy embraced to attain the speakership.

Kevin McCarthy's (R-CA) term after the former speaker stepped down from office at the end of last year.\n\nFong defeated Tulare Sheriff Mike Boudreaux in the head-to-head contest with the state lawmaker garnering 60.5% of the vote with 83% ballots counted. The Associated Press called the race at 11:18 p.m EST.\n\nThe victory allows Fong to represent California's 20th Congressional District for the remainder of this Congress, and it gives him an advantage to win the general election in November for a full term.\n\nFong's win comes as a victory for Speaker Mike Johnson's predecessor McCarthy, who was ousted last October and retired from Congress just three months later. Fong, once a staffer under McCarthy, ran as a candidate with similar values as his onetime boss, upholding the Republican establishment.\n\nMcCarthy played a substantial role in Fong's campaign by appearing at fundraising events and helping to secure a coveted endorsement from former President Donald Trump. A political action committee tied to the former speaker has also poured $450,000 into a pro-Fong super PAC to help boost his candidacy and target Boudreaux in the March primaries.\n\nHis win will bring the Republican majority to 218-213, giving the party a bit more breathing room by increasing its current one-vote majority to two. That is sure to give Johnson (R-LA) a sense of relief as he navigates a historically thin majority paired with a group of hard-line conservatives who are unafraid to buck GOP leadership to get what they want.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThe replacement of McCarthy will chip away at the House's efforts to fill a slew of other vacancies announced over the last few months. Those include the seats vacated by Republican Reps. Bill Johnson, Mike Gallagher, and Ken Buck, all of whom resigned from office before their terms expired. There is also the seat vacated by Democratic Rep.

Whoever wins will then gain an advantage in November when the seat is up for a full two-year term.\n\nOnce the winner of the special election is sworn into Congress, California's 20th Congressional District will have a representative for the first time in nearly five months. The swearing-in will also bring a sense of reinforcement to House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), who has been navigating a historically thin majority paired with a group of hard-line conservatives who are unafraid to buck GOP leadership to get what they want.\n\nThe induction of either Fong or Boudreaux will bring the Republican majority to 218-213, giving Johnson a bit more breathing room by increasing his one-vote majority to two.\n\nFong is favored to win the seat after receiving 42.3% of the vote in March's special election, which resulted in a runoff because no candidate secured over 50% of the vote. Boudreaux garnered 25.8%.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nMcCarthy has played a substantial role in Fong's campaign by appearing at fundraising events and helping to secure a coveted endorsement from former President Donald Trump. A political action committee tied to the former speaker has also poured $450,000 into a pro-Fong super PAC to help boost his candidacy and target Boudreaux in the March primaries.\n\nDespite leaving office in December 2023, McCarthy has still kept a high profile in Washington politics. Once a prolific fundraiser for the Republican Party, he has turned those efforts to boost candidates and set out on a revenge tour of sorts against the hard-line conservatives responsible for his ouster.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThe replacement of McCarthy will chip away at the House's efforts to fill a slew of other vacancies announced over the last few months. Those include the seats vacated by Republican Reps. Bill Johnson, Mike Gallagher, and Ken Buck, all of whom resigned from office before their terms expired. There is also the seat vacated by Democratic Rep. Donald Payne, who died late last month.\n\nThose races are all considered not to be competitive and will provide Republicans a little boost to their majority once they are all filled. Until then, Johnson faces pushback from some hard-line members who have repeatedly threatened his leadership, including a failed ouster attempt by Rep.

Both Valley men campaigned up and down the Valley over the last several months vying for voters, donors and support.\n\nBoth men won the March Primary to runoff during Tuesday's special election to replace retired Congressman Kevin McCarthy.\n\nMcCarthy, 59, in December, announced his plans to retire from Congress at the end of the year, after more than a decade of serving in the House ended with intraparty fractures and a handful of Republican rebels pushing for his removal.\n\nHe backed Fong in the race.\n\n\"I am filled with humility and gratitude tonight, as early results show that voters have overwhelmingly selected me to serve as their voice in Washington D.C.,\" Fong said. \"With the campaign over, the real work now begins. In Congress, I will remain focused on solving the tough issues facing our community -- securing the border, supporting small business, bringing investment in water storage and infrastructure, unleashing our energy industry, and keeping the United States safe amidst the grave security threats facing our nation.\n\n\"Now is the time to unite and work together to fight for our way of life.\"\n\nTuesday's results were still coming in with both candidates switching leads several times, though larger portions of Fong's districts had yet to be reported.\n\nBoudreaux, who has been sheriff for nearly a decade and had strong support throughout the northern portion of the district, couldn't overcome Fong's base in Bakersfield.\n\nHe conceded to Fong Tuesday night after seeing early statewide results. He carried Tulare County with nearly 70% of the vote and split Kings County 50% each.\n\n\"I entered this campaign in December because we faced a crisis: the very real potential of losing critical, seasoned representation in Congress at a time when our region and nation's public safety is threatened,\" the sheriff said. \"In the ensuing six months, I have been absolutely humbled by the outpouring of support from family, friends, and neighbors across Fresno, Tulare, Kings and Kern counties who stepped up to volunteer their time and energy to our campaign and donated generously to spread our message for a better Valley.\"\n\nCalifornia's GOP released a statement shortly after statewide results poured in.\n\n\"Congratulations to Congressman-Elect Vince Fong on his resounding victory tonight in CA-20. He has already been a champion for Central Valley families in the California state legislature, and I know that he will do an excellent job now representing their interests in Washington, DC. I look forward to seeing him advocate for critical water and energy resources, fight to protect our Southern border and hold the failing Biden administration accountable for their reckless spending that fueled inflation across the nation.\"\n\nThe solidly Republican district is anchored in Bakersfield, which cuts through parts of several counties in the state's interior farm belt, including Visalia and Tulare County.\n\nMcCarthy announced in early December that he would step down, two months after his historic ouster as House speaker. The announcement capped a stunning end to a House career for the onetime deli counter owner, who ascended through state and national politics to become second in line to the presidency, until a cluster of hard-right conservatives engineered his removal in October.\n\nMcCarthy is the only speaker in history to be voted out of the job.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

Whoever wins will then gain an advantage in November when the seat is up for a full two-year term.\n\nOnce the winner of the special election is sworn into Congress, California's 20th Congressional District will have a representative for the first time in nearly five months. The swearing-in will also bring a sense of reinforcement to House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), who has been navigating a historically thin majority paired with a group of hard-line conservatives who are unafraid to buck GOP leadership to get what they want.\n\nThe induction of either Fong or Boudreaux will bring the Republican majority to 218-213, giving Johnson a bit more breathing room by increasing his one-vote majority to two.\n\nFong is favored to win the seat after receiving 42.3% of the vote in March's special election, which resulted in a runoff because no candidate secured over 50% of the vote. Boudreaux garnered 25.8%.\n\nMcCarthy has played a substantial role in Fong's campaign by appearing at fundraising events and helping to secure a coveted endorsement from former President Donald Trump. A political action committee tied to the former speaker has also poured $450,000 into a pro-Fong super PAC to help boost his candidacy and target Boudreaux in the March primaries.\n\nDespite leaving office in December 2023, McCarthy has still kept a high profile in Washington politics. Once a prolific fundraiser for the Republican Party, he has turned those efforts to boost candidates and set out on a revenge tour of sorts against the hard-line conservatives responsible for his ouster.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThe replacement of McCarthy will chip away at the House's efforts to fill a slew of other vacancies announced over the last few months. Those include the seats vacated by Republican Reps. Bill Johnson, Mike Gallagher, and Ken Buck, all of whom resigned from office before their terms expired. There is also the seat vacated by Democratic Rep. Donald Payne, who died late last month.\n\nThose races are all considered not to be competitive and will provide Republicans a little boost to their majority once they are all filled.

Trump.\n\nHere are some takeaways.\n\nBiden met significant resistance in the Kentucky primary, and a protest vote against him in Oregon faltered.\n\nNearly 30 percent of voters in the Democratic primary in Kentucky backed an option that wasn't Mr. Biden, a notable underperformance for the president among Democrats in the state. The protest vote against Mr. Biden there was nearly double that against Mr. Trump, who won about 85 percent of the vote in the Republican primary. Turnout also plunged in the Democratic primary, with about 184,000 votes tallied, compared with the more than 537,000 recorded in 2020.\n\nIn Oregon, a write-in campaign in protest of Mr. Biden's handling of the war in Gaza underperformed significantly, with less than 5 percent of all votes in the Democratic primary going to write-ins. In neighboring Washington State, the uncommitted ballot option got nearly 10 percent of the vote in the Democratic primary in late March. Mr. Trump was unopposed in Oregon's Republican primary.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

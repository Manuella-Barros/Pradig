She dove right in after it,\" Duncan recalled.FinalistsOur first finalist this week is Samantha, a rescue dog who endured abuse before finding her forever home with owner Ramon Bautista.\"[She] has been with us for almost three years and has grown to be thankful for all the good fortunes that have come her way,\" Bautista told Newsweek. A testament to rescues, she is now living her best life at their home in Vermont where she can often be seen rolling around on the lawn in front of their home.Next up this week is Darbi, a food-motivated Bernedoodle who lives with her owner Cindyrae Stang.\"We brought Darbi home when she was 8 weeks old and began her basic training right away. It didn't take us long to realize she was very food motivated,\" Stang told Newsweek.One memorable training session particularly reflects Darbi's dedication.\"During our lunch time training, I put her on a sit and stay command, dropped the leash, and walked about 30 feet away,\" Stang explained. \"When I turned around, she was sitting precisely as I had left her\u2014the leash still (unintentionally) draped over her head. She didn't move a muscle, waiting for the 'come' command and consequently, the coveted treat.\"As Stang looked through her bag to find a treat, the obedient Darbi even waited while she snapped a picture of the moment\u2014something that always brings a smile to her owner's face.Last but not least this week is Annabelle, affectionately known as Annie.An Alaskan Malamute, she lives with her owner Robert Ashkenes who describes her as a \"a playful jovial pup without a mean bone in her body. A giant cuddle bug and just the sweetest pup you've ever met.\"Despite her gentle nature, Annie does experience anxiety when left alone. However, Ashkenes, a retired Marine, ensures she is never alone.\"I'm retired, so I'm always here with her. She's a great companion for a disabled Marine,\" he told Newsweek.Annie's loving and loyal presence brings joy and comfort to Ashkenes, making her an invaluable part of his life.Do you have funny and adorable videos or pictures of your pet you want to share?

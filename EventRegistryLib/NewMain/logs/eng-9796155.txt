Khelif has won three consecutive bouts in Paris, and she will win either a gold or a silver medal when she completes the tournament on Friday against Yang Liu of China.\n\n\"I am very happy,\" Khelif said through an interpreter. \"I've worked eight years for these Olympics, and I'm very proud of this moment. I would like to thank the support from people back home.\"\n\nKhelif had already clinched Algeria's first medal in women's boxing before she stepped into the ring to rousing roars at Court Philippe Chatrier. She then controlled her bout with Suwannapheng, who took a standing 8-count late in the third after absorbing a series of punches.\n\n\"My opponent was really good,\" Khelif said. \"But I trained for two weeks, and I learned how she fought from videos.\"\n\nKhelif has won every round on every judge's card in her two fights that have gone the distance in Paris. She has made the most important tournament run of her international career amid criticism and stigmatization stemming from the Olympic-banished International Boxing Association's decision to disqualify her and fellow Paris medalist Lin Yu-ting of Chinese Taipei from the world championships last year for allegedly failing an eligibility test.\n\n\"I had heard about the news regarding her, but I wasn't following it closely,\" Suwannapheng said. \"She is a woman, but she is very strong.\"\n\nThe ending of Khelif's first bout in Paris propelled her into the center of a worldwide divide over gender identity and safety regulations in sports. Her first opponent, Angela Carini of Italy, tearfully quit after just 46 seconds, saying she was in too much pain from Khelif's punches.\n\nCarini's abandonment of the fight led to comments from the likes of former U.S. President Donald Trump, \"Harry Potter\" writer J.K. Rowling and others falsely claiming Khelif was a man or transgender. Carini later apologized for her decision.\n\nIn an interview Sunday with SNTV, a sports video partner of The Associated Press, Khelif said the wave of hateful scrutiny she is facing \"harms human dignity\" and called for an end to bullying athletes.\n\nKhelif also said she felt the \"best response\" to the uproar around her would be to win a gold medal -- and now she's one win away.\n\nAfter sharing a hug with Suwannapheng, Khelif celebrated in the ring by running joyously in place while pumping her fists as the crowd roared for her again. The celebration was more joyous than her cathartic finish to her quarterfinal victory over Hungary's Anna Luca Hamori, when she slammed her palm on the canvas as she teared up.\n\nKhelif received her post-fight medical check and was headed out of the Roland Garros arena when she was mobbed by fans near the exit. They hugged Khelif, demanded selfies and waved Algerian flags while she made her way backstage.\n\nKhelif received cheers that echoed through the famed tennis arena from the moment she entered to face Suwannapheng. Roland Garros welcomed a prominent turnout from Algerian fans voicing their national pride in a boxer whose negative spotlight has been taken quite personally in her country.\n\nBoth fighters came out aggressively, trading punches from distance. Khelif was more accurate while winning the first round on all five cards, and she repeated the performance in the second.\n\nThe fight got more physical in the third, with Suwannapheng pushing forward to make a comeback. The bout was stopped for a standing 8-count late in the third when Suwannapheng absorbed a few head punches in succession, although Suwannapheng appeared to shrug as if it wasn't necessary -- as is often the case in Olympic boxing, where referees can stop a bout for relatively minor reasons.\n\n\"I tried to use my speed, but my opponent was just too strong,\" Suwannapheng said.\n\nThe 25-year-old Khelif is on the best run of her amateur career at the Olympics. She has performed solidly at the international level and even won some regional tournaments, but Khelif has never been a dominant fighter on the world stage until her two strong performances -- and 46 seconds of easy work against a third -- to reach the final in Paris.\n\nThe IOC and its president, Thomas Bach, have repeatedly defended the Olympic eligibility of Khelif and Lin while condemning the IBA as incompetent and biased.\n\nKhelif and Lin were disqualified by the IBA in the middle of last year's world championships over what it claimed were failed eligibility tests for the women's competition. The IBA has been banished from the Olympics since before the Tokyo Games, and the body struggled to articulate the reasoning for its decisions on Khelif and Lin at a news conference Monday.\n\nLin also has clinched a medal and advanced to the Olympic semifinals. She fights Esra Yildiz Kahraman of Turkey on Wednesday night.\n\nAlgeria's Olympic team has reacted forcefully to the criticism and negative attention around Khelif, and the fan turnout in Roland Garros reflected the seriousness with which the accusations have been received in her home country and in its French diaspora.\n\nChinese Taipei has reacted with equal condemnation of the IBA's claims and the worldwide swirl of scrutiny. Sports officials on Tuesday said they are considering legal action against the IBA after sending a letter protesting \"the International Boxing Association's continued publication of false information, obscuring the facts, and attempting to interfere with the normal conduct of the event regardless of the rights and interests of athletes.\"\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "greg_beacham@eagletribune.com", "name": "Greg Beacham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Liu_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yang Liu (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Yu-ting", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lin Yu-ting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angela Carini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Taipei", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Taipei"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Khelif has won three consecutive bouts in Paris, and she will win either a gold or a silver medal when she completes the tournament on Friday against Yang Liu of China.\n\nKhelif had already clinched Algeria's first medal in women's boxing before she stepped into the ring to rousing roars at Court Philippe Chatrier.

Her first opponent, Angela Carini of Italy, tearfully quit after just 46 seconds, saying she was in too much pain from Khelif's punches.\n\nCarini's abandonment of the fight led to comments from the likes of former U.S. president Donald Trump, \"Harry Potter\" writer J.K. Rowling and others falsely claiming Khelif was a man or transgender. Carini later apologized for her decision.\n\nIn an interview Sunday with SNTV, a sports video partner of The Associated Press, Khelif said the wave of hateful scrutiny she is facing \"harms human dignity\" and called for an end to bullying athletes.\n\nKhelif also said she felt the \"best response\" to the uproar around her would be to win a gold medal -- and now she's one win away.\n\nKhelif received her post-fight medical check and was headed out of the Roland Garros arena when she was mobbed by fans near the exit. They hugged Khelif, demanded selfies and waved Algerian flags while she made her way backstage.\n\nKhelif received cheers that echoed through the famed tennis arena from the moment she entered to face Suwannapheng. Roland Garros welcomed a prominent turnout from Algerian fans voicing their national pride in a boxer whose negative spotlight has been taken quite personally in her country.\n\nBoth fighters came out aggressively, trading punches from distance. Khelif was more accurate while winning the first round on all five cards, and she repeated the performance in the second.\n\nThe fight got more physical in the third, with Suwannapheng pushing forward to make a comeback. The bout was stopped for a standing 8-count late in the third when Suwannapheng absorbed a few head punches in succession, although Suwannapheng appeared to shrug as if it wasn't necessary -- as is often the case in Olympic boxing, where referees can stop a bout for relatively minor reasons.\n\n\"I tried to use my speed, but my opponent was just too strong,\" Suwannapheng said.\n\nWATCH | Khelif defeats Carlini at Paris Olympics:\n\nThe 25-year-old Khelif is on the best run of her amateur career at the Olympics. She has performed solidly at the international level and even won some regional tournaments, but Khelif has never been a dominant fighter on the world stage until her two strong performances -- and 46 seconds of easy work against a third -- to reach the final in Paris.\n\nThe IOC and its president, Thomas Bach, have repeatedly defended the Olympic eligibility of Khelif and Lin while condemning the IBA as incompetent and biased.\n\nKhelif and Lin were disqualified by the IBA in the middle of last year's world championships over what it claimed were failed eligibility tests for the women's competition. The IBA has been banished from the Olympics since before the Tokyo Games, and the body struggled to articulate the reasoning for its decisions on Khelif and Lin at a news conference Monday.\n\nAlgeria's Olympic team has reacted forcefully to the criticism and negative attention around Khelif, and the fan turnout in Roland Garros reflected the seriousness with which the accusations have been received in her home country and in its French diaspora.\n\nChinese Taipei has reacted with equal condemnation of the IBA's claims and the worldwide swirl of scrutiny. Sports officials on Tuesday said they are considering legal action against the IBA after sending a letter protesting \"the International Boxing Association's continued publication of false information, obscuring the facts, and attempting to interfere with the normal conduct of the event regardless of the rights and interests of athletes.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Liu_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yang Liu (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Yu-ting", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lin Yu-ting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angela Carini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Sports officials on Tuesday said they are considering legal action against the IBA after sending a letter protesting \"the International Boxing Association's continued publication of false information, obscuring the facts, and attempting to interfere with the normal conduct of the event regardless of the rights and interests of athletes.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "clickondetroit.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WDIV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@clickondetroit.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "greg_beacham@clickondetroit.com", "name": "Greg Beacham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Liu_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yang Liu (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Yu-ting", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lin Yu-ting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angela Carini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Taipei", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Taipei"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stigma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social stigma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Khelif has won three consecutive bouts in Paris, and she will win either a gold or a silver medal when she completes the tournament on Friday against Yang Liu of China.\n\nKhelif had already clinched Algeria's first medal in women's boxing before she stepped into the ring to rousing roars at Court Philippe Chatrier.\n\nShe then controlled her bout with Suwannapheng, who took a standing 8-count late in the third after absorbing a series of punches. Khelif has won every round on every judge's card in her two fights that have gone the distance in Paris.\n\nAfter hugging Suwannapheng, Khelif celebrated in the ring, running joyously in place while pumping her fists as the crowd roared for her again. Khelif received her post-fight medical check and was headed out of the arena when she was mobbed by fans near the exit. They hugged Khelif, demanded selfies and waved Algerian flags while she made her way backstage.\n\nThe ending of Khelif's first bout in Paris propelled her into the center of a worldwide divide over gender identity and safety regulations in sports. Her first opponent, Angela Carini of Italy, tearfully quit after just 46 seconds, saying she was in too much pain from Khelif's punches.\n\nCarini's abandonment of the fight led to comments from the likes of former U.S. President Donald Trump, \"Harry Potter\" writer J.K. Rowling and others falsely claiming Khelif was a man or transgender.\n\nIn an interview with SNTV, a sports video partner of The Associated Press, Khelif said the wave of hateful scrutiny she is facing \"harms human dignity\" and called for an end to bullying athletes.\n\nKhelif also said she felt the \"best response\" to the uproar around her would be to win a gold medal -- and now she's one win away.\n\nKhelif entered the ring against Suwannapheng to cheers echoing through the famed tennis arena. Roland Garros welcomed a prominent turnout from Algerian fans voicing their national pride in a boxer whose stigmatization by the Olympic-banished International Boxing Association has been taken very personally in her country.\n\nBoth fighters came out aggressively, trading punches from distance. Khelif was more accurate while winning the first round on all five cards, and she repeated the performance in the second.\n\nThe fight got more physical in the third, with Suwannapheng pushing forward to make a comeback. The bout was stopped for a standing 8-count late in the third when Suwannapheng absorbed a few head punches in succession, although Suwannapheng appeared to shrug as if it wasn't necessary -- as is often the case in Olympic boxing, where referees can stop a bout for relatively minor reasons.\n\nThe 25-year-old Khelif is on the best run of her amateur career at the Olympics. She has performed solidly at the international level and even won some regional tournaments, but Khelif has never been a dominant fighter on the world stage until her two strong performances -- and 46 seconds of easy work against a third -- to reach the final in Paris.\n\nThe IOC and its president, Thomas Bach, have repeatedly defended the Olympic eligibility of Khelif and fellow boxer Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan while condemning the IBA as incompetent and biased.\n\nKhelif and Lin were disqualified by the IBA in the middle of last year's world championships over what it claimed were failed eligibility tests for the women's competition. The IBA has been banished from the Olympics since before the Tokyo Games, and the body struggled to articulate the reasoning for its decisions on Khelif and Lin at a news conference Monday.\n\nLin also has clinched a medal and advanced to the Olympic semifinals. She fights Esra Yildiz Kahraman of Turkey in the first bout Wednesday night at Roland Garros.\n\nAlgeria's Olympic team has reacted forcefully to the criticism and negative attention around Khelif, and the fan turnout in Roland Garros reflected the seriousness with which the accusations have been received in her home country and in its French diaspora.\n\nChinese Taipei has reacted with equal condemnation of the IBA's claims and the worldwide swirl of scrutiny.

Khelif has won three consecutive bouts in Paris, and she will win either a gold or a silver medal when she completes the tournament on Friday against Yang Liu of China.\n\n\"I am very happy,\" Khelif said through an interpreter. \"I've worked eight years for these Olympics, and I'm very proud of this moment. I would like to thank the support from people back home.\"\n\nRelated Story: Boxer Imane Khelif Fights to Get Closer to Olympic Gold Amid Outcry Over Gender ...\n\nKhelif had already clinched Algeria's first medal in women's boxing before she stepped into the ring to rousing roars at Court Philippe Chatrier.

She has made the most important tournament run of her international career amid criticism and stigmatization stemming from the Olympic-banished International Boxing Association's decision to disqualify her and fellow Paris medalist Lin Yu-ting of Chinese Taipei from the world championships last year for allegedly failing an eligibility test.\n\n\"I had heard about the news regarding her, but I wasn't following it closely,\" Suwannapheng said. \"She is a woman, but she is very strong.\"\n\nRelated Story: Who Is Imane Khelif? Algerian Boxer Facing Gender Outcry Had Modest Success ...\n\nThe ending of Khelif's first bout in Paris propelled her into the center of a worldwide divide over gender identity and safety regulations in sports. Her first opponent, Angela Carini of Italy, tearfully quit after just 46 seconds, saying she was in too much pain from Khelif's punches.\n\nCarini's abandonment of the fight led to comments from the likes of former U.S. President Donald Trump, \"Harry Potter\" writer J.K. Rowling and others falsely claiming Khelif was a man or transgender. Carini later apologized for her decision.\n\nIn an interview Sunday with SNTV, a sports video partner of The Associated Press, Khelif said the wave of hateful scrutiny she is facing \"harms human dignity\" and called for an end to bullying athletes.\n\nKhelif also said she felt the \"best response\" to the uproar around her would be to win a gold medal -- and now she's one win away.\n\nRelated Story: IOC Rejects IBA's Gender Tests, Allows Disputed Female Boxers to Continue\n\nAfter sharing a hug with Suwannapheng, Khelif celebrated in the ring by running joyously in place while pumping her fists as the crowd roared for her again. The celebration was more joyous than her cathartic finish to her quarterfinal victory over Hungary's Anna Luca Hamori, when she slammed her palm on the canvas as she teared up.\n\nKhelif received her post-fight medical check and was headed out of the Roland Garros arena when she was mobbed by fans near the exit. They hugged Khelif, demanded selfies and waved Algerian flags while she made her way backstage.\n\nKhelif received cheers that echoed through the famed tennis arena from the moment she entered to face Suwannapheng. Roland Garros welcomed a prominent turnout from Algerian fans voicing their national pride in a boxer whose negative spotlight has been taken quite personally in her country.\n\nBoth fighters came out aggressively, trading punches from distance. Khelif was more accurate while winning the first round on all five cards, and she repeated the performance in the second.\n\nThe fight got more physical in the third, with Suwannapheng pushing forward to make a comeback. The bout was stopped for a standing 8-count late in the third when Suwannapheng absorbed a few head punches in succession, although Suwannapheng appeared to shrug as if it wasn't necessary -- as is often the case in Olympic boxing, where referees can stop a bout for relatively minor reasons.\n\n\"I tried to use my speed, but my opponent was just too strong,\" Suwannapheng said.\n\nThe 25-year-old Khelif is on the best run of her amateur career at the Olympics. She has performed solidly at the international level and even won some regional tournaments, but Khelif has never been a dominant fighter on the world stage until her two strong performances -- and 46 seconds of easy work against a third -- to reach the final in Paris.\n\nThe IOC and its president, Thomas Bach, have repeatedly defended the Olympic eligibility of Khelif and Lin while condemning the IBA as incompetent and biased.\n\nKhelif and Lin were disqualified by the IBA in the middle of last year's world championships over what it claimed were failed eligibility tests for the women's competition.

Khelif has won three consecutive bouts in Paris, and she will win either a gold or a silver medal when she completes the tournament on Friday against Yang Liu of China.\n\n\"I am very happy,\" Khelif said through an interpreter. \"I've worked eight years for these Olympics, and I'm very proud of this moment. I would like to thank the support from people back home.\"\n\nKhelif had already clinched Algeria's first medal in women's boxing before she stepped into the ring to rousing roars at Court Philippe Chatrier. She controlled her bout with Suwannapheng, who took a standing eight count late in the third after absorbing a series of punches.\n\n\"My opponent was really good,\" Khelif said. \"But I trained for two weeks, and I learned how she fought from videos.\"\n\nKhelif has won every round on every judge's card in her two fights that have gone the distance in Paris. She has made the most important tournament run of her international career amid criticism and stigmatization stemming from the Olympic-banished International Boxing Association's decision to disqualify her and fellow Paris medalist Lin Yu-ting of Chinese Taipei from the world championships last year for allegedly failing an eligibility test.\n\n\"I had heard about the news regarding her, but I wasn't following it closely,\" Suwannapheng said. \"She is a woman, but she is very strong.\"\n\nThe ending of Khelif's first bout in Paris propelled her into the center of a worldwide divide over gender identity and safety regulations in sports. Her first opponent, Angela Carini of Italy, tearfully quit after just 46 seconds, saying she was in too much pain from Khelif's punches.\n\nCarini's abandonment of the fight led to comments from the likes of former U.S. President Donald Trump, \"Harry Potter\" writer J.K. Rowling and others falsely claiming Khelif was a man or transgender.\n\nIn an interview with SNTV, a sports video partner of The Associated Press, Khelif said the wave of hateful scrutiny she is facing \"harms human dignity\" and called for an end to bullying athletes.\n\nKhelif also said she felt the \"best response\" to the uproar around her would be to win a gold medal -- and now she's one win away from claiming it.\n\nAfter sharing a hug with Suwannapheng, Khelif celebrated in the ring by running joyously in place while pumping her fists as the crowd roared for her again. The celebration was more joyous than her cathartic finish to her quarterfinal victory over Hungary's Anna Luca Hamori, when she slammed her palm on the canvas as she teared up.\n\nKhelif received her post-fight medical check and was headed out of the Roland Garros arena when she was mobbed by fans near the exit. They hugged Khelif, demanded selfies and waved Algerian flags while she made her way backstage.\n\nKhelif received cheers that echoed through the famed tennis arena from the moment she entered to face Suwannapheng. Roland Garros welcomed a prominent turnout from Algerian fans voicing their national pride in a boxer whose negative spotlight has been taken quite personally in her country.\n\nBoth fighters came out aggressively, trading punches from distance. Khelif was more accurate while winning the first round on all five cards, and she repeated the performance in the second.\n\nThe fight got more physical in the third, with Suwannapheng pushing forward to make a comeback. The bout was stopped for a standing eight count late in the third when Suwannapheng absorbed a few head punches in succession, although Suwannapheng appeared to shrug as if it wasn't necessary -- as is often the case in Olympic boxing, where referees can stop a bout for relatively minor reasons.\n\n\"I tried to use my speed, but my opponent was just too strong,\" Suwannapheng said.\n\nKhelif, 25, is on the best run of her amateur career at the Olympics. She has performed solidly at the international level and even won some regional tournaments, but Khelif has never been a dominant fighter on the world stage until her two strong performances -- and 46 seconds of easy work against a third -- to reach the final in Paris.\n\nThe IOC and its president, Thomas Bach, have repeatedly defended the Olympic eligibility of Khelif and Lin while condemning the IBA as incompetent and biased.\n\nKhelif and Lin were disqualified by the IBA in the middle of last year's world championships over what it claimed were failed eligibility tests for the women's competition. The IBA has been banished from the Olympics since before the Tokyo Games.\n\nLin also has clinched a medal and advanced to the Olympic semifinals. She fights Esra Yildiz Kahraman of Turkey in the first bout Wednesday night at Roland Garros.\n\nAlgeria's Olympic team has reacted forcefully to the criticism and negative attention around Khelif, and the fan turnout in Roland Garros reflected the seriousness with which the accusations have been received in her home country and in its French diaspora.\n\nChinese Taipei has reacted with equal condemnation of the IBA's claims and the worldwide swirl of scrutiny.

Khelif has won three consecutive bouts in Paris, and she will win either a gold or a silver medal when she completes the tournament on Friday against Yang Liu of China.\n\nKhelif had already clinched Algeria's first medal in women's boxing before she stepped into the ring to rousing roars at Court Philippe Chatrier.\n\nShe controlled her bout with Suwannapheng, who took a standing 8-count late in the third after absorbing a series of punches. Khelif has won every round on every judge's card in her two fights that have gone the distance in Paris.\n\nAfter hugging Suwannapheng, Khelif celebrated in the ring, running joyously in place while pumping her fists as the crowd roared for her again. Khelif received her post-fight medical check and was headed out of the arena when she was mobbed by fans near the exit. They hugged Khelif, demanded selfies and waved Algerian flags while she made her way backstage.\n\nThe ending of Khelif's first bout in Paris propelled her into the center of a worldwide divide over gender identity and safety regulations in sports. Her first opponent, Angela Carini of Italy, tearfully quit after just 46 seconds, saying she was in too much pain from Khelif's punches.\n\nCarini's abandonment of the fight led to comments from the likes of former U.S. President Donald Trump, \"Harry Potter\" writer J.K. Rowling and others falsely claiming Khelif was a man or transgender.\n\nIn an interview with SNTV, a sports video partner of The Associated Press, Khelif said the wave of hateful scrutiny she is facing \"harms human dignity\" and called for an end to bullying athletes.\n\nKhelif also said she felt the \"best response\" to the uproar around her would be to win a gold medal -- and now she's one win away from claiming it.\n\nKhelif entered the ring against Suwannapheng to cheers echoing through the famed tennis arena. Roland Garros welcomed a prominent turnout from Algerian fans voicing their national pride in a boxer whose stigmatization by the Olympic-banished International Boxing Association has been taken very personally in her country.\n\nBoth fighters came out aggressively, trading punches from distance. Khelif was more accurate while winning the first round on all five cards, and she repeated the performance in the second.\n\nThe fight got more physical in the third, with Suwannapheng pushing forward to make a comeback. The bout was stopped for a standing 8-count late in the third when Suwannapheng absorbed a few head punches in succession, although Suwannapheng appeared to shrug as if it wasn't necessary -- as is often the case in Olympic boxing, where referees can stop a bout for relatively minor reasons.\n\nThe 25-year-old Khelif is on the best run of her amateur career at the Olympics. She has performed solidly at the international level and even won some regional tournaments, but Khelif has never been a dominant fighter on the world stage until her two strong performances -- and 46 seconds of easy work against a third -- to reach the final in Paris.\n\nThe IOC and its president, Thomas Bach, have repeatedly defended the Olympic eligibility of Khelif and fellow boxer Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan while condemning the IBA as incompetent and biased.\n\nKhelif and Lin were disqualified by the IBA in the middle of last year's world championships over what it claimed were failed eligibility tests for the women's competition.

Khelif has won three consecutive bouts in Paris, and she will win either a gold or a silver medal when she completes the tournament on Friday against Yang Liu of China.\n\nKhelif had already clinched Algeria's first medal in women's boxing before she stepped into the ring to rousing roars at Court Philippe Chatrier.\n\nShe then controlled her bout with Suwannapheng, who took a standing 8-count late in the third after absorbing a series of punches. Khelif has won every round on every judge's card in her two fights that have gone the distance in Paris.\n\nAfter hugging Suwannapheng, Khelif celebrated in the ring, running joyously in place while pumping her fists as the crowd roared for her again. Khelif received her post-fight medical check and was headed out of the arena when she was mobbed by fans near the exit. They hugged Khelif, demanded selfies and waved Algerian flags while she made her way backstage.\n\nThe ending of Khelif's first bout in Paris propelled her into the center of a worldwide divide over gender identity and safety regulations in sports. Her first opponent, Angela Carini of Italy, tearfully quit after just 46 seconds, saying she was in too much pain from Khelif's punches.\n\nCarini's abandonment of the fight led to comments from the likes of former U.S. President Donald Trump, \"Harry Potter\" writer J.K. Rowling and others falsely claiming Khelif was a man or transgender.\n\nIn an interview with SNTV, a sports video partner of The Associated Press, Khelif said the wave of hateful scrutiny she is facing \"harms human dignity\" and called for an end to bullying athletes.\n\nKhelif also said she felt the \"best response\" to the uproar around her would be to win a gold medal -- and now she's one win away.\n\nKhelif entered the ring against Suwannapheng to cheers echoing through the famed tennis arena. Roland Garros welcomed a prominent turnout from Algerian fans voicing their national pride in a boxer whose stigmatization by the Olympic-banished International Boxing Association has been taken very personally in her country.\n\nBoth fighters came out aggressively, trading punches from distance. Khelif was more accurate while winning the first round on all five cards, and she repeated the performance in the second.\n\nThe fight got more physical in the third, with Suwannapheng pushing forward to make a comeback. The bout was stopped for a standing 8-count late in the third when Suwannapheng absorbed a few head punches in succession, although Suwannapheng appeared to shrug as if it wasn't necessary -- as is often the case in Olympic boxing, where referees can stop a bout for relatively minor reasons.\n\nThe 25-year-old Khelif is on the best run of her amateur career at the Olympics. She has performed solidly at the international level and even won some regional tournaments, but Khelif has never been a dominant fighter on the world stage until her two strong performances -- and 46 seconds of easy work against a third -- to reach the final in Paris.\n\nThe IOC and its president, Thomas Bach, have repeatedly defended the Olympic eligibility of Khelif and fellow boxer Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan while condemning the IBA as incompetent and biased.\n\nKhelif and Lin were disqualified by the IBA in the middle of last year's world championships over what it claimed were failed eligibility tests for the women's competition. The IBA has been banished from the Olympics since before the Tokyo Games, and the body struggled to articulate the reasoning for its decisions on Khelif and Lin at a news conference Monday.\n\nLin also has clinched a medal and advanced to the Olympic semifinals. She fights Esra Yildiz Kahraman of Turkey in the first bout Wednesday night at Roland Garros.\n\nAlgeria's Olympic team has reacted forcefully to the criticism and negative attention around Khelif, and the fan turnout in Roland Garros reflected the seriousness with which the accusations have been received in her home country and in its French diaspora.\n\nChinese Taipei has reacted with equal condemnation of the IBA's claims and the worldwide swirl of scrutiny.

(AFP)\n\nThe Algerian boxer embroiled in a major gender controversy at the Paris Olympics won her semi-final match on Tuesday to guarantee at least a silver medal in front of a raucous Roland Garros crowd that chanted her name.\n\nImane Khelif defeated Thailand's 2023 world silver medallist Janjaem Suwannapheng in a unanimous points decision to march into Friday's final in the women's 66kg category.\n\nTaiwan's Lin Yu-ting, the other boxer in the eye of a storm over her eligibility, is herself sure to take home at least bronze at a different weight.\n\nThe 25-year-old Khelif and Lin both fought at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago but there was no controversy at the time and neither won a medal.\n\nBoth were disqualified from last year's world championships after failing gender eligibility tests, but were cleared to compete in Paris.\n\nKhelif was given the biggest roar of the night as she entered the arena at Roland Garros, usually home to Grand Slam tennis but hosting Olympic boxing and a sizeable number of Algerian fans with flags.\n\nCries of \"Imane, Imane\" rang out repeatedly before and during the bout. The Thai, who had a clear height disadvantage, took a standing count in the third round after feeling the full power of the superior Algerian.\n\nAt the end of the fight at the 15,000-seated Court Philippe Chatrier, which was close to capacity, the two fighters greeted each other warmly and shook hands.\n\nKhelif did a dance in the middle of the ring, to more roars of approval. Khelif faces China's Yang Liu or Taiwan's Chen Nien-chin for gold.\n\nThe gender controversy ignited when Khelif defeated Angela Carini in 46 seconds in her opening bout in the French capital, the Italian reduced to tears and abandoning the fight after suffering a badly hurt nose.\n\nThe 2023 world championships, from which Lin and Khelif were expelled, were run by the International Boxing Association (IBA) but the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is organising the sport at the Games because of financial, governance and ethical concerns at the IBA.\n\nThe IBA's Kremlin-linked president Umar Kremlev claimed at a chaotic press conference on Monday that both fighters had \"genetic testing that shows that these are men\".\n\nThe IOC has leapt to the defence of Khelif and Lin,

her semi-final on Tuesday to guarantee at least a silver medal in front of a raucous Roland Garros crowd that chanted her name.\n\nImane Khelif defeated Thailand's 2023 world silver medallist Janjaem Suwannapheng in a unanimous points decision to march into Friday's final in the women's 66kg category.\n\nTaiwan's Lin Yu-ting, the other boxer in the eye of a storm over her eligibility, is herself sure to take home at least bronze at a different weight.\n\nThe 25-year-old Khelif and Lin both fought at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago but there was no controversy at the time and neither won a medal.\n\nBoth were disqualified from last year's world championships after failing gender eligibility tests, but were cleared to compete in Paris.\n\nKhelif was given the biggest roar of the night as she entered the arena at Roland Garros, usually home to Grand Slam tennis but hosting Olympic boxing and a sizeable number of Algerian fans with flags.\n\nCries of \"Imane, Imane\" rang out repeatedly before and during the bout.\n\nThe Thai, who had a clear height disadvantage, took a standing count in the third round after feeling the full power of the superior Algerian.\n\nAt the end of the fight at the 15,000-seated Court Philippe-Chatrier, which was close to capacity, the two fighters greeted each other warmly and shook hands.\n\nKhelif did a dance in the middle of the ring, to more roars of approval.\n\nKhelif faces China's Yang Liu or Taiwan's Chen Nien-chin for gold.\n\nThe gender controversy ignited when Khelif defeated Angela Carini in 46 seconds in her opening bout in the French capital, the Italian reduced to tears and abandoning the fight after suffering a badly hurt nose.\n\nThe 2023 world championships, from which Lin and Khelif were expelled, were run by the International Boxing Association (IBA) but the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is organising the sport at the Games because of financial, governance and ethical concerns at the IBA.\n\nThe IBA's Kremlin-linked president Umar Kremlev claimed at a chaotic press conference on Monday that both fighters had \"genetic testing that shows that these are men\".\n\nThe IOC has leapt to the defence of Khelif and Lin, with president Thomas Bach saying they were born and raised as women, and have passports saying that.\n\nThe 28-year-old Lin fights in the semi-finals of the women's 57kg division on

Khelif has won three consecutive bouts in Paris, and she will win either a gold or a silver medal when she completes the tournament on Friday against Yang Liu of China.\n\nKhelif had already clinched Algeria's first medal in women's boxing before she stepped into the ring to rousing roars at Court Philippe Chatrier.\n\nShe then controlled her bout with Suwannapheng, who took a standing 8-count late in the third after absorbing a series of punches. Khelif has won every round on every judge's card in her two fights that have gone the distance in Paris.\n\nAfter hugging Suwannapheng, Khelif celebrated in the ring, running joyously in place while pumping her fists as the crowd roared for her again. Khelif received her post-fight medical check and was headed out of the arena when she was mobbed by fans near the exit. They hugged Khelif, demanded selfies and waved Algerian flags while she made her way backstage.\n\nThe ending of Khelif's first bout in Paris propelled her into the center of a worldwide divide over gender identity and safety regulations in sports. Her first opponent, Angela Carini of Italy, tearfully quit after just 46 seconds, saying she was in too much pain from Khelif's punches.\n\nCarini's abandonment of the fight led to comments from the likes of former U.S. President Donald Trump, \"Harry Potter\" writer J.K. Rowling and others falsely claiming Khelif was a man or transgender.\n\nIn an interview with SNTV, a sports video partner of The Associated Press, Khelif said the wave of hateful scrutiny she is facing \"harms human dignity\" and called for an end to bullying athletes.\n\nKhelif also said she felt the \"best response\" to the uproar around her would be to win a gold medal -- and now she's one win away.\n\nKhelif entered the ring against Suwannapheng to cheers echoing through the famed tennis arena. Roland Garros welcomed a prominent turnout from Algerian fans voicing their national pride in a boxer whose stigmatization by the Olympic-banished International Boxing Association has been taken very personally in her country.\n\nBoth fighters came out aggressively, trading punches from distance. Khelif was more accurate while winning the first round on all five cards, and she repeated the performance in the second.\n\nThe fight got more physical in the third, with Suwannapheng pushing forward to make a comeback. The bout was stopped for a standing 8-count late in the third when Suwannapheng absorbed a few head punches in succession, although Suwannapheng appeared to shrug as if it wasn't necessary -- as is often the case in Olympic boxing, where referees can stop a bout for relatively minor reasons.\n\nThe 25-year-old Khelif is on the best run of her amateur career at the Olympics. She has performed solidly at the international level and even won some regional tournaments, but Khelif has never been a dominant fighter on the world stage until her two strong performances -- and 46 seconds of easy work against a third -- to reach the final in Paris.\n\nThe IOC and its president, Thomas Bach, have repeatedly defended the Olympic eligibility of Khelif and fellow boxer Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan while condemning the IBA as incompetent and biased.\n\nKhelif and Lin were disqualified by the IBA in the middle of last year's world championships over what it claimed were failed eligibility tests for the women's competition. The IBA has been banished from the Olympics since before the Tokyo Games, and the body struggled to articulate the reasoning for its decisions on Khelif and Lin at a news conference Monday.\n\nLin also has clinched a medal and advanced to the Olympic semifinals. She fights Esra Yildiz Kahraman of Turkey in the first bout Wednesday night at Roland Garros.\n\nAlgeria's Olympic team has reacted forcefully to the criticism and negative attention around Khelif, and the fan turnout in Roland Garros reflected the seriousness with which the accusations have been received in her home country and in its French diaspora.\n\nChinese Taipei has reacted with equal condemnation of the IBA's claims and the worldwide swirl of scrutiny. Sports officials on Tuesday said they are considering legal action against the IBA after sending a letter protesting \"the International Boxing Association's continued publication of false information, obscuring the facts, and attempting to interfere with the normal conduct of the event regardless of the rights and interests of athletes.\"", "source": {"uri": "daytondailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dayton Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Liu_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yang Liu (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angela Carini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stigma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social stigma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Suwannapheng competed in the final after Khelif's disqualification and won silver.\n\nKhelif and Lin are competing in the Olympics after the International Olympic Committee stripped the IBA of its status as the sport's governing body in 2023 and took control of organizing the boxing in Paris.\n\nThe IOC has rejected the results of the IBA-ordered tests as arbitrary and illegitimate, saying there was no reason to conduct them.\n\nAt these Games, the IOC is using boxing eligibility rules that were applied in the 2016 and 2021 Olympics, which do not include gender testing.\n\nAlgerian fans flocked into a repurposed Court Philippe Chatrier, devoid of its iconic red clay, looking to support Khelif and screamed \"Imane, Imane, Imane\" ahead of the bout, while also booing Suwannapheng on entry.\n\nIn a cautious first round, both boxers attempted to keep their distance and engaged sparingly, but Khelif used her jab to better effect than her Thai opponent.\n\nSuwannapheng connected with a big right hand in the second, but the rangy Algerian's excellent technique allowed her to keep landing shots and sweep the judges' scorecards.\n\nKhelif threw caution to the wind and went after Suwannapheng in the final round, peppering her with jarring shots to claim the win by unanimous decision.\n\nBoth boxers touched gloves in a sign of respect after the fight, and when Khelif was announced as winner, a deafening roar erupted from the fans in attendance.\n\nKhelif waited until her opponent left the ring before celebrating, jogging on the spot with an enormous grin on her face before leaving and shadow-boxing her way to the doctor's station for a quick medical check.\n\nKhelif will face Yang Liu of China in the final on Friday, August 9.\n\nLin also reached the semifinals in the featherweight category, where she will take on Turkey's Esra Yildiz on Wednesday.\n\nThe storm surrounding Khelif and Lin erupted when the Algerian's opponent Angela Carini pulled out of their round of 16 bout last week after just 46 seconds, saying she felt intense pain and feared for her safety after being hit with a barrage of punches.\n\nIn the aftermath of Carini's withdrawal, the gender furore swept social media, with people such as Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling and Tesla founder Elon Musk voicing their opposition to the two boxers competing at the Games.\n\nFollowing the bout, Italian Carini apologized to Khelif and said she did not harbor any ill feeling toward the Algerian. - Rappler.com", "source": {"uri": "rappler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rappler"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unanimous_decision", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unanimous decision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIS_Freestyle_Ski_and_Snowboarding_World_Championships_2023", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIS Freestyle Ski and Snowboarding World Championships 2023"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2022 World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Yu-ting", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lin Yu-ting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_verification_in_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sex verification in sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_governing_body", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports governing body"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Liu_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yang Liu (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carini", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angela Carini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rappler", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rappler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Featherweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Featherweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Suwannapheng competed in the final after Khelif's disqualification and won silver.\n\nKhelif and Lin are competing in the Olympics after the International Olympic Committee stripped the IBA of its status as the sport's governing body in 2023 and took control of organising the boxing in Paris.\n\nThe IOC has rejected the results of the IBA-ordered tests as arbitrary and illegitimate, saying there was no reason to conduct them.\n\nAt these Games, the IOC is using boxing eligibility rules that were applied at the 2016 and 2021 Olympics which do not include gender testing.\n\nFAN SUPPORT\n\nAlgerian fans flocked into a repurposed Court Philippe Chatrier, devoid of its iconic red clay, looking to support Khelif and screamed \"Imane, Imane, Imane\" ahead of the bout, while also booing Suwannapheng on entry.\n\nIn a cautious first round, both boxers attempted to keep their distance and engaged sparingly, but Khelif used her jab to better effect than her Thai opponent.\n\nSuwannapheng connected with a big right hand in the second, but the rangy Algerian's excellent technique allowed her to keep landing shots and sweep the judge's scorecards.\n\nKhelif threw caution to the wind and went after Suwannapheng in the final round, peppering her with jarring shots to claim the win by unanimous decision.\n\nBoth boxers touched gloves in a sign of respect after the fight, and when Khelif was announced as winner a deafening roar erupted from the fans in attendance.\n\n\"I just had the performance I was looking to deliver today to make the fans happy,\" Khelif said.\n\nKhelif waited until her opponent left the ring before celebrating, jogging on the spot with an enormous grin on her face before leaving and shadow-boxing her way to the doctor's station for a quick medical check.\n\n\"I have not followed the controversy closely but all I know is that she is a woman and she is a strong fighter,\" Suwannapheng said.\n\nKhelif will face Yang Liu of China in the final on Friday.\n\nLin also reached the semi-finals in the featherweight category, where she will take on Turkey's Esra Yildiz on Wednesday.\n\nThe storm surrounding Khelif and Lin erupted when the Algerian's opponent Angela Carini pulled out of their round-of-16 bout last week after just 46 seconds, saying she felt intense pain and feared for her safety after being hit with a barrage of punches.\n\nIn the aftermath of Carini's withdrawal, the gender furore swept social media, with people such as Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling and Tesla founder Elon Musk voicing their opposition to the two boxers competing at the Games.\n\nFollowing the bout, Italian Carini apologised to Khelif and said she did not harbour any ill feeling toward the Algerian.\n\n(Reporting by Julien Pretot, Philip O'Connor, Ashraf Hamed Atta, Layli Foroudi and Aadi Nair in Paris; Editing by Toby Davis and Bill Berkrot)", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unanimous_decision", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unanimous decision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Yu-ting", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lin Yu-ting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_verification_in_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sex verification in sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_governing_body", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports governing body"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Liu_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yang Liu (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carini", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angela Carini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Featherweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Featherweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

dominated Suwannapheng to confirm she will get the chance to emulate compatriot Hocine Soltani, who won lightweight gold in 1996.\n\nThe participation of Khelif and Chinese Taipei featherweight Lin Yu-ting has caused an international storm since Khelif beat Angela Carini of Italy in just 46 seconds in her opening bout last Thursday.\n\nBoth Khelif and Lin were disqualified by the International Boxing Association (IBA) during last year's World Championships for failing to meet gender eligibility criteria.\n\nHowever, the IBA, which was was expelled by the International Olympic Commitee (IOC) over financial and corruption concerns, has failed to provide any proof of its findings.\n\nKhelif and Lin were allowed to return to competition by the IOC, which is effectively administering the Paris 2024 boxing tournament in the IBA's absence.\n\nThe case has aroused global interest, with figures such as former United States president Donald Trump and Harry Potter author JK Rowling weighing

Suwannapheng competed in the final after Khelif's disqualification and won silver.\n\nKhelif and Lin are competing in the Olympics after the International Olympic Committee stripped the IBA of its status as the sport's governing body in 2023 and took control of organising the boxing in Paris.\n\nThe IOC has rejected the results of the IBA-ordered tests as arbitrary and illegitimate, saying there was no reason to conduct them.\n\nAt these Games, the IOC is using boxing eligibility rules that were applied at the 2016 and 2021 Olympics which do not include gender testing.\n\nFAN SUPPORT\n\nAlgerian fans flocked into a repurposed Court Philippe Chatrier, devoid of its iconic red clay, looking to support Khelif and screamed \"Imane, Imane, Imane\" ahead of the bout, while also booing Suwannapheng on entry.\n\nIn a cautious first round, both boxers attempted to keep their distance and engaged sparingly, but Khelif used her jab to better effect than her Thai opponent.\n\nSuwannapheng connected with a big right hand in the second, but the rangy Algerian's excellent technique allowed her to keep landing shots and sweep the judge's scorecards.\n\nKhelif threw caution to the wind and went after Suwannapheng in the final round, peppering her with jarring shots to claim the win by unanimous decision.\n\nBoth boxers touched gloves in a sign of respect after the fight, and when Khelif was announced as winner a deafening roar erupted from the fans in attendance.\n\nKhelif waited until her opponent left the ring before celebrating, jogging on the spot with an enormous grin on her face before leaving and shadow-boxing her way to the doctor's station for a quick medical check.\n\nKhelif will face Yang Liu of China in the final on Friday.\n\nLin also reached the semi-finals in the featherweight category, where she will take on Turkey's Esra Yildiz on Wednesday.\n\nThe storm surrounding Khelif and Lin erupted when the Algerian's opponent Angela Carini pulled out of their round-of-16 bout last week after just 46 seconds, saying she felt intense pain and feared for her safety after being hit with a barrage of punches.\n\nIn the aftermath of Carini's withdrawal, the gender furore swept social media, with people such as Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling and Tesla founder Elon Musk voicing their opposition to the two boxers competing at the Games.\n\nFollowing the bout, Italian Carini apologised to Khelif and said she did not harbour any ill feeling toward the Algerian.

disqualified by the International Boxing Association (IBA) during last year's World Championships for failing to meet gender eligibility criteria.\n\nHowever, the IBA, which was was expelled by the International Olympic Commitee (IOC) over financial and corruption concerns, has failed to provide any proof of its findings.\n\nOn Monday, an IBA press conference descended into farce as controversial president Umar Kremlev made baseless claims about Lin and Khelif and launched an astonishing tirade against IOC president Thomas Bach.\n\nKhelif and Lin were allowed to return to competition by the IOC, which is effectively administering the Paris 2024 boxing tournament in the IBA's absence.\n\nThe case has aroused global interest, with figures such as former United States

I'm here to compete and get a good result,\" Khelif told SNTV via The Metro.\n\n\"I send a message to all the people of the world to uphold the Olympic principles and the Olympic Charter to refrain from bullying all athletes because this has massive effects. It can destroy people, it can kill people's thoughts, spirit and mind. It can divide people. And because of that, I ask them to refrain from bullying.\"\n\nMORE: IBA endangers Olympic boxing's future | Imane's latest opponent bigger than her sport\n\nThe 23-year-old Suwannapheng advanced to the semifinal stages thanks to a points win over Turkey's Busenaz Surmeneli.

Algerian supporters turned the normally genteel surroundings of Phillippe-Chatrier Court at Roland Garros into a cauldron of noise as boxer Imane Khelif sealed her place in the Olympic women's welterweight final.\n\nChants of \"Imane\" tumbled down from the stands as Khelif, who is one of two boxers at the centre of a gender eligibility row, dominated her opponent Janjaem Suwannapheng of Thailand to confirm she will get the chance to emulate compatriot Hocine Soltani, who won lightweight gold in 1996.\n\nThe participation of Khelif and Chinese Taipei featherweight Lin Yu-ting has caused an international storm since Khelif beat Angela Carini of Italy in just 46 seconds in her opening bout last Thursday.\n\nBoth Khelif and Lin were disqualified by the International Boxing Association (IBA) during last year's World Championships for failing to meet gender eligibility criteria.\n\nHowever, the IBA, which was was expelled by the International Olympic Commitee (IOC) over financial and corruption concerns, has failed to provide any proof of its findings.\n\nOn Monday, an IBA press conference descended into farce as controversial president Umar Kremlev made baseless claims about Lin and Khelif and launched an astonishing tirade against IOC president Thomas Bach.\n\nKhelif and Lin were allowed to return to competition by the IOC, which is effectively administering the Paris 2024 boxing tournament in the IBA's absence.\n\nThe case has aroused global interest, with figures such as former United States president Donald Trump and Harry Potter author JK Rowling weighing in on the issue.\n\nKhelif won every round on the judges' cards, appearing close to securing a stoppage at times, and celebrated with a victory jig in the ring as the Algerian supporters

The echoes in cavernous Roland-Garros were far louder than tiny North Paris Arena, where Khelif's Olympic journey began.\n\nAlgerian flags lined Roland-Garros' lower sections, and Khelif entered the arena second, to the night's loudest cheers and deafening chants of \"I-MANE.\" Wearing blue trunks and top, she stormed into the arena, punching the air. Khelif and Suwannapheng tapped gloves at the center of the ring, and the fight began.\n\nIn Round 1, Khelif once again used her reach advantage, keeping Suwannapheng at a distance before landing jabs. Suwannapheng spent much of the early part of the round in a defensive crouch, and the crowd, sensing her conservatism, tried to rally Khelif with loud chants of \"I-MANE.\" With just over a minute remaining in the round, Khelif charged in and caught Suwannapheng in a clinch, forcing the referee to step in and break up the pair. Khelif won the first round 10-9 on all five judges' cards.\n\nRound 2 began with Khelif again taking the fight to Suwannapheng, but this time Suwannapheng fought back, charging inside Khelif's reach to land a few early blows. Seventy-five seconds into the round, Khelif caught Suwannapheng with a hard uppercut that seemed to stagger her. Suwannapheng's counterpunches became wilder, most failing to land. The two again tapped gloves as the round ended. Khelif again won the round 10-9 on all cards.\n\nIn the final round, Suwannapheng took an aggressive tack right from the start, appearing to stagger Khelif while also clutching at her. Khelif landed some powerful roundhouse blows to the side of Suwannapheng's head, and even lost her balance in her aggressive attack. Referee Shawn Reese of the United States let the fighters clinch, and as the seconds wound down, Khelif used the maneuver to sap Suwannapheng's energy. Knowing she needed a knockout, Suwannapheng charged straight into Khelif's jabs. But it wasn't enough, and the judges gave Khelif another 10-9 win as the crowd roared. Khelif danced and grinned in the middle of the ring, to the delight of the crowd.\n\nKhelif and Chinese Taipei's Lin Yu-ting, who is scheduled to fight tomorrow night in the 57kg semifinals,, stand at the center of a complex controversy over gender and eligibility, a story fraught with politics, bureaucracy, misinformation and varying applications of science. Khelif has been in the world's spotlight ever since her first bout last Thursday, when her opponent, Italy's Angela Carini, tapped out after just 46 seconds.\n\nCarini tearfully complained after the fight that Khelif's punches were too hard. That charge quickly sparked a worldwide firestorm as Khelif and Lin had failed gender qualification tests administered by the International Boxing Association in 2022 and 2023. In a coincidental reunion, Khelif had beaten Suwannapheng, Tuesday night's Olympic opponent, in the semifinals of the 2023 world championships before being disqualified by the IBA.\n\nHowever, since the International Olympic Committee had severed ties with the IBA and no longer recognizes it as a legitimate boxing authority, the tests did not come into play when determining the boxers' eligibility for these Olympics. Instead, in the absence of any independent regulatory authority, the IOC dismissed the IBA's tests out of hand and instead relied on the boxers' passports to determine their gender eligibility. Both boxers were born female and have lived as females their entire lives, and the IOC has maintained that this is the only necessary metric for judging their qualifications.\n\nThe IBA attempted to explain the specifics of its tests and the rationale behind them in a hastily-called Monday press conference, but any useful information the organization could have shared was drowned out by a chaotic cascade of grievances and rants against the IOC.

John Locher/Associated Press\n\nPARIS -- Boxer Imane Khelif of Algeria has advanced to the gold-medal bout in the women's welterweight division with a semifinal victory at the Paris Olympics on Tuesday night amid scrutiny over misconceptions about her gender.\n\nKhelif defeated Janjaem Suwannapheng of Thailand 5:0 in the semifinals at Roland Garros, where the crowd roared and chanted her name throughout her three-round fight. Khelif has won three consecutive bouts in Paris, and she will win either a gold or a silver medal when she completes the tournament on Friday.\n\nKhelif had already clinched Algeria's first medal in women's boxing before she stepped into the ring to rousing roars at Court Philippe Chatrier.\n\nShe controlled her bout with Suwannapheng, who took a standing eight-count late in the third after absorbing a series of punches. Khelif has won every round on every judge's card in her two fights that have gone the distance in Paris.\n\nAfter hugging Suwannapheng, Khelif celebrated in the ring, running wildly in place while pumping her fists as the crowd roared for her. With one more victory, Khelif would win Algeria's second boxing gold medal, joining Hocine Soltani (1996).\n\nThe ending of Khelif's first bout in Paris propelled her into the center of a worldwide divide over gender identity and safety regulations in sports. Her first opponent, Angela Carini of Italy, tearfully quit after just 46 seconds, saying she was in too much pain from Khelif's punches.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarini's abandonment of the fight led to comments from the likes of former U.S. President Donald Trump, \"Harry Potter\" writer J.K. Rowling and others falsely claiming Khelif was a man or transgender.\n\nIn an interview with SNTV, a sports video partner of The Associated Press, Khelif said the wave of hateful scrutiny she is facing \"harms human dignity\" and called for an end to bullying athletes.\n\nKhelif also said she felt the \"best response\" to the uproar around her would be to win a gold medal - and now she's one win away from claiming it.\n\nKhelif entered the ring against Suwannapheng to cheers echoing through the famed tennis arena. Roland Garros welcomed a prominent turnout from Algerian fans voicing their national pride in a boxer whose stigmatization by the Olympic-banished International Boxing Association has been taken very personally in her country.\n\nBoth fighters came out aggressively, trading punches from distance. Khelif was more accurate while winning the first round on all five cards, and she repeated the performance in the second.\n\nThe fight got more physical in the third, with Suwannapheng pushing forward to make a comeback. The bout was stopped for a standing eight-count late in the third when Suwannapheng absorbed a few head punches in succession, although Suwannapheng appeared to shrug as if it wasn't necessary - as is often the case in Olympic boxing, where referees can stop a bout for relatively minor reasons.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nRelated Stories Latest Articles", "source": {"uri": "pressherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Portland Press Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angela Carini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hocine_Soltani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hocine Soltani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

the Paris Olympics won her semi-final on Tuesday to guarantee at least a silver medal in front of a raucous Roland Garros crowd that chanted her name.\n\nImane Khelif defeated Thailand's 2023 world silver medallist Janjaem Suwannapheng in a unanimous points decision to march into Friday's final in the women's 66kg category.\n\nTaiwan's Lin Yu-ting, the other boxer in the eye of a storm over her eligibility, is herself sure to take home at least bronze at a different weight.\n\nThe 25-year-old Khelif and Lin both fought at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago but there was no controversy at the time and neither won a medal.\n\nBoth were disqualified from last year's world championships after failing gender eligibility tests, but were cleared to compete in Paris.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKhelif was given the biggest roar of the night as she entered the arena at Roland Garros, usually home to Grand Slam tennis but hosting Olympic boxing and a sizeable number of Algerian fans with flags.\n\nCries of \"Imane, Imane\" rang out repeatedly before and during the bout.\n\nThe Thai Janjaem, who had a clear height disadvantage, took a standing count in the third round after feeling the full power of the superior Algerian.\n\nAt the end of the fight at the 15,000-seated Court Philippe-Chatrier, which was close to capacity, the two fighters greeted each other warmly and shook hands.\n\nKhelif did a dance in the middle of the ring, to more roars of approval.\n\nShe faces Yang Liu for gold after the Chinese boxer beat Taiwan's Chen Nien-chin in the other semi-final on points.\n\nThe gender controversy ignited when Khelif defeated Angela Carini in 46 seconds in her opening bout in the French capital, the Italian reduced to tears and abandoning the fight after suffering a badly hurt nose.\n\nThe 2023 world championships, from which Lin and Khelif were expelled, were run by the International Boxing Association (IBA) but the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is organising the sport at the Games because of financial, governance and ethical concerns at the IBA.\n\nThe IBA's Kremlin-linked president Umar Kremlev claimed at a chaotic press conference on Monday that both fighters had \"genetic testing that shows that these are men\".\n\nThe IOC has leapt to the defence of Khelif and Lin, with president Thomas Bach saying they were born and raised as women, and have passports saying that.\n\nThe 28-year-old Lin fights in the semi-finals of the women's 57kg division on Wednesday.\n\n- \u00a9 AFP 2024", "source": {"uri": "the42.ie", "dataType":

Suwannapheng competed in the final after Khelif's disqualification and won silver.\n\nKhelif and Lin are competing in the Olympics after the International Olympic Committee stripped the IBA of its status as the sport's governing body in 2023 and took control of organising the boxing in Paris.\n\nThe IOC has rejected the results of the IBA-ordered tests as arbitrary and illegitimate, saying there was no reason to conduct them.\n\nAt these Games, the IOC is using boxing eligibility rules that were applied at the 2016 and 2021 Olympics which do not include gender testing.\n\nAlgerian fans flocked into a repurposed Court Philippe Chatrier, devoid of its iconic red clay, looking to support Khelif and screamed \"Imane, Imane, Imane\" ahead of the bout, while also booing Suwannapheng on entry.\n\nIn a cautious first round, both boxers attempted to keep their distance and engaged sparingly, but Khelif used her jab to better effect than her Thai opponent.\n\nSuwannapheng connected with a big right hand in the second, but the rangy Algerian's excellent technique allowed her to keep landing shots and sweep the judge's scorecards.\n\nKhelif threw caution to the wind and went after Suwannapheng in the final round, peppering her with jarring shots to claim the win by unanimous decision.\n\nBoth boxers touched gloves in a sign of respect after the fight, and when Khelif was announced as winner a deafening roar erupted from the fans in attendance.\n\n\"I just had the performance I was looking to deliver today to make the fans happy,\" Khelif said.\n\nKhelif waited until her opponent left the ring before celebrating, jogging on the spot with an enormous grin on her face before leaving and shadow-boxing her way to the doctor's station for a quick medical check.\n\n\"I have not followed the controversy closely but all I know is that she is a woman and she is a strong fighter,\" Suwannapheng said.\n\nKhelif will face Yang Liu of China in the final on Friday.\n\nLin also reached the semi-finals in the featherweight category, where she will take on Turkey's Esra Yildiz on Wednesday.\n\nThe storm surrounding Khelif and Lin erupted when the Algerian's opponent Angela Carini pulled out of their round-of-16 bout last week after just 46 seconds, saying she felt intense pain and feared for her safety after being hit with a barrage of punches.\n\nIn the aftermath of Carini's withdrawal, the gender furore swept social media, with people such as Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling and Tesla founder Elon Musk voicing their opposition to the two boxers competing at the Games.\n\nFollowing the bout, Italian Carini apologised to Khelif and said she did not harbour any ill feeling toward the Algerian.\n\n(Reporting by Julien Pretot, Philip O'Connor, Ashraf Hamed Atta, Layli Foroudi and Aadi Nair in Paris; Editing by Toby Davis and Bill Berkrot)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@theprint.in", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIS_Freestyle_Ski_and_Snowboarding_World_Championships_2023", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIS Freestyle Ski and Snowboarding World Championships 2023"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unanimous_decision", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unanimous decision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_governing_body", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports governing body"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jab", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_verification_in_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sex verification in sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Liu_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yang Liu (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carini", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angela Carini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Featherweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Featherweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Khelif has won three consecutive bouts in Paris, and she will win either a gold or a silver medal when she completes the tournament on Friday.\n\nKhelif had already clinched Algeria's first medal in women's boxing before she stepped into the ring to rousing roars at Court Philippe Chatrier.\n\nShe controlled her bout with Suwannapheng, who took a standing 8-count late in the third after absorbing a series of punches. Khelif has won every round on every judge's card in her two fights that have gone the distance in Paris.\n\nAfter hugging Suwannapheng, Khelif celebrated in the ring, running wildly in place while pumping her fists as the crowd roared for her.\n\nWith one more victory, Khelif would win Algeria's second boxing gold medal, joining Hocine Soltani (1996).\n\nThe ending of Khelif's first bout in Paris propelled her into the center of a worldwide divide over gender identity and safety regulations in sports. Her first opponent, Angela Carini of Italy, tearfully quit after just 46 seconds, saying she was in too much pain from Khelif's punches.\n\nCarini's abandonment of the fight led to comments from the likes of former U.S. President Donald Trump, \"Harry Potter\" writer J.K. Rowling and others falsely claiming Khelif was a man or transgender.\n\nIn an interview with SNTV, a sports video partner of The Associated Press, Khelif said the wave of hateful scrutiny she is facing \"harms human dignity\" and called for an end to bullying athletes.\n\nKhelif also said she felt the \"best response\" to the uproar around her would be to win a gold medal -- and now she's one win away from claiming it.\n\nKhelif entered the ring against Suwannapheng to cheers echoing through the famed tennis arena. Roland Garros welcomed a prominent turnout from Algerian fans voicing their national pride in a boxer whose stigmatization by the Olympic-banished International Boxing Association has been taken very personally in her country.\n\nBoth fighters came out aggressively, trading punches from distance. Khelif was more accurate while winning the first round on all five cards, and she repeated the performance in the second.\n\nThe fight got more physical in the third, with Suwannapheng pushing forward to make a comeback. The bout was stopped for a standing 8-count late in the third when Suwannapheng absorbed a few head punches in succession, although Suwannapheng appeared to shrug as if it wasn't necessary -- as is often the case in Olympic boxing, where referees can stop a bout for relatively minor reasons.\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "greg_beacham@register-herald.com", "name": "Greg Beacham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angela Carini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hocine_Soltani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hocine Soltani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

her semi-final on Tuesday to guarantee at least a silver medal in front of a raucous Roland Garros crowd that chanted her name.\n\nImane Khelif defeated Thailand's 2023 world silver medallist Janjaem Suwannapheng in a unanimous points decision to march into Friday's final in the women's 66kg category.\n\nTaiwan's Lin Yu-ting, the other boxer in the eye of a storm over her eligibility, is herself sure to take home at least bronze at a different weight.\n\nThe 25-year-old Khelif and Lin both fought at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago but there was no controversy at the time and neither won a medal.\n\nBoth were disqualified from last year's world championships after failing gender eligibility tests, but were cleared to compete in Paris.\n\nKhelif was given the biggest roar of the night as she entered the arena at Roland Garros, usually home to Grand Slam tennis but hosting Olympic boxing and a sizeable number of Algerian fans with flags.\n\nCries of \"Imane, Imane\" rang out repeatedly before and during the bout.\n\nThe Thai, who had a clear height disadvantage, took a standing count in the third round after feeling the full power of the superior Algerian.\n\nAt the end of the fight at the 15,000-seated Court Philippe-Chatrier, which was close to capacity, the two fighters greeted each other warmly and shook hands.\n\nKhelif did a dance in the middle of the ring, to more roars of approval.\n\nKhelif faces China's Yang Liu or Taiwan's Chen Nien-chin for gold.\n\nThe gender controversy ignited when Khelif defeated Angela Carini in 46 seconds in her opening bout in the French capital, the Italian reduced to tears and abandoning the fight after suffering a badly hurt nose.\n\nThe 2023 world championships, from which Lin and Khelif were expelled, were run by the International Boxing Association (IBA) but the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is organising the sport at the Games because of financial, governance and ethical concerns at the IBA.\n\nThe IBA's Kremlin-linked president Umar Kremlev claimed at a chaotic press conference on Monday that both fighters had \"genetic testing that shows that these are men\".\n\nThe IOC has leapt to the defence of Khelif and Lin, with president Thomas Bach saying they were born and raised as women, and have passports saying that.\n\nThe 28-year-old Lin fights in the semi-finals of the women's 57kg division on Wednesday.\n\nLatest on SportstarParis 2024 Olympics: Algerian boxer in Olympic gender row, Imane Khelif, marches into final AFPParis 2024 Olympics: Brazil stuns Spain to reach women's football final

For more of our coverage from the games head to our latest updates.\n\nPARIS -- Imane Khelif, the Algerian boxer at the center of political controversy over participation in women's sports, will compete for the Olympic gold medal in women's boxing.\n\nAway from Paris, criticism has erupted over the past week around Khelif's participation in the Olympics amid claims that she failed two gender eligibility tests administered by a boxing federation -- tests that Olympic officials have dismissed as \"illegitimate\" as they have defended her participation.\n\nBut in the stands of Roland-Garros Stadium, dozens of Algerian flags hung over the seats, as hundreds of men and women dressed in green and red cheered raucously for Khelif.\n\nOver three rounds in the ring Tuesday, Khelif traded blows with her opponent, Thailand's Janjaem Suwannapheng, in the 66kg weight class semifinal. With her win (a unanimous decision by the five judges), Khelif is set to compete Friday in the gold medal match, in which she will face China's Yang Liu.\n\n\"I don't care about criticism. I care about competition. God willing, I will perform well in the final,\" Khelif told reporters after Tuesday's bout. \"I will do everything I can to make it enjoyable to watch around the world.\"\n\nAfter the official raised her hand to declare her victory, Khelif danced joyfully in the ring as Algerian fans roared their approval.\n\nThe political controversy around Khelif that erupted over the past week centers on a decision last year by the International Boxing Association to disqualify her and another female boxer from some competitions by claiming that they had failed two unspecified gender eligibility tests. The second boxer, Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan, is also competing in the Olympics.\n\nKhelif, 25, is a woman and has competed for years in women's boxing, in which she has accumulated a typical record of wins and losses against her female competition.\n\n\"They were born as girls, registered as female passports, have fought at the senior level for six years with no issues,\" International Olympic Committee spokesperson Mark Adams said on Sunday.\n\nBut the Russia-linked boxing federation has refused to release any details about those tests, and the disqualification was announced shortly after Khelif defeated a Russian boxer.\n\nIn a chaotic press conference Monday, IBA officials raised more questions than they answered about the tests. IBA president Umar Kremlev, speaking by videoconference from Russia, said through a translator that their tests had shown elevated levels of testosterone -- but that claim directly contradicted a previous statement from the IBA that said the boxers had not undergone a testosterone exam.\n\nThe IOC says the IBA shared the results of the tests, which Olympic officials have denounced as they continue to defend the boxers' participation.\n\n\"The method of the testing, the idea of the testing -- which kind of happened overnight -- none of it was legitimate,\" Adams said. The IOC broke ties with the IBA last year over long-standing concerns about corruption.\n\nStill, the controversy has led to a swell of harassment online targeted at Khelif and Lin, who will compete in her own semifinal in a different weight class on Wednesday. Earlier in the tournament, Algerian Olympic officials filed a complaint with the IOC to protest harmful posts made online by one of Khelif's competitors; the IOC ordered the competitor to remove them.\n\n\"It can destroy people, it can kill people's thoughts, spirit and mind. It can divide people. And because of that, I ask them to refrain from bullying,\" Khelif said Sunday in an interview with SNTV, a sports news service.\n\nAt the stadium, fans of Algeria said they rejected the claims against Khelif and decried the online harassment that has surrounded her. \"I think she is really brave to get into the ring today despite the relentless campaign against her,\" said Abdelslam Afs. \"We are all here to support her.\"\n\nAnother fan, the Algiers-born Yacine Bouzydy, said he originally hadn't planned to attend Tuesday's bout, as he doesn't closely follow sports. But when he heard about the controversy surrounding Khelif, he decided to attend to show his support and \"give her energy,\" he said.\n\n\"Algeria is quite a conservative country to France and to other European countries. But for this specific story, the role has changed somehow,\" he said.\n\n\"I can imagine that it was very, very hard for her to go beyond this and to compete and to win the bronze medal, at least,\" Bouzydy said. \"I hope it will end with a gold medal. And even if not, Algerian people are very happy.\"", "source": {"uri": "bpr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "bpr.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

At least 50 flags in support of Khelif were draped around the 15,000-capacity arena, which saved its biggest roar for the contentious showdown.\n\nFor fair sport campaigners, this has been a saga with only losers as Khelif now closes in on gold despite allegedly failing two sex tests in 2022 and 2023.\n\nNot much more to add on the fight really. Suwannapheng fought bravely but in truth she was several levels below her opponent this evening. Whatever you may think of Khelif's participation in this Olympics, it's hard to argue that she is not a talented fighter.\n\n...no surprise. IMANE KHELIF WINS! The Algerian crowd go wild. Suwannapheng is gracious in defeat.\n\nOne-two combination from Khelif. She has not had to get out of second or third gear here...so far at least. Suwannapheng's attack is fast and furious but the Algerian looks unflustered to say the least.\n\nKhelif giving the Sugar Ray Leonard-esque dance on the spot. Suwannapheng is then asked to get through a standing count after taking a heavy shot.\n\nThere's the bell. Whatever your thoughts, that was a clinic.\n\nSuwannapheng knows she likely lost that round and is straight on the front foot but the size of Khelif is a real problem. Down low she can only really target the body with any venom and as yet Kehlif has shown taking those shots to no problem whatsoever.\n\nTough to say Khelif has really gone for it in this fight yet but her work is tidy, neat and as yet seemingly enough to pick up points and through that rounds.\n\nSuwannapheng lands a nice combination, the Thai fighter knows she needs to go out and win this rather than rest on her laurels.\n\nCagey start here. Khelif is the larger of the fighters and thus it makes sense to see her attacking from distance. Suwannapheng does look confident though as she looks to get inside after getting Khelif to miss on a long jab.\n\nKhelif gets a warning for pulling Suwannapheng's head down in the clinch. You feel the Algerian has another couple of gears to go to here, it just depends on when she decides to utilise them.\n\nSuwannapheng takes a heavy shot as she takes a risk in going after Khelif in the closing stages of that round.\n\n...the bell sounds and we are underway.\n\n...tough to make out any boos. If there were any they were certainly drowned out by cheers - loud cheers at that.\n\n\"Khelif, Khelif, Khelif,\" chants ring out. French-Algerians once again show up in raucous scenes for Khelif, this time at Roland Garros. Hundreds waving flags dotted around the arena. No doubt which is the big ticket fight here.\n\nOr at least that appears to be the case at this point. Discovery/Eurosport are carrying it of course.\n\n...it's Imane Khelif against Thailand's Janjaem Suwannapheng.\n\n...Buse Naz \u00c7ak&inodot;ro&gbreve;lu is the clear winner. Wu Yu will have her hands full in the final with the impressive Turkish boxer.\n\n..stretched away in this bout. His hand speed and footwork are clearly a cut above. Would be very surprised if this was anything less than a unanimous decision.\n\nDecent first round between \u00c7ak&inodot;ro&gbreve;lu and Villegas in the second semi-final. The Turkish boxer has a wicked left hook which has caught the Phillipino out on a few occasions.\n\nAnd it's China's Wu Yu who comes out on top. The third round brought that fight very close on the scorecards but that's another example of the fine margins in amateur boxing.\n\nYu and Kyzaibay are into the final round of the first semi-final in the women's flyweight and for me the Kazakh who looks to have been the more active throughout.\n\n\"It's devastating, it's raw. I've stepped out the ring moments ago so emotions are very high. Obviously disappointed to miss out on the final and box for a gold on Friday night.\n\n\"Initial disappointment but I hope to look back and be really proud of what I have achieved because I have created history within my city, Colchester. I'm the only British boxer to medal at these Games so hopefully I will look back with pride and happiness in the future.\n\n\"It's hard to say at this moment [if the fight went to plan] I've just stepped out the ring, I'll have to go back and analyse it but it was close, it was a 3-2 split decision.\n\n\"Two of the judges went for me, three went against me, every round was competitive and close and that's amateur boxing. It's just a flip of the coin sometimes and in this case it didn't go my way.\n\n\"It's been an amazing experience, I'm so grateful for everyone who has helped me along the way.\n\n\"It's been an amazing journey, I have been boxing for 12, 13 years and the amount of people and support I have had throughout those years has been so influential in me achieving what I have achieved tonight, creating history for myself, my family and my city.\n\n\"Even talking now brings pride but I'm a winner and it obviously is disappointing not to be able to box for the gold on Friday.\n\n\"I don't know [how hometown - Colchester - will react], we will soon find out next week! I need to sort of lick my wounds for the moment, go back to the village tonight and probably drown my sorrows. I've been dieting like crazy to make the weight. The weight is a challenge for me.\n\n\"Drown my sorrows and eat some cake and just look back and hopefully celebrate. Not dwell on the loss but celebrate the win because I have had two fantastic wins out here. Support from Great Britain has been amazing. I'm proud but also disappointed.\"\n\nHmmmm not sure I agree with that. But hey, I'm not in the chair so who cares what I think. It's bronze for Lewis Richardson. It will be interesting to see what he has to say after that.\n\nRichardson awarded a 4-1 victory in that last round by the judges. Just three more minutes now. A gold-medal bout is in his grasp.\n\nThe Briton lands a nice combination, dancing in and out of range of the Mexican. Richardson lands another scoring shot, his work rate both in attack and defence has maintained well through this fight.\n\nThis fight is on a knife edge heading into the final minute. The last few scoring shots here will be vital - which Richardson lands.\n\nSurely Richardson has this...though you never know with Olympic boxing.\n\nVerde's all-out attacking style has Richardson doubting himself a touch you feel. That's better though, as Richardson lands a lovely counter which snaps the head of Richardson back. A bit of swelling starting to show underneath Richardson's left eye.\n\nRichardson is growing into this round. Verde looks like he's running on empty touch, his shots look more ragged than in the opening round and a half.\n\nTight round. That one's anyone's guess.\n\nTwo southpaws facing off here. Verde lands the more convincing early shot, including a neat short right hook which finds the mark on Richardson's chin. The Mexican is on the front foot here, Richardson is not utilising his reach advantage to the best effect but does get a good left hand in over the top.\n\nWild from Verde, leading to a decent shot from the Briton. Verde hits back though as another right hand lands. Nice clash of styles...a traditional Mexican brawler against a more fluid counter-puncher.\n\nIt's been a disappointing Olympics for GB boxing but the man from Colchester has the chance to make it one to remember. A spot to fight for the gold medal is on the line.\n\nAs you might have already read, tonight's fights are being held on Court Phillipe Chatrier at Roland-Garros rather than the North Paris Arena. That was always the plan for the semi-finals and finals of the respective weight categories.\n\n...has come to an end. For my money that's a win for Asadkhuja Muydinkhujaev. Omari Jones is a real talent but he looked a little ragged through those three rounds.\n\nAND IT IS THE UZBEK BY SPLIT DECISION. He will face either Lewis Richardson or Marco Verde for the gold medal.\n\nThat fight follows next.\n\nAs already mentioned, the IBA press conference about Imane Khelif, held yesterday in Paris, was a sight and a sound for sore eyes. Heavily delayed, technically deficient and featuring at least one individual who arguably did more to undermine the credibility of the organisation than the very fact that the IOC has cut ties with it.\n\nCatch up with everything that happened HERE.\n\n...here at Roland-Garros this evening. Lewis Richardson faces Mexico's Marco Verde in the second semi-final in the men's welterweight.\n\nThe first semi-final, between Omari Jones of the USA and Uzbekistan's Asadkhuja Muydinkhujaev, is already underway.\n\nThe firestorm engulfing Imane Khelif at this Olympic Games has been relentless, exhausting, confusing and everything in between. So it gives me great pleasure to advise you all to saddle up because it's about to kick into gear again.\n\nThe Algerian faces Janjaem Suwannapheng in the semi-final of the women's welterweight this evening as he closes in on what would be a second gold medal for her nation at these games.\n\nSome will say that is all this evening is about. Others vehemently disagree. Like it or not, it's impossible to ignore the spectre of the failed gender eligibility test that has overshadowed her campaign.\n\nEven after the organisation that administered that test, the IBA, undermined its credibility with a shambolic and rhetoric-fuelled press conference on Monday, controversy still swirls.\n\nAmid all of this, there are Olympic medals on the line and so it would feel remiss to not spend any time whatsoever on the fight itself.\n\nKhelif and Suwannapheng met in the same stage of the 2023 world championships, with the Algerian coming out on top before her disqualification for failing the aforementioned gender test.\n\nThe winner will face either Taiwan's Chen Nien-chin or China's Yang Liu in Friday's final, with both losers being awarded bronze medals, as is the way in the single-elimination tournament that is Olympic boxing.\n\nA Khelif victory, of any kind, will surely ramp up the rhetoric yet further and she is a heavy favourite - as short as &frac16; with some oddsmakers - to the gold medal.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It's not clear under what criteria made for a failed test, -- which came after Khelif beat a Russian opponent -- was administered.\n\nIn an interview with SNTV on Sunday, Khelif spoke in Arabic about the backlash she's faced, while declining to answer whether she had undergone tests aside from doping tests.\n\n\"I send a message to all the people of the world to uphold the Olympic principles and the Olympic Charter, to refrain from bullying all athletes, because this has effects, massive effects,\" Khelif said, as translated by the Associated Press. \"It can destroy people, it can kill people's thoughts, spirit and mind. It can divide people. And because of that, I ask them to refrain from bullying.\"\n\nKhelif burst into tears upon clinching at least a bronze medal with her win over Hungary's Anna Luca Hamori, telling reporters that she is female.\n\nSince Olympic boxing does not have third-place bouts, both Khelif and Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting -- another female boxer who failed the IBA's gender test -- were guaranteed medals before today's semifinals.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angela Carini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Yu-ting", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lin Yu-ting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arabic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_verification_in_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex verification in sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Charter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Charter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drug test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/thailands-janjaem-suwannapheng-left-fights-87166937.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796155", "eventUri": "eng-9796155", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

For more of our coverage from the games head to our latest updates.\n\nPARIS -- Imane Khelif, the Algerian boxer at the center of political controversy over participation in women's sports, will compete for the Olympic gold medal in women's boxing.\n\nOutside of Paris, criticism has erupted over the past week around Khelif's participation in the Olympics amid claims that she failed two gender eligibility tests administered by a boxing federation -- tests that Olympic officials have dismissed as \"illegitimate\" as they have defended her participation.\n\nBut in the stands of Roland-Garros Stadium, dozens of Algerian flags hung over the seats, as hundreds of men and women dressed in green and red cheered raucously for Khelif.\n\nOver three rounds in the ring Tuesday, Khelif traded blows with her opponent, Thailand's Janjaem Suwannapheng, in the 66kg weight class semifinal.\n\nWith her win, she is set to compete Friday in the gold medal match.\n\nAfter the official raised her hand to mark her victory, Khelif danced joyfully in the ring as Algerian fans roared their approval.\n\nThe political controversy around Khelif that erupted over the past week centers on a decision last year by the International Boxing Association to disqualify her and another female boxer from some competitions by claiming that they had failed two unspecified gender eligibility tests. The second boxer, Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan, is also competing in the Olympics.\n\nKhelif, 25, is a woman and has competed for years in women's boxing, in which she has accumulated a typical record of wins and losses against her female competition.\n\n\"They were born as girls, registered as female passports, have fought at the senior level for six years with no issues,\" International Olympic Committee spokesperson Mark Adams said on Sunday.\n\nBut the Russia-linked boxing federation has refused to release any details about those tests, and the disqualification was announced shortly after Khelif defeated a Russian boxer.\n\nIn a chaotic press conference Monday, IBA officials raised more questions than they answered about the tests. IBA president Umar Kremlev, speaking by videoconference from Russia, said through a translator that their tests had shown elevated levels of testosterone -- but that claim directly contradicted a previous statement from the IBA that said the boxers had not undergone a testosterone exam.\n\nThe IOC says the IBA shared the results of the test Olympic officials have denounced and continue to defend the boxers' participation.\n\n\"The method of the testing, the idea of the testing -- which kind of happened overnight -- none of it was legitimate,\" Adams said. The IOC broke ties with the IBA last year over long-standing concerns about corruption.\n\nStill, the controversy has led to a swell of harassment online targeted at Khelif and Lin, who will compete in her own semifinal in a different weight class on Wednesday.\n\n\"It can destroy people, it can kill people's thoughts, spirit and mind. It can divide people. And because of that, I ask them to refrain from bullying,\" Khelif said Sunday in an interview with SNTV, a sports news service.\n\nAt the stadium, fans of Algeria said they rejected the claims against Khelif and decried the online harassment that has surrounded her. \"I think she is really brave to get into the ring today despite the relentless campaign against her,\" said Abdelslam Afs. \"We are all here to support her.\"\n\nAnother fan, the Algiers-born Yacine Bouzydy, said he originally hadn't planned to attend Tuesday's bout, as he doesn't closely follow sports. But when he heard about the controversy surrounding Khelif, he decided to attend to show his support and \"give her energy,\" he said.\n\n\"Algeria is quite a conservative country to France and to other European countries. But for this specific story, the role has changed somehow,\" he said.\n\n\"I can imagine that it was very, very hard for her to go beyond this and to compete and to win the bronze medal, at least,\" Bouzydy said. \"I hope it will end with a gold medal. And even if not, Algerian people are very happy.\"", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "becky_sullivan@npr.org", "name": "Becky Sullivan", "type":

According to the results of the tests, it was proved that they have XY chromosomes. Such athletes were excluded from competition,\" Kremlev said.\n\nKhelif was jubilant after the victory.\n\nKhelif's previous two victories included an opening bout against Italy's Angela Carini that lasted all of 46 seconds before the Italian quit the match, citing her Algerian opponent's \"power.\"\n\nAfter the fight, Carini told Italy's ASNA: \"I'm used to suffering. I've never taken a punch like that; it's impossible to continue. I'm nobody to say it's illegal.\n\n\"I got into the ring to fight. But I didn't feel like it anymore after the first minute. I started to feel a strong pain in my nose. I didn't give up, but a punch hurt too much and, so I said enough. I'm leaving with my head held high.\"\n\nKhelif's next victim was Hungary's Anna Luca Hamori. The fight went the distance, but the judges gave Khelif a 5-0 comprehensive victory.\n\nInternational outrage has erupted after each of Khelif's victories. However, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) backs the Alegerian and insists that all gender requirements to compete as a female have been met.\n\n\"Everyone competing in the women's category is complying with the competition eligibility rules,\" IOC spokesperson Mark Adams said. \"They are women in their passports, and it's stated that this is the case.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dylan_gwinn@breitbart.com", "name": "Dylan Gwinn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Yu-ting", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lin Yu-ting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_verification_in_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sex verification in sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umar_Kremlev", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Umar Kremlev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carini", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angela Carini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Women", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/08/Matthew-Stockman_Getty-Images-4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796155", "eventUri": "eng-9796155", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

semi-final on Tuesday night (local time).\n\nKhelif, who has been as the centre of a global storm over questions about her gender, beat Thailand's Janjaem Suwannapheng in front of a parochial crowd at Roland Garros.\n\nThousands of Algerian fans turned out to support the 25-year-old.\n\nThey cheered \"Imane, Imane, Imane\" as she walked out to fight and released a deafening roar when she was declared the winner.\n\nThe result was almost certain after Khelif delivered her opponent a brutal blow in the third round that forced the referee to deliver a standing eight count.\n\nKhelif has been subject to a torrent of abuse since her round-of-16 bout against Italy's Angela Carini last week.\n\nThe match ended prematurely when Carini withdrew after 46 seconds, saying she feared for her life.\n\nThe incident sparked massive outrage and reignited a bitter feud between the International Olympic Committee and the International Boxing Association, which had disqualified Khelif and Taiwan's Li Lu-Ting from last year's world championship after they failed gender eligibility tests.\n\nThe IOC last year permanently stripped the IBA's Olympic accreditation over governance concerns that had dogged the organisation and its president Umar Kremlev, a close associate of Russian president Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe IOC took control of the boxing tournament at the Paris Games and deemed Khelif and Lu-Ting eligible to compete based on the fact they have passports stating they are female.\n\nIOC spokesman Mark Adams rejected the IBA's testing regime, describing it as ad hoc and arbitrary.\n\nOn Monday the IBA held a chaotic, two-hour press conference where Kremlev declared Khelif and Lu-Ting were men who should not be allowed to compete at the Olympics.\n\nHe also accused the IOC of corruption and said the IBA was standing up for the rights of women.\n\nIt said its testing showed Khelif and Lu-Ting had elevated levels of testosterone and had XY chromosomes, which is found in men.\n\nThe IBA said it could not release the result of its gender tests after receiving letters of demand from the Algerian and Taiwanese Olympic committees.\n\nBut IBA officials left behind notes at the event which said Khelif had an unfair advantage, and that XY athletes could punch 162 per cent harder than men.\n\nKhelif's appearance in the gold medal bout will ensure the controversy that has dominated headline at these Olympics will continue.\n\nShe will take on China's Liu Yang in the gold medal bout on Saturday morning (AEST).", "source": {"uri": "skynews.com.au", "dataType":

The bout was stopped for a standing 8-count late in the third when Suwannapheng absorbed a few head punches in succession, although Suwannapheng appeared to shrug as if it wasn't necessary -- as is often the case in Olympic boxing, where referees can stop a bout for relatively minor reasons.", "source": {"uri": "wesh.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WESH"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angela Carini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hocine_Soltani", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hocine Soltani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stigma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social stigma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

For more of our coverage from the games head to our latest updates.\n\nPARIS -- Imane Khelif, the Algerian boxer at the center of political controversy over participation in women's sports, will compete for the Olympic gold medal in women's boxing.\n\nOutside of Paris, criticism has erupted over the past week around Khelif's participation in the Olympics amid claims that she failed two gender eligibility tests administered by a boxing federation -- tests that Olympic officials have dismissed as \"illegitimate\" as they have defended her participation.\n\nBut in the stands of Roland-Garros Stadium, dozens of Algerian flags hung over the seats, as hundreds of men and women dressed in green and red cheered raucously for Khelif.\n\nOver three rounds in the ring Tuesday, Khelif traded blows with her opponent, Thailand's Janjaem Suwannapheng, in the 66kg weight class semifinal.\n\nWith her win, she is set to compete Friday in the gold medal match.\n\nAfter the official raised her hand to mark her victory, Khelif danced joyfully in the ring as Algerian fans roared their approval.\n\nThe political controversy around Khelif that erupted over the past week centers on a decision last year by the International Boxing Association to disqualify her and another female boxer from some competitions by claiming that they had failed two unspecified gender eligibility tests. The second boxer, Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan, is also competing in the Olympics.\n\nKhelif, 25, is a woman and has competed for years in women's boxing, in which she has accumulated a typical record of wins and losses against her female competition.\n\n\"They were born as girls, registered as female passports, have fought at the senior level for six years with no issues,\" International Olympic Committee spokesperson Mark Adams said on Sunday.\n\nBut the Russia-linked boxing federation has refused to release any details about those tests, and the disqualification was announced shortly after Khelif defeated a Russian boxer.\n\nIn a chaotic press conference Monday, IBA officials raised more questions than they answered about the tests. IBA president Umar Kremlev, speaking by videoconference from Russia, said through a translator that their tests had shown elevated levels of testosterone -- but that claim directly contradicted a previous statement from the IBA that said the boxers had not undergone a testosterone exam.\n\nThe IOC says the IBA shared the results of the test Olympic officials have denounced and continue to defend the boxers' participation.\n\n\"The method of the testing, the idea of the testing -- which kind of happened overnight -- none of it was legitimate,\" Adams said. The IOC broke ties with the IBA last year over long-standing concerns about corruption.\n\nStill, the controversy has led to a swell of harassment online targeted at Khelif and Lin, who will compete in her own semifinal in a different weight class on Wednesday.\n\n\"It can destroy people, it can kill people's thoughts, spirit and mind. It can divide people. And because of that, I ask them to refrain from bullying,\" Khelif said Sunday in an interview with SNTV, a sports news service.\n\nAt the stadium, fans of Algeria said they rejected the claims against Khelif and decried the online harassment that has surrounded her. \"I think she is really brave to get into the ring today despite the relentless campaign against her,\" said Abdelslam Afs. \"We are all here to support her.\"\n\nAnother fan, the Algiers-born Yacine Bouzydy, said he originally hadn't planned to attend Tuesday's bout, as he doesn't closely follow sports. But when he heard about the controversy surrounding Khelif, he decided to attend to show his support and \"give her energy,\" he said.\n\n\"Algeria is quite a conservative country to France and to other European countries. But for this specific story, the role has changed somehow,\" he said.\n\n\"I can imagine that it was very, very hard for her to go beyond this and to compete and to win the bronze medal, at least,\" Bouzydy said. \"I hope it will end with a gold medal. And even if not, Algerian people are very happy.\"", "source": {"uri": "gpb.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Georgia Public Broadcasting"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weight class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umar_Kremlev", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Umar Kremlev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Yu-ting", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lin Yu-ting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Testosterone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.gpb.org/sites/default/files/styles/three_two_702x468/public/npr_story_images/2024/08/06/gettyimages-2165595086.jpg?h=6be572f5&itok=rn8PoS-4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796155", "eventUri": "eng-9796155", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Competing in the women's 66kg category, Khelif secured at least a silver medal after defeating Thailand's Janjaem Suwannapheng, the 2023 world silver medallist, by a unanimous points decision.\n\nThe match took place in front of an enthusiastic crowd at Roland Garros, who passionately chanted Khelif's name throughout the contest.\n\nIn a separate weight class, Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting, another boxer involved in the eligibility controversy, is also assured of winning at least a bronze medal. Both Khelif, 25, and Lin participated in the Tokyo Olympics three years prior without any controversy and did not secure medals at that time.\n\nThe two boxers faced disqualification from the world championships last year after failing to meet gender eligibility requirements. However, they were subsequently cleared to participate in the Paris Olympics.\n\n\"I am focusing on the competition and other things are not important. The important thing is that I am in the final now,\" Khelif told BeIN Sports.\n\n\"I am very proud of this new achievement. I gave everything I had. We worked as a team for years and the dream has become a reality. I hope to focus and be up to the responsibility in the dream final.\"\n\nKhelif, the Algerian boxer, received a thunderous ovation as she stepped into the arena at Roland Garros, which is typically known for hosting Grand Slam tennis tournaments.\n\nThe venue was packed with a considerable number of Algerian fans waving flags and chanting \"Imane, Imane\" throughout the bout.\n\nKhelif's opponent, the Thai boxer Janjaem, who was visibly shorter, took a standing count in the third round after feeling the full force of the Algerian's superior skills.\n\nDespite the intense atmosphere, the two fighters showed great sportsmanship at the end of the fight, warmly greeting each other and shaking hands.\n\nKhelif celebrated her victory with a dance in the center of the ring, eliciting even more cheers from the crowd.\n\nShe will face Yang Liu for the gold medal, after the Chinese boxer defeated Taiwan's Chen Nien-chin on points in the other semi-final.\n\nThe gender controversy surrounding Khelif and another boxer, Lin, began when Khelif defeated Angela Carini in just 46 seconds during her opening bout. Carini, who suffered a severe nose injury, was reduced to tears and forced to abandon the fight. The 2023 world championships, from which both Khelif and Lin were expelled, were organized by the International Boxing Association (IBA). However, due to concerns over the IBA's financial, governance, and ethical practices, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has taken charge of the sport at the Olympic Games.\n\nIBA president Umar Kremlev, who has ties to the Kremlin, made a controversial claim during a chaotic press conference, stating that both fighters had undergone \"genetic testing that shows that these are men.\"\n\nThe IOC has strongly defended Khelif and Lin, with president Thomas Bach emphasizing that they were born and raised as women and hold passports reflecting their gender.\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

Khelif, representing Algeria, took a 5-0 unanimous decision over Janjaem Suwannapheng and will now face the winner of the bout between Nien Chin Chen of Chinese Taipei and Liu Yang of China.\n\nThe bout was not fought at a blistering pace, with Suwannapheng happy to stay outside for the first two rounds, which allowed Kehlif to throw occasional scoring straight punches, mostly a strong jab. Entering the third and final round, Suwannapheng needed an unlikely knockout or knockdown to score the win. Suwannapheng tried to make it more of a fight but was caught by a hard combination and received a standing eight-count, locking up the win for Khelif.\n\nControversy over Khelif's participation reached a fever pitch when she defeated Italy's Angela Carini in just 46 seconds after Carini quit the fight. Social media was soon abuzz with a debate over whether Khelif should be allowed to compete, with some calling her \"a man\" based on a 2023 decision by the IBA to disqualify her and Taiwan's Lin Yu-Ting for failing a \"gender test.\" Khelif defeated Luca Anna Hamori in a standard-looking decision in the quarterfinals, drawing less online chatter than after the Carini fight.\n\nThe IBA, which was dropped by the IOC amid years of controversy and scandal, including findings of fight fixing in the Rio Olympics, has never given clear details about the test though have at various times claimed the tests were not for testosterone but the unspecified test detected XY chromosomes. In a press conference on Monday, IBA officials repeated the XY finding while also suddenly adding that there were issues with Khelif's testosterone levels, this after the previous statements that testosterone tests were not a factor in their previous decision.\n\nIBA president Umar Kremlev also attempted to add fuel to the fire by suggesting during the press conference that Khelif may be a transgender woman, saying, \"I was not present when she was in the Algerian maternity. There is no proof. It may be transgender woman, maybe not.\"\n\nThere is no proof, nor has the IBA ever previously claimed, that Khelif is a transgender woman and photos of her as a young girl have surfaced. She is also a female according to Algeria, where homosexuality as well as gender-affirming surgeries are strictly prohibited by law.\n\nThe IOC has repeatedly stated their position that Khelif is eligible under all applicable rules and guidelines to compete.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brent_brookhouse@cbssports.com", "name": "Brent Brookhouse", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Broadcasting_Authority", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Broadcasting Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Taipei", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Taipei"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angela Carini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_verification_in_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sex verification in sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Testosterone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_woman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trans woman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_sex-determination_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "XY sex-determination system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/08/06/f45ea508-b322-48da-934a-cc32436f0d3d/thumbnail/1200x675/947a8c0af520a40e1d80294a03a4e53d/imane-khelif-win-semis.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796155", "eventUri": "eng-9796155", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

And she could earn even more having found a route past Suwannapheng.\n\nKhelif dominated throughout the opening two rounds of the bout. She won every judge's scorecard from the first round, and after landing a few impressive hits in the second, did exactly the same.\n\nSuwannapheng had to go for broke in the final round buit failed to knockout her opponent, which allowed Khelif to waltz to victory. She now heads into Friday's final and will take on either Chen Nien-chin or Yang Liu.\n\nKhelif has been at the heart of ongoing controversy at the Olympics. Her opening round fight with Italian rival Angela Carini was abandoned after less than a minute.\n\nThat led to many questioning her eligibility in the championships - particularly in the wake of the International Boxing Association disqualifying her from competition in 2023. Khelif was one of two female fighters to fail an unspecified gender test during last year's world championships in Delhi.\n\nHowever, the IBA are no longer recognised as amateur boxing's governing body due to concerns over finances, governance, ethics, refereeing and judging. And due to the International Olympic Committee having different eligibility criteria, she was free to fight in Paris.\n\nKhelif, 25, beat Carini in her opening round before overcoming Anna Luca Hamori in the quarter-finals. Speaking ahead of her semi-final clash with Suwannapheng, she asked for empathy and for her critics to refrain from the incredible levels of hostility directed towards her.\n\n\"I send a message to all the people of the world to uphold the Olympic principles and the Olympic Charter, to refrain from bullying all athletes, because this has effects, massive effects.\n\n\"It can destroy people, it can kill people's thoughts, spirit and mind. It can divide people. And because of that, I ask them to refrain from bullying.\n\n\"I am in contact with my family two days a week. I hope that they weren't affected deeply. They are worried about me. God willing, this crisis will culminate in a gold medal, and that would be the best response.\"\n\nKhelif's latest success comes after IBA president Umar Kremlev launched a bizarre rant at both her and Lin-Yu ting, who had also failed a gender test. Speaking in a press conference, he said: \"The tests show they were men.\n\n\"We don't verify what they have between their legs. We don't know if they were born like that, or if some changes were made. The second tests confirmed the first tests. If people have doubts, refer to them. They can make their own tests.\"\n\nKhelif's Dad has also attempted to intervene over the last few days. According to Mail Online, he shared a document that confirmed his daughter had been born a female.\n\nHer semi-final opponent Suwannapheng had said before the bout: \"Imane is a little girl that has loved sport since she was six-years-old, she used to play football. These critics and rumours aim to destabilise Imane, they don't want her to be the champion of the world.\n\n\"I tell her prove them wrong in the ring and I hope that she will honour Algeria and Arabic countries and win the gold medal.

And this time under the lights at Roland Garros Stadium. Khelif is fighting for a chance to win a silver or gold medal.\n\nKhelif has advanced to the semifinals of the welterweight division (146 pounds). She'll be facing a familiar foe - Thailand's Janjaem Suwannapheng. Khelif, 25, beat Suwannapheng in the semifinals of the 2023 world championships before Khelif was disqualified for allegedly failing what the organizers called a \"gender eligibility test.\"\n\nThe International Boxing Association (IBA), a discredited organization with no role in the Olympics, disqualified Khelif and Taiwanese boxer Lin without providing evidence of any failed tests. Lin is scheduled to fight in her semifinal match Wednesday.\n\nA victory for Khelif would vault her into the finals, where the winner would win gold and the runner-up would take silver. But she's already guaranteed bronze.\n\nIn Olympic boxing, bronze medals are awarded to both losing semifinalists in the single-elimination format tournament.\n\nBouts are scheduled for three rounds and are scored by five judges. Using a 10-point system, each judge awards 10 points to the boxer they deem won the round and at least nine points to the boxer they deem lost the round.\n\nBarring a stoppage, the winner of the bout will be determined by points based on the judges' scorecards. A boxer earns one point for each judge who deems the boxer has won at least two of the three rounds.\n\nIn Khelif's opening bout, Italy's Angela Carini abandoned the fight only 46 seconds into the match. Khelif demonstrated she could deliver a punch - one solidly connected with Carini's face before the Italian quit fighting - and Khelif secured a spot in the quarterfinals.\n\nIn Khelif's quarterfinal bout, she beat Hungary's Anna Luca Hamori on points by unanimous decision, 5-0. This time she had nine minutes to perform and showed impressive boxing skills in dominating Hamori.\n\nKhelif, who made her amateur boxing debut in 2018, is 38-9 with five knockouts as an amateur, according to BoxRec.\n\nThe 23-year-old won her first two bouts by split decision. The victories came against Brigitte Mbabi of the Democratic Republic of The Congo and Busenaz Surmeneli of Turkey.\n\nShe made her amateur boxing debut in 2019 and is 14-5 with one knockout, according to BoxRec.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carini", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angela Carini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_decision", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Split decision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BoxRec", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BoxRec"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unanimous_decision", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unanimous decision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amateur boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/37SNOD7Br7ac0Ecg9uKQpA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDk7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_sports_articles_558/91e06292efc03d16162ec9df899758a6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796155", "eventUri": "eng-9796155", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

She will fight for a gold medal at the Paris Games on Friday.\n\nKhelif beat her opponent, Janjaem Suwannapheng of Thailand, through precise and effective striking and quick footwork. After the result was announced, she celebrated in the middle of the ring, joyfully raising her hand.\n\n\"I am very happy,\" she said through an interpreter, standing with the red, green and white Algerian flag draped on her shoulders. \"I've worked eight years for these Olympics and I'm very proud of this moment.\" The Algerian president, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, congratulated Khelif on social media.\n\nThe uproar surrounding Khelif, 25, had its roots at last year's boxing world championships in India, where she and another boxer, Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan, were ruled ineligible to compete after they underwent unspecified blood tests. The International Boxing Association, which ran the tournament and disqualified the fighters, never fully explained its decisions, saying that Khelif and Lin \"did not undergo a testosterone examination but were subject to a separate and recognized test.\"\n\nThe International Olympic Committee, which no longer recognizes the I.B.A. as boxing's governing authority, allowed Khelif and Lin to compete in the Paris Games, saying their disqualifications in 2023 had been \"sudden and arbitrary,\" and that \"every person has the right to practice sport without discrimination.\" The I.O.C. said plainly that the boxers are women. Lin will fight in the semifinal of her weight division on Wednesday.\n\nIn her first bout, Khelif defeated Angela Carini of Italy, who quit just 46 seconds into the fight after absorbing a powerful blow to the face. Later, she sobbed and told reporters she had \"never felt a punch like this.\" Khelif's eligibility was questioned, including by the British author J.K. Rowling and the billionaire Elon Musk. Giorgia Meloni, Italy's prime minister, told reporters, \"Athletes who have male genetic characteristics should not be admitted to female competitions.\"\n\nCarini has since apologized to Khelif, telling an Italian media outlet, \"All this controversy certainly made me sad.\" Khelif, in an interview with the news service SNTV, denounced the treatment she's received and thanked the I.O.C. for its support.\n\n\"I send a message to all the people of the world to uphold the Olympic principles and the Olympic charter, to refrain from bullying all athletes, because this has effects, massive effects,\" Khelif said in Arabic. \"It can destroy people, it can kill people's thoughts, spirit and mind. It can divide people. And because of that, I ask them to refrain from bullying.\"\n\nIn a chaotic news conference on Monday, officials of the I.B.A. offered no documentation for their decision to suspend the two fighters. The organization is backed by the Russian energy giant Gazprom, which has led I.O.C. officials and others to suggest the boxing controversy was calculated to discredit the Paris Games after Russia was excluded from them because of its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nKhelif's fight Tuesday was attended by a large contingent of Algerian fans, who cheered loudly for her as she walked to the ring and waved their country's flag. She touched gloves with Suwannapheng before and during the match in a sign of good sportsmanship.\n\nAfter the bout, Suwannapheng, who was awarded a bronze medal in the loss, said she had heard about the controversy but had not followed it closely.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Algeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of Algeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Yu-ting", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lin Yu-ting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angela Carini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdelmadjid_Tebboune", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abdelmadjid Tebboune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Testosterone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arabic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgia_Meloni", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giorgia Meloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Charter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Charter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazprom", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gazprom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Imane Khelif will fight for an Olympic gold medal on Friday after putting aside the row surrounding her eligibility to comprehensively win her semi-final against Janjaem Suwannapheng in Paris.\n\nThe Algerian welterweight is one of two boxers competing in Paris despite being disqualified from last year's World Championships by the International Boxing Association (IBA) after she was reported to have failed gender eligibility tests.\n\nAmid wild support under the roof of Court Philippe Chatrier - the French tennis venue repurposed for the boxing finals - Khelif dominated her Thai opponent to

by the IBA.\n\nHere, the crowd chanted her name as she entered the ring - and the Algerian looked more confident than she had at any point this week.\n\nAfter the result was confirmed she dropped her guard and danced on the canvas, and a bout fought in good spirits ended with an embrace between the two fighters.\n\nKhelif's Games began with a win against Angela Carini last week - a fight that lasted just 46 seconds before the Italian abandoned saying she \"had to preserve\" her life.\n\nThat sparked widespread debate over the eligibility of Khelif and Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-ting, who was also disqualified by the IBA last year.\n\nThe IBA said Khelif had \"failed to meet the eligibility criteria for participating in the women's competition, as set and laid out\" in its regulations, but the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said the pair had been \"suddenly disqualified without any due process\".\n\nThe IOC, which suspended the IBA in 2019 because of concerns over its finances, governance, ethics, refereeing and judging, has allowed the pair to compete and strongly backed them.\n\nPresident Thomas Bach said on Saturday there was \"never any doubt\" they are women.\n\nA chaotic news conference held by the IBA on Monday did little to lessen the confusion, with key IBA figures giving conflicting statements on why they were banned.\n\nThe IOC said competitors were eligible for the women's division if their passports said they were female.\n\nIt will now see Khelif, already guaranteed bronze by reaching this semi-final, in the final of its biggest stage in three

And she could earn even more having found a route past Suwannapheng.\n\nKhelif dominated throughout the opening two rounds of the bout. She won every judge's scorecard from the first round, and after landing a few impressive hits in the second, did exactly the same.\n\nSuwannapheng had to go for broke in the final round buit failed to knockout her opponent, which allowed Khelif to waltz to victory. She now heads into Friday's final and will take on either Chen Nien-chin or Yang Liu.\n\nKhelif has been at the heart of ongoing controversy at the Olympics. Her opening round fight with Italian rival Angela Carini was abandoned after less than a minute.\n\nThat led to many questioning her eligibility in the championships - particularly in the wake of the International Boxing Association disqualifying her from competition in 2023. Khelif was one of two female fighters to fail an unspecified gender test during last year's world championships in Delhi.\n\nHowever, the IBA are no longer recognised as amateur boxing's governing body due to concerns over finances, governance, ethics, refereeing and judging. And due to the International Olympic Committee having different eligibility criteria, she was free to fight in Paris.\n\nKhelif, 25, beat Carini in her opening round before overcoming Anna Luca Hamori in the quarter-finals. Speaking ahead of her semi-final clash with Suwannapheng, she asked for empathy and for her critics to refrain from the incredible levels of hostility directed towards her.\n\n\"I send a message to all the people of the world to uphold the Olympic principles and the Olympic Charter, to refrain from bullying all athletes, because this has effects, massive effects.\n\n\"It can destroy people, it can kill people's thoughts, spirit and mind. It can divide people. And because of that, I ask them to refrain from bullying.\n\n\"I am in contact with my family two days a week. I hope that they weren't affected deeply. They are worried about me. God willing, this crisis will culminate in a gold medal, and that would be the best response.\"\n\nKhelif's latest success comes after IBA president Umar Kremlev launched a bizarre rant at both her and Lin-Yu ting, who had also failed a gender test. Speaking in a press conference, he said: \"The tests show they were men.\n\n\"We don't verify what they have between their legs. We don't know if they were born like that, or if some changes were made. The second tests confirmed the first tests. If people have doubts, refer to them. They can make their own tests.\"\n\nKhelif's Dad has also attempted to intervene over the last few days. According to Mail Online, he shared a document that confirmed his daughter had been born a female.\n\nHer semi-final opponent Suwannapheng had said before the bout: \"Imane is a little girl that has loved sport since she was six-years-old, she used to play football. These critics and rumours aim to destabilise Imane, they don't want her to be the champion of the world.\n\n\"I tell her prove them wrong in the ring and I hope that she will honour Algeria and Arabic countries and win the gold medal. She is our role model, and we want to be like her and honour Algeria and Tiaret.\"\n\nFollow all the action on day 11 of the Paris Olympics with Mirror Sport's live blog\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

Suwannapheng was pounded with punches in the third round and took a standing eight-count.\n\nThus far in the Paris Olympics, Khelif has won every single round on every judge's card.\n\nKhelif and Lin Yu\u2011ting of Taiwan both failed gender tests in 2019 and 2023, per the International Boxing Association (IBA).\n\nA blood test in 2019 showed that the fighters had \"inconsistent\" results, suggesting that the bloodwork was inconsistent with that of a female, IBA CEO Chris Roberts said during a press conference on Monday. In 2023, another test revealed that the fighters \"demonstrated the chromosomes we refer to in competition rules that make both boxers ineligible,\" he added.\n\nKhelif and Lin were subsequently disqualified from the 2023 world championships.

Angela Carini of Italy, for example, called her match \"unjust,\" before later walking back the comments. Hungarian fighter Anna Luca Hamori, who also lost to Khelif, published numerous posts on social media that related to Khelif being a man before their fight.\n\nAs for Lin, Bulgarian fighter Svetlana Staneva staged a protest with her coach after their fight. Staneva made the \"X\" gesture two times with her hands -- a reference to having XX chromosomes as a female -- after her loss to Lin. And Staneva's coach shared a note with the press that read, \"I only want to play with women I am XX.\"\n\nInternational Olympics Committee (IOC) spokesperson Mark Adams, however, has claimed that the IBA gender tests are \"not credible\" because the IBA is not credible and the reasoning for the tests is not credible, ESPN reported.\n\n\"There was no consideration of whether they were correct or not correct because they had no bearing for the eligibility of boxing here,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "dailywire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carini", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angela Carini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bulgaria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bulgaria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Questionnaires", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Questionnaires", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://dw-wp-production.imgix.net/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-06-at-5.21.03-PM.png?w=1200&h=800&ixlib=react-9.3.0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796155", "eventUri": "eng-9796155", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

At a wild, steamy, increasingly unbound Roland Garros, Algeria's fifth seed outclassed Janjaem Suwannapheng of Thailand to win the women's 66kg semi-final bout and set up a final against Yang Liu of China on Friday.\n\nThis was a startling event in so many ways, in large part here because of its exuberantly \u00adAlgerian tone. The snaking queue outside Roland Garros in the hours before this \u00adevening round of Olympic \u00adboxing had been heavily stacked with Algerian flags and football shirts. Centre court, reconfigured into a breathtaking boxing area, was similarly decked with the red and green.\n\nRelated: The men of international boxing use the Olympics to spoil for another kind of fight\n\nThis has been one effect of the controversy around Khelif. The \u00adAlgerian diaspora in Paris has come out in numbers to \u00adsupport her, a reflection of the way the events of the past two weeks have been received back home.\n\nIt has been another \u00adextraordinary week in this story, with Khelif and Lin Yu-ting of Chinese Taipei guaranteed a medal of some sort \u00adhaving both reached their semi-finals (two bronzes are awarded in boxing, in keeping with the sport's most basic code that \u00adanyone who gets in the ring deserves something just for doing so).\n\nBoth boxers have been at the centre of Paris 2024's most fevered and bruising extra-sport story, which was aggravated further this week by the chaotic short-notice press conference staged in a Paris hotel by the International Boxing Federation.\n\nIt was of course the IBA that banned both Khelif and Lin from competing during the world championships last year on the basis of swab and blood tests that suggested neither was qualified to take part in the women's event.\n\nKhelif and Suwannapheng entered the arena at 10.25pm, by which time the Algerian flags were everywhere, rippling and waving in every corner. Suwannapheng got plenty of cheers from the Thai crowd. Khelif emerged to ear-mangling whistles, the \u00adAlgerian supporters dancing in the aisles and chanting: \"Imane, Imane!\"\n\nThere was an odd circularity to this Olympic semi-final - of course, because this is now high drama - as Khelif versus Suwannapheng was in effect a rematch of the world championship bout, won by Khelif, that preceded her disqualification.\n\nSuwannapheng had beaten the reigning gold medallist and favourite Busenaz Surmeneli on her way here. She has blistering foot speed and was in and out of range to good effect early on, coming in behind Khelif's jab.\n\nKhelif was the taller boxer with a greater reach. She likes to keep her distance and tag her opponent with the jab or come in with the long straight right. It was messy at times, a clash of \u00admethods, all flailing arms and \u00adbumping in the clinches, but Khelif took the opening round 10-9 on every card.\n\nRoland Garros has taken over from the North Paris Arena business park complex as the venue for these finals, which is a bit like moving from a cheerful old clanky National League ground to the Augusta National Golf Club. It is a wonderful space, every soft touch surface beautifully turned, the roof creating a boisterous echo chamber, but also a sweat-box effect that left trainers furiously fanning their charges with towels between rounds.\n\nSuwannapheng needed to get closer in the second, but struggled to evade the jab. Khelif reeled off a couple of powerful uppercuts and never really came under enough pressure, taking it by the same score.\n\nSuwannapheng had no choice but to up her work rate and get closer in the third, but by now Roland \u00adGarros was in a state of pre\u2011celebratory uproar, every combination cheered. A \u00adstanding count for \u00adSuwannapheng shortly before the end drew a great \u00adwhooshing wave of noise. As the \u00addecision was announced Khelif wagged her finger and strolled around the ring as the stands re-erupted, then returned to do a knees-up style dance of joy.\n\nAfterwards she was once again assailed by the gathered global media in surely one of the most fevered Olympic boxing mixed zones ever staged, stopping this time to talk to Algerian TV, looking calm, unmarked and delighted to have progressed this far. For reasons that stretch far beyond the distribution of a featherweight gold medal, that final really is going to be quite an event.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Yu-ting", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lin Yu-ting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(hairstyle)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queue (hairstyle)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Taipei", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Taipei"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diaspora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jab", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusta_National_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Augusta National Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Featherweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Featherweight"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/27560cb736115db4612d7ae2ebf2eb70", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796155", "eventUri": "eng-9796155", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Carini quit the bout just 46 seconds in after taking hard punches.\n\nA year ago, the International Boxing Association, which runs the world championships, banned Khelif and another fighter, Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting, in the middle of that tournament after they said that tests had shown them to have \"competitive advantages over other female competitors.\"\n\nBoth Khelif and Lin were assigned female at birth and have always competed in women's divisions. The IBA has provided no further clarification of its decision, and even confused things further Monday as officials made contradictory descriptions of the tests while saying they could not disclose the actual results.\n\nLin will fight in the 57-kilogram semifinals on Wednesday.\n\nThe IOC, which runs the Olympic tournament, has repeatedly supported Khelif and Lin's inclusion.\n\n\"They are eligible by the rules of the federation which was set in 2016, and which worked for Tokyo too,\" where Khelif and Lin also competed, IOC spokesman Mark Adams said last week. \"To compete as women, which is what they are. And we fully support that.\"\n\nKhelif, her coach and others in the boxing community have dismissed the IBA's decision as baseless.\n\n\"They (boxing authorities) did some worthless tests, tests that don't show anything,\" Mohamed Chaoua, Khelif's coach, told SNTV and the Associated Press.\n\n\"She will box, and she will fight,\" said Roumaysa Boualam, Khelif's teammate on the Algerian boxing team. \"This is unfair, what's happened. ... We have to support her.\"\n\nAfter her bout with Khelif, Carini did not participate in the customary post-match handshake, which inflamed speculation about her feelings on fighting Khelif. Carini later apologized in an interview with an Italian publication, Gazzetta dello Sport.\n\n\"It was not intentional, in fact, I apologize to her and to everyone,\" Carini said. \"I was angry because my Games had already gone up in smoke. I have nothing against Khelif and, on the contrary, if I happened to meet her again I would give her a hug.\"\n\nTwo days later, Khelif beat Hungary's Anna Luca Hamori in the quarterfinals. After that match, a Hungarian IOC representative, Bal\u00e1zs F\u00fcrjes, delivered prepared remarks that did little to stamp down the controversy.\n\n\"We are not afraid of difficult circumstances and are ready to fight even among difficult circumstances,\" F\u00fcrjes said. \"... We are 100 percent convinced that the International Olympic Committee will make the right decisions.\"\n\nNow, Khelif is into the Olympic final, set for Friday at Roland Garros, and one step from a gold medal.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zack_pierce@nytimes.com", "name": "Zack Pierce", "type": "author", "isAgency":

I hope I can also make them proud in my final match,\" she said.\n\n\"All that matters is for me to be at my best level. I know I'm a great athlete, I just hope people enjoyed watching my match.\"\n\nThe fans who came to support Khelif were beaming with delight.\n\n\"I am so happy for her - I bought my tickets at 2am yesterday to come support her, I came alone and now I\u00b4m going to look for tickets for the finals,\" Imane Touti, a 25-year-old who works at a marketing company, said.\n\n\"She has won no matter what.

Text \"Alerts\" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nKhelif's gold medal match is scheduled for Friday at 4:51 p.m. EDT.\n\nThe outcome of the match with Carini, and Khelif's background, provoked criticism against the Algerian boxer, including scrutiny from Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who said \"athletes who have male genetic characteristics should not be admitted to women's competitions,\" according to Sky News, noting the prohibition should be done not to discriminate against anyone, \"but to protect the right of female athletes to be able to compete on equal terms.\" Khelif is legally a female and is identified as such on her passport, according to multiple outlets. Mark Adams, the International Olympic Committee's chief spokesman, told The New York Times that Khelif is not a transgender athlete, and Adams noted everyone competing in the Olympics' women's category has complied with competition eligibility rules. Khelif appealed and called her disqualification from the IBA's World Boxing Championships last year a \"big conspiracy,\" according to NBC News. The IBA said its decision to disqualify Khelif was \"extremely important and necessary to uphold the level of fairness and utmost integrity of the competition.\" Khelif later withdrew her appeal. The Algerian fighter has competed as a woman throughout her career and also participated in the 2021 Tokyo Olympic Games, losing in the quarterfinals against Irish boxer Kellie Harrington in a unanimous decision. Boxing at the Olympics is just the latest women's sport to become a battleground over gender identity issues, as some critics have argued participation should be limited to people whose biological sex is female at birth. The New York Times reported that intersex athletes, or those with some biologically male characteristics and some female, have also been a focal point of the debate.\n\nThe last time the IBA organized an Olympic boxing competition was during the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics. The IOC has scrutinized the association's lack of financial transparency, the credibility of its boxing competitions and its governance.\n\nKhelif is not the only female Olympic boxer to have stirred up controversy in Paris. Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-ting was also disqualified from last year's World Championships over a disputed gender test. She will fight in the women's 125-pound semifinals Wednesday and has already clinched a bronze medal. Her first victory in the Paris Olympics was met with cheers and boos from the audience, The Washington Post reported, and prompted USA Boxing Executive Director Mike McAtee to speak up in her defense.\n\nThe IOC stood by Khelif's inclusion, saying in a statement that did not explicitly name the boxer that \"two athletes were the victims of a sudden and arbitrary decision by the IBA,\" likely referencing Khelif and Yu-ting. Algerian national team soccer player Isma\u00ebl Bennacer expressed support for Khelif in a tweet, saying she is \"suffering a wave of unjustified hatred\" and that her \"presence at the Olympic Games is simply the result of her talent and hard work.\" IOC president Thomas Bach has said there have never been any doubts about Khelif and Yu-ting being women and said the Olympics would \"not take part in a sometimes politically motivated, cultural war.\" Boxer Amy Broadhurst, who beat Khelif in the 2022 IBA World Championships, has supported her former opponent. \"Personally I don't think she has done anything to 'cheat,'\" Broadhurst wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. \"I (think) it's the way she was born & that's out of her control.\" Marissa Williamson Pohlman of Australia, also a fellow boxer, said she did notice that Khelif felt particularly strong, \"but you just keep fighting, though, don't you? It's just a part of the sport.\"\n\nImane Khelif Wins Again -- Clinches Medal -- After Olympics Chief Defends Her (Forbes)", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"},

I will give everything I have for the final.'\n\nSuwannapheng said she was 'not afraid' of Khelif ahead of their semi-final and insisted the pair were 'evenly matched' despite the Algerian winning their previous meeting in India last year.\n\n'I've improved since then and I'll fight with all I've got,' Suwannapheng told Thai newspaper Khaosod earlier this week.\n\n'I've looked into it too, about her hormones, and I know she's lost to female boxers before, but that was a long time ago.\n\n'I'm not sure if she's got stronger or if her male hormones have increased.'\n\nSuwannapheng added: 'But if we meet again, I'm not afraid because we're evenly matched.\n\n'I've prepared my body well too, trained a lot. I just think, no matter how strong or tough, we're both human, we both have two fists.\n\n'Having come this far, I want to go all the way to the gold medal.'\n\nMORE : Team GB boxer left 'devastated' after controversial semi-final defeat at Paris Olympics\n\nMORE : Heartbroken Team GB star Lina Nielsen consoled by reporter after falling in 400m hurdles at Olympics", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_olver@metro.co.uk", "name": "Tom Olver", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Liu_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yang Liu (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lina_Nielsen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lina Nielsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/400_metres_hurdles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "400 metres hurdles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hormone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_GB", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Team GB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/comp-1722984992.png?crop=0px%2C23px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796155", "eventUri": "eng-9796155", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

After defeating Thailand's Janjaem Suwannapheng to advance to the gold-medal match of the women's welterweight (66-kilogram) bracket, a grinning Khelif danced a celebratory jig and hugged her coaches. She raised her fist. On her way off the floor, she shadowboxed to the tune of thunderous cheers.\n\nThe crowd of at least 10,000 stood behind Khelif all of Tuesday night, chanting her name before she even entered the ring. They encouraged her for the duration of her fight, fervently shaking their flags and making themselves heard whenever she went on the offensive.\n\nThe overwhelming outpouring of support comes while Khelif is caught in the crossfire of an ongoing back-and-forth between the International Olympic Committee and the International Boxing Association.\n\nThe saga dates to the 2023 world boxing championships, when the IBA disqualified Khelif and Taiwan's Lin Yu Ting because unspecified and unproven tests allegedly showed the female boxers had \"XY chromosomes.\" IBA president Umar Kremlev has shared little information about the tests, including when, why, and how they were administered.\n\nThe IOC has rejected the results, calling Khelif and Lin \"victims of a sudden and arbitrary decision\" by the IBA.\n\nThe debated qualifications resurfaced in Paris after Khelif defeated Italy's Angela Carini in just 46 seconds during the preliminary round last Thursday. Carini withdrew from the match, didn't shake Khelif's hand, started crying in the ring, and later spoke about the pain she endured as a result of the forcefulness of Khelif's punch.\n\nThe outcome of the fight, along with Carini's comments, prompted several high-profile individuals, such as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance, to question Khelif's eligibility. Billionaire businessman Elon Musk and author J.K. Rowling also weighed in via social media, amplifying misinformation.\n\nCarini has since apologized for her behavior and her role in the controversy that ensued.\n\nThe IOC has vehemently and repeatedly defended Khelif and Lin, reiterating that both athletes are women. Their gender has been confirmed by their passport information, the IOC said.\n\nThe furor surrounding their gender, IOC spokesman Mark Adams said, has ignited a \"culture war.\" IOC president Thomas Bach, too, referred to the discourse as \"politically motivated,\" and asked for an end to the hate speech and abuse directed at Khelif and Lin.\n\n\"We have two female boxers who were born as women, who were raised as women, who have women's passports, and who have been competing as women for many years,\" Bach said. \"That's the clear definition of a woman.\"\n\n\"This is not a transgender issue,\" added Adams.\n\nThe IBA promised to provide \"detailed explanations\" backing its decision to disqualify Khelif and Lin, and attempted to do so in a press conference on Monday. But the Russian-led organization failed to share pertinent evidence or disclose meaningful information.\n\nThe IOC and IBA have been at odds for years, with the IOC stripping the IBA of its authority as a governing body in 2023. Their back-and-forth seems far from over, as boxing's future in the Olympics is in jeopardy, especially if the sport cannot settle on a new international federation. Boxing is the only sport in the 2024 Summer Games that is not being overseen by a dedicated world governing body.\n\nChristian Klaue, the IOC's corporate communications and public affairs director, has said the IBA is orchestrating a \"disinformation campaign against the Olympic movement.\"\n\nKhelif, whose native language is Arabic, hasn't said much about the situation, asking people to refrain from bullying and thanking the IOC for defending her. On Tuesday, she expressed gratitude for the support from the crowd as well as people in Algeria.\n\n\"I am very happy,\" Khelif said via translation. \"I've worked eight years for these Olympics, and I'm very proud of this moment.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angela Carini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Her victory comes after she and another female Olympic boxer, Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan, continue to face intense scrutiny and false accusations about their gender and eligibility to compete with women.\n\nFans erupted from the moment the match began, waving the Algerian green, white and red flag and chanting \"Imane, Imane, Imane!\" Khelif appeared elated after the match was called in her favor, dancing around the ring.\n\nKhelif and Lin have competed for years in women's events, including at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, and there is no indication that they identify as transgender or intersex, the latter referring to people born with sex characteristics that do not fit strictly into the male-female gender binary.\n\nHowever, controversy surrounding their gender stemmed from their disqualification at last year's Women's World Boxing Championships by the Russian-led International Boxing Association. The association, which is led by Umar Kremlev, who is reportedly an acquaintance of Vladimir Putin, alleged the two women failed an unspecified gender test that showed they have male chromosomes. The allegations, which were first reported by Russian state media in 2023, resurfaced during the Paris Olympics, where Russia has been banned from competing.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee, which severed ties with the IBA last year due to financial and ethical impropriety, has fiercely come to Khelif and Lin's defense, repeatedly declaring the women eligible due to the genders listed on their passports. At a press conference Saturday, IOC President Thomas Bach slammed the incendiary online commentary about the women, chalking it up to \"hate speech.\"\n\n\"We have two boxers who were born as women, who have been raised as women, who have a passport as a woman, and who have competed for many years as women,\" Bach said.\n\nSince the accusations about her gender started in 2023, Khelif has repeatedly rebuked them. On Saturday, Khelif told reporters, \"I want to tell the entire world that I am a female,\" fighting back tears, after her second Paris Olympics win. Khelif's father has also insisted that his daughter is a woman, whom he has raised as a girl. Speaking with Algerian broadcaster SNTV Sunday night, Khelif pleaded for the public to \"avoid bullying all athletes.\"\n\nTaiwan's Lin has thanked her fans for their support in recent days. She reportedly took up boxing as a child to protect her mother from domestic violence.\n\nThe IBA has had its legitimacy questioned in recent years.\n\nAfter temporarily being suspended by the IOC in 2019, the IOC stopped recognizing the association formally last year. A report the IOC produced last year alleged that the IBA participated in years of financial and ethical impropriety. USA Boxing, the sport's U.S. governing body, also cut ties with the association last year, citing the \"ongoing failures of IBA leadership.\"\n\nIOC spokesperson Mark Adams called the IBA's eligibility tests \"flawed\" and \"not legitimate\" at a press conference Sunday.\n\nThe IBA reaffirmed its decision to disqualify Khelif and Lin from the 2023 competition last week, saying in a statement the pair also failed similar eligibility tests at its Women's World Boxing Championships in Istanbul in 2022. The body didn't take any action against Khelif and Lin after the first tests, which allegedly showed the same results as last year's tests. The timing of the disqualification, which came just days after Khelif beat an otherwise undefeated Russian boxer, has also been questioned.\n\nA hastily called press conference by the IBA in Paris on Monday shed little light on the allegations as association president Kremlev answered several questions with rambling remarks against the Olympics, which he compared to Sodom and Gomorrah, biblical cities destroyed due to their notorious sinfulness.\n\nAs false accusations about Khelif and Lin spread worldwide last week, frequent critics of transgender rights, including Elon Musk and the \"Harry Potter\" author J.K. Rowling, quickly weighed in.\n\n\"A young female boxer has just had everything she's worked and trained for snatched away because you allowed a male to get in the ring with her,\" Rowling wrote following Khelif's first win last week.\n\nSome leading politicians in the West, including former President Donald Trump, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., were also quick to comment on the matter.\n\n\"I will keep men out of women's sports!\" Trump wrote on his social media site, Truth Social, in all caps.\n\nNikki Hiltz, a nonbinary American runner participating in this Olympics, appeared to defend Khelif and Lin on Tuesday after advancing to the semifinals in the women's 1500-meter race.\n\n\"There's a lot of ignorance and hate out there right now,\" Hiltz wrote on Instagram. \"For those who identify as nonbinary or trans and are doing cool things in the world (which is most likely all of you because all queer people are cool AF) remember you are magic and that it's not the critic who counts.\"\n\nAfter more information about the scrutinized boxers and the controversial history of the IBA came to light, some who initially criticized Khelif and Lin apologized.\n\n\"Oopsies,\" American influencer and professional boxer Logan Paul wrote on X in all caps at the end of last week. \"I might be guilty of spreading misinformation along with the entirety of this app.\"\n\nAnd at least one newspaper had to issue a correction due to misidentifying Khelif as transgender.

The Algerian boxer faced off against her Thai rival on Tuesday evening (August 6) in Paris, having already secured at least a bronze medal.\n\nNow, she's set her sights on more after triumphing over Suwannapheng.\n\nKhelif dominated the first two rounds of the match, winning every judge's scorecard from the first round and repeating the feat in the second after landing several impressive hits. Despite Suwannapheng's desperate attempts to turn the tide in the final round, she failed to knockout Khelif.\n\nREAD MORE: Imane Khelif's dad shows Olympic boxer's birth certificate after IBO chief said prove it\n\nREAD MORE: Inside Team GB star's bitter rivalry that is set to reach boiling point in Paris\n\nKhelif will now looks forward to Friday's final where she'll face either Chen Nien-chin or Yang Liu.\n\nHowever, Khelif's journey to the final hasn't been without controversy. Her opening round bout with Italian competitor Angela Carini was halted after less than a minute, leading many to question her eligibility for the championships, reports the Mirror.\n\nThis comes after the International Boxing Association (IBA) disqualified her from competing in 2023. Khelif was one of two female fighters who failed an unspecified gender test during last year's world championships in Delhi.\n\nDespite this, the IBA is no longer recognised as the governing body for amateur boxing due to concerns over finances, governance, ethics, refereeing and judging. As the International Olympic Committee has different eligibility criteria, Khelif was allowed to compete in Paris.\n\nKhelif's journey became more tumultuous following IBA chief Umar Kremlev's bizarre outburst. Addressing gender test failures by Khelif and Lin-Yu ting during a press briefing, he declared, \"The tests show they were men.\"\n\n\"We don't verify what they have between their legs. We don't know if they were born like that, or if some changes were made. The second tests confirmed the first tests. If people have doubts, refer to them. They can make their own tests.\"\n\nIn the wake of the controversy, Khelif's father also stepped up recently. He reportedly provided a document to Mail Online, verifying that his daughter has been biologically female since birth.\n\nAhead of their semi-final clash, Suwannapheng praised her competitor with heartfelt words: \"Imane is a little girl that has loved sport since she was six-years-old, she used to play football. These critics and rumours aim to destabilise Imane, they don't want her to be the champion of the world.\"\n\n\"I tell her prove them wrong in the ring and I hope that she will honour Algeria and Arabic countries and win the gold medal.

Lin is guaranteed at least a bronze medal after advancing to the semifinal round of the featherweight division; she will fight Esra Yildiz Kahraman of Turkey on Wednesday. Both competed in the women's division, despite recent allegations from the International Boxing Association (IBA) that they are not women. Regardless of which color medal either boxer wins in Paris, opinions about gender determination will likely remain one of the legacies of the Paris 2024 Olympics. \"I had heard about the news regarding her, but I wasn't following it closely. She is a woman, but she is very strong,\" Suwannapheng said of Khelif after the bout.\n\nIn the famed Roland-Garros tennis stadium, where one of the courts was reframed with a boxing ring, fans came out in force to support Khelif. Chants of \"Imane, Imane, Imane\" drowned out the bell at the end of the three rounds, and when the final unanimous decision was announced, Khelif jumped up and down in the ring and pumped her fists.\n\n\"What she went through was on a whole other scale,\" says Imane Megharbi, an influencer from Algeria. \"She was being harassed by international celebrities, which was very sad and very unfortunate, because she was focused on one goal, and she has been working for years to be at the Olympics. And finally, when she's here, she's been attacked unfairly.\"\n\nRead More: The IBA Held a Press Conference About Boxing's Gender Controversy. It Was a Chaotic Mess\n\nBoth Khelif and Lin have competed for years in the women's divisions for years, including at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago, where neither medaled. (Khelif finished fifth in her weight class.) But questions about their sex were catalyzed by the IBA last year when the group, which is the international governing body for boxing, disqualified Khelif and Lin from its world championships, claiming the two women had failed eligibility tests establishing their gender. Khelif has declined to answer questions about any tests the IBA claims to have administered. The IBA held a press conference in Paris in which they didn't provide any additional documentation on this testing or clarify the reasons for the disqualifications. IBA officials only stated that the two boxers were \"destroying sport, especially feminine sport.\" They continued their claims that Khelif and Lin may be transgender, despite statements from each of the athletes' representatives stating they were born as women and grew up as women.\n\nThe IBA's claims fueled a firestorm of unfounded opinions online, including by conservative politicians claiming the women are transgender and Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling, whose previous statements on transgender issues have disaffected many fans. At issue is whether there are biological criteria for determining sex, since chromosomes, genitalia, and hormones can vary widely within gender.\n\nDr. Eric Vilain, director of the Institute for Clinical and Translational Science at University of California, Irvine, who has conducted extensive research on disorders of sexual development, says that there is no single test, or even series of tests for definitively determining sex. Chromosomes, hormones, the receptors for those hormones, and genitalia all play a part, and within each of those parameters, there is wide variation. \"For example, there are not just XX and XY chromosomes, but in a number of individuals there is a mosaic of XXY or XYY; some individuals have both testes and ovaries in the same body; and hormones vary widely depending on individuals,\" he says. \"So the idea that one parameter such as sex chromosomes determines the sex of an individual and can form the basis of making them ineligible is just wrong.\"\n\nVilain served as a medical expert on an IOC committee that in 2015 established a framework for considering sex assignment and hyperandrogenism (high levels of testosterone). He says based on the variability and the range of biological factors involved in sex determination, the IOC in 1999 abandoned sex testing, which primarily relied on chromosomes. In 2021, the 2015 framework was updated with the Fairness, Inclusion and Non-Discrimination on the Basis of Sex Identity and Sex Variations guidelines. In it, however, the IOC leaves the primary responsibility for determining sex up to individual sport federations, which have in turn interpreted the IOC's framework in varying ways. World Aquatics, which oversees water sports such as swimming, for instance, focuses on puberty as a pivotal criterion, while World Athletics, which has responsibility for track, zeroes in on testosterone levels in combination with a list of XY-based disorders of sexual development.\n\nRead More: The Insidious Scrutiny of Female Athletes' Bodies\n\nVilain applauds the IOC supporting Khelif and Lin, but hopes the organization provides more detail about the criteria it used in allowing Khelif and Lin to compete. That way, it could serve as a template for future determinations and not open athletes up to the questions, and \"bullying,\" as Khelif called it, that she and Lin experienced. \"My hope is that once we have this explanation, they should apply it at least during the Olympics to all of the athletes [including those] with differences in sexual development who might have been excluded based on rulings that varied from one federation to another and weren't scientifically based,\" he says.\n\nKhelif's first bout in Paris, against Italy's Angela Carini, lasted only 46 seconds - Carini pulled out of the fight after receiving some punches from Khelif. \"I couldn't breathe anymore. I thought about my family, I looked at my brother in the stands and I went to my corner to retire...I've never been hit with such a powerful punch,\" she said, according to Italian sports newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport.\n\nCarini, who learned to box from her father and brother, maintained that her decision to leave the fight and not shake Khelif's hand when she left the ring was not related to questions about Khelif's gender, saying, \"It wasn't something I intended to do. I don't have anything against [Khelif]. Actually, if I were to meet her again, I would embrace her.\"\n\nKhelif praised the IOC for its support. The IOC removed the IBA from the Olympics as amateur boxing's international governing body in 2019 over concerns about corruption and questions about its impartiality. And in a press conference in Paris, IOC president Thomas Bach called the group's allegations \"hate speech\" and denounced them as \"totally unacceptable.\" \"We have two women who are born as women, who have been raised as women, who have a passport as a woman and have competed for many years as women,\" he said.\n\nRead More: Taiwan Turns Against J.K. Rowling for Stirring Olympic Boxing Gender Controversy\n\nAvoiding most of the media flurry in Paris in order to focus on her bouts, Khelif pleaded in a broadcast interview after her quarterfinal bout \"to all the people of the world to uphold the Olympic principles and the Olympic Charter, to refrain from bullying all athletes, because this has effects, massive effects. It can destroy people, it can kill people's thoughts, spirit and mind.\"\n\nIn 2023, Khelif was named a UNICEF ambassador and hopes to continue promoting sports for young girls, after her experience of initially being discouraged to pursue boxing by her father. Growing up in a rural village in western Algeria, Khelif began playing soccer but was bullied by boys when her natural athletic abilities began overshadowing them. She shared with UNICEF that when those boys began fighting with her, she was able to dodge their attacks, which steered her toward boxing. Her father didn't approve of her taking up the sport, and she and her mother took on odd jobs, including selling scrap metal and couscous, to raise enough money for the bus fare Khelif needed to train in a nearby village.\n\nNow, both parents support her Olympic dream. \"Imane is an example of Algerian women. She is one of the heroines of Algeria,\" her father Omar said to RFI after Khelif's quarterfinal win over Anna Luca Hamori of Hungary guaranteed her an Olympic medal. At the club where Khelif first honed her boxing skills, a coach discounted the gender uproar. \"Their objective is clear: it is done to confuse her and make her forget why she came to the Olympics.\"\n\nMany of the fans in the crowd at Roland-Garros waving Algerian flags were women, who now see Khelif as a symbol of female empowerment. \"You can't imagine the scale of people [in Algeria who are supporting Khelif],\" says Megharbi. \"Not only because she's Algerian, but because she's a woman. Even if the whole world, the entire world is against you, your country is behind you. Algerian women are behind you.

She was disqualified from the 2023 women's world championships after IBA testing, and the scrutiny increased after Italian boxer Angela Carini withdrew and forfeited early in their match in the Olympics.\n\nThe reason for Khelif's disqualification in 2023 was because testing showed she had an XY chromosome. However, she has identified as a woman since birth, and the presence of XY chromosomes in cisgender women is a known medical phenomenon called Swyer syndrome. The IBA has not released any further details on the disqualifying test.\n\nThe backlash was fierce as many labeled Khelif as transgender. As she advanced in the Olympics, the outcry continued, and she issued a message during an interview about bullying athletes.\n\n\"I send a message to all the people of the world to uphold the Olympic principles and the Olympic Charter, to refrain from bullying all athletes, because this has effects, massive effects,\" Khelif said in Arabic, per the Associated Press. \"It can destroy people, it can kill people's thoughts, spirit and mind. It can divide people. And because of that, I ask them to refrain from bullying.\"\n\nShe added: \"I am in contact with my family two days a week. I hope that they weren't affected deeply.

God willing, this crisis will culminate in a gold medal, and that would be the best response.\"\n\nThe IBA - with which the IOC cut ties due to corruption and lack of transparency - added to the controversy late last week. During a press conference, the organization created more confusion with comments about both Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting, who was also disqualified in 2023 due to testing.\n\n\"We didn't check what was between their legs,\" said Umar Kremlev, President of the IBA, regarding the status of Khelif and Yu-ting, per Jonathan Crane. \"They have men's levels of testosterone.

The talk about her was a loss for everyone.", "body": "Sorry, a summary is not available for this article at this time. Please try again later.\n\nA few days ago, I sought out and watched a boxing match from 2021: Algerian boxer Imane Khelif's Olympic debut in Tokyo, long before she became a household name, and a symbol of gender identity wars, and caused Fox News panelists to lose their minds on national television.\n\nIn the quarterfinals, Khelif fought Kellie Harrington of Ireland. Almost as soon as the match began, the announcer declared that Harrington had the \"superior skill set,\" while Khelif was \"awkward.\" Harrington tidily defeated Khelif in the first round and only increased her advantage in the second. Harrington's punches were sharp and focused; Khelif's were sloppy. By the third round, Khelif was \"simply outclassed,\" the announcer declared. When Khelif managed to land a single punch, Harrington appeared to laugh in amusement at her opponent's insufficient effort. Harrington won the match in a unanimous decision.\n\nThe bout was, in other words, the total opposite of the narrative that has dominated the 2024 Games: that Khelif is some kind of biological mutant, against whom \"real\" women don't stand a chance.\n\nOn Tuesday, Khelif decisively won her match against Thailand's Janjaem Suwannapheng, and she will now move forward to the bout for the gold later this week. She flung her arms up in joy, and the stadium -- comprised disproportionately of Algerian fans, it seemed -- cheered on her victory.\n\nBut the path to that moment of celebration has been horrible. A contemptible episode that flies in the face of everything the Olympics represent -- including, I might add, a showcase for all of the marvelous and diverse forms the female human body can take, from the pint-size power of Simone Biles to the massive wingspan of 7-foot-3 women's basketballer Zhang Ziyu. The saga might end happily for someone, but getting there has make me feel badly for almost everyone involved.\n\nAbove all, for Khelif herself, who committed no infraction other than to compete in the body she was born in, under the gender classification she has always competed in, under rules that permitted her to do so. Watching her win her second match, on Saturday -- against a Hungarian fighter who had used social media to present Khelif as a predatory beast -- felt prurient and sad. The tears Khelif cried did not look happy; they looked exhausted. \"I want to tell the entire world that I am a female,\" she told reporters immediately after the match, and it was hard to imagine a more humiliating declaration anyone could be forced to make on the heels of victory.\n\nSkip to end of carousel\n\nThe Style section\n\nStyle is where The Washington Post covers happenings on the front lines of culture and what it all means, including the arts, media, social trends, politics and yes, fashion, all told with personality and deep reporting.

And for the International Olympic Committee, now asked daily to defend its inclusion of Khelif (and Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-Ting), and to comment on unspecified sex tests that were administered by a different, since-disgraced organization. Tests that are \"not legitimate\" and \"so flawed that it's impossible to engage with it,\" as an IOC spokesperson put it over the weekend.\n\nI feel bad for Italy's Angela Carini, whose dramatic exit from the competition after just 46 seconds in the ring with Khelif inadvertently launched this whole controversy last week.\n\nShortly after their match began, Carini said she'd \"never felt a punch\" like Khelif's and withdrew from competition, refusing to shake her opponent's hand. This promptly turned her into an unwitting poster girl for the anti-Khelif set, who cast Carini as a dainty heroine taking a principled stand. Later, Carini apologized, explaining that her behavior in the ring hadn't been political; it had merely been poor sportsmanship. In the moment, she'd been devastated to see her own Olympic dreams evaporate, she said. But she thought Khelif should be allowed to compete, and if the athletes met again, \"I would embrace her.\"\n\nBy then it was too late. Author J.K. Rowling had already posted a photo on X of Khelif and Carini after their match, writing, \"Could any picture sum up our new men's rights movement better? The smirk of a male who's knows he's protected by a misogynist sporting establishment enjoying the distress of a woman he's just punched in the head.\"\n\nThe fact that Khelif appeared to be consoling Carini, not smirking, was the least of this tweet's misinformation. The broader problem is that Khelif is not a man. She was born female. Raised as a woman. Her birth certificate and passport say she is a woman. She has been publicly competing as a woman for years, winning against other women but losing to them, too: \"Keep the head high champ!\" posted Irish boxer Amy Broadhurst in support of Khelif, whom Broadhurst defeated at the 2022 World Championships.\n\nKhelif's womanhood was never in question until she defeated Russian superstar Azalia Amineva last year. At that point, the International Boxing Association, an organization with Russian ties, vaguely declared that Khelif failed \"to meet the required necessary eligibility criteria and were found to have competitive advantages over other female competitors.\"\n\n\"Other\" is an interesting inclusion in this sentence. Because while it declares that Khelif should not be allowed to compete with women, it also declares that she is a woman. She was just not, apparently, the right kind of woman for the IBA. She was not, apparently, the right kind of woman for people like Rowling, whose position on gender is usually that sex cannot be changed, and is immutably determined at birth. Khelif was identified female at birth, but ... would Rowling prefer she undergo surgery to compete as a man?\n\nOr would Khelif's detractors prefer she simply never get to compete at all? Never take up any kind of space? (Ding ding ding.)\n\nWhen the South African runner Caster Semenya underwent similarly invasive questioning about her gender several years ago, I wrote a column lamenting the way that her alleged genetic differences were pathologized while those of other athletes, such as Michael Phelps, were celebrated.\n\nI won't repeat myself here, except to say that, in addition to feeling bad for Khelif, Lin, Algeria, Taiwan, Carini and the IOC, the saga of Khelif and Lin also makes me feel bad for women in general.\n\nBecause the conversations about Khelif have far broader implications than this case alone. The biggest tragedy isn't that detractors are questioning whether Khelif should be permitted to box. The biggest tragedy is that detractors are boxing in women. Determining that female athletes must look and behave a certain way. Declaring that anyone who doesn't fit a particular mold should be hauled into a clinic for an invasive series of exams. Deciding that, if certain female athletes get too good, then they must not be women at all.\n\nBut back to Khelif's 2021 fight, which now feels like Chekhov's gun, an uneasy premonition of what was to come. \"That is what you call a learning fight,\" the announcer said. He remarked that Khelif, then 22, had \"youth on her side.\"\n\nHe may have been assuming that she would go back to Algeria, train up, learn from her mistakes, then reappear three years later for a more successful run at a medal.\n\nWhich is exactly what she did. And it's devastating that the pursuit became such a godawful mess.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "monica_hesse@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Monica Hesse", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kellie_Harrington", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kellie Harrington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angela Carini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Broadhurst", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amy Broadhurst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsmanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sportsmanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has said they both have met all criteria and that there's no question they are women.\n\nIn an interview with 'SNTV', Khelif, in Arabic, issued the following statement:\n\n\"I send a message to all the people of the world to uphold the Olympic principles and the Olympic Charter, to refrain from bullying all athletes, because this has effects, massive effects. It can destroy people, it can kill people's thoughts, spirit and mind. It can divide people.

I came here for a medal, and to compete for a medal. I will certainly be competing to improve (and) be better, and God willing, I will improve, like every other athlete.\"\n\nConcluding the boxer shared (h/t MMAJunkie):\n\n\"I know that the Olympic Committee has done me justice, and I am happy with this remedy because it shows the truth.

On Tuesday, Khelif won over her semi final bout in the women's 66kg competition against Thai boxer Janjaem Suwannapheng, taking her through to the final on Aug. 9.\n\nKhelif, who broke down in tears after winning the quarter-final boxing match against Hungary's Anna Luca Hamori last Saturday, was once again welcomed in the ring by loud cheers from a hugely supportive crowd and numerous Algerian flags being waved.\n\nThe Algerian boxed opened up yesterday in an interview with SNTV, a sports video partner of The Associated Press, about how she's felt about the online bullying over claims that she shouldn't be competing in the women's boxing competition.\n\nThe gender eligibility row broke out after following her victory over Italy's Angela Carini in a bout that lasted less than a minute and alluded to the fact that she was disqualified at last year's Women's World Championships, along with Taiwan's Lin Yu\u2011ting, after two separate tests revealed that they both had elevated levels of testosterone in their systems. Some prominent figures such as J.K. Rowling and Elon Musk also fueled the controversy on social media, accusing her of competing in the wrong gender category.\n\nIn the SNTV interview which was conducted in Arabic, Khelif claimed that her family was worried about her. \"God willing, this crisis will culminate in a gold medal, and that would be the best response,\" she said. \"I send a message to all the people of the world to uphold the Olympic principles and the Olympic Charter, to refrain from bullying all athletes, because this has effects, massive effects.\"\n\nKhelif said bullying \"can destroy people, it can kill people's thoughts, spirit and mind. It can divide people. And because of that, I ask them to refrain from bullying.\" She also thanked the Olympic Committee for doing her \"justice.\"\n\nThomas Bach, the president of the International Olympic Commitee, has indeed had her back. In a press briefing hours before Khelif's quater-final bout, he said Khelif was entitled to compete in the women's boxing competition because she was born and raised as a woman, has competed as such in the past, and is registered as a woman on her passport. Bach suggested the controversy stemmed from a \"politically motivated cultural war\" and denounced the \"hate speech with this aggression and abuse\" spreading on social media and the way it's \"fueled by this agenda is totally unacceptable.\"\n\nThe International Boxing Association reacted a couple days later with a press conference held in Paris with managing director Chris Roberts and Ioannis Filippatos, the former head of the IBA's medical committee who both reiterated claims that tests had been conducted on Khelif and Yu\u2011ting in Istanbul and India and had found that both boxers had XY chromosomes and had been given the opportunity to appeal the findings to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Roberts said Khelif appealed the decision but then withdrew.\n\nBach has suggested the row served the agenda of the International Boxing Association, which has been banned from the Olympics since June 2023 due to its ties to the Kremlin, management by presidents from Uzbekistan and Russia, as well as the fact that it's backed by Russian state energy firm Gazprom.\n\n\"What we have seen from the Russian side and in particular from the International Federation, from which we had to withdraw their recognition for many reasons that they have undertaken way before these games with a defamation campaign against France, against the games against the against the IOC,\" said Bach.", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angela Carini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberbullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyberbullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arabic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Charter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Charter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Testosterone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Paris Olympics will rage on by winning her way through to a gold medal bout.\n\nThe 25-year-old was banned from competing by the International Boxing Association last year after gender tests reportedly revealed she had male XY chromosomes but the International Olympic Committee has allowed her to compete in the female division due to her passport listing her gender as female.\n\nAnother boxer banned by the IBA over gender eligibility, Lin Yu-ting of Chinese Taipei, will be looking to punch her ticket to the final in the women's featherweight divison on day 12.\n\nIn front of raucous Algerian support, Khelif comfortably accounted for Janjaem Suwannapheng of Thailand in their women's welterweight semi-final on day 11, setting up a final against China's Yang Liu.\n\nThe win is the latest in a series of dominant performances for Khelif, who will come into the final as the hot favourite.\n\nThe storm over Khelif's eligibility reached new heights when Italy's Angela Carini opted to abandon their round of 16 bout only 46 seconds in, saying she had \"never been hit so hard in my life\".\n\nThe IBA called a press conference in Paris over the controversy earlier this week, with president Umar Kremlev saying the decision to allow the pair to compete was \"destroying the sport.\"\n\nBut an IOC statement earlier in the games criticised the IBA's process over the decision, saying the pair were the victim of a \"sudden and arbitrary decision\" and had been denied due process.", "source": {"uri": "perthnow.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Perth Now"}, "authors": [],

She'll fight for a gold medal later this week.\n\nAs Khelif has become a polarising figure at this Olympics, she has fought better and better, and she easily moved through the semifinal bout. Late in the fight, she knocked Suwannapheng back, forcing a count from the official. After the bout, she hugged her coaches while music blared and Algerian fans danced in the aisles.\n\nKhelif skipped victorious circles around the ring and then left the arena to fans still calling her name.\n\nKhelif and Taiwanese 57 kg boxer Lin Yu Ting have been the targets of what the International Olympic Committee has described as \"hate speech\" and \"abuse\" because they were disqualified from last year's world championships, for what the International Boxing Association described \"a failure to meet eligibility rules\".\n\nImane Khelif after winning the Women's 66kg Quarter-final round match against Anna Luca Hamori on Hungary on August 3.\n\nUmar Kremlev, the Russian sports minister who runs the IBA, and other IBA officials have said the tests showed the women, who are not transgender, have XY chromosomes, suggesting they held a testosterone-based advantage over other women, who typically have XX chromosomes. The IBA has not produced proof of the test results, including during a Paris news conference on Monday.\n\nThe controversy ignited last week, when Italian boxer Angela Carini quit her fight with Khelif after taking a punch less than a minute into the bout. A barrage of attacks followed, including from former President Donald Trump, author J.K. Rowling and billionaire Elon Musk, creating a ferocious debate about gender in sports.\n\nThe IOC cut ties with the IBA last year, citing Kremlev's close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, financial irregularities and allegations of election rigging to keep Kremlev in power. IOC officials say Kremlev and the IBA, and therefore any tests they say they administered, are not credible.\n\n\"The method of the testing, the idea of the testing, which happened overnight - is not legitimate,\" IOC spokesman Mark Adams said.\n\nExecutives from the IOC and USA Boxing, which is working to develop a new federation to run Olympic boxing, say Kremlev's goal is to disrupt the Paris Olympics, in which neither the IBA nor Russia is participating.\n\nAt their news conference this week, Kremlev and other IBA officials claimed tests dating back to the 2022 world championships suggested the two fighters had an advantage, and they said they were worried about the safety of other female fighters at the Olympics. But they never acted on these concerns in the months leading up to the 2023 world championships. The two boxers, who had fought for years without issue until the 2023 disqualification, were allowed to fight after the disqualifications as well.\n\nIOC and USA Boxing officials have pointed out that the disqualifications came just three days after Khelif beat Russian boxer Azalia Amineva, removing the only blemish from Amineva's still-undefeated record.\n\nLin's semifinal bout against Turkey's Esra Yildiz Kahraman is tonight.", "source": {"uri": "newstalkzb.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewstalkZB"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umar_Kremlev", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Umar Kremlev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angela Carini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hate speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Please try again later.\n\nWith thousands of Algerian fans waving flags and chanting her name, Algerian boxer Imane Khelif easily beat Janjeam Suwannapheng of Thailand in a unanimous decision Tuesday night to advance to the finals of the women's 66kg competition. She'll fight for a gold medal on Friday.\n\nAs Khelif has become a polarizing figure at this Olympics, she has fought better and better, and she easily moved through the semifinal bout. Late in the fight, she knocked Suwannapheng back, forcing a count from the official. After the bout, she hugged her coaches while music blared and Algerian fans danced in the aisles.\n\nKhelif skipped victorious circles around the ring and then left the arena to fans still calling her name.\n\nKhelif and Taiwanese 57 kg boxer Lin Yu Ting have been the targets of what the International Olympic Committee has described as \"hate speech\" and \"abuse\" because they were disqualified from last year's world championships, for what the International Boxing Association described \"a failure to meet eligibility rules.\"\n\nUmar Kremlev, the Russian sports minister who runs the IBA, and other IBA officials have said the tests showed the women, who are not transgender, have XY chromosomes, suggesting they held a testosterone-based advantage over other women, who typically have XX chromosomes. The IBA has not produced proof of the test results, including during a Paris press conference on Monday.\n\nThe controversy ignited last Thursday, when Italian boxer Angela Carini quit her fight with Khelif after taking a punch less than a minute into the bout. A barrage of attacks followed, including from former president Donald Trump, author J.K. Rowling and billionaire Elon Musk, creating a ferocious debate about gender in sports.\n\nThe IOC cut ties with the IBA last year, citing Kremlev's close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, financial irregularities and allegations of election-rigging to keep Kremlev in power. IOC officials say Kremlev and the IBA, and therefore any tests they say they administered, are not credible.\n\n\"The method of the testing, the idea of the testing, which happened overnight - is not legitimate,\" IOC spokesman Mark Adams said Sunday.\n\nExecutives from the IOC and USA Boxing, which is working to develop a new federation to run Olympic boxing, say Kremlev's goal is to disrupt the Paris Olympics, in which neither the IBA nor Russia is participating.\n\nAt their press conference on Monday, Kremlev and other IBA officials claimed tests dating back to the 2022 world championships suggested the two fighters had an advantage, and they said they were worried about the safety of other female fighters at the Olympics. But they never acted on these concerns in the months leading up to the 2023 world championships. The two boxers, who had fought for years without issue until the 2023 disqualification, were allowed to fight after the disqualifications as well.\n\nIOC and USA Boxing officials have pointed out that the disqualifications came just three days after Khelif beat Russian boxer Azalia Amineva, removing the only blemish from Amineva's still-undefeated record.\n\nLin's semifinal bout against Turkey's Esra Yildiz Kahraman is Wednesday night.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "les_carpenter@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Les Carpenter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Carini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angela Carini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hate speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

She was disqualified from the 2023 women's world championships after IBA testing, and the scrutiny increased after Italian boxer Angela Carini withdrew and forfeited early in their match in the Olympics.\n\nThe reason for Khelif's disqualification in 2023 was because testing showed she had an XY chromosome. However, she has identified as a woman since birth, and the presence of XY chromosomes in cisgender women is a known medical phenomenon called Swyer syndrome. The IBA has not released any further details on the disqualifying test.\n\nThe backlash was fierce as many labeled Khelif as transgender. As she advanced in the Olympics, the outcry continued, and she issued a message during an interview about bullying athletes.\n\n\"I send a message to all the people of the world to uphold the Olympic principles and the Olympic Charter, to refrain from bullying all athletes, because this has effects, massive effects,\" Khelif said in Arabic, per the Associated Press. \"It can destroy people, it can kill people's thoughts, spirit and mind. It can divide people. And because of that, I ask them to refrain from bullying.\"\n\nShe added: \"I am in contact with my family two days a week. I hope that they weren't affected deeply. They are worried about me. God willing, this crisis will culminate in a gold medal, and that would be the best response.\"\n\nThe IBA - with which the IOC cut ties due to corruption and lack of transparency - added to the controversy late last week. During a press conference, the organization created more confusion with comments about both Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting, who was also disqualified in 2023 due to testing.\n\n\"We didn't check what was between their legs,\" said Umar Kremlev, President of the IBA, regarding the status of Khelif and Yu-ting, per Jonathan Crane. \"They have men's levels of testosterone. We don't know if there were born like men or some changes intervened [sic] at a later stage.\"\n\nKhelif and Suannpheng will square off Tuesday afternoon, with the winner advancing to the gold medal match in the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Despite making history with her recent successes, the Algerian athlete's victories have been partly overshadowed by a media storm since 2 August, when Italy's Angela Carini pulled out of their fight after just 46 seconds, claiming she had \"never felt a punch like [it] in my life\". Her words were promptly used to justify widespread speculation about Khelif's identity - including the mistaken assertion that she is transgender - and triggered a wave of discourse around women and sport, much of it vitriolic, with decidedly sexist, transphobic and racist overtones.\n\nFurther fuel has been added to the fire thanks to the lack of alignment between the International Olympic Committee and the International Boxing Association. The latter banned Khelif from competing at the 2023 Women's World Championships in New Delhi after she reportedly failed eligibility tests, but the accuracy and validity of those assessments is hotly debated - and although IBA president Umar Kremlev has claimed that Khelif has XY chromosomes, this has yet to be substantiated by Khelif herself, who was born, raised and identifies as a woman. Critically, the IBA is no longer recognised as a legitimate governing body by the Olympic games, in part due to a perceived lack of integrity and transparency around its practices - a decision upheld even after the IBA legally challenged the IOC on the matter through the Court of Arbitration for Sport this spring.\n\nAs for the criteria for women's boxing at Paris 2024: typically, the Olympics requires International Sports Federations (eg, World Athletics) to decide individual's eligibility for gender categories in their respective sports. However, since the IBA no longer has Olympic oversight, the IOC's own members determined that all qualifying competitors would be accepted for women's boxing, assuming their passports identified them as female. IOC President Thomas Bach has wholeheartedly defended Khelif's right to compete under these guidelines, which - to be clear - would allow her to participate regardless of whether she has any form of DSD (Differences in Sex Development) or not.\n\nImpressively, Khelif has remained a model of good sportsmanship throughout all of this. \"I send a message to all the people of the world to uphold the Olympic principles and the Olympic charter, to refrain from bullying all athletes, because this has effects, massive effects,\" she told The Associated Press's SNTV on Monday. \"It can destroy people, it can kill people's thoughts, spirit and mind. It can divide people. And because of that, I ask them to refrain from bullying... God willing, this crisis will culminate in a gold medal, and that would be the best response.\" She also thanked the Olympic committee for its continued support over the weekend. \"I am grateful to the IOC, who spoke the truth,\" she told reporters in the Olympic Village. \"I am very proud to represent Algeria. Thanks to God, this is the first women's medal for boxing in Algeria. In the Olympics, there are no easy passes. Hopefully I will be ready for the next match for my country that I love so much. And I hope it will be a good one for the next generation.\"\n\nCarini, meanwhile, has apologised for her role in initiating the backlash: \"All this controversy certainly made me sad, and I also felt sorry for my opponent. She had nothing to do with it and, like me, was only here to fight,\" she reflected while speaking to the Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport. \"It was not intentional; in fact, I apologise to her and to everyone... I was angry, because my Games had already gone up in smoke. I have nothing against Khelif; on the contrary, if I happened to meet her again, I would give her a hug.\"", "source": {"uri": "vogue.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "British Vogue"}, "authors":

She is now three rounds from gold. 'I don't care,' she declared to her doubters.\n\nThe Algerian, 25, cruised to a unanimous victory over Thailand's Janjaem Suwannapheng, who simply had no answers to her opponent's speed and power.\n\nThe questions for Games bosses, however, will now grow even louder.\n\nKhelif was banned from last year's World Championships by Russian-led governing body IBA after failing a gender test shortly before she was due to fight for a gold medal.\n\nAccording to the IBA, which was stripped of the right to run boxing at the Games amid corruption and governance issues, she was found to have the male 'XY' chromosome.\n\nHowever, no such tests have been carried out at Paris 2024, with eligibility based around which sex is listed in a participant's passport.\n\nKhelif, who comprehensively stamped her ticket to the final, had a two-inch height advantage and was roared on by a noisy Algerian contingent. She has rapidly become a hero in the country.\n\nShe has also now won 12 straight bouts and will return to this tennis landmark, which has taken over from the North Paris Arena, for the final set on Friday night.\n\n'I don't care what anyone is saying about me with the controversy,' she said. 'All that is important to me is that I stay on the level and give my people the performance they deserve. I know I'm a talented person and this is a gift to all Algerians.'\n\nFrom the opening bell, that gift was being wrapped. Khelif took immediate control. The left jab-right hand combination we saw in her previous fights were again in full flow. She landed clean, big shots and forced the Thai into a rare standing eight-count in the last round of what was largely a no-contest.\n\nWhen the verdict came in Khelif she launched into a delighted victory jig, with a beaming smile.\n\nThere not be many of those in the International Olympic Committee's plush hotel suites. The prospect of gold for Khelif is likely to cause a continued headache for IOC bosses, who have been forced to defend her presence in Paris on an almost-daily basis.\n\nThey will have to do so again, no doubt, although this was a performance not without a high level of skill.\n\nEyes will now turn to the second boxer who failed the gender test at World Championships, Taiwan's Lin Yu-Ting, who fights her semi-final Wednesday against Turkey's Esra Yildiz Kahraman.\n\nKhelif will fight China's Yang Liu in the final.\n\nEarlier, Lewis Richardson suffered a cruel split decision defeat to Mexico's Marco Verde as Team GB's boxing squad ended the competition with a solitary bronze.\n\nThe Colchester light-middleweight, could feel incredibly hard done by after a gutsy performance that was somehow not enough to land a place in the final.\n\nTo many onlookers, Richardson appeared to have secured a shot at gold with a composed performance behind an improving jab. But the judges, in front of a raucous Mexican support, had other ideas.\n\n'It's devastating, it's raw,' Richardson said. 'I've stepped out the ring moments ago so emotions are very high. I'm obviously disappointed to miss out on the final and box for a gold on Friday night.'\n\nRichardson did reflect that he had performed well, and that his efforts had ensured that if the Brits were to land a medal the only way would be Essex. His solo effort, however, is five less than the two-of-each-colour haul in Tokyo.\n\n'I hope to look back and be really proud of what I have achieved because I have created history within my city, Colchester, he said. 'I'm the only British boxer to medal at these Games so hopefully I will look back with pride and happiness in the future.'", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

This leads to the development of male characteristics, including an increase in muscle mass.\n\nSouth African middle-distance runner Caster Semenya was previously diagnosed with the condition, which led to her being disqualified from athletics competitions due to her elevated testosterone levels.\n\nIt is estimated that approximately one to two in every 100 people in the US are born with an intersex gender, or DSD.\n\nIntersex women have defended Khelif, saying she should be allowed to compete in her category because she is a woman. Pictured on the left is Alyssa Ball, an activist for the intersex community, and on the right is Hannah Twigg, an intersex woman from the UK who is raising awareness about the condition.\n\nKhelif was forced to speak out earlier this week, calling on boxing fans to stop bullying the athletes\n\nKhelif, who was registered as female at birth, has been at the centre of a gender row after the IBA disqualified her from the world championships last year. She is pictured at the Paris Olympics\n\nAlyssa Ball, who is also intersex and campaigns for awareness of the condition, told DailyMail.com: 'I feel quite emotionally drained talking about this topic.\n\n'As an intersexual person, I naturally think she should be allowed to participate.\n\n\"Whatever 'advantages' she has, they are comparable to those of anyone else who is born with a body shape best suited for any sport.\"\n\nHowever, Dr Tommy Lundberg, a lecturer in physiology at Sweden's Karolinska Institute, disagreed, arguing that she probably had a biological advantage because she had probably gone through male puberty.\n\nHe said: 'If Khelif is indeed on 5-ARD, then that would be considered male development during puberty and therefore an advantage.\n\n'Being male is not a talent and should not be rewarded more than being female.\n\n\"Including athletes with male performance advantages in women's sports violates the very important principles of fair and safe competition for female athletes.\"\n\nIn tonight's match, Khelif defeated her rival Janjaem Suwannapheng after overpowering the brave opponent and delivering harder blows, eventually winning by unanimous decision.\n\nThe testosterone limit rules had previously been brought into sharp focus by Caster Semenya, who was banned from women's athletics competitions after she was found to have elevated testosterone levels.\n\nShe was cheered by a noisy Algerian crowd, who were already chanting 'Imane' before their boxer entered the arena.\n\nAfter winning, she skipped victoriously around the arena before leaving to loud cheers ahead of her gold medal match on Friday.\n\nFiona McAnena, who works with scientists who research sex differences and is director of the UK women's sport charity Sex Matters, also said she was likely at an advantage.\n\nShe said: 'It is not the fault of these young people that they have a congenital (developmental) defect and are registered as female, while their chromosomes are male. This can be a shocking, surprising and even traumatic thing to discover.\n\nBut apart from that, women's sports are meant for people who have a female advantage and not a male advantage.\n\n\"If athletes have a male advantage and have gone through male puberty, then they do not belong in women's sports.\"\n\nKhelif's condition has not been made public. Experts can only speculate on whether she has a condition, and if so, what it is.\n\nBut a recent change in the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) statement suggests she may be intersex.\n\nOn August 3, they updated a statement saying \"this is not a Discrimination in Sexual Development issue\" to \"this is not a transgender issue.\"\n\nKhelif herself has said that she is a woman and has promised to continue competing.\n\nIn a statement, she said: \"I am sending my message to all people around the world to adhere to the Olympic principles, as per the Olympic Charter, and to avoid bullying of athletes, as this has a major impact.\n\n\"It can destroy people, kill people's thinking and spirit, and divide people.\"\n\nShe previously dismissed the decision to ban her from the IBA competition as a \"conspiracy\" to prevent an Algerian from winning.\n\nIn Khelif's native Algeria, there are strict anti-LGBT laws and society does not tolerate transgender people.\n\nThe IOC interprets someone's gender literally based on what is stated in the passport.\n\nThey also organise the women's boxing competition, despite a separate dispute with the IBA, which was barred from involvement.\n\nHowever, in other categories, such as swimming, the federation reserves the right to test athletes if there are concerns they may have a biological advantage.\n\nExperts suggest that the same thing should happen in boxing. They say that a blood test can determine whether someone has gone through male puberty. This test can show higher testosterone levels.", "source": {"uri": "nybreaking.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NY Breaking News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imane Khelif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_muscle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Skeletal muscle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Testosterone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Puberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intersex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_sex-determination_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "XY sex-determination system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorders_of_sex_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disorders of sex development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caster_Semenya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caster Semenya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_verification_in_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sex verification in sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_insensitivity_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Androgen insensitivity syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anatomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_governing_body", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports governing body"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karolinska_Institute", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karolinska Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptorchidism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptorchidism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sex organ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Genderqueer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Genderqueer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Nutrition", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Nutrition", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Male_to_Female", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Male to Female", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://nybreaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Imane-Khelifs-health-is-at-the-center-of-controversy-over.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796155", "eventUri": "eng-9796155", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-03", "textStart": 6076, "textEnd": 6084}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

We have two boxers who were born as women, have been raised as women, who have a passport as a woman, and who have competed for many years as a woman. And this is the clear definition of a woman.\"\n\nThe second boxer, Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan, is scheduled to fight Wednesday in the women's featherweight bout in the 126 lb.

The IOC dropped the association as its boxing authority last year over concerns about finances, governance and judging integrity, replacing it with an ad hoc Paris 2024 unit.\n\nThe IOC has insisted that \"this is not a transgender issue,\" spurring speculation that the fighters may have a Difference of Sexual Development known as 46, XY, which results in ambiguous genitalia at birth but male-level testosterone levels after puberty.\n\nAmar Khelif, the fighter's father, told Reuters that his child is a girl, citing an \"official family document\" showing the newborn's sex listed as \"female.\"\n\n\"Having such a daughter is an honor because she is a champion, she honored me and I encourage her and I hope she will get the medal in Paris,\" he said. \"Imane is a little girl that has loved sport since she was six years old.\"\n\nThe Algerian Olympic and Sports Committee has filed a complaint over online harassment directed at its boxer, while advocates for fairness in women's sports have blasted the Olympic rules allowing the boxers to compete without resolving the gender questions.\n\nLinda Blade, a Canadian athlete, coach and advocate for single-sex female sports, said the match \"reinforces the need for the sex screen.\"\n\n\"If we cannot screen for biological sex, there is no way to know what is happening or if one of the fighters has a categorial advantage,\" she

Here's what we think", "body": "The controversy surrounding Olympian boxer Imane Khelif was amplified tonight after she emphatically beat a Thai woman and advanced to the finals.\n\nThere have been calls for the 5ft 10in Khelif, 25, who is now one win away from Olympic gold, to be banned from competing due to a suggestion she may not be biologically female.\n\nShe is not transgender -- there are photos from her childhood as a little girl -- and Olympic organizers say the Algerian passed all gender eligibility checks.\n\nHowever, Khelif was disqualified from last year's World Championships by Russian-led governing body IBA after failing a gender test shortly before she was due to fight for a gold medal.\n\nSome health experts believe she has a differences in sex development (DSD) disorder, an umbrella term for individuals who have a group of conditions where their reproductive anatomy does not match the typical definition of male or female.\n\nKhelif denies this.\n\nDailyMail.com spoke to two women born with DSDs -- plus doctors -- about whether they think Khelif has an unfair advantage over her female opponents.\n\nImane Khelif pictured celebrating her victory over Thai boxer Janjaem Suwannapheng today\n\nKhelif is facing controversy over her candidacy in the women's boxing\n\nHannah Twigg is an intersex woman from the UK who has a condition called Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS).\n\nIt means that although she has the XY chromosomes of a male, her body does not respond to testosterone because of a genetic mutation.\n\nAs a result, she has developed the traits of a female -- because testosterone has no effect on her sex development.\n\nMs Twigg said: 'I was involved a lot in sports teams in high school, playing on sports teams.\n\nRead More What is a DSD? The condition at the heart of the Olympic boxing controversy\n\n'[But] I never felt as though my condition gave me an advantage or disadvantage in sport.'\n\nShe added: 'I would like to take the opportunity to say that Imane Khelif does not owe anyone an explanation for her gender and identity.'\n\nBecause testosterone does not act on her body, this means she has not gone through the surge in muscle mass that males experience at puberty.\n\nAfter puberty, men have about 40 to 50 percent more muscle mass than women.\n\nSome experts suggest Khelif may have a different condition, however, called 5-Alpha-Reductase Deficiency (5-ARD).\n\nIn this, an individual is biologically male -- with XY chromosomes -- but their body does not respond to a crucial hormone in the womb, leading to the development of a vagina or indeterminate sex organs externally.\n\nInternally, however, they have undescended testicles, which start to release testosterone when someone hits puberty -- leading to the development of male characteristics including a surge in muscle mass.\n\nPreviously, the South African mid-distance runner Caster Semenya was diagnosed with the condition -- which led her to be barred from track events because of elevated testosterone levels.\n\nEstimates suggest about one to two out of every 100 people in the US are born intersex or with DSD.\n\nIntersex women have defended Khelif, saying that she should be allowed to compete in her category because she is a woman. Pictured left is Alyssa Ball, an activist for the community who is intersex, and right is Hannah Twigg, an intersex woman from the UK who aims to raise awareness about the condition\n\nKhelif was forced to speak out and call upon boxing fans to refrain from bullying the athletes earlier this week\n\nKhelif, who was registered female at birth, has been at the heart of a gender row after the IBA disqualified her from the World Championships last year. She is pictured at the Paris Olympics\n\nAlyssa Ball, who is also intersex and raises awareness of the condition, told DailyMail.com: 'I feel pretty emotionally exhausted speaking about the subject matter at hand.\n\n'As an intersex person, of course I think she should be allowed to compete.\n\n'Whatever \"advantages\" she may have are comparable to say someone else born with a physical build that is most advantageous for whatever sport.'\n\nDr Tommy Lundberg, a lecturer in physiology at Sweden's Karolinska Instituet, disagreed, however, saying she likely had a biological advantage because she has likely gone through male puberty.\n\nHe said: 'If Khelif does have 5-ARD, then that's considered male development during puberty and therefore and advantage.\n\n'Being male is not a talent and should not be rewarded more than being female.\n\n'The inclusion of athletes with male performance advantages in women's sport if a violation of the very important principles of fair and safe competition for female athletes.'\n\nIn tonight's fight, Khelif beat her competitor Janjaem Suwannapheng after overpowering the plucky opponent and landing bigger shots -- before cruising to victory with a unanimous verdict.\n\nRules on testosterone limits had been previously brought into sharp focus by Caster Semenya, who was barred from women's track events after it emerged she had elevated testosterone levels\n\nShe was cheered on by a noisy Algerian crowd, who were shouting 'Imane' before their boxer had even entered the arena.\n\nAfter winning, she skipped victorious circles around the arena before leaving to more cheers -- ahead of her fight for the gold on Friday.\n\nFiona McAnena, who works with scientists who research sex differences and is a director at UK-based women's sports charity Sex Matters, also said she likely had an advantage.\n\nShe said: 'It is not the fault of these young people that they have a congenital [developmental] condition and are registered as female when their chromosomes are male. This may be a shocking, surprising and traumatic thing even, to find out about.\n\n'But all of that aside, women's sport is set up for people who have a woman's advantage and not a male advantage.\n\n'If competitors have a male advantage, and have been through male puberty, then they don't belong in women's sport.'\n\nKhelif's condition is not public, leaving experts only able to speculate on whether or not she may have a condition and, if so, which one.\n\nBut a recent statement tweak from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) suggests that she may be intersex.\n\nOn August 3, they updated a statement where they said 'this is not a Differences of Sexual Development' case' to 'this is not a transgender case'.\n\nFor her part, Khelif has said that she is a woman and vowed to continue competing.\n\nIn a statement, she said: 'I address my message to all the people of the world to adhere to the Olympic principles, according to the Olympic Charter, and to avoid bullying all athletes, because this has a great impact.\n\n'It is capable of destroying people, killing people's thinking and minds, and dividing people.'\n\nShe previously dismissed the decision to ban her from the IBA's competition as a 'conspiracy' to stop an Algerian winning.\n\nKhelif's native Algeria has strong anti-LGBT laws in place, and its society does not tolerate transgender individuals.\n\nThe IOC interprets someone's gender at face value based on what is written in their passports.\n\nThey are also running the women's boxing competition amid a separate dispute with the IBA, which was barred from involvement.\n\nIn other categories, however, such as swimming -- the association reserves the right to test athletes when there are concerns they may have a biological advantage.\n\nExperts suggest the same should be done in boxing, saying it can be determined whether someone has gone through male puberty using a blood test -- which can pick up higher levels of testosterone.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imane_Khelif", "type": "wiki",

These allegations were false, as Snopes has covered.\n\nAs we explained in that previous article, Khelif was disqualified from the 2023 International Boxing Association World Championships in New Delhi after a genetic test -- the details of which the IBA has described as \"confidential\" -- allegedly found results consistent with the male sex.\n\nRegardless of the nature of the 2023 IBA test, the International Olympic Committee determined Khelif eligible to compete as a woman in the 2024 Olympics, as an IOC representative told The Associated Press on Aug. 2, 2024. There is no evidence that Khelif has ever identified as male or transgender.\n\nThe document in question appears in video footage credited to Reuters and shared on YouTube by Philippines-based ABS-CBN News, also on Aug. 3, 2024. The document, a booklet with both printed and handwritten text in Arabic, can be seen starting around the 2:25 timestamp in the video below:\n\nIn the Reuters interview, Amar Khelif said, \"This is our family official document, May 2, 1999, Imane Khelif, female. It is written here you can read it, this document doesn't lie.\"\n\nSnopes has not independently authenticated the existence or the contents of the document shown in the video.

Khelif's unanimous 5-0 win at the Paris Games showcased her dominance and precision, leaving no doubt about her control over the bout.\n\nKhelif's performance was a masterclass in boxing, dictating the pace from the first round to the last. Her superior technique and frequent, well-placed punches kept Suwannapheng on the defensive, though a knockout never seemed imminent. The crowd at Roland Garros, vibrant with Algerian flags and chants, clearly favored Khelif, creating an electrifying atmosphere.\n\nHowever, Khelif's journey to the gold medal round hasn't been without controversy. Her eligibility has been a hot topic since Italian boxer Angela Carini forfeited their match after just 46 seconds, citing the unprecedented strength of Khelif's punches. This incident brought Khelif's gender into the spotlight, as she had failed a gender test administered by the International Boxing Association (IBA) in 2023, despite being listed as female on her passport.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding Khelif's gender test have been murky.

weightlifting and taekwondo.\n\nKunlavut has been in stellar form in Paris.\n\nHe stunned world No.1 Shi Yuqi of China in the quarter-finals on Friday and the 23-year-old continued his fantastic run to the final with an impressive victory over Lee in 51 minutes.\n\nDespite competing in every Olympic Games since 1992, the closest Thai badminton players got to a podium finish was at Athens 2004,

In this installment, singer and songwriter Meghan Trainor shares the three products she always has on her \u2014 whether she\u2019s spending time at home with husband Daryl Sabara and her two kids or touring with her BFF TikToker Chris Olsen. Meghan Trainor is about to have one of her biggest years. The \u201cBeen Like This\u201d singer is preparing for her first U.S. tour since 2016, after she releases her sixth studio album Timeless on June 14. The 30-year-old tells Elite Daily she\u2019s currently training like an athlete and implementing new exercises daily. \u201cI know I\u2019m going to be jumping around a lot and singing, so I have to get better with my stamina,\u201d she says. Along with switching up her workout routine, Trainor says that when the Timeless Tour kicks off in Cincinnati on Sept. 4, she\u2019ll add new skin care into the mix. \u201cI do remember popping the gnarliest pimples when I was on [The Untouchables Tour] because my skin was so bad,\u201d she says, which is why she\u2019ll bring along plenty of Mighty Patches and Band-Aids. Along with her emergency zit essentials, staying hydrated is super important to Trainor, who also says TikTok influenced her to incorporate snail mucin into her skin care routine. \u201cThe snail mucin got me for sure.\u201d Below, the singer, who\u2019s partnering with Freshpet as its first-ever celebrity ambassador, dishes on what products she can\u2019t live without and why they\u2019ve become staples in her household. Meghan Is On A Hair-Growth Journey Since giving birth to her two sons, 3-year-old Riley and 10-month-old Barry, Trainor says her hair is pretty damaged. \u201cMy hair has taken a beating from all these pregnancies, so I\u2019m trying everything I can to take care of it,\u201d she says, which is why she\u2019s currently on a hair-growth journey. Trainor says one approach is to apply oil nightly and take vitamins every day, but her real hair hack is to use soft scrunchies for her \u201cmom buns.\u201d \u201cIf I\u2019m not working, I\u2019m in a mom bun, and Riley goes, \u2018You have a bun,\u2019 and we laugh about it.\u201d She doesn\u2019t have a specific brand she loves but says the softer, the better. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get soft scrunchies \u2014 the ones that don\u2019t damage your hair,\u201d she says. Meghan Believes Your Eyebrows Are Super Important A person\u2019s eyes may be the windows to their soul, but Trainor thinks your eyebrows are just as important. \u201cThey frame your face,\u201d she says, which is why a good eyebrow pencil is the first thing on her list of holy grail products. The pencil of choice for Trainor is Anastasia Beverly Hills Brow Wiz in taupe. She loves it so much because it has both a pencil and brush to get the perfect eyebrow shape. Meghan Has Long Been A Fan Of This Lip Oil Another beauty product in Trainor\u2019s everyday arsenal is E.l.f Cosmetic\u2019s Glow Reviver Lip Oil. She says, \u201cIt just keeps my lips so good all day, every day.\u201d Trainor starred in E.l.f.\u2019s 2024 Super Bowl commercial and has praised the lip oil before, telling InStyle she often puts it on right before bed. Her go-to shade is pink quartz, and it\u2019s likely coming with her on the Timeless Tour. Looking at each one of Trainor\u2019s go-to products, there\u2019s a theme of simplicity. With such a busy schedule, it makes sense that Trainor would want to keep her beauty routine easy. Even she says, \u201cLess is more, dude. I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d", "summary": "Ahead of her 'Timeless' Tour, singer Meghan Trainor shares her favorite beauty products, including scrunchies, lip oil, and an eyebrow pencil.", "url": "https://www.elitedaily.com/beauty/meghan-trainor-favorite-beauty-products-timeless-tour", "image": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2024/5/14/8dc13a82/onenightstand_meghan-trainor.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&fm=jpg&fp-x=0.5152&fp-y=0.4227", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:00:25", "author": "Rachel Chapman", "authors": ["Rachel Chapman"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.381}

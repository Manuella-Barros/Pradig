Thousands of signatures needed to clear a project and every signature passes through corrupt practices\", Sitharaman said.\n\nShe highlighted the alarming situation of investment flow being halted in the state, as no business entity would invest where lawlessness is at its peak.\n\nReferring to National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, she said, \"Investment flow has stopped in the state, no business means will invest in states where lawlessness is at its peak. NCRB data shows 795 businessmen were murdered in 2022.\"Despite the challenges, Sitharaman stressed that Jharkhand has the potential to become a manufacturing state, with 40 per cent of the country's minerals found in the state.\n\nHowever, she lamented that these resources are often exported instead of being utilised for local development, stating, \"States should become the engine of growth for Vikshit Bharat in 2047\".\n\nSitharaman said, \"Out of 112 aspirational districts, 42 are from eastern India including Jharkhand Odisha and Bihar.\"Regarding the contribution of Jharkhand to the mineral fund, the Finance Minister said, \"Jharkhand's contribution to mineral fund was Rs 12,000 crore, out of the total of Rs 86,000 crore. In the last five years, 15,000 projects have been completed out of this fund in Jharkhand.\"Responding to allegations that the central government does not allocate funds to Jharkhand, Sitharaman provided a comparative analysis. She stated that during the UPA regime from 2009-2014, the central government gave an average of Rs. 457 crore per annum to Jharkhand.\n\nIn contrast, in the Modi regime, Sitharaman said, \"During the 2009-2014 UPI regime, the central government gave on average of Rs 457 crore per annum to Jharkhand. In the Modi Regime- 2024-25 interim budget, only for railways projects of Jharkhand, 7234 crore was allocated.\"\"Additionally, significant allocations were made for other development projects, including 100 per cent electrification of railways, redevelopment of 57 railway stations as modern stations, the introduction of 3 Vande Bharat trains, construction of 2256 km of national highways crossing Jharkhand, and Rs 8900 crore for the revival of the Sindri fertilizer factory,\" she said.\n\nThe Finance Minister further said, \"100 per cent electrification of railways, 57 railway stations were re-developed as modern stations, 3 Vande Bharat trains, 2256 km of national highways crossing Jharkhand, Rs 8900 cr for revival of Sindri fertilizer factory.\" (ANI)", "source": {"uri": "indiagazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirmala_Sitharaman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nirmala Sitharaman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jharkhand"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jharkhand"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranchi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ranchi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ranchi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Crime_Records_Bureau", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Crime Records Bureau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Finance_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Finance (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_News_International", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asian News International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_highways_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National highways of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Progressive_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Progressive Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Odisha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Odisha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilizer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fertilizer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bihar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bihar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Socially_Responsible", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Socially Responsible", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads/Organizations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static.midwestradionetwork.com/story_logos/premier/india-gazette.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552672", "eventUri": "eng-9552672", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 28, "textEnd": 33}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

It is also bearing the brunt of migration and lawlessness. And, there is no conducive environment for industries here,'' she said.\n\nEastern India can become the engine of growth for the country with the restoration of industries, Sitharaman said and added anyone ''with a little pen was busy extorting money'' in lieu of providing sanctions for trade and industries etc. ''There is no business creating environment...Somebody is doing well in business so I have to extract something ...I have one little pen with which one signature is to be given....Thousands of signatures are required for setting up a business, but every pen thinks that I have something to take out of this and that perpetrates the monumental corruption which is in Jharkhand,'' she said.\n\nSitharaman said it pained her to see the corruption in Jharkhand and the amount of cash being recovered in Jharkhand. ''It pains me to see the corruption....'Deewar tak cash, paatal tak cash' even counting machines fail to count,'' she said. The minister said focus should be on value addition to minerals, as Jharkhand has 40 per cent of the country's mineral wealth.\n\n''Jharkhand used to feature among the top five states in ease-of-doing business. But now, 'new jungle raj' prevails here. The state will attract more investment if law and order improves... Change in governance is the need of the hour in the state,'' the minister said.\n\n''The allegations (of the opposition) about step-motherly treatment towards the state by the Prime Minister are baseless. Jharkhand was allocated a record Rs 7,234 crore for rail projects in the 2024-25 budget...The allocation during the earlier regime used to be barely Rs 457 crore,'' she said.\n\nSpeaking at the interactive session on 'Eastern India - Engine of Growth for Viksit Bharat', Sitharaman said some places in the state, including Sahibganj, Santhal Parganas and Godda, were witnessing demographic changes which is a matter of serious concern.\n\n''Demography of Sahibganj, Santhal Parganas and Godda has been changing. It has changed in the last four years which is a matter of serious concern,'' she said.\n\nShe pointed out that despite Jharkhand contributing 40 per cent of the country's mineral output, industries were being established elsewhere. She stressed the imperative for establishing industrial units within the state.\n\n''There should be a focus on mineral-based manufacturing because Jharkhand holds a significant share of the country's mineral wealth, accounting for 40 per cent of all minerals combined. Within that, 28 per cent comprises coal, 26 per cent iron, 25 percent cobalt, 18 per cent copper, and 6 per cent bauxite. Instead of transporting these minerals elsewhere for processing, manufacturing bases can be established here. I believe the emphasis should be on adding value to these minerals located in Jharkhand,'' Sitharaman added.\n\nShe added that Rs 86,000 crore was collected in the country on account of District Mineral Fund and Jharkhand's share was Rs 12,000 crore while Odisha and Bengal got Rs 25,400 and Rs 150 crore respectively. ''A total of 24,500 projects have been initiated in Jharkhand through the mineral fund, utilising the Rs 12,000 crore allocated. Notably, these funds operate independently of the state budget. Over the past five years, approximately 15,000 projects have been successfully completed,'' she said.\n\nSitharaman said accusations of stepmotherly treatment from Delhi are unfounded. ''The government's focus towards development of Jharkhand resulted in allocation of Rs 30,575 crore for Varanasi-Ranchi-Kolkata greenfield corridor under Bharatmala Pariyojna besides Rs 8,900 crore for revival of Sindri Fertiliser unit,'' she added.\n\nSitharaman stirred a controversy after her photo with Vishnu Agarwal, one of the accused in a land scam investigation by the ED, went viral and led to widespread discussion, with both the JMM and Congress criticising the BJP-led government at the Centre.\n\nHitting out at BJP, JMM issued a statement, ''Businessman Vishnu Agarwal, who had been jailed on charges of land scam including Army land, met Sitharaman. Babulal Marandi was also present on the occasion. He (Agarwal) had been arrested by the ED. He is out on bail. ED comes under the finance ministry''.\n\nIn a statement, the Congress asserted, ''The BJP owes an explanation regarding the nature of the arrangement that led to the Finance Minister meeting with an accused individual in a land scam under investigation by the ED, an agency that operates under the purview of the Finance Ministry.'' Later, the BJP issued a statement saying the list of invitees was prepared by NGO 'Badalta Jharkhand' and chamber of commerce and the party had nothing to do with it.\n\nSitharaman was meeting those who were sent by these organisations, it said. Agarwal was arrested by the ED in connection with a land scam in July for alleged fraudulent sale of a one-acre plot in an upscale Ranchi locality. The Jharkhand High Court granted him bail in January.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com",

''Jharkhand used to feature among the top five states in ease-of-doing business. But now, 'new jungle raj' prevails here. The state will attract more investment if law and order improves... Change in governance is the need of the hour in the state,'' the minister said.\n\n''The allegations (of the opposition) about step-motherly treatment towards the state by the Prime Minister are baseless. Jharkhand was allocated a record Rs 7,234 crore for rail projects in the 2024-25 budget...The allocation during earlier regime used to be barely Rs 457 crore,'' she said.\n\nSpeaking at the interactive session on 'Eastern India - Engine of Growth for Viksit Bharat', Sitharaman said some places in the state, including Sahibganj, Santhal Parganas and Godda, were witnessing demographic changes which is a matter of serious concern.\n\n''Demography of Sahibganj, Santhal Parganas and Godda has been changing. It has changed in the last four years which is a matter of serious concern,'' she said.\n\nShe pointed out that despite Jharkhand contributing 40 per cent of the country's mineral output, industries were being established elsewhere. She stressed the imperative for establishing industrial units within the state.\n\n''There should be a focus on mineral-based manufacturing because Jharkhand holds a significant share of the country's mineral wealth, accounting for 40 per cent of all minerals combined. Within that, 28 per cent comprises coal, 26 per cent iron, 25 per cent cobalt, 18 per cent copper, and 6 per cent bauxite. Instead of transporting these minerals elsewhere for processing, manufacturing bases can be established here. I believe the emphasis should be on adding value to these minerals located in Jharkhand,'' Sitharaman added.\n\nShe added that Rs 86,000 crore was collected in the country on account of District Mineral Fund and Jharkhand's share was Rs 12,000 crore while Odisha and Bengal got Rs 25,400 and Rs 150 crore respectively.\n\n''A total of 24,500 projects have been initiated in Jharkhand through the mineral fund, utilising the Rs 12,000 crore allocated. Notably, these funds operate independently of the state budget. Over the past five years, approximately 15,000 projects have been successfully completed,'' she said. Sitharaman emphasised that accusations of stepmotherly treatment from Delhi are unfounded and incorrect. ''The government's focus towards development of Jharkhand resulted in allocation of Rs 30,575 crore for Varanasi-Ranchi-Kolkata greenfield corridor under Bharatmala Pariyojna besides Rs 8,900 crore for revival of Sindri Fertiliser unit,'' she added.\n\nSitharaman stirred a controversy after her photo with Vishnu Agarwal, one of the accused in a land scam investigation by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), went viral and led to widespread discussion, with both the JMM and Congress criticising the BJP-led government at the Centre.\n\nHitting out at the BJP on the viral photograph, JMM issued a statement, ''Businessman Vishnu Aggarwal, who had been jailed on charges of land scam including Army land, met Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. Babulal Marandi was also present on the occasion. He (Agarwal) had been arrested by the ED. He is out on bail. ED comes under the Finance Minister''.\n\nIn a statement, the Congress asserted, ''The BJP owes an explanation regarding the nature of the arrangement that led to the Finance Minister meeting with an accused individual in a land scam under investigation by the Enforcement Directorate, an agency that operates under the purview of the Finance Ministry.'' Agarwal, the owner of a huge property in Ranchi, was arrested by the ED in connection with land-scam in July for alleged fraudulent sale of an acre plot in an upscale Ranchi locality. The Jharkhand High Court granted him bail in January.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com",

Pointing out that thousands of signatures are required to clear a project, and every signature passes through corrupt practices, \"Business is not growing because of lawlessness and monumental corruption. Thousands of signatures needed to clear a project and every signature passes through corrupt practices\", Sitharaman said.\n\nShe highlighted the alarming situation of investment flow being halted in the state, as no business entity would invest where lawlessness is at its peak. Referring to National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, she said, \"Investment flow has stopped in the state, no business means will invest in states where lawlessness is at its peak. NCRB data shows 795 businessmen were murdered in 2022.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, Sitharaman stressed that Jharkhand has the potential to become a manufacturing state, with 40 per cent of the country's minerals found in the state. However, she lamented that these resources are often exported instead of being utilised for local development, stating, \"States should become the engine of growth for Vikshit Bharat in 2047\".\n\nSitharaman said, \"Out of 112 aspirational districts, 42 are from eastern India including Jharkhand Odisha and Bihar.\" Regarding the contribution of Jharkhand to the mineral fund, the Finance Minister said, \"Jharkhand's contribution to mineral fund was Rs 12,000 crore, out of the total of Rs 86,000 crore. In the last five years, 15,000 projects have been completed out of this fund in Jharkhand.\"\n\nResponding to allegations that the central government does not allocate funds to Jharkhand, Sitharaman provided a comparative analysis. She stated that during the UPA regime from 2009-2014, the central government gave an average of Rs. 457 crore per annum to Jharkhand. In contrast, in the Modi regime, Sitharaman said, \"During the 2009-2014 UPI regime, the central government gave on average of Rs 457 crore per annum to Jharkhand. In the Modi Regime- 2024-25 interim budget, only for railways projects of Jharkhand, 7234 crore was allocated.\"\n\n\"Additionally, significant allocations were made for other development projects, including 100 per cent electrification of railways, redevelopment of 57 railway stations as modern stations, the introduction of 3 Vande Bharat trains, construction of 2256 km of national highways crossing Jharkhand, and Rs 8900 crore for the revival of the Sindri fertilizer factory,\" she said. The Finance Minister further said, \"100 per cent electrification of railways, 57 railway stations were re-developed as modern stations, 3 Vande Bharat trains, 2256 km of national highways crossing Jharkhand, Rs 8900 cr for revival of Sindri fertilizer factory.\" (ANI)\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirmala_Sitharaman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nirmala Sitharaman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jharkhand"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jharkhand"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Crime_Records_Bureau", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Crime Records Bureau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Finance_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Finance (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranchi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ranchi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ranchi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_highways_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National highways of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_News_International", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asian News International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Progressive_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Progressive Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Odisha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Odisha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilizer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fertilizer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bihar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bihar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/North America", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads/Organizations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Photography", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Photography", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/09_05_2024_14_18_42_5327373.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552672", "eventUri": "eng-9552672", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

It is also bearing the brunt of migration and lawlessness. And, there is no conducive environment for industries here,\" she said.\n\nEastern India can become the engine of growth for the country with the restoration of industries, Sitharaman said and added anyone \"with a little pen was busy extorting money\" in lieu of providing sanctions for trade and industries etc.\n\n\"There is no business creating environment...Somebody is doing well in business so I have to extract something ...I have one little pen with which one signature is to be given....Thousands of signatures are required for setting up a business, but every pen thinks that I have something to take out of this and that perpetrates the monumental corruption which is in Jharkhand,\" she said.\n\nSitharaman added that \"blood-sucking leeches at every level supported by political dispensation\" were making Jharkhand hollow and a massive scale reformation was needed here.\n\nThe Union minister said focus should be on value addition to minerals, as Jharkhand has 40 per cent of the country's mineral wealth.\n\n\"Law and order when improved automatically gets investment, people have faith, and there is collection of revenue,\" she said emphasisng a \"change in governance in Jharkhand is needed for its betterment.\" \"Jharkhand used to feature among the top five states in ease-of-doing business.

Change in governance is the need of the hour in the state,\" the minister said.\n\n\"The allegations (of the opposition) about step-motherly treatment towards the state by the Prime Minister are baseless. Jharkhand was allocated a record Rs 7,234 crore for rail projects in the 2024-25 budget...The allocation during earlier regime used to be barely Rs 457 crore,\" she said.\n\nSpeaking at the interactive session on 'Eastern India - Engine of Growth for Viksit Bharat', Sitharaman said some places in the state, including Sahibganj, Santhal Parganas and Godda, were witnessing demographic changes which is a matter of serious concern.\n\n\"Demography of Sahibganj, Santhal Parganas and Godda has been changing. It has changed in the last four years which is a matter of serious concern,\" she said.\n\nShe pointed out that despite Jharkhand contributing 40 per cent of the country's mineral output, industries were being established elsewhere. She stressed the imperative for establishing industrial units within the state.\n\n\"There should be a focus on mineral-based manufacturing because Jharkhand holds a significant share of the country's mineral wealth, accounting for 40 per cent of all minerals combined. Within that, 28 per cent comprises coal, 26 per cent iron, 25 per cent cobalt, 18 per cent copper, and 6 per cent bauxite. Instead of transporting these minerals elsewhere for processing, manufacturing bases can be established here. I believe the emphasis should be on adding value to these minerals located in Jharkhand,\" Sitharaman added.\n\nShe added that Rs 86,000 crore was collected in the country on account of District Mineral Fund and Jharkhand's share was Rs 12,000 crore while Odisha and Bengal got Rs 25,400 and Rs 150 crore respectively.\n\n\"A total of 24,500 projects have been initiated in Jharkhand through the mineral fund, utilising the Rs 12,000 crore allocated. Notably, these funds operate independently of the state budget. Over the past five years, approximately 15,000 projects have been successfully completed,\" she said.\n\nSitharaman emphasised that accusations of stepmotherly treatment from Delhi are unfounded and incorrect. \"The government's focus towards development of Jharkhand resulted in allocation of Rs 30,575 crore for Varanasi-Ranchi-Kolkata greenfield corridor under Bharatmala Pariyojna besides Rs 8,900 crore for revival of Sindri Fertiliser unit,\" she added.\n\nSitharaman stirred a controversy after her photo with Vishnu Agarwal, one of the accused in a land scam investigation by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), went viral and led to widespread discussion, with both the JMM and Congress criticising the BJP-led government at the Centre.\n\nHitting out at the BJP on the viral photograph, JMM issued a statement, \"Businessman Vishnu Aggarwal, who had been jailed on charges of land scam including Army land, met Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. Babulal Marandi was also present on the occasion. He (Agarwal) had been arrested by the ED. He is out on bail. ED comes under the Finance Minister\".\n\nIn a statement, the Congress asserted, \"The BJP owes an explanation regarding the nature of the arrangement that led to the Finance Minister meeting with an accused individual in a land scam under investigation by the Enforcement Directorate, an agency that operates under the purview of the Finance Ministry.\" Agarwal, the owner of a huge property in Ranchi, was arrested by the ED in connection with land-scam in July for alleged fraudulent sale of an acre plot in an upscale Ranchi locality.

Responding to a question on the rise of online frauds in Jharkhand over the past few years while speaking at an event here, Sitharaman pointed out that financial regulators can highlight how such people can be engaged for ethical practices to combat cyber frauds and that the Government should highlight such potential.\n\nDelivering an address to the Federation of Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce on the theme \"Vikshit Bharat 2047\" on Thursday in Ranchi, Jharkhand, in an answer to a question, Sitharaman emphasised the importance of using the talent in Jharkhand ethically to combat cyber crime. She suggested that the state government and fintech companies could harness such people effectively to prevent cyber crimes.\n\nAccording to data, from 2019 to July 2023, a total of 5,350 cases of cybercrime have been reported in the state. Among these, 1,432 cases were registered in Ranchi district alone. Other districts with high numbers of cybercrime cases include Dhanbad (496 cases), Deoghar (405 cases), Jamshedpur (384 cases), and Hazaribagh (348 cases). Despite a slight decrease from 2021, Jharkhand reported 967 cybercrime cases in 2022, making it the second highest in the country for cybercrime cases.\n\nNotably, four districts of Jharkhand--Jamtara, Deoghar, Giridih, and Bokaro--are among the top ten in the country for the highest number of cybercrime cases. Jamtara, in particular, has earned notoriety as the \"phishing capital of India,\" responsible for 2.4 per cent of all cybercrimes in the country. It has also inspired several crime capers on OTT and big screen with plots revolving around it.\n\nIn response to the growing threat of cyber crimes, the Jharkhand Police established a Cyber Crime Police Station in March 2016. This station deals with serious and complex cyber crimes and provides technical assistance to all cases it receives. Sitharaman also addressed the alleged rampant corruption that has hindered Jharkhand's progress, stating that it has blocked the state's development.\n\nThe Finance Minister emphasised that the talent of Jharkhand is being wasted due to lawlessness, corruption, and the absence of basic infrastructure such as electricity and roads. She highlighted the alarming situation of investment flow being halted in the state, as no business entity would invest where lawlessness is at its peak. Referring to National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, she said, \"Investment flow has stopped in the state, no business means will invest in states where lawlessness is at its peak. NCRB data shows 795 businessmen were murdered in 2022.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, Sitharaman stressed that Jharkhand has the potential to become a manufacturing state, with 40 per cent of the country's minerals found in the state.

She believes that improving law and order is crucial for attracting more investment to the state. The minister also mentioned that Jharkhand received a record allocation of Rs 7,200 crore for rail projects in the 2024-25 budget, refuting claims of neglect by the prime minister.\n\nDuring the interactive session on 'Eastern India - Engine of Growth for Viksit Bharat', Sitharaman raised concerns about demographic changes occurring in certain areas of the state, such as Sahibganj, Santhal Parganas, and Godda, attributing them to infiltration.\n\nThe TOI City Desk is an indefatigable team of journalists dedicated to bringing you the pulse of cities from across the nation, all day and all night.

The state needs proper electricity supply, better road connectivity, and reduction in dependence on minerals and there should be attempts to make the state a manufacturing hub.\"\n\nShe said that eastern state needs to focus on bringing in investments to bring value addition to its mineral reserves, and added that migration was a serious problem as well.\n\n\"The talent of youth in Jharkhand is getting wasted as they have to move out of the state for opportunities due to lawlessness, rampant corruption, lack of business environment, and the practice of treating wealth creation as a rent seeking opportunity,\" Sitharaman said.", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoneyControl"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jharkhand"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jharkhand"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirmala_Sitharaman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nirmala Sitharaman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Finance_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Finance (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranchi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ranchi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ranchi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Statistics_and_Programme_Implementation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Monetary Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rent-seeking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2024/01/FM-Sitharaman.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552672", "eventUri": "eng-9552672", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 50, "textEnd": 55, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 1307, "textEnd": 1312}, {"amb": false, "date": "-02-29", "textStart": 1607, "textEnd": 1618}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

This follows the Bharatiya Janata party's campaign in the state, where it alleges corruption in a recently released 'Aarop Patra' or 'charge sheet' against the incumbent Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, or JMM.\n\nThe minister noted that reform and restoration will have to happen at different levels, for which both central and state governments will have to support (the state) and then businesses will gain confidence, and soon a multiplier effect will ensue.\n\nSitharaman explained the multiplier effect by saying, \"When law and order are improved, they automatically attract investments; people will have faith; the collection of revenue and efficiencies of the system and small businesses improving are all there for us to see.\"\n\nShe noted that the government has allocated a 'record' Rs 7,234 crore for railway projects in the state of Jharkhand alone in the interim budget for FY25.\n\nShe outlined the government's efforts in the state over the years, noting that the Modi government achieved 100% railway electrification in November 2023 and redeveloped 57 railway stations under the Amrit Bharat Station Scheme.\n\n\"Three Vande Bharat trains have been introduced between Jharkhand and Patna, Varanasi and Howrah, and the Deoghar Airport has been completed and is operational,\" she said.\n\nShe also alluded to the ongoing Varanasi-Kolkata expressway under the Bharatmala Pariyojana and said that 2,256 kilometres of national highways passing through the state were built under the Modi government.\n\nShe also referred to the revival of the Sindri fertiliser plant, which involved an outlay of Rs 8,900 crore, to evidence the government's efforts. To reduce urea import dependence, the Sindri plant received revival approval from the Union Cabinet in 2011 and again in 2016 from different governments. The Sindri plant is said to have begun urea production on November 5, 2022, to aid fertiliser supply in the state and adjoining areas.\n\n\"...We need good representation in Jharkhand,\" the minister said. \"The Modi government will be formed again for a third term, and India's economy will reach third place from fifth place in around a year, as per the Prime Minister's announcement, and for this, we need Jharkhand's contribution too...\"\n\nSpeaking of aspirational districts, Sitharaman noted that of the 112 districts, 42 are in the eastern regions of Odisha, Bihar, and Jharkhand.\n\nShe stated that aspirational districts will further be monitored as aspirational blocks and that development is happening in these aspirational districts under the prime minister's direct supervision, where some districts have shown progress equivalent to or more than the state's average.\n\nSitharaman suggested that the state should concentrate on attracting investments to enhance the value of its mineral deposits through mineral-based manufacturing. The state, she said, has 40% of the total aggregate of all mineral deposits in the country.", "source": {"uri": "ndtvprofit.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTV Profit"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The word means salutations in the tribal dialect of Jharkhand, which goes to polls from May 13.\n\nIt was 24 years ago that the State of Jharkhand was created, after giving sleepless nights to politicians and residents in its parent State of Bihar. The latter, primarily an agricultural State, saw nearly its entire mineral resources and power plants shifting to the new State. At the time the Bhojpuri singer Anand Mohan faced 22 FIRs for singing \"Mishri malai khailu, kaila tan buland, ab khaiah shakarkand, alga bhaile Jharkhand.\" (You ate butter and rock candy and your body became strong; now manage with sweet potato as Jharkhand has gone).\n\nThe new State was created amid a passionate cry for a separate State for tribals when the indigenous tribal (Santjhal, Ho, Gond) and Mahato population of Jharkhand, then called South Bihar, complained that North Bihar was eating up all its resources but leaving its villages bereft of development. It was hoped that having their own State would improve the lot of the indigenous people.\n\nAs the State, which sends 14 Lok Sabha members to Parliament, goes to polls in the weeks to come, one wonders if its dream has been fulfilled or if the State still lags in comparison to Chhattisgarh and Uttarakhand, which were carved out of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh respectively, along with Jharkhand, in 2000 by Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government at the Centre.\n\nThe creation of new States or the bifurcation of existing ones are often political decisions although they are laced with the promise of better governance, as one finds this time in Mayawati's promise for a separate State for Western UP (Harit Pradesh). Jharkhand was no exception, as it suited both the BJP and the ruling RJD in Bihar to pitch for separation.\n\nToday, there is a building boom in cities like Ranchi, Dhanbad, and Jamshedpur. The crowd at the famous Shiva temple in Deoghar has only grown with the passage of time. Malaria still strikes villages in Latehar and West Singhbhum districts. Jharkhand is home to 23 listed tribes, including primitive ones like Asur and Birhor (who lived on trees), and is still called a tribal State although the non-tribal population outnumbers the tribal.\n\nThe State has seen 12 Chief Ministers since its creation. The only Chief Minister who could complete his full term in Jharkhand was the non-tribal Raghubar Das of the BJP while the tribal leader who is credited for the creation of Jharkhand, Shibu Soren, had to contend with the shortest stint of 10 days as Chief Minister in one of his tenures.\n\nShibu Soren's supporters call him \"Dishom Guru\" and once even believed in his miraculous powers of being present in multiple locations at the same time. His conviction in the 1993 JMM bribery case did not affect his popularity nor his being charged in a murder case. The juiciest part of the JMM bribery case was that Soren had reportedly deposited the bribe money in a Delhi bank. In March, the case came back in the news after the Supreme Court overruled its earlier majority judgement in which it had upheld the immunity of MPs or MLAs in cases of bribes for a speech or a vote in the House. And the issue promises to haunt the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, Soren's party, in the run-up to the polls.\n\nJharkhand is the only State where an Independent candidate, Madhu Koda, became Chief Minister and continued in office for two years until he was brought down by a corruption case. Corruption is a menace that continues to stalk Jharkhand even today, with money repeatedly playing a role in Rajya Sabha nominations.\n\nOn May 6, the ED recovered cash to the tune of Rs 30 crore in raids conducted on some people close to Jharkhand's Rural Development Minister, Alamgir Alam, with the cash found in the house of a domestic worker of the Minister's private secretary. Earlier, a sum of Rs 350 crore was recovered from the residence of former Rajya Sabha MP Dheeraj Sahu. In fact, the extent of the problem becomes clear when you consider that three Chief Ministers of Jharkhand have been jailed in corruption cases.\n\nYet, Jharkhand retains its sense of humour. In the coalfield city of Dhanbad, there is a dhaba called Dukhi (Unhappy) and in nearby Giridih there is an eatery called Bewakoof (Foolish). Both are places where people throng for a full meal that is easy on the pocket. And if you ever visit Hazaribagh, a Lok Sabha constituency represented by former Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha, don't miss the luscious dark brown gulab jamuns of Tati Jharia, an otherwise nondescript town.\n\nIn fact, you will find a dozen and more shops bearing the name \"Pradhanji Gulab Jamun Waale\" in the Hazaribagh-Vishnugarh crescent. In this Naxal-hit region, even the Maoist threat has failed to quell the spirit of gulab-jamun entrepreneurship. Today, the venture has travelled to the bigger cities of Jharkhand as well. But sweets are not the only thing that has taken off, with opium cultivation becoming a big thing of late in Bishungarh. About two hours away is the city of Jamtara, where unemployment is so severe that many youngsters have taken to cyber crime en masse, with professional phishing their crime of choice. The menace runs so deep that it inspired a Netflix series titled Jamtara: Sabka Number Ayega.\n\nSome 90 km away is the revered Jain pilgrimage spot, the Sammed Shikharji temple, in the Parasnath hills, which got into an unsavoury controversy last year when the Jains protested against the State government's decision to declare it a tourist spot. The VHP issued a statement against the move while the Congress leader Kamal Nath wrote to the then Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren to change his decision. Interestingly, Hemant's predecessor Raghubar Das of the BJP, also faced a similar protest in 2015.\n\nPolitically speaking, Lok Sabha election 2024 could well decide the fate of the most popular and prominent political family of Jharkhand, the Sorens, and also set a roadmap for tribal politics in the coming years. The ageing patriarch of the family, Shibu Soren, is a pale shadow of his powerful self and leads an almost retired life. His son and political heir, Hemant Soren, is in jail, arrested just months before the general election, with the party hurriedly electing a new CM from outside the family due to the intense rivalry for the chair among other Soren family members.\n\nAn intense albeit muted fight is ongoing in Jharkhand right now, involving the two daughters-in-law of the Soren family. Sita Soren (wife of the late Durga Soren, Shibu Soren's older son) is fighting from the Lok Sabha seat of Dumka, a family pocket borough, on a BJP ticket. And Kalpana Soren (wife of the jailed Hemant Soren) is hoping to win the Gandey Assembly seat on the JMM ticket, for which the bye-election was held on April 19. The results of both will be declared on June 4. The BJP is saying \"Khela Hobe\" (There will be the game). Indications are Sita Soren could try to bring back people from her former party, who were close to her late husband.\n\nThe Gandey seat was vacated by veteran JMM leader Sarfaraz Ahmed to enable Kalpana Soren to contest. Now, with her political rival Sita having joined the BJP camp, Kalpana could replace Champai Soren as CM if JMM wins the Assembly by-election. Champai is the senior-most JMM leader. An associate of Shibu Soren, Champai is a die-hard family loyalist.\n\nThe BJP, which lost the 2019 Assembly polls to the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance is hoping to bounce back to power in the Assembly and also corner a lion's share of the 14 Lok Sabha seats in the State. It has allied with the All Jharkhand Students Union (AJSU), whose leader Sudesh Mahato drives hard bargains, and has already been Deputy Chief Minister twice in two rival alliances led by the BJP and the JMM only because of his party's five MLAs. Fighting the BJP-AJSU combine is the Congress-JMM-RJD-CPI-ML alliance.\n\nThere is terrific woman power at play in these polls. The BJP has fielded two other women candidates -- Annapurna Devi from Koderma and Gita Koda from Singhbhum. In Singhbhum, the JMM candidate is also a woman, the MLA Joba Majhi. The Congress has fielded two woman candidates, party veteran Subodhkant Sahay's daughter Yashaswini from Ranchi and Anupama Singh from Dhanbad. And the RJD candidate is Mamta Bhuiyan, who is taking on the BJP's sitting MP, VD Ram, the former DGP of Jharkhand.\n\nHere's wishing Johar to the women of Jharkhand!\n\nWrite to us with your comments on Poll Vault, and I will see you next week, next State, next rivalry.\n\nAnand Mishra | Political Editor, Frontline\n\nWe hope you've been enjoying our newsletters featuring a selection of articles that we believe will be of interest to a cross-section of our readers.

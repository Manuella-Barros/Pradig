{"id": 239767286, "title": "\u2026How Farooq Oreagba stole the show", "text": "Undoubtedly, the most talked about attraction at the 2024 Ojude Oba festival was the unique fashion style of Farooq Oreagba, the Chief Executive Officer of NG Clearing Limited. Oreagba inadvertently became the face of the festival from his grand entrance on a decorated horse, dressed in a green and lemon agbada with a matching cap, red coral beads, and a gold crossbody chain. The businessman, who has conspicuous tattoos on both arms, also had a cigar hanging from his lips. An Apple wristwatch and stylish sunglasses further enhanced his look, earning him the title of, \u2018The Man of the Day\u2019, as pictures of him set the Internet agog. The Ogun State native holds a degree in Finance from Oxford University, London, United Kingdom; and another degree in Business Management from Coventry University, also in the UK. He has had a chequered career, having worked in the financial sector in Nigeria and abroad. Oreagba was also a former Managing Director of the Nigerian Stock Exchange and Securities. In 2014, Oreagba was diagnosed with osteosarcoma and carcinoma, a cancer of the skin and bone marrow, and he had to leave his role as the MD of NSE to tend to his health. However, after two years of battling the killer disease, he was declared cancer-free and healthy enough to go back to work. Oreagba\u2019s stylish and charismatic presence at the Ojude Oba festival conveyed the story of not only his achievements, but also his resilience and triumph.", "summary": "<p>Undoubtedly, the most talked about attraction at the 2024 Ojude Oba festival was the unique fashion style of Farooq Oreagba, the Chief Executive Officer of NG Clearing Limited.

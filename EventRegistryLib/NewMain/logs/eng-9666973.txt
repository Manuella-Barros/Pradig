More info\n\nA Scots Just Stop Oil protester has been arrested after allegedly spraying orange paint over aircraft at Stansted Airport where Taylor Swift's private jet is believed to have landed.\n\nJennifer Kowalski, 28, from Dumbarton, who has been named by Just Stop Oil, was detained by Essex Police alongside fellow campaigner Cole Macdonald, 22, on Thursday morning.\n\nThe activists claim they entered the private airfield at Stansted airport where Swift's jet is currently stationed and painted two private jets using fire extinguishers filled with orange paint.\n\nJust Stop Oil says they are demanding that the incoming UK government commit to working with other governments to agree an equitable plan to end the extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030.\n\nIn a post on X, they said: \"Jennifer and Cole cut the fence into the private airfield at Stansted where @taylorswift13's jet is parked, demanding an emergency treaty to end fossil fuels by 2030.\"\n\nThe accompanying video shows one of the activists cutting a hole in the airfield's metal fence using an angle grinder.\n\nOne activist, wearing a Just Stop Oil T-shirt, can then be seen spraying the fuselage and windows of two parked white planes with orange paint, before both then sit together in front of the planes on the tarmac.\n\nEssex Police said they were called at around 5am after reports of people gaining access to a private area of an airfield at Stansted Airport.\n\nTwo people had entered an area \"well away from the runway and main passenger terminal\" before causing damage to two aircraft.\n\nA 22-year-old woman from Brighton and a 28-year-old woman, from Dumbarton, have been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and interference with the use or operation of national infrastructure, the force said.\n\nIt added the airport and flights are operating as normal.\n\nChief superintendent Simon Anslow said: \"I would like to reassure passengers and the wider public that we are well prepared and resourced to deal with incidents of this nature.\n\n\"Almost immediately after we were made aware of this incident, which took place away from the main passenger terminal, we were on the scene. We maintain a constant presence at the airport and this presence will be heightened over the summer period.\n\n\"We are not anti protest but we will always take action where criminal acts take place.\"\n\nEssex Police confirmed the private jet of pop star Taylor Swift, which Just Stop Oil said had landed at Stansted \"mere hours before\", was not at the airport.\n\nIn a statement on Just Stop Oil, Jennifer Kowalski, said: \"Over the years, I've had to realise that even working in sustainability provides me with essentially no ability to make the necessary changes to prevent the complete collapse of our natural systems. I have to take desperate measures to make my voice heard.\n\n\"In 2024 we all have to be considering what we can do each day to change the course our society is on. We need an emergency treaty to stop the extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030.\"\n\nCole Macdonald, from Brightom, added: \"We're living in two worlds: one where billionaires live in luxury, able to fly in private jets away from the other, where unliveable conditions are being imposed on countless millions.\n\n\"Meanwhile, this system that is allowing extreme wealth to be accrued by a few, to the detriment of everyone else, is destroying the conditions necessary to support human life in a rapidly accelerating never-ending 'cruel summer'.

In a statement, Just Stop Oil (JSO) explained that the activists were demanding an emergency treaty to end fossil fuels by 2030.\n\nIn a post on X, JSO said two activists had \"cut the fence into the private airfield at Stansted where Taylor Swift 's jet is parked, demanding an emergency treaty to end fossil fuels by 2030\".\n\nA video posted by the group, showed one activist cutting the fence and another spraying the paint.\n\nWhile the activists claimed Taylor Swift's jet was parked at the airfield, police clarified that her aircraft was not present during the incident. However, flight tracking data showed Swift's private jet had landed at Stansted the previous night.\n\nSwift was scheduled to perform three shows at London's Wembley Stadium from Friday through Sunday, according to a report by BBC.\n\nThe protest at Stansted Airport, which is often used by government officials and visiting world leaders, including US President Joe Biden, was not a threat to the public, according to an airport spokesperson. The incident occurred about three miles from the main terminal.\n\nIn a statement, the Just Stop Oil group said the protest was aimed at highlighting the disparity between the lavish lifestyles of the ultra-wealthy, who can afford private jets, and the devastating impacts of climate change on millions of people. The group demanded that the UK government legally commit to phasing out fossil fuels by 2030.\n\nIn February, lawyers representing Taylor Swift threatened legal action against a student who was tracking Swift's jet use on social media. The X account CelebJets reported that Swift's plane was the most frequently used among celebrities, emitting over 8,000 tonnes of carbon. A spokesperson for Swift responded by denying that she was on every flight, stating that her plane is often loaned out to others.\n\nThe incident at Stansted Airport came a day after Just Stop Oil activists sprayed orange paint on the iconic Stonehenge monument, which was condemned by heritage organizations and political leaders. Restorers were able to clean the paint from the stones using blown air to avoid damaging the rare lichens on the surface, according to a report by Guardian.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Stop_Oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Just Stop Oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_jet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Business jet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stansted_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London Stansted Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aerodrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Indian_Express", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Indian Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vandalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_extinguisher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fire extinguisher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Essex Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stonehenge"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Painting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Painting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/Untitled-design-2-12.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666973", "eventUri": "eng-9666973", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

They have sprayed orange paint over private jets on the airfield where Taylor Swift's private plane is said to have used.\n\nThey claim Taylor Swift's jet landed at the airfield just hours before, though it remains uncertain whether Swift's aircraft was among those targeted by the eco-protesters. The popstar is due to perform a string of Eras Tour shows in Wembley Stadium over the coming days.\n\nIt comes shortly after the group sprayed orange paint on Stonehenge on Wednesday (June 19). Two climate activists have since been arrested taking part in the protest, calling for the next government to commit to phasing out fossil fuels by 2030.\n\nToday (June 20), in the early hours of the morning, the two activists reportedly breached security at the Essex airport around 5am. They proceeded to douse private jets in orange paint using modified fire extinguishers, members said.\n\nIn a statement by the environmental protest group, the duo were identified as 28-year-old Jennifer Kowalski, a former sustainability manager from West Dunbartonshire. Alongside Brighton-based Cole Macdonald, aged 22.\n\nOn X, Just Stop Oil declared: \"Jennifer and Cole cut the fence into the private airfield at Stansted where @taylorswift13's jet is parked, demanding an emergency treaty to end fossil fuels by 2030.\"\n\nExplaining their motive, the group said: \"Whilst governments are allowing oil corporations to run amok destroying our communities, the actions of individuals mean very little That's why Just Stop Oil is demanding that our next government sign up to a legally binding treaty to phase out fossil fuels by 2030.\n\n\"Failure to defend the people they represent will mean Just Stop Oil supporters, along with citizens from Austria, Canada, Norway, the Netherlands and Switzerland will join in resistance this summer, if their own governments do not take meaningful action.\"", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charlotte_smith@walesonline.co.uk", "name":

It is likely that her jet would therefore not have been left on the runway.\n\nAs subsequent images appear, a rebel in a Just Stop Oil emblem tee sprays the fuselage and windows of two high-end white aircrafts, sitting triumphantly on the tarmac alongside another activist post-vandalism.\n\nVoicing their discontent, Macdonald stated: We're living in two worlds: one where billionaires live in luxury, able to fly in private jets away from the other, where unliveable conditions are being imposed on countless millions.\n\n\"Meanwhile, this system that is allowing extreme wealth to be accrued by a few, to the detriment of everyone else, is destroying the conditions necessary to support human life in a rapidly accelerating never-ending 'cruel summer'.\n\n\"Billionaires are not untouchable, climate breakdown will affect every single one of us.\"\n\nKowalski said: \"Over the years, I've had to realise that even working in sustainability provides me with essentially no ability to make the necessary changes to prevent the complete collapse of our natural systems. I have to take desperate measures to make my voice heard.\n\n\"In 2024 we all have to be considering what we can do each day to change the course our society is on. We need an emergency treaty to stop the extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030.\"\n\nThe most recent protest by the group occurred after two Just Stop Oil activists were found splattering orange paint over Stonehenge on Tuesday.\n\nEssex Police said: \"Officers have responded quickly and made two arrests following reports of people gaining access to a private area of an airfield at Stansted Airport.\n\n\"We were called shortly before 5.10am today (Thursday 20 June). It was reported two people had gained access to an area well away from the runway and main passenger terminal, before causing damage to two aircraft.\n\n\"Officers were on the scene within minutes and detained two people. The airport and flights are operating as normal.\n\n\"A 22-year-old woman from Brighton, and a 28-year-old woman from Dumbarton, have been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and interference with the use or operation of national infrastructure.\"\n\nChief Superintendent Simon Anslow said: \"I would like to reassure passengers and the wider public that we are well prepared and resourced to deal with incidents of this nature.\n\n\"Almost immediately after we were made aware of this incident, which took place away from the main passenger terminal, we were on the scene.\n\n\"We maintain a constant presence at the airport and this presence will be heightened over the summer period.\n\n\"We have a good working relationship with London Stansted Airport to ensure you can go about your travels with minimal impact.

Two activists were arrested for vandalism at London Stansted Airport, spray-painting private jets. Taylor Swift's private jet was not at the airport during the incident, despite the environmental group's claim. SIMPLEFLYING VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nOn Thursday, June 20, two climate activists were arrested for trespassing and vandalism at London Stansted Airport (STN). These activists, who were a part of the climate activist group, Just Stop Oil, allegedly cut through a wire fence at the airport early Thursday. The climate activists then used a fire extinguisher to cover several private jets in a coat of orange spray paint. London Stansted Airport is also the airfield that Taylor Swift flew her private jet into just hours before the incident occurred.\n\nJust Stop Oil activists demand an end to fossil fuels\n\nThe incident occurred early in the morning on June 20. The two environmentalists, Jennifer Kowalski and Cole Macdonald, allegedly entered the airport at 05:00 local time. The two activists were able to enter the airport by cutting through the chain-link fence that surrounded the nearby private terminal. Kowalski and Macdonald then used a fire extinguisher to spray orange paint on at least two private jets, per AP News.\n\nThe environmental group, Just Stop Oil, took credit for the incident later that morning. A spokesperson for the group stated,\n\n\"Whilst governments are allowing oil corporations to run amok destroying our communities, the actions of individuals mean very little. That's why Just Stop Oil is demanding that our next government sign up to a legally binding treaty to phase out fossil fuels by 2030.\"\n\nThe Essex police have reported that both Macdonald and Kowalski were arrested. The Essex police said in a statement,\n\n\"A 22-year-old woman from Brighton, and a 28-year-old woman from Dumbarton, have been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and interference with the use or operation of national infrastructure.\"\n\nThe incident occurred near one of the airport's private terminals, which is about three miles from the airport's main terminal. Essex police stated that there was no immediate threat to the public.\n\nTaylor Swift's private jet\n\nAllegedly, the famous pop star's private jet arrived at the airport just hours before the incident occurred. Just Stop Oil stated that London Stansted Airport is where Swift's jet was located, but Essex police have reported that the aircraft was not at the airfield at the time of the incident, per AP News. Swift had arrived in London to perform three shows, as a part of her world-famous Eras Tour, this upcoming weekend.\n\nRelated Upgraded Dassault Falcon 7X: A Look At Taylor Swift's Private Jet Taylor Swift and her team operate a Dassault Falcon 7X.\n\nSwift, who flies in a Dassault Falcon 7X, has come under scrutiny recently for her extensive use of her private jet. According to JetSpy, Swift's private jet has operated a total of 97 flights so far this year. These flights have accumulated to a total flight time of 216 hours. Per JetSpy, these flights have utilized over 77,000 total gallons of fuel. This is estimated to equal about 742 metric tons of carbon emissions.\n\nPreviously, climate activists have criticized Swift for her extensive use of her private jet. Her use of her private jet in 2022 placed her near the top of celebrities who emit the most carbon emissions. However, her PR team have stated that not all flights are operated by Swift, as she frequently loans out her jet to others.", "source": {"uri": "simpleflying.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Simple Flying"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Stop_Oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Just Stop Oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_jet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Business jet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stansted_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London Stansted Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vandalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Environmental movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_extinguisher", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fire extinguisher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerodrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Essex"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Essex"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Environmentalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dassault_Falcon_7X", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dassault Falcon 7X"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Popular music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gallon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Aeronautical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Aeronautical", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/photo_2024-06-20-05-20.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666973", "eventUri": "eng-9666973", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 471, "textEnd": 478, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

According to Yard, her jet flew 170 times that year, emitting a total of 8,293.54 tonnes of CO2, which they noted was 1,184.8 times more than the average person's annual emissions.\n\nThe two women, Jennifer Kowalski, 28, and Cole Macdonald, 22, have been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and interference with national infrastructure in connection with the incident. The activists reportedly used fire extinguishers filled with orange paint for their demonstration.\n\nIn a statement, Just Stop Oil stated that the action was aimed at pressuring the next UK government, following the July 4 general election, to commit to a legal phase-out of fossil fuels by 2030.\n\n\"Jennifer and Cole cut the fence into the private airfield at Stansted where @taylorswift13's jet is parked, demanding an emergency treaty to end fossil fuels by 2030,\" the statement said.\n\nThe post accompanied by a video showed one of the activist cutting a hole in the fence before spraying paint over the jets.\n\nIn the video, the duo also confirms that they have spray painted two private jets.\n\nAn airport spokesperson said that the incident occurred three miles (5 kilometers) from the main terminal, and police assured the public there was no threat.\n\nLocated 30 miles (50 kilometers) northeast of central London, the airfield is the city's third busiest airport, frequently utilised by government officials and visiting world leaders, including US President Joe Biden.\n\nJust Stop Oil is among several environmental groups across Europe that have garnered both attention and criticism for their tactics, which include disrupting sporting events, splashing paint and food on famous works of art, and interrupting traffic to raise awareness about

Swift's private jet became an unwitting target in a London airport protest. Eco-activists from the group Just Stop Oil doused several private jets with orange paint, with Swift's plane reportedly among those present at the moment. The Cruel Summer singer's jet was believed to have just landed hours before the \"second anti-fossil fuels protest,\" took shape.\n\nTaylor Swift's name has been added to an expanding roster of stars under scrutiny for their use of private jets. As concerns over carbon emissions mount, leading to widespread worry about increasing global warming, her Eras Tour jet consumption has reportedly riled up climate activists.\n\nJennifer Kowalski and Cole Macdonald, the two Just Stop Oil eco-activists, are believed to have targeted multiple private jets at London's Stansted Airport. This happened shortly after the pop star's plane touched down there before her concert tour. The event happened around 5 am and involved two activists breaking into the airfield by cutting through the fence and marking the planes orange with fire extinguishers filled with orange paint.\n\nAlso read: Euphoria star Jacob Elordi's X-rated deepfake video involving minor goes viral in over 16+ posts\n\nA video shared by the activists shows them entering the airfield by cutting through the fence. The activists claim, \"Two Just Stop Oil supporters have painted multiple private jets on the airfield where Taylor Swift's jet landed mere hours before.\" While it's unclear whether her plane was also painted orange, the protesters shared pictures from the incident alongside their statement.\n\nThis isn't the first time high-profile figures have faced backlash for their regular use of private aircraft.

The Hollywood Reporter contacted the group to clarify the intentions at the Stanstead break-in but did not immediately hear back on Thursday.\n\n\"We're living in two worlds: one where billionaires live in luxury, able to fly in private jets away from the other, where unlivable conditions are being imposed on countless millions,\" MacDonald said in the article posted on the group's website Thursday morning. \"Meanwhile, this system that is allowing extreme wealth to be accrued by a few, to the detriment of everyone else, is destroying the conditions necessary to support human life in a rapidly accelerating never-ending 'cruel summer'. Billionaires are not untouchable, climate breakdown will affect every single one of us.\"\n\nSwift's team previously sent a cease-and-desist letter to the owner of social media accounts that documented tracked her private jet travel. A 2022 study from marketing firm Yard found that Swift was the top celebrity \"offender\" in terms of carbon dioxide emissions, with 170 flights by that point emitting 9,142 tons of carbon dioxide.\n\nIn response, a rep for Swift said in a statement that her plane \"is loaned out regularly to other individuals. To attribute most or all of these trips to her is blatantly incorrect.\"\n\nAdditionally, a rep for Swift told THR when the cease-and-desist letter was sent that before her Eras tour, which Swift is currently taking through the UK, began, \"Taylor purchased more than double the carbon credits needed to offset all of her travel, which includes the tour.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, two Just Stop Oil activists were seen in a video using fire extinguishers to spray paint Stonehenge. The group wrote of the direct action event: \"The Just Stop Oil protestors demanded the incoming government sign up to a legally binding treaty to phase out fossil fuels by 2030.\"\n\nIn a statement to CNN, English Heritage chief executive Nick Merriman said there was no immediate damage to the monument, which will be open for summer solstice celebrations this week.\n\n\"There appears to be no visible damage but that's in no way saying there hasn't been harm, from the very act of having to clean the stones to the distress caused to those for whom Stonehenge holds a spiritual significance.\"", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Reporter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_dolak@hollywoodreporter.com", "name": "Kevin Dolak",

The Eras Tour jet has come under scrutiny against the backdrop of mounting concerns over carbon emissions, leading to widespread worry and a global rise in temperatures.\n\nJennifer Kowalski and Cole Macdonald, two Just Stop Oil eco-activists, are suspected of targeting multiple private jets at London's Stansted Airport. This incident occurred shortly after the pop star's plane landed there ahead of her concert tour. Around 5 am, the activists broke into the airfield by cutting through the fence and sprayed the planes orange using fire extinguishers filled with orange paint.\n\nThe activists shared a video of them entering the airfield by bypassing the fence. The activists claim, \"Two Just Stop Oil supporters have painted multiple private jets on the airfield where Taylor Swift's jet landed mere hours before.\" Although it is not clear whether Swift's plane was also doused in orange, the protesters released photos of the incident alongside their statement.\n\nNow this is not the first time where high-profile figures have faced a backlash about their regular use of private jets. Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Leonardo DiCaprio have all faced criticism for their frequent private jet use. However, Taylor Swift has become the main focus due to her constant touring. The 14-time Grammy winner is scheduled to perform next at Wembley Stadium on Friday.\n\nAs per Macdonald, \"We're living in two worlds: one where billionaires live in luxury, able to fly in private jets away from the other, where unlivable conditions are being imposed on countless millions.\" including Swift's song pun the protester added, \"Meanwhile, this system that is allowing extreme wealth to be accrued by a few, to the detriment of everyone else, is destroying the conditions necessary to support human life in a rapidly accelerating never-ending 'cruel summer'.", "source": {"uri": "newsx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsX"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_jet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Business jet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Environmentalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Stop_Oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Just Stop Oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerodrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faisalabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Faisalabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Faisalabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Concert tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stansted_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London Stansted Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_extinguisher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fire extinguisher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_DiCaprio", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leonardo DiCaprio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Gates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Painting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Painting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Visual_Arts/Painting", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Visual Arts/Painting", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Painting", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Painting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Painting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Painting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Taylor-swift.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666973", "eventUri": "eng-9666973", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

It also comes as the singer touched down in the UK for the latest leg of her mammoth 'Eras Tour' just hours earlier.\n\nIn footage and images of the incident, two activists appeared to use a circular saw to get through a chainlink fence protecting the private airfield at Stansted Airport on Thursday morning (June 20). They then painted two private jets by using fire extinguishers filled with orange paint, before taking photos in front of them.\n\n\"Jennifer and Cole cut the fence into the private airfield at Stansted where Taylor Swift's jet is parked, demanding an emergency treaty to end fossil fuels by 2030,\" the group shared. \"We're living in two worlds: one where billionaires live in luxury, able to fly in private jets away from the other, where unlivable conditions are being imposed on countless millions.\n\n\"Meanwhile, this system that is allowing extreme wealth to be accrued by a few, to the detriment of everyone else, is destroying the conditions necessary to support human life in a rapidly accelerating never-ending 'cruel summer'. Billionaires are not untouchable, climate breakdown will affect every single one of us.\"\n\nPolice have told The Independent that Swift's jet wasn't at the private airfield at the time of the incident, although flight tracking data has shown that the 'Midnights' singer's Falcon 7x jet landed in Stansted at around 11pm last night.\n\nA spokesperson for the Essex Police said that officers had moved quickly to arrest the two on suspicion of criminal damage and interference with the use or operation of national infrastructure. They also shared that those arrested were a 22-year-old woman from Brighton and a 28-year-old woman from Dumbarton.\n\nIt comes after Swift has gained increasing scrutiny for her travel in private jets, with many criticising the artist as being oblivious to the CO2 emissions released on every flight.\n\nA further comment on the incident this morning was shared by a Stansted airport spokesman, who told The Independent: \"Shortly after 5am, Essex Police arrested two protestors who had entered the private aviation area of the airfield, away from the runway and main passenger terminal.\n\n\"As a precaution, runway operations were suspended for a short period, but no flights were disrupted, and the airport and flights are operating as normal.\"\n\nChief Superintendent Simon Anslow also spoke to the outlet, saying: \"I would like to reassure passengers and the wider public that we are well prepared and resourced to deal with incidents of this nature. Almost immediately after we were made aware of this incident, which took place away from the main passenger terminal, we were on the scene.\n\n\"We maintain a constant presence at the airport and this presence will be heightened over the summer period. We have a good working relationship with Manchester Airport Group and Stansted Airport to ensure you can go about your travels with minimal impact. We are not anti-protest but we will always take action where criminal acts take place.\"\n\nIn other Taylor Swift news, the singer recently confirmed that her career-spanning show, the 'Eras' tour, will come to an end this December. The tour began in March 2023, and has recently crossed its 100th show. Swift performed one night in Cardiff earlier this week (June 18) - where she performed 'I Hate It Here' live for the first time.\n\nNow, she is gearing up for three shows in London's Wembley Stadium on June 21-23, before heading to Dublin on June 28 and eventually taking the tour around Europe.", "source": {"uri": "nme.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos,

While it isn't known who owns the jets targeted, according to a press release from the group, Swift's jet is currently stationed at London Stansted Airport.\n\nThe pop superstar is bringing her record-breaking Eras Tour to London. She is expected to perform in the city from June 21 to 23. Newsweek emailed Swift's publicist for comment on Thursday.\n\nJust Stop Oil shared the news on X, formerly Twitter, writing: \"Jennifer and Cole cut the fence into the private airfield at Stansted where @taylorswift13's jet is parked, demanding an emergency treaty to end fossil fuels by 2030.\"\n\nThe accompanying video shows two women cutting fencing wire at the airfield site. Then, the clip shows the activists spraying two different jets with orange paint.\n\nAnother post from the group on X reads: \"80% of the population have never taken a flight. Just 1% of people cause 50% of global aviation emissions. Private jet users are responsible for up to 14x as much carbon emissions compared with a commercial flight.\"\n\nIn a statement online, one of the protesters said: \"We're living in two worlds: one where billionaires live in luxury, able to fly in private jets away from the other, where unlivable conditions are being imposed on countless millions. Meanwhile, this system that is allowing extreme wealth to be accrued by a few, to the detriment of everyone else, is destroying the conditions necessary to support human life in a rapidly accelerating never-ending 'cruel summer.' Billionaires are not untouchable, climate breakdown will affect every single one of us.\"\n\nSwift's private jet usage has been a talking point in recent years. In 2022, she faced backlash after a report by environmentally oriented marketing firm Yard found at that time that her extensive use of a private jet made her the biggest celebrity polluter of the year up to that point.\n\nThe report used publicly available data to compile a list of the top greenhouse gas-emitting celebrities, based on their routine use of private jets. Swift came out on top, with a total of 170 flights on her private jet that added up to nearly 16 days in the air.\n\n\"Taylor's jet is loaned out regularly to other individuals,\" a spokesperson for Swift told Newsweek at the time. \"To attribute most or all of these trips to her is blatantly incorrect.\"\n\nThe conversation about Swift's jet use continued in 2023, as the singer-songwriter flew between New York and Kansas City, Missouri, to see her boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. She also made trips between performances in South America for her Eras Tour. The star was criticized after it was revealed her private jet flights had allegedly produced 138 tons of CO2 emissions in just three months.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "billie_schwab_dunn@newsweek.com", "name": "Billie Schwab Dunn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Stop_Oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Just Stop Oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_jet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Business jet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aerodrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stansted_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London Stansted Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Environmental movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Aeronautical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Aeronautical", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 24}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2413331/taylor-swift.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=68dbceb5a95686ce5c3a3da5bd616d03", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666973", "eventUri": "eng-9666973", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-21", "dateEnd": "2024-06-23", "textStart": 510, "textEnd": 523}], "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

More info\n\nGood Morning Britain was forced to interrupt their broadcast for a surprise news update revealing Just Stop Oil activists had invaded a private airfield at Stansted Airport.\n\nThe protestors managed to breach the Greater London Airport's defences, slicing through a fence before vandalising two seemingly unattended private jets with splashes of vibrant orange paint - all filmed for posterity.\n\nAs the breaking news unfolded, ITV's frontline team, Susanna Reid and her co-star Adil Ray, relayed the situation live on air to their understandably captivated audience. Susanna declared: \"We have breaking news this morning that the Just Stop Oil activists who we saw at Stone Henge yesterday... Well, a number of other activists this morning have broken into a private airfield at Stansted Airport.\"\n\nThe footage of activists wielding power tools to penetrate the airfield's barrier and proceeding to spraypaint one of the private jets with their hallmark colour was screened next.\n\nDemonstrating the film, Susanna narrated: \"You can see them here cutting through the fence and then defacing two private jets with orange paint\", reports the Express.\n\nShe informed viewers about a rather curious detail: \"Now this is the airfield where they say Taylor Swift's private jet is believed to be parked.\"\n\nHowever, reassuring fans and curious viewers alike, she swiftly added: \"But this was not one of the jets which was attacked.\"\n\nContinuing with their breaking news coverage, co-host Adil contributed: \"Now it comes a day after protestors from the same group sprayed parts of Stone Henge with orange powder paint.\"\n\nTaking things even further, two members from Just Stop Oil confessed they had infiltrated the airfield early Thursday dawn around 5am, armed with fire extinguishers packed with orange paint which was used to emblazon the aircrafts.\n\nThe duo involved in the climate protest at Stansted Airport have been identified as Jennifer Kowalski, 28, a former sustainability manager from Dumbarton, West Dunbartonshire, and Cole Macdonald, 22, from Brighton.\n\nJust Stop Oil took to Twitter to announce: \"Jennifer and Cole cut the fence into the private airfield at Stansted where taylorswift13's jet is parked, demanding an emergency treaty to end fossil fuels by 2030.\"\n\nGood Morning Britain's audience quickly took to social media to express their opinions on the act of vandalism. One viewer commented: \"Probably best to stop promoting them on your show It's exactly what they want.\"\n\nAnother added their voice to the discussion, saying: \"How can they expect public support when they are going to bring into question public safety, people are nervous about flying as it is?\"\n\nCraig weighed in with his take: \"This isn't breaking news. It's 2 bomps vandalising a fence and spray painting 2 private jets, you're giving them exactly what they want.\"\n\nGet the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.

The activists broke into London's Stansted Airport and sprayed two jets with orange paint. Swift's jet wasn't at the airport at the time.\n\nTwo climate activists from the Just Stop Oil group were arrested after covering private jets in orange paint in a Taylor Swift-inspired stunt.\n\nA video posted on X on Thursday showed the two activists breaking into a private airfield at London's Stansted Airport -- where they claimed Swift's jet was parked -- before spraying two jets with paint.\n\nHowever, a representative for Stansted Airport told Business Insider that Swift's jet wasn't at the airport when the incident occurred.\n\nIt's possible that Swift's aircraft originally landed at the airport before being moved. According to flight tracking data cited by The Independent, Swift's Falcon 7x landed at Stansted at around 11 p.m. on Wednesday.\n\nA spokesperson for Essex Police told BI that a 22-year-old from Brighton, England, and a 25-year-old from Dumbarton, Scotland, had been arrested \"on suspicion of criminal damage and interference with the use or operation of national infrastructure.\"\n\nThey were detained shortly after 5:10 a.m. on Thursday morning, the statement added.\n\n\"We are not anti-protest but we will always take action where criminal acts take place,\" Chief Superintendent Simon Anslow said in a statement obtained by BI.\n\nThe protesters belonged to Just Stop Oil, a climate campaign group that has defaced famous artwork and landmarks, which most recently included spraying Stonehenge with orange paint.\n\nA representative for Just Stop Oil confirmed to BI that the planes doused in paint did not belong to Swift.\n\nThey said the protest was \"generally targeted at private planes,\" though the two people involved likely believed Swift's aircraft was at the airport.\n\nThe representative said the group singled out Swift's aircraft in its social media post because it is \"the most emitting\" of all celebrity private jets and because they believed that Stansted is where she usually keeps her private jet while in London.\n\nBI previously reported that the singer spent more than 166 hours traveling in private jets between March and August of 2023 for the first leg of her widely popular Eras Tour.\n\nHowever, according to a study by My Climate Tracker, cited by The Tab, Travis Scott was the celebrity with the most private jet use in 2023. The rapper took 137 flights, resulting in 6,061,300 kg of CO2 emissions, according to The Tab.\n\nMeanwhile, Swift wasn't among the top 30 celebrities with the most private jet use in 2023, the outlet said.\n\nThat's a stark contrast to 2022.\n\nAccording to Yard, a UK-based sustainability marketing firm, Swift produced the most CO2 emissions of all celebrities in 2022, with 170 flights and an average flight time of 80 minutes.\n\nA spokesperson for Swift previously told BI that her jet is \"loaned out regularly to other individuals\" and to attribute most of the trips to the singer alone is \"blatantly incorrect.\"\n\nThe singer's spokesperson also previously said she had purchased carbon credits to offset her jet use.\n\nSwift is in London for the UK leg of the Eras Tour. She is expected to perform three sold-out shows at Wembley before returning in August for additional shows.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mikhaila_friel@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Mikhaila Friel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Stop_Oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Just Stop Oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_jet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Business jet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stansted_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London Stansted Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "British Isles"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Essex Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stonehenge"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vandalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumbarton", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dumbarton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dumbarton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travis Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tab", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Tab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Aeronautical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Aeronautical", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Aviation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/66740a95087acd2be9b4f938?format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666973", "eventUri": "eng-9666973", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Earlier, on Wednesday, supporters of the group also covered the iconic Stonehenge in orange powder paint to lodge their protests.\n\n\"We're living in two worlds: one where billionaires live in luxury, able to fly in private jets away from the other, where unlivable conditions are being imposed on countless millions,\" Macdonald said in a statement. \"Meanwhile, this system that is allowing extreme wealth to be accrued by a few, to the detriment of everyone else, is destroying the conditions necessary to support human life in a rapidly accelerating never-ending 'cruel summer'. Billionaires are not untouchable, climate breakdown will affect every single one of us.\"\n\nKowalski, a former sustainability manager, said that her work in sustainability gave her \"no ability to make the necessary changes,\" and that she had no choice but to take \"desperate measures to make my voice heard.\"\n\nJust Stop Oil, in their statement, said that estimates suggest that 80% of the world's population has never taken a flight, while 1% of people cause 50% of global aviation emissions.\n\n\"Private jet users are responsible for up to 14x as much carbon emissions compared with a commercial flight,\" the group said. \"A single flight in a private jet can easily emit as much carbon dioxide as the average annual carbon footprint for an EU citizen - 8.2 tons.\"\n\nWhile Stanstead Airport declined to comment on if Swift's jet was present at the airport at the time of incident, a spokesperson told Business Insider that Swift's jet wasn't present at the airport when the incident occurred. However, The Independent, citing flight tracking reported that Swift's Falcon 7x landed at the airport around 11 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nSwift's jet to emit half a million kgs of CO2 in 2024\n\nSwift as often faced backlash from climate change activists and protest groups over her excessive use of private jets. The award-winning singer previously owned two jets but sold one at the beginning of the year.\n\nIn 2023, Swift's two jets traveled up to 178,000 miles, emitting 1,200 tons of carbon dioxide, according to a report in The Tennessean, part of the USA TODAY Network. The majority of those flights were to Los Angeles, New York, Nashville and concert stops for the 2023 Eras Tour.\n\nPayless Power, a Texas-based company, in a report, estimated that Swift will fly approximately 43,688 kilometers and emit 511,154 kilograms of CO2 for the Eras Tour in 2024. To put this into perspective, it's the equivalent of driving 1,307,311 miles in a gasoline-powered passenger vehicle. It's also equivalent to the emissions made from 67 households in an entire year.\n\nAlthough this may seem like a lot for the singer conducting a record-breaking tour across the world, the report states her 2024 travel still doesn't come close to the top celebrity emitters of 2023: Travis Scott (6.06 million kilograms of CO2), Kim Kardashian (5.86 million) and Elon Musk (4.56 million).\n\nContributing: Bryan West, USA TODAY NETWORK", "source": {"uri": "freep.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Detroit Free Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Meanwhile, this system that is allowing extreme wealth to be accrued by a few, to the detriment of everyone else, is destroying the conditions necessary to support human life in a rapidly accelerating never-ending 'cruel summer.' Billionaires are not untouchable, climate breakdown will affect every single one of us.\"\n\nPolice said Swift's jet wasn't actually at the airfield when the incident occurred, but it had landed there hours earlier. The two protesters were arrested on \"suspicion of criminal damage and interference with the use or operation of national infrastructure.\"\n\nThis comes shortly after Just Stop Oil pulled a similar stunt at Stonehenge.", "source": {"uri": "uproxx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UPROXX"}, "authors": [{"uri": "derrick_rossignol@uproxx.com", "name": "Derrick Rossignol", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "aaron_williams@uproxx.com", "name": "Aaron Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "wongo_okon@uproxx.com", "name": "Wongo Okon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "grant_sharples@uproxx.com", "name": "Grant Sharples", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_jet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Business jet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aerodrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Stop_Oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Just Stop Oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stansted_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London Stansted Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NME", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NME"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stonehenge"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_damage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Property damage"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleogeography_and_Paleoclimatology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2-taylor-swift.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666973", "eventUri": "eng-9666973", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Earlier, on Wednesday, supporters of the group also covered the iconic Stonehenge in orange powder paint to lodge their protests.\n\n\"We're living in two worlds: one where billionaires live in luxury, able to fly in private jets away from the other, where unlivable conditions are being imposed on countless millions,\" Macdonald said in a statement. \"Meanwhile, this system that is allowing extreme wealth to be accrued by a few, to the detriment of everyone else, is destroying the conditions necessary to support human life in a rapidly accelerating never-ending 'cruel summer'. Billionaires are not untouchable, climate breakdown will affect every single one of us.\"\n\nKowalski, a former sustainability manager, said that her work in sustainability gave her \"no ability to make the necessary changes,\" and that she had no choice but to take \"desperate measures to make my voice heard.\"\n\nJust Stop Oil, in their statement, said that estimates suggest that 80% of the world's population has never taken a flight, while 1% of people cause 50% of global aviation emissions.\n\n\"Private jet users are responsible for up to 14x as much carbon emissions compared with a commercial flight,\" the group said. \"A single flight in a private jet can easily emit as much carbon dioxide as the average annual carbon footprint for an EU citizen - 8.2 tons.\"\n\nWhile Stanstead Airport declined to comment on if Swift's jet was present at the airport at the time of incident, a spokesperson told Business Insider that Swift's jet wasn't present at the airport when the incident occurred. However, The Independent, citing flight tracking reported that Swift's Falcon 7x landed at the airport around 11 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nSwift as often faced backlash from climate change activists and protest groups over her excessive use of private jets. The award-winning singer previously owned two jets but sold one at the beginning of the year.\n\nIn 2023, Swift's two jets traveled up to 178,000 miles, emitting 1,200 tons of carbon dioxide, according to a report in The Tennessean, part of the USA TODAY Network. The majority of those flights were to Los Angeles, New York, Nashville and concert stops for the 2023 Eras Tour.\n\nPayless Power, a Texas-based company, in a report, estimated that Swift will fly approximately 43,688 kilometers and emit 511,154 kilograms of CO2 for the Eras Tour in 2024. To put this into perspective, it's the equivalent of driving 1,307,311 miles in a gasoline-powered passenger vehicle. It's also equivalent to the emissions made from 67 households in an entire year.\n\nAlthough this may seem like a lot for the singer conducting a record-breaking tour across the world, the report states her 2024 travel still doesn't come close to the top celebrity emitters of 2023: Travis Scott (6.06 million kilograms of CO2), Kim Kardashian (5.86 million) and Elon Musk (4.56 million).\n\nContributing: Bryan West, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nSaman Shafiq is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

According to flight tracking data cited by The Independent, Swift's Falcon 7x landed at Stansted at around 11 p.m. on Wednesday.\n\nA spokesperson for Essex Police told BI that a 22-year-old from Brighton, England, and a 25-year-old from Dumbarton, Scotland, had been arrested \"on suspicion of criminal damage and interference with the use or operation of national infrastructure.\"\n\nThey were detained shortly after 5:10 a.m. on Thursday morning, the statement added.\n\n\"We are not anti-protest but we will always take action where criminal acts take place,\" Chief Superintendent Simon Anslow said in a statement obtained by BI.\n\nThe protesters belonged to Just Stop Oil, a climate campaign group that has defaced famous artwork and landmarks, which most recently included spraying Stonehenge with orange paint.\n\nA representative for Just Stop Oil confirmed to BI that the planes doused in paint did not belong to Swift.\n\nThey said the protest was \"generally targeted at private planes,\" though the two people involved likely believed Swift's aircraft was at the airport.\n\nThe representative said the group singled out Swift's aircraft in its social media post because it is \"the most emitting\" of all celebrity private jets and because they believed that Stansted is where she usually keeps her private jet while in London.\n\nBI previously reported that the singer spent more than 166 hours traveling in private jets between March and August of 2023 for the first leg of her widely popular Eras Tour.\n\nHowever, according to a study by My Climate Tracker, cited by The Tab, Travis Scott was the celebrity with the most private jet use in 2023. The rapper took 137 flights, resulting in 6,061,300 kg of CO2 emissions, according to The Tab.\n\nMeanwhile, Swift wasn't among the top 30 celebrities with the most private jet use in 2023, the outlet said.\n\nThat's a stark contrast to 2022.\n\nAccording to Yard, a UK-based sustainability marketing firm, Swift produced the most CO2 emissions of all celebrities in 2022, with 170 flights and an average flight time of 80 minutes.\n\nA spokesperson for Swift previously told BI that her jet is \"loaned out regularly to other individuals\" and to attribute most of the trips to the singer alone is \"blatantly incorrect.\"\n\nThe singer's spokesperson also previously said she had purchased carbon credits to offset her jet use.\n\nSwift is in London for the UK leg of the Eras Tour.

The X account CelebJets, found that the plane owned by Swift, was the most used by celebrities emitting more than 8,000 tonnes of carbon. A spokesperson for the singer denied that Swift was on every flight, saying her plane is loaned out to others.\n\nThe Stansted demonstration came as English Heritage pleaded with JSO to stop targeting cultural monuments after two protesters sprayed orange power on Stonehenge.\n\nNick Merriman, the chief executive of the national body that cares hundreds of national properties and sites including Stonehenge, condemned the protest as \"vandalism to one of the world's most celebrated ancient monuments\".\n\nTwo Just Stop Oil activists were arrested after the incident on Wednesday before summer solstice celebrations at the monument, which are due to begin on Thursday evening.\n\nThe group has targeted a series of cultural institutions in recent months including disrupting a Proms concert at the Royal Albert Hall; damaging a case around the Magna Carta at the British Library and throwing tomato soup over Vincent van Gogh's Sunflowers in the National Gallery.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday, Merriman said: \"We respect the rights of people to protest as an important right in British life. But we wish people would channel their protests, away from cultural heritage sites, museums and galleries, because we feel that doesn't actually help their cause and causes this huge upset and disruption to the operation of these important sites.\"\n\nIn a statement about the Stonehenge protest, Just Stop Oil said it was time for \"megalithic action\" to stop the extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030.\n\nIt said: \"Continuing to burn coal, oil and gas will result in the death of millions. We have to come together to defend humanity, or we risk everything. That's why Just Stop Oil is demanding that our next government sign up to a legally binding treaty to phase out fossil fuels by 2030.\"\n\nMerriman said the protest was \"difficult to understand\".\n\nHe said: \"Stonehenge is about 5,000 years old, and people in those ancient times were living so sustainably, and the stones are a testament to the desire of people to connect with nature and the Earth and the sun and the moon as well as each other.\"\n\nRestorers have managed to clean the orange powder from the stones using blown air to avoid damaging rare lichens on the surface, Merriman said.\n\nHe said: \"Lichens are very fragile and sensitive indications of climate change, and the lichens on Stonehenge are actually quite rare in southern England. Luckily, our staff moved very quickly to remove the powdered substance from the lichen so it looks like they are OK.\"\n\nHe also warned that if conditions had been wet more damage could have been done.\n\nMerriman said: \"We were very lucky, given that the atrocious weather we've had recently, that it wasn't done in pouring rain, where we fear that there would have been quite some considerable damage to the lichens.\"\n\nHe added: \"The site is open to the public again and for the solstice tomorrow.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"},

Two activists from the group Just Stop Oil appeared to be targeting pop singer Taylor Swift's private jet, which they believed was parked at the Stansted Airport.\n\nIn a statement, Just Stop Oil named the vandals as Jennifer Kowalski and Cole Macdonald. The group posted a video on X where a person was shown using a power tool to slice through a security fence and using a fire extinguisher to spray paint a jet with bright orange paint. Swift's jet was reportedly not at the airport. The pop star is in London to do three shows at Wembley Stadium.\n\nReportedly, the stunt was meant to gain attention for a Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n\n\"We're living in two worlds: one where billionaires live in luxury, able to fly in private jets away from the other, where unlivable conditions are being imposed on countless millions,\" said 22-year-old Macdonald. \"Meanwhile, this system that is allowing extreme wealth to be accrued by a few, to the detriment of everyone else, is destroying the conditions necessary to support human life in a rapidly accelerating never-ending 'cruel summer'. Billionaires are not untouchable, climate breakdown will affect every single one of us.\"\n\nMacdonald's accomplice Kowalski said, \"Over the years, I've had to realise that even working in sustainability provides me with essentially no ability to make the necessary changes to prevent the complete collapse of our natural systems. I have to take desperate measures to make my voice heard.\"\n\n\"In 2024 we all have to be considering what we can do each day to change the course our society is on. We need an emergency treaty to stop the extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030,\" Kowalski added.\n\nJust Stop Oil threatened more incidents unless their demands are met.\n\n\"Whilst governments are allowing oil corporations to run amok destroying our communities, the actions of individuals mean very little. That's why Just Stop Oil is demanding that our next government sign up to a legally binding treaty to phase out fossil fuels by 2030,\" a group spokesman said.\n\nThe action comes just one day after the group similarly defaced the prehistoric megalithic structure at Stonehenge on the Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire in Southwest England. Just Stop Oil took credit for that stunt as well, which was not paint but an orange cornflour mixture. The group again promised more chicanery should their demands not be met.\n\n\"Failure to defend the people they represent will mean Just Stop Oil supporters, along with citizens from Austria, Canada, Norway, the Netherlands and Switzerland will join in resistance this summer, if their own Governments do not take meaningful action,\" the group proclaimed.\n\nJust Stop Oil is one of several stunt-focused groups that have been disrupting sporting events, defacing priceless art, and vandalizing precious national documents in their quest to gain attention for their pet cause of climate change. How long will it be until one of these groups does actual damage or causes physical harm to someone? Will it take a tragedy before these psychotic protesters finally face unintended consequences of their actions?", "source": {"uri": "thenewamerican.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New

Jennifer Kowalski, a former sustainability manager from Dumbarton, was arrested alongside Cole for painting and vandalising private jets at London's Stansted airport.\n\nAccording to reports, Just Stop Oil's eco-activists painted numerous private planes with orange paint, including Swift's jet. Her flight had landed only hours before the second anti-fossil fuels protest took place.\n\nJust Stop Oil Protesters Target Taylor Swift's Jet\n\nSwift's name has been added to a growing list of celebrities being scrutinised for their usage of private aircrafts. As concerns about carbon emissions grow raising fears about rising global temperatures, her Eras Tour jet use allegedly stirred up climate campaigners.\n\nThe incident happened shortly after the popstar's jet landed at the airport ahead of her concert tour.

Just Stop Oil have posted on X saying two protesters, Jennifer Kowalski and Cole Macdonald, cut the fence into the private airfield at Stansted where the pop star's jet is parked at around 5am this morning.\n\nThe two Just Stop Oil members then proceeded to spray paint two private jets orange, the protest group's signature colour. According to Just Stop Oil, Kowalski and Macdonald used fire extinguishers filled with the orange paint to mark the jets.\n\nThe two protesters claim this was in protest against the very rich, who are \"able to fly in private jets\", unlike millions living in \"unliveable conditions\". Macdonald, 22, from Brighton, said: \"We're living in two worlds: one where billionaires live in luxury, able to fly in private jets away from the other, where unlivable conditions are being imposed on countless millions.\n\nREAD MORE: Tower Hamlets shooting in early morning as suspects in BMW arrested\n\n\"Meanwhile, this system that is allowing extreme wealth to be accrued by a few, to the detriment of everyone else, is destroying the conditions necessary to support human life in a rapidly accelerating never-ending 'cruel summer'. Billionaires are not untouchable, climate breakdown will affect every single one of us.\"\n\nPhotos show the two protesters sitting and standing in front of one of the planes, with Kowalski, 28 holding a fire extinguisher. The former sustainability manager from Dumbarton said: \"Over the years, I've had to realise that even working in sustainability provides me with essentially no ability to make the necessary changes to prevent the complete collapse of our natural systems. I have to take desperate measures to make my voice heard.\n\nIn 2024 we all have to be considering what we can do each day to change the course our society is on. We need an emergency treaty to stop the extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030.\"\n\nTaylor Swift owns one private jet, but according to the Liverpool Echo, it's a $53 million private jet with a kitchen and walk-in shower. Swift currently owns a Dassault 7X model, but did also own a Dassault Falcon 900 which she sold on January 30 of this year, the Mirror reports.\n\nThe Dassault Falcon 900 had a list price of $44million (\u00a338m) when new, with Swift's version boasting a kitchen, a bathroom with a shower and a bedroom. Last year, Swift flew in her jets 170 times, with a number of trips back and forth to watch boyfriend Travis Kelce play his football games with his team the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nHowever Swift has previously been slammed for using private jets in the past after she topped a list of celebrities with the most private jet carbon emissions in 2022. A spokesperson for Swift told the Mirror that she purchased carbon credits to offset the usage of her jets. Swift has tried to limit the information available about her flights in the past by, using the FAA's privacy ICAO aircraft address program, also known as PIA.\n\nGot a story for us?

She travelled to the capital using her private jet, something which has previously prompted widespread criticism. Taylor has faced calls to stop using private jets over climate change fears.\n\nIndeed, Taylor's landing in London came just hours before two Just Stop Oil activists broke into a VIP private airfield at Stansted airport and spray painted aircraft. Amid the latest drama, we've taken a look at all of the controversy surrounding Taylor's private jet usage.\n\nJust Stop Oil protests\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Inside luxury hotel Taylor Swift 'spotted' leaving after The Eras Tour\n\nTwo Just Stop Oil climate protestors have been arrested after filming themselves breaking into a private airfield and spraying aircraft orange. Jennifer Kowalski and Cole Macdonald are believed to have cut into a VIP private airfield at Stansted airport at around 5am and targeted planes using fire extinguishers filled with orange paint.\n\nJust Stop Oil claimed they attacked the airfield after Taylor had landed their earlier that day, however, her plane was not there. A statement from the environmental activists stated: \"Two Just Stop Oil supporters have painted multiple private jets on the airfield where Taylor Swift's jet landed mere hours before.\n\n\"They are demanding that the incoming UK government commit to working with other governments to agree an equitable plan to end the extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030.\" Ms Macdonald, 22, from Brighton, said: \"We're living in two worlds: one where billionaires live in luxury, able to fly in private jets away from the other, where unliveable conditions are being imposed on countless millions.\n\n\"Meanwhile, this system that is allowing extreme wealth to be accrued by a few, to the detriment of everyone else, is destroying the conditions necessary to support human life in a rapidly accelerating never-ending 'cruel summer'. Billionaires are not untouchable, climate breakdown will affect every single one of us.\"\n\nMs Kowalski, 28, who is a former sustainability manager from Dumbarton, said: \"I have to take desperate measures to make my voice heard. In 2024 we all have to be considering what we can do each day to change the course our society is on.\"\n\nEssex Police have said two women, aged 22 and 28, have been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and interference with the use of national infrastructure following the incident.\n\nCarbon footprint\n\nFor her 2024 Eras Tour, Taylor is expected to fly an estimated 43,688 kilometres, excluding any detours. Using data from the myclimate Carbon Tracker, this means she will emit an estimated 511,154 kilograms of CO2.\n\nAccording to Payless Power, the travel emissions from the tour are equal to the annual energy use emissions of 66.7 homes. It's also equivalent to 33,744,692 smartphones being charged.\n\nDuring the Eras Tour, Taylor used her private jet to travel from Tokyo to Las Vegas for the Super Bowl. Gregory Keoleian, co-director of the Centre for Sustainable Systems at the University of Michigan, suggested that would release more than 200,000 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nFan disappointment\n\nIt's not just critics who have found issue with Taylor's private jet usage. Die-hard Swifties are finding it hard to defend the singer's potential impact on the environment.\n\nPosting on Reddit, one person said: \"The more I think about it, the madder I am. Like, I am really just here for Taylor's music and don't really care about her personal life, but this s*** is just so gross.\"\n\nAnother added: \"Not a great look at all Tay!\" while a third commented: \"This ain't it Taylor... I love the music but your billionaire status will eventually turn you into a villain.\"\n\nLegal action threat\n\nCollege student Jack Sweeney uses public information to track the flights of celebrities with the goal of \"transparency and public information\". He published data about Taylor's trips on social media, which then prompted her to threaten legal action against him. Her legal team issued a cease-and-desist letter accusing him of \"stalking and harassing behaviour.\"\n\nA legal letter to Jack, which was sent earlier this year, explained: \"We are aware of your public disputes with other high-profile individuals and your tactics in those interactions, including offering to stop your harmful behaviour only in exchange for items of value. While this may be a game to you, or an avenue that you hope will earn you wealth or fame, it is a life-or-death matter for our Client. Ms. Swift has dealt with stalkers and other individuals who wish her harm.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Taylor told The Mirror: \"We cannot comment on any ongoing police investigation but can confirm the timing of stalkers suggests a connection. His posts tell you exactly when and where she would be.\"\n\nSpeaking to The Mirror after the letter, Jack said: \"It's worth noting, as reported by WAPO, that this letter surfaced days after headlines criticised her jet use and its carbon emissions. A year prior, her team informed the media that her jet is seldom used by her and is often loaned out. These statements contradict each other, much like her team's response to owning a single jet, which has only been true for the past two weeks.\"\n\nWhile Jack expressed clear frustration with many aspects of the situation, he also insisted that he wasn't looking to necessarily target Taylor. In fact, he could even be considered a fan, telling The Mirror: \"Firstly, I'd like to clarify that my intentions are not to cause harm. In fact, I actually like some of Swift's songs.\"\n\n* Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType":

Stop Oil has targeted a private airfield where they claim Taylor Swift's jet landed hours earlier.\n\nTwo demonstrators, named by the group as Jennifer Kowalski, 28, and Cole Macdonald, 22, are said to have entered Stansted airport at around 5am on Thursday as part of their latest stunt.\n\nIt is understood the pair attempted to target Taylor Swift's jet, claiming they knew the plane's tail number, but couldn't find it.\n\nInstead they painted two jets at random using fire extinguishers filled with orange paint.\n\nJust Stop Oil claims the American pop star landed in the private terminal of the airport in Essex just hours earlier.\n\nMs Swift is scheduled to perform at Wembley Stadium on Friday, Saturday and Sunday this week.\n\nMr Macdonald, from Brighton, East Sussex, said: \"We're living in two worlds: one where billionaires live in luxury, able to fly in private jets away from the other, where unlivable conditions are being imposed on countless millions.\n\n\"Meanwhile, this system that is allowing extreme wealth to be accrued by a few, to the detriment of everyone else, is destroying the conditions necessary to support human life in a rapidly accelerating never-ending 'cruel summer'.\n\n\"Billionaires are not untouchable, climate breakdown will affect every single one of us.\"\n\nA Just Stop Oil spokesman said: \"Whilst governments are allowing oil corporations to run amok destroying our communities, the actions of individuals mean very little.\n\n\"That's why Just Stop Oil is demanding that our next government sign up to a legally binding treaty to phase out fossil fuels by 2030.\n\n\"Failure to defend the people they represent will mean Just Stop Oil supporters, along with citizens from Austria, Canada, Norway, the Netherlands and Switzerland will join in resistance this summer, if their own governments do not take meaningful action.\"\n\nYesterday the campaign group was met with a storm of criticism after two protesters sprayed orange powder over Stonehenge, one day before the summer solstice.\n\nNiamh Lynch, 21, and Rajan Naidum, 73, were filmed vandalising the stone circle, near Salisbury, with repurposed fire extinguishers on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nJK Rowling joined Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer in condemning the group's actions.\n\nWiltshire Police have arrested the activists \"on suspicion of damaging the ancient monument\".\n\nMs Rowling derided the group's tactics and said: \"Let's not target anyone or anything remotely responsible for climate change.\n\n\"Let's attack a unique ancient monument to which everyone's hugely attached, incidentally endangering rare lichen that only grows there.\"\n\nEnglish Heritage said the incident was \"extremely upsetting\", and it has instructed its curators to

Once they had gained access, they sprayed orange paint all over two private jets. It didn't take long for Just Stop Oil to accept blame for the incident, incorrectly claiming that superstar Taylor Swift's private jet had been parked at the airfield at the time. This was refuted by the airport.\n\nA video taken by the two shows Macdonald admitting to being \"the one behind\" the painting of the jets, as the pair giggles over the damage they've caused.\n\n\"We need an international treaty against the burning of all oil, coal, and gas,\" Macdonald said in a separate video. \"While people are starving, the elite and the rich fly thousands and thousands of feet in the air, above us all. Billionaires are not untouchable.\"\n\nThe duo found out they weren't untouchable either when police cuffed them on suspicion of criminal damage.\n\nChief Superintendant of the Essex Police, Simon Anslow gave a reassuring statement to the public following the arrests.\n\n\"I would like to reassure passengers and the wider public that we are well prepared and resourced to deal with incidents of this nature,\" he said. \"Almost immediately after we were made aware of this incident, which took place away from the main passenger terminal, we were on the scene. We maintain a constant presence at the airport and this presence will be heightened over the summer period. We have a good working relationship with Manchester Airport Group and Stansted Airport to ensure you can go about your travels with minimal impact.\"\n\n\"We are not anti-protest but we will always take action where criminal acts take place,\" he reiterated.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, Kowalski is a former Swiftie who, along with her sister, was actually able to meet the pop icon at her 2015 show in Glasgow. They had matching Taylor Swift-themed outfits and even lifted the performer in the air for a photo. But apparently there is \"bad blood\" between the two now after Swift was revealed to have some of the highest private jet carbon emissions in 2022, something Kowalski won't stand for.\n\nSwift is reportedly currently in the UK for her record-shattering Eras Tour, and from the sounds of it, she may want to hide her jet.\n\nFeature photo: Photo by Just Stop Oil / Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

(Credit: Just Stop Oil)\n\nClimate change activists spray-painted two jets orange after breaking into a London airport where they claimed Taylor Swift's luxury plane was parked.\n\nThe two vandals, part of the Just Stop Oil environmental activists group, were arrested in a private area of London Stansted Airport on suspicion of criminal damage and interference with the use or operation of national infrastructure.\n\nThe group posted a video of someone cutting through a security fence followed by a clip of a woman using a fire extinguisher to spray orange paint on at least two private jets.\n\nCLIMATE ACTIVISTS SPRAY STONEHENGE WITH ORANGE POWDER, DEMANDING END TO FOSSIL FUELS IN UK\n\nIn a statement, Just Stop Oil named the vandals as Jennifer Kowalski, 28, and Cole Macdonald, 22, and said the pair were demonstrating against fossil fuels and demanding that governments around the world commit to ending \"extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030.\"\n\nThe group said that Taylor Swift's jet had landed on the airfield \"mere hours before,\" although Stanstead Airport was unable to confirm this to Fox News Digital. The airfield, 30 miles northeast of central London, is the city's third-busiest airport and is often used by government officials and visiting world leaders, including President Biden.\n\nSwift is doing three shows at London's Wembley Stadium from Friday through Sunday as part of her \"The Eras Tour.\" On Tuesday, she performed in Cardiff, Wales.\n\n\"While people are starving, the elite and the rich fly thousands and thousands of feet in the air above us all,\" Macdonald says in the video.\n\nDARK MONEY POURED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO ECO ACTIVIST GROUPS BLOCKING HIGHWAYS, DESTROYING FAMOUS ART\n\n\"Billionaires are not untouchable,\" she says as the video cuts to an image of the duo hugging while sitting on the concrete in front of one of the jets.\n\nMacdonald said in a statement that the rich are accruing wealth to the detriment of everyone else, which is \"destroying the conditions necessary to support human life in a rapidly accelerating never-ending 'cruel summer.'\"\n\n\"Cruel Summer\" is the name of one of Swift's hit songs from 2019.\n\nThe incident came the day after the other Just Stop Oil demonstrators targeted and vandalized the ancient Stonehenge monument in southern England as part of a wider protest against fossil fuels. The 4,500-year-old stone circle is aligned toward the sunrise on the summer solstice and sunset on the winter solstice.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThis stunt is similar to dozens committed over the past several years by multiple climate activism organizations that have sought public attention via temporary or superficial vandalism.\n\nJust Stop Oil is one of many of those groups around Europe that have received attention -- and blowback -- for disrupting sporting events, splashing paint and food on famous works of art, and interrupting traffic to draw attention to what they claim is man-made global warming.\n\nFox News' Timothy H.J.

The DWP has been asked to comment.\n\nMailOnline can also reveal that her co-conspirator at Stansted, Cole Macdonald, 22, is a JSO activist from Brighton who was in court only a few weeks ago for another stunt - this time for the Palestinian cause.\n\nKowalski and Macdonald were arrested at Stansted this morning after cutting through a fence. They then ran into the VIP area of the airfield and began spraying private jets using fire extinguishers filled with orange paint before posing for selfies in front of the planes and hugging each other while waiting for police to arrive, telling a camera while laughing: 'We just spray-painted the f*** out of this private jet - and the one behind'.\n\nJust Stop Oil claimed Taylor Swift's luxury jet was parked there while she is in the UK for her Eras Tour. But MailOnline understands it was not one of the two jets defaced.\n\nMacdonald was arrested and charged after she 'locked on' to a road in Sussex in protest against an American arms company based there as part of a Pro-Palestine protest last year.\n\nShe pleaded not guilty at a hearing in May and will appear at Brighton Magistrates' Court in October where, if convicted, she could face up to six months in prison and a fine for a public order offence.\n\nCritics have said that her attack on Stansted again shows how often protesters are being bailed before committing more crimes.\n\nThe attack came less than 24 hours after JSO yobs appalled the world by spraying Stonehenge orange.\n\nThe protesters have been held on suspicion of criminal damage and interference with the use of national infrastructure.\n\nYesterday, the headline-grabbing group targeted Stonehenge in Wiltshire by attacking the ancient monument with spray paint - leading Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to brand them 'a disgrace'.\n\nFar from raising awareness of climate change, their antics sparked widespread condemnation after it emerged activists could have irreparably damaged rare lichen that lives on the rock.\n\nFootage from Stansted this morning shows the pair brazenly cutting through a wire fence at the perimeter of the airfield and crawling under to gain access.\n\nThe pair then proceed to spray paint a series of jets before sitting proudly in front of their vandalism and embracing in a smug hug.\n\nSharing their breaking and entering on social media, a spokesman for the group 'justified' the action by declaring that '80% of the population had never taken a flight.'\n\nMailOnline understands the pair have since been arrested and has approached Essex Police for information.\n\nSpeaking before the stunt, Jennifer Kowalski, 28, who describes herself as a full time JSO activist on Linked In claimed she 'had to take desperate measures to make her voice heard.'\n\nIt is the latest in a series of attention seeking stunts the group has foisted on the public this summer.\n\nYesterday, members of the public were forced to intervene after two Just Stop Oil protesters sprayed Stonehenge with orange paint sparking widespread condemnation.\n\nVideo footage posted on social media showed two people, wearing white shirts with Just Stop Oil emblazoned on the front, running up to the ancient monoliths with canisters and spraying paint all over them.\n\nIn a heroic attempt to stop the group desecrating the stones, one woman was seen desperately trying to drag the protesters away before other members of the public piled in to help her.\n\nThe protesters, who were named as Niamh Lynch, 21, a student from Oxford, and Rajan Naidu, 73, from Birmingham, have now been arrested by police on suspicion of damaging the historical monument.\n\nAs police officers led the pair away, one man could be heard shouting: 'You dirty scum. This is a temple, not a publicity stunt!'\n\nSeveral stones - dating back to the late Neolithic period - were covered during the incident, which happened at around 12pm today, the day before the summer solstice is celebrated at Stonehenge, which is the heart of a World Heritage site.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has condemned the attack as a 'disgraceful act of vandalism to one of the UK's and the world's oldest and most important monuments.'\n\nThe Prime Minister continued: 'Just Stop Oil should be ashamed of their activists, and they and anyone associated with them, including a certain Labour Party donor, should issue a condemnation of this shameful act immediately.'\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said 'Just Stop Oil are pathetic' after activists from the group targeted Stonehenge.\n\nIn a tweet, he wrote: 'The damage done to Stonehenge is outrageous. Just Stop oil are pathetic. Those responsible must face the full force of the law.'\n\nHistorian Tom Holland, who has previously hailed Stonehenge as one of Europe's most precious prehistoric sites, also criticised the attack.\n\nHe wrote on X: 'Parade your concern for the planet by destroying endangered lichens. Sympathy transmuted into utter loathing.'\n\nWiltshire Police said officers had attended the scene and arrested two people.\n\nA spokesman added: 'At around noon, we responded to a report that orange paint had been sprayed on some of the stones by two suspects.\n\n'Officers attended the scene and arrested two people on suspicion of damaging the ancient monument.\n\n'Our inquiries are ongoing, and we are working closely with English Heritage.'", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Fortunately, they failed to douse the singer's plane in orange paint, but not everyone was as lucky.\n\nTaylor Swift has faced backlash for the significant carbon footprint her frequent private plane trips have caused.\n\nThe crime reportedly went down around 5 AM on Thursday when two members of Just Stop Oil -- a British environmental activist group focused on human-caused climate change -- broke into the private airfield with rigged fire extinguishers.\n\nThe culprits, Jennifer Kowalski and Cole Macdonald doused two private jets in orange paints that did not belong to their prime target, Swift. The activist group took responsibility for the vandalism, confirming they were specifically going after the singer's jet.\n\nAlthough they failed to douse Swift's plane in their group's signature orange paint, Kowalski and Macdonald posed proudly by the private jets they successfully vandalized. They did not mind putting their faces out there, given their noble beliefs, but cops begged to differ.\n\nEssex police confirmed they arrested the women, booking them on suspicion of criminal damage and interference with the use or operation of national infrastructure, per TMZ.\n\nLast Fall, Swift officially obtained billionaire status with her \"Eras\" tour playing a crucial role in her increased net worth. However, this got her on the environmental activist group's hit list, with Macdonald noting:\n\n\"We're living in two worlds: one where billionaires live in luxury, able to fly in private jets away from the others, where unlivable conditions are being imposed on countless millions.\"\n\nAccording to Just Stop Oil, private jet users like Swift are responsible for up to 14X more carbon emissions than a commercial flight.\n\nTherefore, the environmental demonstrators are fighting for the British government to stop the extraction and burning of oil, gas, and coal by 2030.\n\nIn February, The Blast reported that Swift had parted ways with one of her private jets amid her battle with a relentless tracker. She sold the Dassault Falcon 900 jet she purchased in 2009 to an LLC named Triangle Real Estate.\n\nThe organization reportedly had ties to the famous auto protection company CarShield, which was incorporated in Missouri around 2006. It was unclear who the new owner of Swift's jet was, but the CEO of CarShield was revealed to be Nicholas Hamilton.\n\nIf Hamilton owned Swift's jet, he must have spent a fortune on the private plane. While the actual sales price was not disclosed, a brand new Dassault Falcon 900 jet was reportedly worth around $40 million.\n\nBefore news of Swift's jet sale broke, she made waves by sending a cease and desist letter to a young tracker named Jack Sweeney. The college student had a history of tracking celebrity jets, a hobby the singer wanted no part of.\n\nThe entertainer, through her lawyers, warned Sweeney to stop his \"stalking and harassing\" behavior, or else they would be forced \"to pursue any and all legal remedies.\" Swift's legal reps stressed the tracker was causing their client emotional and physical distress.\n\nThe attorneys claimed Sweeney was also inviting possible stalkers that could put Swift's safety in jeopardy. In their words: \"While this may be a game to you or an avenue that you hope will earn you wealth or fame, it is a life-or-death matter for our Client.\"\n\nWhatever reaction Swift's team expected from Sweeney might not have been his bold response to their cease and desist letter. The Blast shared that he did not cower in fear but bravely refuted their allegations through his lawyers.\n\nSweeney claimed he was not breaking any laws because the information he shared about Swift was available publicly. He explained that he tracked jets using data from the FAA and other details from fellow trackers.\n\nHowever, he dedicated an Instagram page to Swift's private jet and published private details, including her flight time, distance covered, CO2 emissions, fuel usage, and fuel cost.", "source": {"uri": "theblast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Blast"}, "authors": [{"uri":

While it isn't known who owns the jets targeted, according to a press release from the group, Swift's jet is currently stationed at London Stansted Airport.\n\nThe pop superstar is bringing her record-breaking Eras Tour to London. She is expected to perform in the city from June 21 to 23. Newsweek emailed Swift's publicist for comment on Thursday.\n\nJust Stop Oil shared the news on X, formerly Twitter, writing: \"Jennifer and Cole cut the fence into the private airfield at Stansted where @taylorswift13's jet is parked, demanding an emergency treaty to end fossil fuels by 2030.\"\n\nThe accompanying video shows two women cutting fencing wire at the airfield site. Then, the clip shows the activists spraying two different jets with orange paint.\n\nAnother post from the group on X reads: \"80% of the population have never taken a flight. Just 1% of people cause 50% of global aviation emissions. Private jet users are responsible for up to 14x as much carbon emissions compared with a commercial flight.\"\n\nThe two activists have said they want the U.K. government to commit to cooperating with other countries to develop an equitable plan to halt the \"extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030.\"\n\nIn a statement online, one of the protesters said: \"We're living in two worlds: one where billionaires live in luxury, able to fly in private jets away from the other, where unlivable conditions are being imposed on countless millions. Meanwhile, this system that is allowing extreme wealth to be accrued by a few, to the detriment of everyone else, is destroying the conditions necessary to support human life in a rapidly accelerating never-ending 'cruel summer.' Billionaires are not untouchable, climate breakdown will affect every single one of us.\"\n\nSwift's private jet usage has been a talking point in recent years. In 2022, she faced backlash after a report by environmentally oriented marketing firm Yard found at that time that her extensive use of a private jet made her the biggest celebrity polluter of the year up to that point.\n\nThe report used publicly available data to compile a list of the top greenhouse gas-emitting celebrities, based on their routine use of private jets. Swift came out on top, with a total of 170 flights on her private jet that added up to nearly 16 days in the air.\n\n\"Taylor's jet is loaned out regularly to other individuals,\" a spokesperson for Swift told Newsweek at the time. \"To attribute most or all of these trips to her is blatantly incorrect.\"\n\nThe conversation about Swift's jet use continued in 2023, as the singer-songwriter flew between New York and Kansas City, Missouri, to see her boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. She also made trips between performances in South America for her Eras Tour. The star was criticized after it was revealed her private jet flights had allegedly produced 138 tons of CO2 emissions in just three months.\n\nWhile data provided by the MyClimate Carbon Tracker stated that Swift doesn't crack the top 30 celebrities when it comes to private jet carbon emissions, she has continued to be a talking point online whenever the topic is raised.\n\nIn 2023, the pop superstar embarked on her ambitious 21-month world tour, spanning 152 shows across five continents.\n\nAccording to a study from Greenly released in April, Swift traveled nearly 37,053 miles, generating 77.5 tons of CO2 equivalent over almost 113 flight hours during the American leg of her tour. The study was conducted before Swift downsized to a single private jet.\n\nThe acclaimed artist is thought to have released 61.6 tons of CO2 equivalent on her South American portion of the tour, which covered 29,431 miles. As a result, the Eras Tour emitted about 139 tons of CO2 equivalent for 66,484 kilometers of travel on the North and South American legs alone.\n\nThis doesn't consider the fact that Swift has also flown to Asia and Australia for her world tour and is currently in the middle of the European leg.\n\nAfter her last European show in the middle of August, the singer will make a few last-minute appearances in American cities, including Miami, New Orleans and Indianapolis. She's scheduled to end her tour in Canada, with multiple shows in November and December. The tour is expected to conclude on December 8 in Vancouver, five days before her 35th birthday on December 13.", "source": {"uri": "heraldonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"},

Just Stop Oil seemingly claimed to have vandalized Swift's jet, drawing mixed reactions from the public.\n\nNo. The Daily Mail confirmed Swift's jet, which had brought her parents to London the day before the incident, was not among the two planes that were damaged. The activist group ambiguously used Swift's name in a tweet and a press release likely to attract publicity.\n\nTaylor Swift has been repeatedly criticized for how often she uses private jets to travel around the world, a number which naturally increased during her still-ongoing Eras Tour. Per a Newsweek report, the pop star produced 138 tons of CO2 emissions in just three months in 2023. For reference, according to a European Commission report, the average American citizen produced 14.44 tons in all of 2022, which is already significantly higher than the average annual carbon footprint for a European Union citizen of 8.2 tons. One cross-country flight on a private jet produces more than an average person will in an entire year.\n\nIn response to the increased backlash, in February, Swift's team released a statement to the Associated Press claiming the singer purchased \"more than double the carbon credits needed to offset all tour travel.\" Carbon credits are essentially translated into money invested in programs aiming to reduce global carbon emissions, such as renewable energy or reforestation, essentially neutralizing the emissions. Except, the environment hardly functions in such mathematical terms.\n\nThe two women responsible for the protest at Stansted Airport were arrested by the Essex Police for criminal damage and interference with the use or operation of national infrastructure, per the Daily Mail.

Two members of the environmental extremism direct action group 'Just Stop Oil' used a battery angle grinder to cut the perimeter fence before using paint-filled fire extinguishers to douse \"multiple private jets\".\n\nTwo people were arrested by Essex Police.\n\nThe group published a statement on the action which was laced with references to Taylor Swift, who is performing in London at Wembley Stadium on Friday as part of the Eras Tour. As with the attack on the ancient British monument Stonehenge by the Just Stop Oil group on Wednesday, they said direct action was required because \"We need an emergency treaty to stop the extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030.\"\n\nIf the activists had hoped to happen across Taylor Swift's jet in particular in the time they had to undertake the vandalism before the arrival of the police, it appears they were not successful.\n\nSpeaking out on private jet use in particular, the group said: \"It is estimated that 80% of the world's population has never taken a flight. Just 1% of people cause 50% of global aviation emissions. Private jet users are responsible for up to 14x as much carbon emissions compared with a commercial flight.\"\n\nThe unchallenged infiltration of the private air terminal at Stanstead -- which ultimately resulted in a brief suspension of runway operations, reports state -- will be a headache for the airport, which is the de facto London secure airfield.\n\nIt is the airport used by U.S. Presidents arriving on Air Force One instead of the larger and more famous London Heathrow because its physical characteristics and proximity to military bases make it better suited to secure operations. Stanstead is also the airport aircraft in distress, or even hijacked flights are directed to, for the same reasons.\n\nJust Stop Oil were widely criticised on Wednesday after they used the same technique -- fire extinguishers reloaded with paint -- to vandalise Stonehenge. Stonehenge is explicitly protected by the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 which makes it a criminal offence to damage the stones.

According to flight tracking data cited by The Independent, Swift's Falcon 7x landed at Stansted at around 11 p.m. on Wednesday.\n\nA spokesperson for Essex Police told BI that a 22-year-old from Brighton, England, and a 25-year-old from Dumbarton, Scotland, had been arrested \"on suspicion of criminal damage and interference with the use or operation of national infrastructure.\"\n\nThey were detained shortly after 5:10 a.m. on Thursday morning, the statement added.\n\n\"We are not anti-protest but we will always take action where criminal acts take place,\" Chief Superintendent Simon Anslow said in a statement obtained by BI.\n\nThe protesters belonged to Just Stop Oil, a climate campaign group that has defaced famous artwork and landmarks, which most recently included spraying Stonehenge with orange paint.\n\nA representative for Just Stop Oil confirmed to BI that the planes doused in paint did not belong to Swift.\n\nThey said the protest was \"generally targeted at private planes,\" though the two people involved likely believed Swift's aircraft was at the airport.\n\nThe representative said the group singled out Swift's aircraft in its social media post because it is \"the most emitting\" of all celebrity private jets and because they believed that Stansted is where she usually keeps her private jet while in London.\n\nBI previously reported that the singer spent more than 166 hours traveling in private jets between March and August of 2023 for the first leg of her widely popular Eras Tour.\n\nHowever, according to a study by My Climate Tracker, cited by The Tab, Travis Scott was the celebrity with the most private jet use in 2023. The rapper took 137 flights, resulting in 6,061,300 kg of CO2 emissions, according to The Tab.\n\nMeanwhile, Swift wasn't among the top 30 celebrities with the most private jet use in 2023, the outlet said.\n\nThat's a stark contrast to 2022.\n\nAccording to Yard, a UK-based sustainability marketing firm, Swift produced the most CO2 emissions of all celebrities in 2022, with 170 flights and an average flight time of 80 minutes.\n\nA spokesperson for Swift previously told BI that her jet is \"loaned out regularly to other individuals\" and to attribute most of the trips to the singer alone is \"blatantly incorrect.\"\n\nThe singer's spokesperson also previously said she had purchased carbon credits to offset her jet use.\n\nSwift is in London for the UK leg of the Eras Tour.

The clip then cuts to them spray-painting what they believed was Taylor Swift's jet, as the pop star had landed hours earlier to continue her international Eras Tour in England. Fortunately for their sake, they targeted the wrong private jet, with Swift's aircraft in a different hangar - but that doesn't make it any better for them.\n\nBoth perpetrators were arrested by Essex Police where they currently remain in custody, and we can only hope they receive a good amount of prison time because there's nothing funny about what they did.\n\nIn fact, the video is being WIDELY criticized - even by climate change sympathizers, with many viewers commentating how deeply disturbing it was for Just Stop Oil to show how easy it may be to gain access to a restricted airfield - as well as get so close to an airliner - regardless whose it was!\n\nDespite tweeting out that they purposely went to that airfield because of Taylor's jet, Essex Police later denied that the massive pop star's plane was parked there.\n\nOf course, the tone-deaf and cringe activists - who are part of a much wider globally funded movement that is being backed by the likes of George Soros and other celebrities like Succession's Jeremy Strong, refuse to admit that their tactics are ever wrong despite turning away people from their causes.\n\nAs I've argued time and time again here - blocking roads, so mothers can't drive their children to the emergency room isn't the way to gain any sympathy for your cause. Destroying historic artifacts and statues and paintings won't cut it, and I can guarantee that breaking into an airport isn't the answer either.\n\nThe problem is, these hardcore climate cultists refuse to have any sense of self awareness as they argue that actions like this are acceptable because it 'brings attention to their cause.'\n\nOh, it brings attention alright - just for all the wrong reasons. In fact, I may start looking into the biggest gas-guzzling SUV I can possibly get, and eat all the cow-farting, methane-producing burgers while I'm at it as well.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_gunzelman@outkick.com", "name": "Mike Gunzelman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_jet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Business jet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aerodrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Stop_Oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Just Stop Oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stansted_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London Stansted Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Essex Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stonehenge"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burglary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Burglary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hangar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Strong_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Strong (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Self-awareness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcore_punk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hardcore punk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Soros", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Soros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamburger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleogeography_and_Paleoclimatology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/06/JUST-STOP-OIL-TAYLOR-SWIFT.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666973", "eventUri": "eng-9666973", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

At around noon, we responded to a report that orange paint had been sprayed on some of the stones by two suspects. Officers attended the scene and arrested two people on suspicion of damaging the ancient monument. Our inquiries are ongoing.\"\n\nThe Just Stop Oil protest at Stone Henge came as the site prepares for its busiest time of year with thousands of people visiting for the summer solstice.\n\nToday (June 20), other Just Stop Oil protesters attempted to target Taylor Swift's private jet and spray paint it, in a bid to raise awareness for climate change.\n\nThe protesters filmed themselves breaking into a private airfield and spray painting a number of private jets orange. It also comes as the singer touched down in the UK for the latest leg of her mammoth 'Eras Tour' just hours earlier.\n\nIn footage and images of the incident, two activists appeared to use a circular saw to get through a chainlink fence protecting the private airfield at Stansted Airport on Thursday morning (June 20). They then painted two private jets by using fire extinguishers filled with orange paint, before taking photos in front of them.\n\nIn other Liam Gallager news, the 'For What It's Worth' singer recently confirmed that he reserves a seat at every one of his solo shows for his brother and former Oasis bandmate Noel.\n\nElsewhere, Oasis guitarist Bonehead recently gifted a busker in Glasgow

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nJust Stop Oil drew widespread criticism this week with protests at Stonehenge and Stansted Airport - with the apparent targetting of the world's biggest pop star illustrating quite how the actions have escalated.\n\nJust over two years ago activists handed in a letter at Downing Street, demanding Boris Johnson cut ties with oil companies.\n\nOn Wednesday, protesters allegedly cut through airport security fences to access an airfield at which they believed Taylor Swift's private jet was parked.\n\nSo far, Just Stop Oil has been accused of being \"terrorists\", called \"pathetic\" by Sir Keir Starmer, angered Druids and even been accused of being a \"false-flag\" group in cahoots with the very oil companies it is taking on, such is the unpopularity of its tactics.\n\nWhile the last 48 months have been punctuated by regular actions, stopping traffic in the street, here The Independent looks at how Just Stop Oil's highest-profile stunts have developed.\n\nJust Stop Oil's first press photograph showed two members delivering an ultimatum letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Valentine's Day in 2022.\n\nLouis McKechnie, then 21, who later received a six-week prison sentence for locking his neck to the post during a Premier League match between Everton and Newcastle, made a brief speech to assembled reporters.\n\nHe said: \"We know what needs to be done, it's simple: Just Stop Oil. Right now. They are doing the opposite.\n\n\"Last year our prime minister told young people that our future is being stolen before our eyes, and that we have every right to be angry with those who aren't doing enough to stop it. He also said that his government wants to move beyond hydrocarbons completely and do it as fast as possible.\n\nHannah Hunt, 23, from Brighton, read out the letter, saying: \"Just Stop Oil is demanding that the UK government makes a statement that it will immediately halt all future licensing and consents for the exploration, development and production of fossil fuels in the UK.\"\n\nShe warned: \"If you do not provide such assurance by 14 March 2022 it will be our duty to intervene - to prevent the ultimate crime against our country, humanity and life on earth.\"\n\nIn October 2022 things had ramped up quickly.\n\nStomach-churning footage appeared to show one climate activist pouring human faeces over a memorial in Derbyshire for Captain Tom Moore, who became a national hero during Covid for fundraising for the NHS by walking lengths of his garden, aged 99.\n\nMadeleine Budd, 21, received a 21-week sentence, suspended for 18 months.\n\nThe activist claimed that every time a private jet takes off in the UK, \"it pours a bucket of s*** and blood onto everything that Captain Tom stood for\".\n\nActivists staged 32 days of disruption on the roads across London and the M25 from the end of September and throughout October 2022, which the Metropolitan police said resulted in 677 arrests.\n\nEssex Police said there was a collision on the M25 involving a police motorcyclist and two lorries during a rolling roadblock.\n\nChief Constable BJ Harrington warned it is \"only a matter of time\" before someone is killed during a Just Stop Oil protest.\n\nThe October 2022 protests included a disruptive action on the Dartford Crossing.\n\nMorgan Trowland, 40, and Marcus Decker, 34, were handed nearly three years in jail each after using ropes and other climbing gear to scale the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge, bringing traffic to a standstill.\n\nThe pair brought hammocks to sleep in overnight as they dangled 200ft above the jammed road. The road was shut for about 40 hours, and the men eventually came down via a cherry picker.\n\nEssex Police said those affected by the disruption included a \"heavily pregnant woman who needed urgent medical help\".\n\nAn appeal was refused and the Court of Appeal was told the pair were given the \"longest\" jail term for a peaceful protest case in modern times.\n\nTurning their hands to culture and the arts, activists threw tomato soup over Vincent Van Gogh's masterpiece \"Sunflowers\" at the National Gallery on 22 October 2022.\n\nTins of Heinz were at the painting, which is worth an estimated \u00a372.5million, before activists glued their hands to the wall.\n\nFortunately, the oil painting, valued at $81m ( \u00a372.5m), is protected by a glass cover and was unharmed, a National Gallery spokesperson told The Independent. Just Stop Oil said activists were aware of the case.\n\nJust Stop Oil protesters were arrested after vegan cake was thrown over King Charles III's waxwork statue at Madame Tussauds on October 24 2022.\n\nEilidh McFadden, 20, and Tom Johnson, 29, were convicted of criminal damage and ordered to pay \u00a31,750 in compensation each to Tussaud's owner Merlin Entertainment.\n\nIn October last year, protesters stormed the stage during a performance of Les Miserables at the Sondheim Theatre in London's West End.\n\nIn scenes they would argue are reminiscent of those on stage, protesters jumped up during a performance of the show's iconic song \"One More Day\" to boos from the outraged audience. Four locked themselves to the stage.\n\nFive protesters were found guilty of aggravated trespass, with two also guilty of criminal damage. All were sentenced to community work.\n\nOn Wednesday, Stonehenge was targetted in an alleged protest in which orange power was sprayed, and on Thursday it was an airfield at Stansted Airport, with activists allegedly believing Taylor Swift's private jet was parked up.\n\nTwo people were arrested in connection with each incident.\n\nThe incidents managed to draw the ire of not only Rishi Sunak and Sire Keir Starmer, but also witches and druids set to mark the summer solstice at Stonehenge.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors":

It would change the life of all of her fans, every single one of them and make them think, \"If Taylor Swift can change her habits to help the environment, then I can too.\" That's her power'\n\nThe singer recently sold one of her two private jets, but has come under fire for leaving such a large carbon footprint as she jets around the world to perform (pictured landing in Burbank airport in Hollywood in April)\n\n'It would be highly symbolic if she were to say, \"I'm giving up my private jet usage\",' said Chris\n\nDespite some analytics companies claiming that her private jets fly more than those belonging to any another star, her representatives have said she regularly loans the plane to other people.\n\nShe has also bought more than double the amount of carbon credits to offset the emissions, her representative has claimed.\n\n'She should be leading, not being forced to do things later, which is crazy,' said Chris.\n\n'She's a very powerful young woman, intelligent, powerful superstar. She should be doing the right thing for her fans, and that is giving them hope for the future.'\n\nChris added: 'I don't know if she ever plans to have children, but you know, it would be caring about her children's future.'\n\nHe said that all pop stars once used private jets as 'we didn't know any better,' but now that we do, Taylor has the 'opportunity to change.'\n\nChris's call to Taylor comes as Just Stop Oil attempted to target her private jet, which they believed was parked at Stansted airport on Thursday\n\nChris's call to Taylor comes as Just Stop Oil attempted to target her private jet, which they believed was parked at Stansted airport on Thursday.\n\nProtestors spray-painted the two jets with orange paint after claiming that the singer's plane had landed there the night before.\n\nChris said he will be one of thousands in attendance at the Restore Nature Now march on Saturday, alongside Dame Emma Thompson and 300 NGOs.\n\nHe is calling on Taylor to send a video message that he can play on stage at the end of the march.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

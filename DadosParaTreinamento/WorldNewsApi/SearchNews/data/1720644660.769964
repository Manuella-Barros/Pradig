Where: Protective Stadium in Birmingham, Alabama. TV: ABC. Streaming: Check out the Michigan Panthers on Fubo (free trial). HELLO, AGAIN: Michigan Panthers UFL playoff preview: Panthers seek revenge vs. Birmingham Stallions Game notes: As they note, it\u2019s tough to beat a team three times in a season, which is good news for the Panthers, losers of both games thus far against the Stallions. Both games were decided by one score, with Birmingham prevailing 20-13 back in Week 2 and then scoring with 59 seconds remaining last week for a 20-19 victory to clinch homefield in this week\u2019s game. Part of the Stallions\u2019 success has been their ability to neutralize star defensive end Breeland Speaks, who was named UFL Defensive Player of the Year on Friday. Sparks had four tackles, with two for loss, in the Week 2 loss. In Week 10, Speaks had three tackles (two for loss) and a sack. In his other eight games, however, Speaks posted 25 tackles (nine for loss) and 8\u00bd sacks, plus two pass breakups. On the other side, the Stallions will put the ball in the hands of former Lions QB prospect Adrian Martinez, the frontrunner for UFL MVP. Martinez snatched the starting job away from former NFL draft pick Matt Corral, then completed 58.5% of his passes for 1,749 yards, 15 touchdowns and just three interceptions. Against the Panthers, Martinez went 22-for-43 (51.2%) for 251 yards and a touchdown while rushing 13 times for 106 yards, an 8.2-yard average. The winner of today\u2019s game will turn its attention to Sunday\u2019s XFL Conference title game between the San Antonio Brahmas and St. Louis Battlehawks, with the UFL title game set for June 16 in St. Louis, Missouri. The Panthers beat the Battlehawks in Week 1, but fell to the Brahmas in Week 4. Contact Ryan Ford at rford@freepress.com.

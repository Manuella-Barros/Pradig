Republican lawmakers, meanwhile, demanded the audio recordings, claiming that to fulfill their oversight responsibilities they wanted to assess for themselves the evidence that Hur used to reach his conclusions.\n\nWhite House Counsel Ed Siskel later said Republicans had no \"legitimate need\" for the recordings and likely only wanted them to \"chop them up, distort them, and use them for partisan political purposes.\"\n\nIn response to Republican demands, the Justice Department released a transcript of Biden's interview to Congress, but Biden -- at Attorney General Merrick Garland's behest -- asserted executive privilege over the recordings to shield them from release.\n\nThen the presidential debate happened -- raising new questions over whether Biden could handle another four years as commander-in-chief.\n\n\"Most of us are concerned ... about President Biden's health,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, told CBS News on Sunday. \"I want those tapes released.\"\n\nAs early as this week, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., could try to push forward a resolution she drafted to hold Garland in \"inherent contempt\" of Congress, which Luna has said would draw on rarely-used legislative branch authority to fine Garland $10,000 a day until he hands over the recordings.\n\nHer effort is controversial even within Republican ranks, and it's unclear if it would succeed. But if it did, the Justice Department could try to challenge it in court.\n\nA Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment to for this story, and the White House counsel's office did not respond to questions from ABC News, including whether Biden would now consider allowing the recordings to be released.\n\nTestifying before lawmakers in March, Hur said that the recordings of Biden's interview -- which began the day after Hamas launched its large-scale attack on Israel -- \"were part of the evidence, of course, that I considered in coming to my conclusions.\"\n\nHur's conclusions were blunt: The president showed \"diminished faculties and faulty memory\" during his five hours with Hur's team, at times exhibiting \"limited precision and recall,\" Hur wrote in his final report.\n\nEven six years earlier, in recorded conversations with a ghostwriter that Hur obtained, Biden was \"often painfully slow, with Mr. Biden struggling to remember events and straining at times to read and relay his own notebook entries,\" Hur wrote. \"In his interview with our office, Mr. Biden's memory was worse.\"\n\nHur, in his final report, wrote, \"It would be difficult to convince a jury that they should convict [Biden] ... of a serious felony that requires a mental state of willfulness.\"\n\nRepublicans say Americans who are worried about Biden's fitness for office deserve more than a written report and a transcript.\n\nLast week, the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee filed a federal lawsuit in Washington to obtain the recordings, saying that there are \"inherent limits of a cold transcript\" and that audio recordings can provide \"verbal and nonverbal context\" such as tone and pace.\n\n\"The audio recordings, not the cold transcripts, are the best available evidence of how President Biden presented himself during the interview,\" the lawsuit says. \"The Committee thus needs those recordings to assess the Special Counsel's characterization of the President, which he and White House lawyers have forcefully disputed.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers aren't the only ones pushing for the recordings to be released.\n\nIn March, the conservative groups Judicial Watch and The Heritage Foundation filed federal lawsuits in Washington seeking the recordings and other case materials under the Freedom of Information Act. Shortly afterward, CNN filed a similar lawsuit, which a dozen other news organizations, including ABC News, then joined.\n\n\"The subsequent release of the interview transcript has made it possible for the press and public to somewhat assess Hur's description of Biden for themselves,\" the lawsuit says. \"Transcripts, however, are no substitute for recordings, which reveal 'intonations, hesitancies, inflections, and tone of voice.'\"\n\nIt's unclear if any of the legal cases could be resolved before the presidential election in November.\n\nIn May, after Garland recommended it, Biden asserted executive privilege over the recordings.\n\nThen, last month, the Republican majority in the House referred Garland to the Justice Department for prosecution after Garland refused to turn over the recordings despite a congressional subpoena. But the Justice Department declined to move forward with the case.\n\nAccording to the Justice Department, the law enforcement interest in keeping the recordings private outweighs any other public interest.\n\nIn particular, releasing the audio recordings could \"chill witness cooperation in future, high-profile investigations,\" Garland has said.\n\n\"It is our view that we need witnesses to be willing to be audio recorded and they are going to be less willing to if they know it is going to be made public,\" Garland told lawmakers last month.\n\nBiden's case, however, is unique: For him, the interviewee is the one with the authority to waive executive privilege, which would essentially give the Justice Department permission to release the recordings of himself.\n\nNevertheless, the Justice Department has also pointed to another law enforcement interest in keeping the recordings private: concern that enemies of the United States could manipulate them.\n\n\"If the recording of President Biden's interview were released, there is substantial risk that malicious actors could alter the record to (for example) insert words that President Biden did not say or delete words that he did say,\" a senior Justice Department official wrote in a declaration submitted in court in May.\n\nUsing widely available technologies, malicious actors could even \"create an audio deepfake in which a fake voice of President Biden can be programmed to say anything that the creator of the deepfake wishes,\" the official added.\n\nMeanwhile, Garland told Republicans last month that he has \"not been shown any reason why audio evidence of demeanor would make a difference in any legislative purpose that you have.\"\n\n\"You have yet to suggest any law that you intend to pass or are thinking about in which the audio would make a difference over the transcript,\" he said.\n\nIn their lawsuit, House Republicans called Biden's executive privilege claim a \"self-serving attempt to shield the audio recording\" from becoming public.\n\n\"Any privilege that could conceivably apply to President Biden's interview with the Special Counsel was waived when the Executive Branch released a transcript of that interview,\" the lawsuit argued.\n\nThe Justice Department has until the end of next month to respond to the suit.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Hur", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert K.

Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) on Wednesday moved to force a vote on her resolution to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in \"inherent contempt\" of Congress and fine him $10,000 for each day that he declines to turn over audio from President Biden's interview with special counsel Robert Hur over his handling of classified documents.\n\nHouse leaders, who had two legislative days to act on the matter, held an immediate vote on tabling the measure -- which failed 207-209 -- and then one on sending the resolution to the Rules Committee, which also failed 207-211.\n\nFour Republicans joined with all Democrats in voting to table and refer the resolution: Reps. John Duarte (Calif.), David Joyce (Ohio), Tom McClintock (Calif.), and Mike Turner (Ohio).\n\nThe chamber proceeded to debate on the underlying resolution with a vote not expected until at least Thursday.\n\nThe move plays into widespread panic among Democrats about Biden's age following a disastrous debate performance nearly two weeks ago. In the report detailing why he would not seek to charge Biden over his handling of classified documents, the special counsel said that any jury would likely see Biden as an \"elderly man with a poor memory,\" citing portions of the October interview in which Biden had trouble remembering dates and key arguments he had made.\n\nLuna, though, had been pushing for inherent contempt before the debate. The proposed $10,000-per-day fine is toned down from her original inherent contempt push, which would have directed the House Sergeant at Arms to arrest and detain Garland over his refusal to turn over the Biden interview tapes.\n\nBut even her new resolution is not the preferred course of action for House GOP leaders.\n\nThe House last month held Garland in \"regular\" contempt over refusal to turn over the interview audio. The Department of Justice (DOJ) responded by saying it would not prosecute Garland, the head of the agency because Biden had claimed executive privilege over the audio. Last week the House Judiciary Committee filed a lawsuit to force Garland to turn over the tapes.\n\nThe DOJ has already provided the House a written transcript of the conversation. Republicans argue that because the DOJ provided the transcript, it cannot withhold the audio, which it says it needs to ensure the transcript is accurate.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) expressed skepticism about the legality of enforcing the fine and of the rarely-used inherent contempt - which encompasses Congress directly enforcing its will rather than relying on the executive branch to do so.\n\n\"As a constitutional litigator, former constitutional litigator, my preference is to follow the legal process and legal proceedings that protect the institution,\" Johnson said in a press conference on Tuesday. \"I frankly have a little pause about presenting an article one authority question to the Article three branch - to the federal judiciary desk, the judicial branch - whether they believe we have the right to enforce a subpoena in this unconventional way.\"\n\nBut despite those concerns, Johnson said: \"If it's brought to the floor, I'll vote for it.\"\n\nLuna has countered that a lawsuit could take years, and has argued that Congress needs to assert its power.\n\n\"Inherent contempt is the ONLY mechanism that can be used to force compliance with subpoenas,\" Luna said in a statement on Wednesday. \"The Hur tapes are not just an issue of national security, as it is evident Joe Biden is impaired, but has now become a criminal organized effort to usurp Congress as a co-equal branch of government.\"\n\nLuna also got support for her push from former President Trump, who wrote on his Truth Social platform on Wednesday: \"I AGREE with Anna Paulina Luna and the many House Members who think Merrick Garland should be held in INHERENT CONTEMPT for refusing to release the Biden Tapes even though they were subpoenaed!\"\n\nStill, Luna did face some House GOP resistance to her resolution.\n\nDuarte had forecasted his intent to not support Luna's proposed fine for Garland.\n\n\"I'm gonna stand by the Judiciary committee's due process, regular order. I'm not interested in these individual motions, privileged motions,\" Duarte said Tuesday.\n\nPrivileged motions have seen a surge in use during this Congress, with rabble-rousers using them to force votes on everything from impeachments to formal reprimands of House members.\n\nRep. David Joyce (R-Ohio), another member who voted to table the resolution, was the only Republican to vote against \"regular\" contempt for Garland last month.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com",

Republican lawmakers, meanwhile, demanded the audio recordings, claiming that to fulfill their oversight responsibilities they wanted to assess for themselves the evidence that Hur used to reach his conclusions.\n\nWhite House Counsel Ed Siskel later said Republicans had no \"legitimate need\" for the recordings and likely only wanted them to \"chop them up, distort them, and use them for partisan political purposes.\"\n\nIn response to Republican demands, the Justice Department released a transcript of Biden's interview to Congress, but Biden -- at Attorney General Merrick Garland's behest -- asserted executive privilege over the recordings to shield them from release.\n\nThen the presidential debate happened -- raising new questions over whether Biden could handle another four years as commander-in-chief.\n\n\"Most of us are concerned ... about President Biden's health,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, told CBS News on Sunday. \"I want those tapes released.\"\n\nAs early as this week, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., could try to push forward a resolution she drafted to hold Garland in \"inherent contempt\" of Congress, which Luna has said would draw on rarely-used legislative branch authority to fine Garland $10,000 a day until he hands over the recordings.\n\nHer effort is controversial even within Republican ranks, and it's unclear if it would succeed. But if it did, the Justice Department could try to challenge it in court.\n\nA Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment for this story, and the White House counsel's office did not respond to questions from ABC News, including whether Biden would now consider allowing the recordings to be released.\n\nWhat could the recordings show?\n\nTestifying before lawmakers in March, Hur said that the recordings of Biden's interview -- which began the day after Hamas launched its large-scale attack on Israel -- \"were part of the evidence, of course, that I considered in coming to my conclusions.\"\n\nHur's conclusions were blunt: The president showed \"diminished faculties and faulty memory\" during his five hours with Hur's team, at times exhibiting \"limited precision and recall,\" Hur wrote in his final report.\n\nEven six years earlier, in recorded conversations with a ghostwriter that Hur obtained, Biden was \"often painfully slow, with Mr. Biden struggling to remember events and straining at times to read and relay his own notebook entries,\" Hur wrote. \"In his interview with our office, Mr. Biden's memory was worse.\"\n\nHur, in his final report, wrote, \"It would be difficult to convince a jury that they should convict [Biden] ... of a serious felony that requires a mental state of willfulness.\"\n\nRepublicans say Americans who are worried about Biden's fitness for office deserve more than a written report and a transcript.\n\nLast week, the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee filed a federal lawsuit in Washington to obtain the recordings, saying that there are \"inherent limits of a cold transcript\" and that audio recordings can provide \"verbal and nonverbal context\" such as tone and pace.\n\n\"The audio recordings, not the cold transcripts, are the best available evidence of how President Biden presented himself during the interview,\" the lawsuit says. \"The Committee thus needs those recordings to assess the Special Counsel's characterization of the President, which he and White House lawyers have forcefully disputed.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers aren't the only ones pushing for the recordings to be released.\n\nIn March, the conservative groups Judicial Watch and The Heritage Foundation filed federal lawsuits in Washington seeking the recordings and other case materials under the Freedom of Information Act. Shortly afterward, CNN filed a similar lawsuit, which a dozen other news organizations, including ABC News, then joined.\n\n\"The subsequent release of the interview transcript has made it possible for the press and public to somewhat assess Hur's description of Biden for themselves,\" the lawsuit says. \"Transcripts, however, are no substitute for recordings, which reveal 'intonations, hesitancies, inflections, and tone of voice.'\"\n\nIt's unclear if any of the legal cases could be resolved before the presidential election in November.\n\nA 'chilling' effect?\n\nIn May, after Garland recommended it, Biden asserted executive privilege over the recordings.\n\nThen, last month, the Republican majority in the House referred Garland to the Justice Department for prosecution after Garland refused to turn over the recordings despite a congressional subpoena. But the Justice Department declined to move forward with the case.\n\nAccording to the Justice Department, the law enforcement interest in keeping the recordings private outweighs any other public interest.\n\nIn particular, releasing the audio recordings could \"chill witness cooperation in future, high-profile investigations,\" Garland has said.\n\n\"It is our view that we need witnesses to be willing to be audio recorded and they are going to be less willing to if they know it is going to be made public,\" Garland told lawmakers last month.\n\nBiden's case, however, is unique: For him, the interviewee is the one with the authority to waive executive privilege, which would essentially give the Justice Department permission to release the recordings of himself.\n\nNevertheless, the Justice Department has also pointed to another law enforcement interest in keeping the recordings private: concern that enemies of the United States could manipulate them.\n\n\"If the recording of President Biden's interview were released, there is substantial risk that malicious actors could alter the record to (for example) insert words that President Biden did not say or delete words that he did say,\" a senior Justice Department official wrote in a declaration submitted in court in May.\n\nUsing widely available technologies, malicious actors could even \"create an audio deepfake in which a fake voice of President Biden can be programmed to say anything that the creator of the deepfake wishes,\" the official added.\n\nMeanwhile, Garland told Republicans last month that he has \"not been shown any reason why audio evidence of demeanor would make a difference in any legislative purpose that you have.\"\n\n\"You have yet to suggest any law that you intend to pass or are thinking about in which the audio would make a difference over the transcript,\" he said.\n\nIn their lawsuit, House Republicans called Biden's executive privilege claim a \"self-serving attempt to shield the audio recording\" from becoming public.\n\n\"Any privilege that could conceivably apply to President Biden's interview with the Special Counsel was waived when the Executive Branch released a transcript of that interview,\" the lawsuit argued.\n\nThe Justice Department has until the end of next month to respond to the suit.", "source": {"uri": "ktbb.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Anna Paulina Luna has followed through on forcing a vote to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in \"inherent contempt.\" That could mean the nation's top cop faces $10,000 fines each day from Congress unless he complies with a subpoena.\n\n\"It is evident that there is a two-tiered justice system in this country. I, along with an overwhelming number of Americans, am tired of all talk and no action,\" Luna said in a statement.\n\nThe St. Petersburg Republican intends to bring a contempt vote up on the floor Wednesday as a privileged resolution. That means the House must schedule a vote of the full House within 48 hours. A vote will likely take place before the current session of Congress is scheduled to end on Thursday.\n\n\"Everyday Americans are penalized when they do not comply with subpoenas. After seeing what has transpired over the last three weeks, I am convinced Merrick Garland is engaged in a cover-up that goes all the way to the White House and involves the House of Representatives.\"\n\nCongress hasn't used its power to hold individuals in inherent contempt since 1935. But Congress has the power to compel individuals to comply with subpoenas. Luna initially wanted to employ the long dormant power to have the sergeant-at-arms for the House arrest Garland and physically force him to testify to Congress, but she has backed off that extreme measure in favor of daily fines.\n\nLuna, a member of the House Oversight Committee, wants the Department of Justice to release recordings of interviews of President Joe Biden by Special Counsel Robert Hur. The White House in May exerted executive privilege to block public release of those materials.\n\nHur in February completed an investigation of whether Biden mishandled classified materials as Vice President. A report from Hur concluded no criminal charges were warranted, but included explosive assessments about Biden's mental state, describing him as an \"well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory.\" Most notably, Hur said Biden did not remember, even within several years, when his son Beau died.\n\nTranscripts later released to Congress suggested some back and forth on those details, and Biden insisted after the report's release that his \"memory is fine.\"\n\nBut Luna has pushed for the release of the audio itself, and suggested there was greater urgency since a debate performance that set alarms within political circles about Biden's age and fitness.\n\n\"Inherent contempt is the ONLY mechanism that can be used to force compliance with subpoenas,\" Luna said in her latest statement.\n\n\"The Hur tapes are not just an issue of national security, as it is evident Joe Biden is impaired, but has now become a criminal organized effort to usurp Congress as a co-equal branch of government. This resolution has been legally vetted to ensure it is constitutional and is backed by case law in the Supreme Court.\"\n\nStill, the push has faced resistance from House leadership, with disagreement reported in Washington largely over the politics of the Presidential Election. Axios reported this week that Speaker Mike Johnson has been happy to see Democratic infighting about Biden's competency dominating headlines for the past two weeks.\n\nStill, Johnson signaled he would support the measure if Luna forced a vote.\n\n\"If it's brought to the floor, I'll vote for it,\" he told press.\n\nBut it remains unclear if the measure has the votes to pass. Many moderate Republicans may not support a contempt vote. But Luna has also started to woo Democrats openly calling for Biden to step aside to support her measure and force the audio of his conversation with Hur into full view.", "source": {"uri": "floridapolitics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Florida Politics - Campaigns & Elections.

Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) filed her resolution as privileged on Wednesday, prompting House Democrats to attempt to table the measure and effectively kill it before it reached the floor for a full vote. However, that motion was killed in a 207-209 vote.\n\nDemocrats then moved to refer the motion to the Rules Committee, a procedural move meant to temporarily delay a vote on the motion. That effort also failed in a 207-211 vote.\n\nThe House will now take up the resolution on the floor Thursday morning before leaving Washington D.C. for a weeklong recess.\n\nLuna has been pushing to hold Garland in inherent contempt after he skirted requests from House Republicans to hand over audio tapes of interviews between Hur and President Joe Biden regarding the special counsel's investigation into the president's handling of classified documents. The Justice Department provided access to transcripts of those interviews, which GOP investigators have argued are insufficient due to possible alterations or edits.\n\nHowever, that push became more prevalent after the first presidential debate last month, during which Biden stumbled over his talking points and repeatedly lost his train of thought -- raising concerns about his cognitive abilities on both sides of the aisle.\n\n\"What America saw at the first presidential debate leaves no question that Congress needs to hear Special Counsel Robert Hur's tapes from his interview with President Joe Biden. President Biden's performance was so concerning to all of us who watched that even before the debate had ended, people were questioning his ability to continue as president,\" Luna wrote in a letter to House Democrats this week. \"Even many of you had to make the difficult decision to call for President Biden to drop out of the race. The urgency of this situation cannot be overstated, and we must act swiftly.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) had expressed concerns about Luna's resolution, noting he would rather pursue alternative paths to access the tapes. The House Judiciary Committee has already filed suit with the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia to force Garland to comply with its subpoena, which Johnson has supported.\n\n\"As a constitutional law litigator, former country litigator, my preference is to follow the legal process and legal proceedings that protect the institution,\" Johnson said on Tuesday. \"I'd rather do it in the way that we've done in our present litigation, but we will let the chips fall where they may.\"\n\nJohnson said earlier this week he would back the motion if it was brought to the floor, making it more likely to pass on Thursday.\n\nDemocrats have repeatedly moved to dismiss any contempt charges, arguing the resolution is an attempt to dredge up the most politically explosive finding of the special counsel's report: that Hur, investigating Biden's handling of classified documents, did not charge him in part because a jury would judge him to be a \"well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nGarland was held in contempt after he rejected a subpoena from House Republicans in February to provide access to the audio recordings. The DOJ has already published the full transcripts of those interviews, arguing they are sufficient for Republicans' impeachment inquiry. The White House has also cited executive privilege.\n\nBut top Republicans on the House Judiciary and Oversight committees have rejected the explanation, arguing the refusal \"has hindered the House's ability to adequately conduct oversight over Special Counsel Hur regarding his investigative findings and the President's retention and disclosure of classified materials and impeded the Committees' impeachment inquiry.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cami_mondeaux@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Cami Mondeaux", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Paulina_Luna", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anna Paulina Luna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller_special_counsel_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mueller special counsel investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Rules", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Rules"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Hur", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert K.

Ultimately, the special counsel declined to prosecute in part because he said a jury could view Biden as a sympathetic \"elderly man with a poor memory.\"\n\nGarland has refused to hand over the audio, prompting the Republican-controlled House voted to hold him in contempt of Congress last month. On Wednesday, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) forced a vote on a resolution that would fine Garland $10,000 a day until he produces the audio. The measure would also hold Garland in \"inherent contempt,\" which would make him susceptible to arrest by the House Sergeant-at-Arms and a trial in Congress.\n\n\"This is a stupid resolution,\" McGovern declared on the House floor. \"Republican leadership knows this is a stupid resolution. Their own members know this is a stupid resolution. But they're beholden to the craziest MAGA members in their conference. And so, this is what we get: stupid resolutions on the floor because they're too chicken to stand up to the extremism in their own party.\"\n\nThe lawmaker noted that Garland provided the transcripts of Biden's deposition after Republicans demanded he do so, and went on to say that Republicans only want the audio so they can use it against Biden in campaign ads.

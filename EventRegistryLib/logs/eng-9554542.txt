According to Grammer, Frasier Crane \"loves with his whole heart,\" having nothing but pure intentions during his return to Boston.\n\nSpeaking with The Ankler, Grammer addressed the differences between the revival series version of Frasier and the original iteration of the titular psychiatrist and TV star-turned-professor. According to the Emmy-winning actor, Frasier returned to Boston, the home of the parent show, Cheers, because he had unfinished business and wanted to fulfill goals dating back to his childhood. \"It's like he's getting younger in a way, so he can fulfill the dreams of his youth, which is what Herman Melville had above his desk: 'Do not forget dreams of your youth.' When he wrote every day, that's what he looked at,\" he said. Grammer also admitted to making the character \"a little sillier\" but spoke about his character having a good spirit, saying, \"In the end, he just loves deeply, with every ounce of his being, and wants to make sure that everybody is okay.\"\n\nRelated Kelsey Grammer Feels 'Vindication' Regarding Frasier Reboot Ahead of Season 2 Frasier star and producer Kelsey Grammer expresses optimism about the reboot's shelf-life after the series recently secured a renewal at Paramount+. Close\n\nFrasier Crane Returns to Boston\n\nIn Season 1 of the Frasier reboot, which aired between last October and December, the eponymous character returns to Boston to take a professorship in psychology at the University of Harvard. He also returns to the North East to rekindle his estranged relationship with his son Freddy (Jack Cutmore-Scott). Grammer believes his decision to bring back the show was justified, reiterating he was motivated to do the reboot series after the short-lived success of Roseanne Barr's revival in 2018. \"We can do this, we can make Frasier a new show and keep the elements that always made it a great show,\" he said.\n\nParamount and Grammer announced the Frasier reboot's renewal in February, with Grammer hoping to make Season 2 bigger after the first season was welcomed by audiences despite mixed critical reviews. Grammer has hinted at potentially featuring Cheers stars during Season 2, indicating his desire to bring Diane (Shelley Long) and Sam (Ted Danson) to the show. Furthermore, he hopes to feature more of his cohorts from the original series, including potentially getting Peri Gilpin's Roz Doyle more on-screen time. Grammer also left the door open for David Hyde Pierce's character, Niles Crane, to appear on the show.\n\nRelated Frasier's Kelsey Grammer Reunites With Cheers Stars at Primetime Emmy Awards Kelsey Grammer was joined by his former Cheers co-stars at the Primetime Emmy Awards, and it would seem that some things never change.\n\nSeason 1 of the Frasier reboot features Grammer alongside Cutmore-Scott, Gilpin, Nicholas Lyndhurst, Toks Olagundoye, Jess Salgueiro, Anders Keith and Bebe Neuwirth. Grammer said he wants the reboot to be a long-term project as he believes there are several stories to tell about his central character's \"third act\" and the other characters on the show.\n\nFans can stream Season 1 of the Frasier reboot via Paramount+.\n\nSource: The Ankler", "source": {"uri": "cbr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jodee_brown@cbr.com", "name": "Jodee Brown", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Grammer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kelsey Grammer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frasier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frasier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Executive producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reboot_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reboot (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frasier_Crane", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Frasier Crane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cheers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatrist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Cutmore-Scott", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Cutmore-Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Television producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Primetime Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramount+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jess_Salgueiro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jess Salgueiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roz_Doyle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roz Doyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peri_Gilpin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peri Gilpin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toks_Olagundoye", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toks Olagundoye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Lyndhurst", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Lyndhurst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelley_Long", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shelley Long"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bebe_Neuwirth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bebe Neuwirth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roseanne_Barr", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roseanne Barr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niles_Crane", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Niles Crane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hyde_Pierce", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Hyde Pierce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Danson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ted Danson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Characters", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Characters", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/All-Stars", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/All-Stars", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/collage-maker-14-sep-2023-04-08-pm-1322.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554542", "eventUri": "eng-9554542", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 231, "relevance": 1}

The show saw the return of Kelsey Grammer in the titular role alongside some newcomers in addition to exciting guest stars from the original series. Today, Paramount shared a press release announcing that the show's second season has officially gone into production. They also shared some exciting news about returning guest stars, and more...\n\nFrasier Season 2 has started production and will feature the return of Grammer in addition to Jack Cutmore-Scott as Freddy, Frasier's son; Nicholas Lyndhurst as Alan, Frasier's old college buddy turned university professor; Toks Olagundoye as Olivia, Alan's colleague and head of the university's psychology department; Jess Salgueiro as Eve, Frasier and Freddy's neighbor; and Anders Keith as David, Frasier's nephew.\n\nIt was also confirmed that Peri Gilpin will reprise her role as Roz Doyle in a recurring role. Gilpin played Roz throughout the original show's entire run, and made an appearance in the reboot's Season One finale. Another exciting return is that of James Burrows, the director and producer who helmed 32 episodes of Frasier and 236 episodes of Cheers, the original show to feature Grammer as the loveable psychiatrist.\n\nWhat Is The Fraiser Reboot About?\n\nYou can read Paramount's description of the series here: \"The series follows Frasier Crane (Grammer) in the next chapter of his life after he returns to Boston to face new challenges, forge new relationships and - with hope - finally fulfill an old dream or two.\n\nFRASIER comes from writers Chris Harris (How I Met Your Mother) and Joe Cristalli (Life in Pieces), who executive produce with Kelsey Grammer, Tom Russo, and Jordan McMahon. The series is produced by CBS Studios in association with Grammer's Grammnet NH Productions. The series is distributed by Paramount Global Content Distribution outside of the Paramount+ markets.\n\nSeason one of FRASIER is currently available to stream exclusively on Paramount+.\"\n\nKevin Daniels Talks Frasier:\n\nThis week, you can catch Frasier's Kevin Daniels starring in Not Another Church Movie, a new parody film from writer/director, Johnny Mack. ComicBook.com recently had the chance to chat with Daniels about the upcoming comedy, and we took the opportunity to ask about Frasier. Not only does Daniels play Tiny in the reboot, but he also appeared in an episode of the original series. He plays Steve in the Season 10 episode, \"Farewell, Nervosa.\" Turns out, Frasier showrunner Joe Cristalli has an idea to make Steve and Tiny's stories connect.\n\n\"Don't tell anybody. Nobody needs to know,\" Daniels joked about his original Fraiser appearance. \"Actually, I'm going to play here in LA, it's called Monsters of the American Cinema. It's really fun. But a lot of the cast members from the new reboot came and saw it last night. And our showrunner ... Joe came last night and we were talking about that very thing. He is like, \"Well, maybe this season the fans find out that Tiny has a brother in Seattle. And I was like, 'That would be hilarious.' I have a twin brother, one who hates him, and now one who works in the firehouse ... But it's for fans like you, people who watch, they figure it out.\"\n\n\"Well, they had the first table read yesterday,\" Daniels said when asked about Season 2. \"I think I begin in episode two, and then we go, I think we're doing seven or eight episodes. Our little firemen, people, we'll find out.\"\n\n\"Kelsey [Grammer], he's so great to work with and so funny, and Nicholas Hurst, the big BBC comedian, comes in. He's fantastic ... It's just cool to be a part of such an iconic franchise, and we have people see it, and the hope is that it leads to other things.\"\n\nStay tuned for more updates about Fraiser.", "source": {"uri":

Roz Doyle, played by Peri Gilpin, will return for a recurring role in the second season of the revived series. Despite lukewarm reviews, strong ratings led to the green light for a second season of the iconic sitcom.\n\nThose tossed salads and scrambled eggs are calling again. Paramount+'s revived Frasier series has begun filming its second season, and this time, Kelsey Grammer is bringing back one of his old pals from Seattle. Peri Gilpin, who plays Frasier's ex-producer Roz Doyle, will return for a recurring role this season. CBS Studios announced today that production has begun on the second season of the revived sitcom, with a new YouTube video of star Grammer biking to set on the Paramount lot as the iconic Frasier theme tune plays in the background.\n\nThe long-in-the-works revival of the iconic 1990s sitcom premiered its first season on Paramount+ last year; although reviews were largely lukewarm, ratings were strong enough that the streamer greenlit a second season of the series earlier this year. And while Grammer's dreams of a reunion with on-screen brother David Hyde Pierce have yet to come to fruition, the new season will feature another beloved member of the Frasier ensemble. Gilpin, who starred as brassy radio producer (and later station manager) Roz on all eleven seasons of the original series, returned to guest-star in the revival series' first-season finale.\n\nWhat Happened on the First Season of 'Frasier'?\n\nClose\n\nIn the wake of the death of his father Martin (John Mahoney, who passed away in 2018), a now-retired Frasier Crane moved to Boston to reconnect with his son, firefighter Freddy (Jack Cutmore-Scott). Wanting to spend more time with him, he moved in across the hall from Freddy, leading to a reversal of the dynamic of the original series, which saw the upper-crust Frasier clashing with his blue-collar Martin as they were forced to share Frasier's enormous apartment.\n\nHe also took a job at Harvard with old friend Alan Cornwall (Nicholas Lyndhurst), much to the excitement of ambitious dean Olivia Finch (Toks Olagundoye). He also had the chance to reconnect with his nephew David (Anders Keith), the son of Niles Crane and Daphne Moon, and Freddy's friend, single mom Eve (Jess Salgueiro). The series also gave Frasier a chance to meet a couple of old friends; in addition to Roz, who dropped into the season finale, the series also featured a guest appearance from Lilith Sternin (Bebe Neuwirth), Frasier's ex-wife and Freddy's mother.\n\nFrasier was created by Chris Harris (How I Met Your Mother) and Joe Cristalli (Life in Pieces), who executive produce with Grammer, Tom Russo, and Jordan McMahon. The series is produced by CBS Studios in association with Grammer's Grammnet NH Productions.\n\nFrasier has begun filming Season 2.

Grammer was sharing the story of how he first auditioned for the role of Frasier on Cheers and how he was sworn to secrecy about this Frasier character joining the ensemble hanging around the bar. (He was originally named Dr. Frasier Nye, but Grammer convinced the creators to change his surname to Crane.) Almost immediately after reading the sides, Grammer recalled, \"I've got this guy, I know who he is.\"\n\nIndeed, he did, as Grammer would go on to play the character for 20 years -- on Cheers, Wings and Frasier (round one). \"I just wanted to prove that I could do it,\" Grammer said.\n\nSo why bring the character back after leaving the airwaves in 2004? Grammer, who has six Emmys, three Golden Globes, a SAG Award and a Tony Award, said the idea started to percolate after Roseanne Barr successfully rebooted her iconic series (in 2018) and it felt fresh. Although not every revival at that time succeeded, Grammer thought, \"We can do this, we can make Frasier a new show and keep the elements that always made it a great show.\"", "source": {"uri": "theankler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "theankler.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "richard_rushfield@theankler.com", "name": "Richard Rushfield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Grammer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kelsey Grammer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frasier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frasier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstage_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Backstage (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cheers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Passions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tony Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Screen Actors Guild Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden Globe Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roseanne_Barr", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roseanne Barr"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:best,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Ftheankler.substack.com%2Fapi%2Fv1%2Fpost_preview%2F144329588%2Ftwitter.jpg%3Fversion%3D4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554542", "eventUri": "eng-9554542", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-02", "textStart": 119, "textEnd": 124}], "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

Well, not so, as last year, the 10-episode Frasier revival debuted to Paramount+ subscribers, and this past February, the series was renewed for Season 2. Although Kelsey Grammer was primarily accompanied by new faces in the new Frasier, Peri Gilpin's Roz Doyle was one of the classic characters who popped back in, and with today bringing word we'll see more of her in Season 2, I have a theory about what's bringing her back to Boston.\n\nParamount+ announced today that Frasier Season 2 has begun filming, and whenever the next batch of episodes drops, we can expect Gilpin to reprise Roz as a recurring guest star, and James Burrows will also return to direct two episodes. In addition her Frasier appearance last year, Gilpin's other TV credits from recent years include guest spots on Why Women Kill, Family Reunion and Kevin Can F**k Himself.\n\nIn the Frasier Season 1 finale, titled \"Reindeer Games\" Frasier's son Freddy called Roz and asked her to come to Boston to cheer up her old friend/work partner as he was still coping with the death of his father, Martin. Roz showed up after the guests at Frasier's party had all left, and the two of them went to a nearby bar to enjoy some drinks together. While they caught up, we learned that Roz's daughter Alice had been dating the same guy for \"like four years,\" a sharp contrast with Roz's history of quickly going through romantic partners.\n\nWith Roz set to appear in multiple Frasier Season 2 episodes, I have trouble envisioning that she'll travel back and forth between Seattle and Boston. Instead, I'm thinking Season 2 will see her moving to the latter city, for either one or both of the following reasons.\n\nFirst, Frasier Crane spent the entirety of his original spinoff hosting his own radio show, and in the interim period between Frasier 1.0 and Frasier 2.0, he hosted a TV talk show in Chicago. Now he's a psychology lecturer at Harvard, but what if he decides he wants to return to media, even if it's just part-time? Perhaps Season 2 will see relocating to Boston so that she can produce a new show for Frasier, whether it's on the radio again or his own podcast.\n\nThen there's Alice, who at this point is old enough to be going to graduate school. Perhaps she'll be joining David Crane at Harvard, and Roz comes along because she wants to remain close to her daughter. That would still allow her to resume her professional relationship with Frasier, or maybe the two of them would simply spend more time with each other socially.\n\nWhatever the reason for Roz Doyle's increased presence in Frasier Season 2, I'll be happy to see more of her. Because cameras just started rolling on the new season, it's hard to say if it'll be ready to go for the 2024 TV schedule or not come out in 2025, but we'll keep passing along major updates on how production is coming along.", "source": {"uri": "cinemablend.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CINEMABLEND"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_holmes@cinemablend.com", "name": "Adam Holmes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roz_Doyle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roz Doyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frasier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frasier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount+", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paramount+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peri_Gilpin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Peri Gilpin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frasier_Crane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frasier Crane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Grammer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kelsey Grammer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cheers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Can_F**k_Himself", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Can F**k Himself"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Reunion_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Family Reunion (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Women_Kill", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Why Women Kill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romantic comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Burrows", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Burrows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Crane_(producer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Crane (producer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Talk show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Mird9EjYRBUtLemTtwvAY-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554542", "eventUri": "eng-9554542", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

He must be pleased that the legendary James Burrows is coming back to direct two episodes in the new season!\n\nNewsletters", "source": {"uri": "djournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kelli_boyle@djournal.com", "name": "Kelli Boyle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peri_Gilpin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peri Gilpin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frasier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frasier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roz_Doyle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roz Doyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramount+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Grammer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kelsey Grammer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Burrows", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Burrows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Pictures"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Condiments_and_Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Condiments and Seasonings", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Media_Production", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Media Production", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/AudioVisual", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/AudioVisual", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/djournal.com/content/tncms/custom/image/9b0abb32-19b9-11ed-8c47-0bbd7b2c1273.png?resize=600%2C315", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554542", "eventUri": "eng-9554542", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 102, "textEnd": 107}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

She appeared at the end of season 1 of the Kelsey Grammer revival and now, there is a chance to bring that forward.\n\nWe do understand why in some ways, there was a real effort in order to ensure that the new version did not have a lot of cameos at first. After all, you don't want to completely overshadow what is going on in Frasier's life now! However, nostalgia is also a big selling point of a series like this, and we do think that there is at least some value in making that happen here and there at the same time. Why wouldn't you want that?\n\nThe streaming service has also confirmed now that season 2 for the sitcom is now in production, and that does make us all the more optimistic that there's a chance that you'll see more of the show at some point this fall. The good news with a series like Frasier is that it does not have some extreme amount of production time. This means it can be turned around quickly, and we'll be able to see more of it within the relatively near future. Let's just hope that it evolves what we saw in season 1 in some good ways!\n\nNever say never, but we know that David Hyde Pierce in particular has said he's not too interested in revisiting the past. Ironically, he's probably one of the people fans most want to see.\n\nRelated - Be sure to get some more news on Frasier now, including other talk about the future\n\nGo ahead and let us know right now in the attached comments!

And there's bittersweet things because it makes me so sad when I think about John [Mahoney, who died in 2018]. I miss him. He was a great friend, but I feel like they dealt with that.\" The actress added that she'd be open to coming back for future episodes \"if that's a possibility.\"\n\nGilpin's appearance in the season finale was quite brief: After getting a call from Frasier's son, Freddy (Jack Cutmore-Scott), Roz flew into Boston to comfort her old friend, who was feeling glum over the holidays. It's not yet clear what might bring Roz back to Beantown on a recurring basis. Speaking with EW last year, Gilpin said that Roz viewed Frasier \"like her older brother and she could always go to him. And those friendships are very, very hard to come by, you realize.\"\n\nLast season, we learned that after he left Seattle, Frasier went on to have a massively successful TV talk show. By the time he moved back to Boston to spend more time with Freddy, however, Dr. Crane insisted he wanted to leave the \"hungry glow\" of \"the limelight\" behind him. Just spitballing here, but maybe this season, Frasier realizes how much he misses fame and hires Roz to help produce his latest TV endeavor.

She's also the Night Host on sister station 92.9 The River (KRQV). She started in radio in 1997 and worked part-time on-air at 101.1 The River (WVRV) in St. Louis, MO until 2002.\n\nFrom there she moved to Mix 96.5 (WKIB) in Cape Girardeau, MO, and was APD and Midday Host until 2004. Her next stop was Hot 102 (WLTO) in Lexington, KY, as PD and Afternoon Host until 2012, then moved on to 105.9 Kiss-FM (KKSW) in Lawrence, KS, where she was PD/OM and Afternoon Host until 2016. Finally, she moved to Tulsa for KHTT where she has been for more than six years now.\n\nGrammer has always been a fan of radio for as long as she can remember. \"80's radio was so fun to listen to in St. Louis,\" she says. \"When I found out there was a radio broadcasting program nearby, that's when I actually thought of it as a 'career.' It was so natural to me and just clicked.\"\n\nGrammer says one of the most exciting things she's experienced in her career so far was a Halloween show. \"When I was in Lawrence, 105.9 KISS-FM had a Halloween show with Twenty One Pilots at The Grenada. The group was just breaking mainstream and already had a huge alternative following,\" she explains. \"They were incredible and hosted a special lounge for twenty of our listeners at the venue. The station was even on stage and introduced the band in front of a sold-out crowd. The best part of the experience was seeing so many listeners and our station staff be part of something that they will never forget. That's one of the reasons why I love radio. The connection between music and a community is beautiful.\"\n\nSpeaking of connections, with things so digitally focused now, Grammer says, \"Unlike a lot of stations, we have the advantage of our airstaff being live and local. That is huge when it comes to social media. Our morning show especially, 'Chubbs & Kacy,' are very active on social media and that connects with listeners online instantly.\"\n\n\"Getting in front of listeners both in person and online is the only way to create loyalty among the newer generation. There are so many distractions. Radio needs to not only get in front of the audience, but also connect and expose the music and issues the younger generation are passionate about to create loyalty among them.\"\n\nAs far as challenges go, Grammer says her toughest over the years so far has been time management and self-care. \"There is so much to do and sometimes so little time to do it. Especially when you have a family. It's a process.\"\n\n\"Another challenge, especially in the past is having those 'Tough Talks.' As a Program Director, you owe it to your people to be compassionate and honest. Being a parent is the best experience,\" she says. \"Tough Love ultimately helps them grow in their career and as a human. Remembering that has helped me overcome this challenge.\"\n\n\"The most common misconception about radio is that it's dying,\" says Grammer. \"I don't believe that, in fact, it's just evolving. We need to embrace the changes in the industry and find ways to continue to connect with the community and listeners on a local level. Yes, this does take an investment, but it is well worth it.\"\n\n\"My advice to young Women who want to be successful and grow in the industry is 'Always find ways to renew and keep your passion alive. There will be times when it'll be hard and frustrating. Embrace the challenge and remember why you got into the business in the first place.'\"\n\n\"To find balance, I read and listen to motivational materials. I also follow a system,\" says Grammer. \"If you have read Atomic Habits you know the importance of having a 'system' and always reviewing it.

Well, not so, as last year, the 10-episode Frasier revival debuted to Paramount+ subscribers, and this past February, the series was renewed for Season 2. Although Kelsey Grammer was primarily accompanied by new faces in the new Frasier, Peri Gilpin's Roz Doyle was one of the classic characters who popped back in, and with today bringing word we'll see more of her in Season 2, I have a theory about what's bringing her back to Boston.\n\nParamount+ announced today that Frasier Season 2 has begun filming, and whenever the next batch of episodes drops, we can expect Gilpin to reprise Roz as a recurring guest star, and James Burrows will also return to direct two episodes. In addition her Frasier appearance last year, Gilpin's other TV credits from recent years include guest spots on Why Women Kill, Family Reunion and Kevin Can F**k Himself.\n\nIn the Frasier Season 1 finale, titled \"Reindeer Games\" Frasier's son Freddy called Roz and asked her to come to Boston to cheer up her old friend/work partner as he was still coping with the death of his father, Martin. Roz showed up after the guests at Frasier's party had all left, and the two of them went to a nearby bar to enjoy some drinks together. While they caught up, we learned that Roz's daughter Alice had been dating the same guy for \"like four years,\" a sharp contrast with Roz's history of quickly going through romantic partners.\n\nWith Roz set to appear in multiple Frasier Season 2 episodes, I have trouble envisioning that she'll travel back and forth between Seattle and Boston. Instead, I'm thinking Season 2 will see her moving to the latter city, for either one or both of the following reasons.\n\nFirst, Frasier Crane spent the entirety of his original spinoff hosting his own radio show, and in the interim period between Frasier 1.0 and Frasier 2.0, he hosted a TV talk show in Chicago. Now he's a psychology lecturer at Harvard, but what if he decides he wants to return to media, even if it's just part-time? Perhaps Season 2 will see relocating to Boston so that she can produce a new show for Frasier, whether it's on the radio again or his own podcast.\n\nThen there's Alice, who at this point is old enough to be going to graduate school. Perhaps she'll be joining David Crane at Harvard, and Roz comes along because she wants to remain close to her daughter. That would still allow her to resume her professional relationship with Frasier, or maybe the two of them would simply spend more time with each other socially.\n\nWhatever the reason for Roz Doyle's increased presence in Frasier Season 2, I'll be happy to see more of her. Because cameras just started rolling on the new season, it's hard to say if it'll be ready to go for the 2024 TV schedule or not come out in 2025, but we'll keep passing along major updates on how production is coming along.", "source": {"uri": "cinemablend.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CINEMABLEND"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_holmes@cinemablend.com", "name": "Adam Holmes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roz_Doyle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roz Doyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frasier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frasier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount+", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paramount+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peri_Gilpin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Peri Gilpin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frasier_Crane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frasier Crane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Grammer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kelsey Grammer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cheers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Can_F**k_Himself", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Can F**k Himself"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Reunion_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Family Reunion (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Women_Kill", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Why Women Kill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romantic comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Burrows", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Burrows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Crane_(producer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Crane (producer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Talk show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Mird9EjYRBUtLemTtwvAY-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554542", "eventUri": "eng-9554542", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 452988247, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 22, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 22}}}

We're so excited to see what the creative team and superb cast serve up for season 2.\"\n\n\"Frasier is a love story, and I am very happy we will be allowed to continue it,\" added Grammer, who also serves as an executive producer on the series. \"I'm delighted that our partners at CBS Studios and Paramount+ are on board for another season, and I can't wait for the fans to see what we have in store!\"\n\nProduction on season 2 kicked off in May 2024, with the show sharing a video of Grammer arriving to set on a bicycle, ready to film some new episodes.\n\nIn the first season of the revival, Frasier returned to his old Cheers stomping ground in Boston, with new challenges to face, new relationships to forge and an old dream or two to finally fulfill. New cast members included Jack Cutmore-Scott, who plays Frasier's adult son, Freddy, and and Anders Keith as Frasier's nephew David, the son of Niles Crane (David Hyde Pierce) and Daphne Moon (Jane Leeves).\n\n\"He is not the same guy anymore,\" Grammer said in ET's exclusive behind-the-scenes look ahead of the show's premiere in October 2023. \"He is a little wiser, he may actually even be a little funnier, willing to laugh at himself. A little more self-aware, and he has a new mission in life.\"\n\nAs news about season 2 continues to be released, ET is sharing a look at the cast -- from franchise newcomers to OGs from the original series -- as well as details on the premiere date, photos and more.\n\nKelsey Grammer\n\nGrammer returned to lead the update, which follows Frasier as he begins a new chapter in his life. The actor was the lone star from the original series to return as a series regular for the new series.\n\nThough the revival was light on OG presence in the first season, Grammer noted that the first episode, titled \"The Good Father,\" is a direct callback to Frasier's series premiere, which was called \"The Good Son.\" There were also plenty of nods and references to characters who have come through Frasier, notably the late John Mahoney, who played Frasier's father, Martin Crane. \"There's a nod to certainly my father in the show, John Mahoney, there,\" Grammer told ET. \"You'll see things about John all through the show. I think people will be very happy to see that he's honored in the way he is in the show.\"\n\nBebe Neuwirth\n\nNeuwirth was the first original cast member, outside of Grammer, officially announced to reprise her role in the upcoming reboot. She guested in the seventh episode of the first season, as Lilith and Frasier had one of their classic showdowns at Freddy's birthday party. After the love-hate energy between the two threatened their relationship with their son, however, the former couple agreed to amicably separate family schedules for Freddy's sake.\n\nPeri Gilpin\n\nGilpin returned for the season 1 finale of the Frasier reboot, reprising her role as Roz, Frasier's longtime friend and former radio co-host. As Frasier struggled with mourning his father during the holiday season, Freddy came through with the ultimate Christmas gift, surprising him with Roz in an attempt to cheer him up. It was announced in May 2024 that Gilpin will return for season 2 in a recurring guest role.\n\nJack Cutmore-Scott\n\nCutmore-Scott was introduced to viewers in season 1 as Freddy, Frasier's grown-up son. (A younger version of the character was played by Luke Tarsitano and Trevor Einhorn on the original series.)\n\nWhile Freddy was the reason Frasier returned to Boston, the father-son reunion is a complicated one. Freddy eschews his father's elitist, academic personality and, despite having been accepted to Harvard himself, works as a fireman, a profession that both frustrates and worries his father. When the pair move into together, it makes for an interesting mirror of the original series, with the clashing personalities providing plenty of fodder for the show's antics.\n\nNicholas Lyndhurst\n\nThe stage actor plays Alan, an old college friend of Frasier's who is now a professor -- though he seems to have more affection for a good, stiff drink than any of his students. Lyndhurst has a connection to Grammer as the two starred in a London production of Man of La Mancha in 2019.\n\nToks Olagundoye\n\nOlagundoye joins the series as Olivia, Alan's colleague and the head of the university's psychology department. She idolizes Frasier, having been a devout fan of his TV talk show, and works tirelessly to persuade him to join the faculty, ultimately becoming part of his inner circle of friends.\n\nJess Salgueiro\n\nSalgueiro portrays Eve, Freddy's roommate, in the new series. While Frasier initially suspects the two are romantically involved, it's later revealed that Eve is the widow of one of Freddy's former co-workers, and she and her infant son, John, moved in with Freddy after the accident. A bartender and struggling actress, Eve often finds herself embroiled in the antics of the Crane men.\n\nAnders Keith\n\nThe Frasier reboot marks Keith's professional acting debut as he plays, Frasier's nephew David, who is the son of Niles Crane and Daphne Moon. Unfortunately, David seems to share both his father's posh aloofness and his mother's penchant for zany shenanigans, often leaving him the butt of the joke. He is a student of Alan's at Harvard, ultimately becoming his teaching assistant, much to both of their chagrins.\n\nSeason 1 showed Frasier readjusting to life in Boston and reattempting to be a supportive father to his now-grown son. He also had to acclimate himself to academic life after years in the spotlight on radio and television, dealing with the complicated behind-the-scenes politicking that goes on at an institution like Harvard.\n\nMeanwhile, Freddy faced challenges of his own, from trying to reconnect with a father he couldn't be more different from, to supporting Eve and her infant son, to his own survivor's guilt. The emotions culminated in the season 1 finale, in which Freddy felt pulled in all directions as he tried to support all the people in his life. Roz's surprise arrival, however, put everyone at ease, as they celebrated and paid tribute to Martin and his favorite time of the year.\n\nFrasier's 10-episode first season -- as well as the entire original series -- is currently streaming on Paramount+.

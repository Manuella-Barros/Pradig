{"id": 232157164, "title": "Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are Selling Their $60 Million Family Home", "text": "Public sightings of the newlyweds sharply declined since the February release of The Greatest Love Story Never Told, a documentary ostensibly about the making of Lopez\u2019s self-funded, Affleck-inflected visual album This Is Me... Now. Affleck and Lopez\u2019s relationship is heavily featured in the doc, including Affleck\u2019s discomfort that their real-life romance was mined for This Is Me. \u201cI did really find the beauty and the poetry and the irony in the fact that it\u2019s the greatest love story never told,\u201d he says at one point in the documentary. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re making a record about it, that seems kind of like telling it.\u201d Those seeking a reason for a rift are probably mulling Affleck\u2019s other comments in the doc, such as \u201cThings that are private, I\u2019d always felt were sacred and special\u2014because, in part, they\u2019re private. So that was a bit of an adjustment for me.\u201d And a scene in which the two discuss their reconciliation after a breakup in 2004 feels especially prescient. \u201cListen, one of the things I don\u2019t want is a relationship on social media,\u201d Affleck says he told Lopez. \u201cI sort of realized it\u2019s not a fair thing to ask. It\u2019s sort of like, you\u2019re going to marry a boat captain, and [you\u2019re like], \u2018Well, I don\u2019t like the water.\u2019\u201d It is perhaps admirable for an aquaphobic to throw those fears to the wind to be with their beloved captain, but in the real world, it\u2019s rarely that simple. That, along with incidents like that viral door slam from over a year ago, has prompted people to speculate from the beginning that their marriage might be on borrowed time. (Representatives for Affleck and Lopez have not responded to Vanity Fair\u2019s request for comment.) That\u2019s also why a TMZ report that Affleck and Lopez hired Buying Beverly Hills Santiago Arana to sell the $60 million Beverly Hills home the couple moved into just last year feels especially significant. According to the outlet, Arana has been showing the 12 bedroom/24 bath home for about two weeks, but no buyers have emerged for the property, which reportedly boasts an asking price of $65 million. The real estate deal isn\u2019t the only disruption in Lopez\u2019s life in recent weeks, as earlier this month, the polymath also canceled her ambitious national stadium tour. According to a statement posted to Lopez\u2019s website, the concert series\u2014which struggled with slow ticket sales\u2014was iced so Lopez could \u201cbe with her children, family and close friends.\u201d", "summary": "Rumors of a pending split between the stars grew more furious when the couple reportedly hired a real estate agent.", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/story/ben-affleck-jennifer-lopez-beverly-hills-house-for-sale", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6665ba5e6a6cc134f610b78a/16:9/w_4048,h_2277,c_limit/2001188435", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:48:51", "author": "Eve Batey", "authors": ["Eve Batey"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.282}

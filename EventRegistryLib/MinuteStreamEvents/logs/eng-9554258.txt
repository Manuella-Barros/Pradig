A new study has answers", "body": "Students attending California's public colleges and universities see better returns on investment than those at most nonprofit private colleges and for-profit institutions.\n\nNathan Reyes lives with his family five minutes from Cal State Los Angeles, where he's paying close to nothing to earn a bachelor's degree that typically lands graduates a salary of $62,000 within five years of completing college.\n\nHe's one of hundreds of thousands of California low-income students who attend colleges that, because they're affordable enough, cost the equivalent of a few months of a typical salary that students earn within a few years of graduation.\n\nA new report today compares California's colleges by analyzing how long it would take low- and moderate-income students to recoup the money they spent to earn a college credential. It shows that many community colleges, Cal States and University of California campuses -- all public campuses -- have better returns on investment than most nonprofit private colleges and for-profit institutions.\n\nReyes' only expenses are car upkeep, gas, a few books and helping his family with some housing costs. The third-year student didn't need to take out loans.\n\n\"I feel very lucky,\" Reyes, a communications major, said. \"In high school, I was always stressing about, 'Oh, man, I'm gonna have a whole bunch of debt racked up after college'. And now that I'm in my third year, I don't have to worry about any of that.\"\n\nReyes, who's 20 years old, receives state grants to cover all his tuition and federal aid for other academic and living expenses. He also works for a state volunteer program that pays students a stipend.\n\nThe report was commissioned by College Futures Foundation, a nonprofit that promotes college completion. The report merges several concepts into one number:\n\nIt defines low- and moderate-income households as those earning below $75,000 annually.\n\nThe data, all from the federal government, show that the time it takes to recoup the net costs of earning a degree at Cal State San Bernardino is less than three months. That's because low-income students there incur about $5,000 in out-of-pocket expenses if they finish in four years. Within a few years they earn about $53,000 a year -- double what young adults with only a high school diploma make.\n\nAt Cal State Los Angeles, the time to recoup the net costs of earning a bachelor's is also less than three months of a typical post-college annual salary.\n\n\"This is really a first-of-its kind look,\" said the report's author, Michael Itzkowitz, who headed the federal government's first consumer tool for comparing college costs under the Obama administration. The approach is a mathematical way of demonstrating which colleges confer economic value to students beyond what a high school diploma would.\n\nA CalMatters analysis of Iztkowitz's data found that the average time needed for a student to recoup their net costs is about two years at public institutions and a little over three years at nonprofit private colleges in California.\n\nSome of those private campuses are as affordable as a Cal State, UC or community college after factoring in financial aid. Stanford University costs low-income students nothing. However, only 4% of students who apply are admitted, while all but three Cal States admit more than 70% of the students who apply. Most undergraduates in California attend a public institution.\n\nPitzer, Pomona and the University of Southern California and several other highly selective nonprofit private colleges cost students less than a year's worth of the typical salary they'll earn within a few years of completing their degree.\n\nWhile some for-profit colleges have strong returns on investment, most do not.\n\nIt takes nearly 13 years for students attending this often-scrutinized segment of higher education to recoup their costs, Itzkowitz's calculations show. California's Department of Justice has sued several for-profit colleges, accusing them of deceitful practices, and won large financial judgments and settlements.\n\nAnd that doesn't even account for the 22 for-profit institutions that show no return on investment, meaning students from those schools earned no more than what a young adult with just a high school diploma makes. In the report, 24 campuses in total, or 8% of all California colleges, showed no return on investment, including two small nonprofit private colleges.\n\n\"There are for-profit institutions that can offer an affordable education and good employment outcomes and they're recognized within the data,\" Itzkowitz said. \"But what we also see is that there are a disproportionate amount that show more worrisome outcomes for students in comparison to other sectors.\"\n\nMost California for-profit colleges, however, predominantly issue certificates, which are shorter-term credentials that don't regularly lead to the economic gains associated with bachelor's degrees.\n\nAt 79% of California institutions in the report, low and moderate-income students typically recoup their costs in five years or less. For nearly a third of campuses, it was less than a year.\n\nFor many students, the ultimate costs of a degree will be higher than the data published today. That's because they need more than two years to earn an associate degree or beyond four years to earn a bachelor's, assuming they graduate at all. The longer they chase a degree, the less time they spend in the workforce earning the higher salaries that come with a college credential. Also, the federal net price data has limits: It only calculates what full-time freshmen pay. Students attending part time will experience different annual costs.\n\nBut the basic trend remains the same: State and federal financial aid at public campuses plus typical salaries that far exceed the wages for those with a high school diploma make college worth the investment.\n\nItzkowitz plans to produce a follow-up report that measures the return on investment by major. His organization, the HEA Group, produced an analysis of typical wages by major last year. Some majors lead to higher wages than others, which can skew school-wide results.\n\nThe data in today's report show variation within public universities, too, even in the same city. UCLA's net price-to-earnings ratio is about seven months and its students tend to earn more than those from Cal State LA after graduating. But the typical cost of a degree after four years for low-income students is roughly $31,000 -- far higher than the $5,500 at Cal State LA, which is 20 miles away.\n\n\"I wanted to go to UCLA, but it was too expensive for me,\" Reyes said. \"I did get accepted.\"\n\nLike he did at Cal State LA, he would have probably qualified for the Cal Grant, which waives tuition at public universities. But the distance from home would have forced him to either live in a UCLA dorm or commute about two hours daily between home and the crosstown campus. Housing, not tuition, is usually the largest expense for students at public universities. Borrowing money was out of the question for him.\n\nSo was a long drive to UCLA. \"If I ended up missing a class or something, I'd beat myself up over it,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "calmatters.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "CalMatters"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mikhail_zinshteyn@calmatters.org", "name": "Mikhail Zinshteyn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Return on investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For-profit_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "For-profit education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_University,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California State University, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_college", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Community college"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_diploma", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "High school diploma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For-profit_higher_education_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "For-profit higher education in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_university", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public university"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor's_degree", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor's degree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_financial_aid_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Student financial aid (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitzer_College", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitzer College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_University,_San_Bernardino", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California State University, San Bernardino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mathematics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Higher education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanford University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undergraduate_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Undergraduate education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Barack_Obama", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomona,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pomona, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pomona, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_(academic)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major (academic)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

A New Study Has Answers", "body": "Nathan Reyes lives with his family five minutes from Cal State Los Angeles, where he's paying close to nothing to earn a bachelor's degree that typically lands graduates a salary of $62,000 within five years of completing college.\n\nHe's one of hundreds of thousands of California low-income students who attend colleges that, because they're affordable enough, cost the equivalent of a few months of a typical salary that students earn within a few years of graduation.\n\nA new report today compares California's colleges by analyzing how long it would take low- and moderate-income students to recoup the money they spent to earn a college credential. It shows that many community colleges, Cal States and University of California campuses -- all public campuses -- have better returns on investment than most nonprofit private colleges and for-profit institutions.\n\nReyes' only expenses are car upkeep, gas, a few books and helping his family with some housing costs. The third-year student didn't need to take out loans.\n\n\"I feel very lucky,\" Reyes, a communications major, said. \"In high school, I was always stressing about, 'Oh, man, I'm gonna have a whole bunch of debt racked up after college'. And now that I'm in my third year, I don't have to worry about any of that.\"\n\nReyes, who's 20 years old, receives state grants to cover all his tuition and federal aid for other academic and living expenses. He also works for a state volunteer program that pays students a stipend.\n\nThe report was commissioned by College Futures Foundation, a nonprofit that promotes college completion. The report merges several concepts into one number:\n\nIt defines low- and moderate-income households as those earning below $75,000 annually.\n\nThe data, all from the federal government, show that the time it takes to recoup the net costs of earning a degree at Cal State San Bernardino is less than three months. That's because low-income students there incur about $5,000 in out-of-pocket expenses if they finish in four years. Within a few years they earn about $53,000 a year -- double what young adults with only a high school diploma make.\n\nAt Cal State Los Angeles, the time to recoup the net costs of earning a bachelor's is also less than three months of a typical post-college annual salary.\n\n\"This is really a first-of-its kind look,\" said the report's author, Michael Itzkowitz, who headed the federal government's first consumer tool for comparing college costs under the Obama administration. The approach is a mathematical way of demonstrating which colleges confer economic value to students beyond what a high school diploma would.\n\nA CalMatters analysis of Iztkowitz's data found that the average time needed for a student to recoup their net costs is about two years at public institutions and a little over three years at nonprofit private colleges in California.\n\nSome of those private campuses are as affordable as a Cal State, UC or community college after factoring in financial aid. Stanford University costs low-income students nothing. However, only 4% of students who apply are admitted, while all but three Cal States admit more than 70% of the students who apply. Most undergraduates in California attend a public institution.\n\nPitzer, Pomona and the University of Southern California and several other highly selective nonprofit private colleges cost students less than a year's worth of the typical salary they'll earn within a few years of completing their degree.\n\nWhile some for-profit colleges have strong returns on investment, most do not.\n\nIt takes nearly 13 years for students attending this often-scrutinized segment of higher education to recoup their costs, Itzkowitz's calculations show. California's Department of Justice has sued several for-profit colleges, accusing them of deceitful practices, and won large financial judgments and settlements.\n\nAnd that doesn't even account for the 22 for-profit institutions that show no return on investment, meaning students from those schools earned no more than what a young adult with just a high school diploma makes. In the report, 24 campuses in total, or 8% of all California colleges, showed no return on investment, including two small nonprofit private colleges.\n\n\"There are for-profit institutions that can offer an affordable education and good employment outcomes and they're recognized within the data,\" Itzkowitz said. \"But what we also see is that there are a disproportionate amount that show more worrisome outcomes for students in comparison to other sectors.\"\n\nMost California for-profit colleges, however, predominantly issue certificates, which are shorter-term credentials that don't regularly lead to the economic gains associated with bachelor's degrees.\n\nAt 79% of California institutions in the report, low and moderate-income students typically recoup their costs in five years or less. For nearly a third of campuses, it was less than a year.\n\nFor many students, the ultimate costs of a degree will be higher than the data published today. That's because they need more than two years to earn an associate degree or beyond four years to earn a bachelor's, assuming they graduate at all. The longer they chase a degree, the less time they spend in the workforce earning the higher salaries that come with a college credential. Also, the federal net price data has limits: It only calculates what full-time freshmen pay. Students attending part time will experience different annual costs.\n\nBut the basic trend remains the same: State and federal financial aid at public campuses plus typical salaries that far exceed the wages for those with a high school diploma make college worth the investment.\n\nItzkowitz plans to produce a follow-up report that measures the return on investment by major. His organization, the HEA Group, produced an analysis of typical wages by major last year. Some majors lead to higher wages than others, which can skew school-wide results.\n\nThe data in today's report show variation within public universities, too, even in the same city. UCLA's net price-to-earnings ratio is about seven months and its students tend to earn more than those from Cal State LA after graduating. But the typical cost of a degree after four years for low-income students is roughly $31,000 -- far higher than the $5,500 at Cal State LA, which is 20 miles away.\n\n\"I wanted to go to UCLA, but it was too expensive for me,\" Reyes said. \"I did get accepted.\"\n\nLike he did at Cal State LA, he would have probably qualified for the Cal Grant, which waives tuition at public universities. But the distance from home would have forced him to either live in a UCLA dorm or commute about two hours daily between home and the crosstown campus. Housing, not tuition, is usually the largest expense for students at public universities. Borrowing money was out of the question for him.\n\nSo was a long drive to UCLA. \"If I ended up missing a class or something, I'd beat myself up over it,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "laist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LAist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Return on investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_University,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California State University, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For-profit_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "For-profit education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_college", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Community college"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_diploma", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "High school diploma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For-profit_higher_education_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "For-profit higher education in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor's_degree", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor's degree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_financial_aid_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Student financial aid (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitzer_College", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitzer College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_University,_San_Bernardino", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California State University, San Bernardino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mathematics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Higher education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanford University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undergraduate_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Undergraduate education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Barack_Obama", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomona,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pomona, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pomona, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_(academic)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major (academic)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

For many, it's 5 years or less.", "body": "One of the major questions facing families today is whether a college degree is worth the expense, given rising tuition and fees that can saddle graduates with tens of thousands in student loan debt. Today, a majority of Americans don't think the cost can be justified.\n\nBut a new analysis finds that most post-secondary degrees provide a payoff within less than five years after graduation for low- and moderate-income students, although that time frame can largely depend on the type of school and program that a student chooses. The analysis, from the HEA Group and the educational nonprofit College Futures Foundation, focuses on graduates in California, the state with the largest number of enrolled college students.\n\nThe study examined families earning $75,000 or less given that these students may be more likely to skip higher education due to fears that pursuing a post-secondary degree may not pay off, even though a college degree could help them get an economic foothold. For this group of students, almost 4 of 5 California colleges and other higher education institutions provide a return on investment within five years, the research found.\n\n\"The No. 1 deterrent for a student not to pursue a college degree is affordability -- they simply think they can't afford the cost of a higher education,\" HEA Group founder Michael Itzkowitz told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nBut the study found that many low- and middle-income students are getting \"an affordable education that allows for enough of an earnings premium that they can pay down their college education very quickly,\" he added.\n\nThe schools with the best return on investment for low- and middle-income students include many of California's state colleges, which tend to be lower-priced than nonprofit private universities, he noted. Itzkowitz said he believes the findings have applicability across the U.S. because students across the nation likewise have access to state colleges and universities that offer lower-cost degree programs compared with private institutions.\n\nThe findings echo recent a recent analysis of 1,500 colleges by Bloomberg News, which found that Ivy League universities like Yale and Harvard provide the best return on investment due to high salaries earned by their grads. But students who don't gain acceptance to one the Ivies are often better off attending state colleges, rather than high-priced private institutions, given that public institutions' lower cost of attendance result in a better return on investment.\n\nEven though many students incur debt when pursuing a college degree, graduates are typically rewarded in the workplace with higher earnings, a benefit that accrues across their career. Despite Americans' increasing skepticism about the value of college, the typical college grad now earns about $60,000 annually, compared with $36,000 for people with only high school degrees, according to data from the New York Federal Reserve Bank.\n\nOver a lifetime, that college wage premium can translate into a huge financial advantage. For instance, baby boomers with bachelor's degrees have median retirement savings of almost $600,000, but those with only a high school diploma have only about $75,000 socked away, a recent study found.\n\nTo examine a school's return on investment, the analysis looked at data from the U.S. Department of Education's College Scorecard to examine the earnings premium for 731,000 low- and moderate income graduates in California.\n\nThe analysis then looked at the net cost that students pay to complete a degree, which is tuition and other fees minus scholarships and grants, times the number of years required to earn a degree. Comparing the earnings premium that college grads receive versus their net cost of getting their degree indicates how long it takes to get a return on investment.\n\nFor instance, the study found the net cost of earning a bachelor's degree at California State University, San Bernardino, stands at about $5,373. But graduates of that university earn about $28,000 more per year than people with only a high school degree. As a result, CSU San Bernardino grads are able to earn a return on their investment after just a few months of graduating -- giving it the second-best return on investment among all California schools.\n\nThe pricier Stanford University offers the best return on investment, with low- and moderate-income students basically able to recoup their costs as soon as they graduate. That's due partly to the wage premium given to Stanford grads, who typically earn about $74,000 more annually than people with only high school degrees.\n\nBut Stanford, like other top-rated colleges, accepts a smaller share of low- and moderate-income students compared with state schools, the study found.\n\n\"There are many state schools that are often the best option for students to consider,\" Itzkowitz said. \"They oftentimes include in-state tuition, which is much less expensive than out-of-state tuition, and they can offer generous scholarships and provide strong economic opportunities.\"\n\nThe analysis also found some red flags, with about 20% of higher education programs providing no ROI. Basically, graduates will never earn enough to offset the cost of attendance, because their earnings are likely to remain lower than those of high school graduates.\n\nThese tend to be for-profit schools that offer certificate programs in industries such as cosmetology, the study found.\n\nBecause of these pitfalls, students should research schools and colleges to learn about typical graduates' economic outcomes before committing to a program, Itzkowitz noted.\n\n\"It's critical that students are more discerning than ever, because it's one of the most important decision you'll ever make,\" he noted.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment", "type":

New study says it depends on the school", "body": "The value of a college degree largely depends on where you go, a new HEA Group study found.\n\nAnd as college tuition continues to increase - more than 30% in the next five years for Cal State University - some are wondering if higher education is worth the investment.\n\nEloy Ortiz Oakley, president and CEO of College Futures Foundation, set out to answer that question when he commissioned the HEA Group to analyze how long it would take low and moderate income students to recoup the costs of attending colleges -- from four-year institutions and community colleges to trade schools.\n\n\"We believe that we are in a crisis moment, particularly when it comes to higher education opportunities,\" Oakley said. \"We all know that the cost of attendance continues to rise. The public is asking questions about the value of a degree. There are a lot of conversations about whether or not your college degree still has the same value that it once promised.\"\n\nOakley, who is the former chancellor of the California Community Colleges, said higher education is one of the largest investments that students and their families will make in their lifetime, so they should see a return on that investment.\n\nThe \"Golden Opportunities\" study by HEA uses data from the U.S. Department of Education's College Scorecard to determine how long it takes 731,000 low and moderate income students at 292 higher ed institutions in the state to recoup their cost of attendance. Students whose family income is less than $75,000 a year are defined as low and moderate income.\n\nThe study calculated the net annual cost of attendance - books, housing, transportation and tuition - after all scholarships and grants are awarded. Then, HEA multiplied that figure by the number of years it would take a student to receive their credential: four years for a bachelor's, two years for an associate's and one year for a certificate.\n\nHEA's study measured the median salary of former students after 10 years of enrolling at each school and compared it to the salary of a high school graduate with no college experience - $26,073. That salary was then used to calculate how long it would take a student to pay down the cost of earning their degree.\n\nThe HEA Group found that generally, students who received associate's degrees were able to recoup their educational costs quicker than students who received bachelor's degrees or certificates.\n\nAccording to the study, San Jose State University costs $47,769 for a low/moderate income student to attend. Graduates made $45,924 more annually than a student with no college experience. Under that scenario, the former student would recoup their costs of attendance in one year.\n\nA student at De Anza Community College in Cupertino paid $9,117 to attend, and would earn $30,766 more on average than a high school grad without a college degree. In that case, the report found, the former student could get back their cost of attendance in less than six months.\n\nBut a student who attended Menlo College in Atherton would have to spend nearly four years earning a salary of $56,512 - barely $30,000 more than a high school graduate without a college degree - before they could recoup the $115,852 it cost to attend the private school.\n\nMichael Itzkowitz, founder and president of the HEA Group, said the analysis aimed to get a bird's eye view on what kind of economic outcomes colleges and universities are providing students.\n\n\"The number one reason why students attend higher education today...is for greater employability and to obtain a financially secure future,\" Itzkowitz said. \"The number one reason why students don't attend college is because of cost.\"\n\nItzkowitz said the survey found that most higher ed institutions in California (79%) allowed for low and moderate income students to regain the cost of attendance in five years or less, and nearly a third allowed students to recuperate their costs in under a year.\n\nBut 24 schools showed that students received no economic benefit from enrolling in college and earned even less than a typical high school graduate. Many of those schools were cosmetology schools or technical colleges.\n\n\"I'd argue that they may actually be worse off financially after they attend, being that they're earning so little and they paid so much to earn their (credential),\" Itzkowitz said.\n\nIn California and the Bay Area, Stanford University rose to the top of the list, providing students with the most bang for their buck -- with graduates earning on average $73,901 more than someone with without a college degree -- and essentially no cost of attendance. But Itzkowitz warned that schools like Stanford that provide the quickest return on investment didn't necessarily enroll a high number of low and moderate income students. In fact, HEA's study found that only 18% of Stanford students surveyed were recipients of the Pell Grant, which is available to low-income students who are enrolled full time. The grants do not have to be repaid.\n\nGraduates of UC Berkeley, another highly selective Bay Area university, earned $60,440 more than the average high school grad. UC Berkeley also saw nearly a third of its students qualify for the Pell Grant, allowing them to recoup their cost of attendance in less than a year, the report found.\n\nOakley said that College Futures and the HEA Group hope to dive deeper into how race, ethnicity, gender and areas of study factor into students' return on investment. The study's data also doesn't factor in how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted students.\n\n\"California remains one of the best states in terms of providing quality access to post-secondary education in the country,\" Oakley said. \"That being said, we still have a long way to go.\"", "source": {"uri": "mercurynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Jose Mercury News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

For many, it only takes a few years, study says.", "body": "One of the major questions facing families today is whether a college degree is worth the expense, given rising tuition and fees that can saddle graduates with tens of thousands in student loan debt. Today, a majority of Americans don't think the cost can be justified.\n\nBut a new analysis finds that most post-secondary degrees provide a payoff within less than five years after graduation for low- and moderate-income students, although that time frame can largely depend on the type of school and program that a student chooses. The analysis, from the HEA Group and the educational nonprofit College Futures Foundation, focuses on graduates in California, the state with the largest number of enrolled college students.\n\nThe study examined families earning $75,000 or less given that these students may be more likely to skip higher education due to fears that pursuing a post-secondary degree may not pay off, even though a college degree could help them get an economic foothold. For this group of students, almost 4 of 5 California colleges and other higher education institutions provide a return on investment within five years, the research found.\n\n\"The No. 1 deterrent for a student not to pursue a college degree is affordability -- they simply think they can't afford the cost of a higher education,\" HEA Group founder Michael Itzkowitz told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nBut the study found that many low- and middle-income students are getting \"an affordable education that allows for enough of an earnings premium that they can pay down their college education very quickly,\" he added.\n\nThe schools with the best return on investment for low- and middle-income students include many of California's state colleges, which tend to be lower-priced than nonprofit private universities, he noted. Itzkowitz said he believes the findings have applicability across the U.S. because students across the nation likewise have access to state colleges and universities that offer lower-cost degree programs compared with private institutions.\n\nThe findings echo recent a recent analysis of 1,500 colleges by Bloomberg News, which found that Ivy League universities like Yale and Harvard provide the best return on investment due to high salaries earned by their grads. But students who don't gain acceptance to one the Ivies are often better off attending state colleges, rather than high-priced private institutions, given that public institutions' lower cost of attendance result in a better return on investment.\n\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r\n\nKey takeaways from Stormy Daniels' testimony in Trump trial\n\nWhat we learned from Stormy Daniels' testimony in Trump trial", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

{"id": 231939412, "title": "Local election results: Independents perform strongly as Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il battle to be largest local government party", "text": "The battle to be the largest party of local government remains too close to call between Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il as the second day of counting continues in local and European elections. With just under a quarter of seats filled on local authorities, Fine Gael have 73 seats and a first preference vote share of 23.23 per cent, ahead of Fianna F\u00e1il\u2019s 64 seats with a 22 per cent share of the vote. Speaking privately, a Fianna F\u00e1il Minister said it was \u201cneck and neck\u201d. \u201cNeither party can confidently say they will be ahead of the other at this point,\u201d the Minister said on Sunday. Independents continue to perform strongly, taking the highest share of the vote at almost 27 per cent. Sinn F\u00e9in has admitted that the party has had an underwhelming day, with Waterford TD David Cullinane telling RT\u00c9 radio that the results are \u201cnot where we want to be\u201d. Amid indications that the party has won about 11 per cent of first preference votes \u2013 based on declarations so far in the local election \u2013 Mr Cullinane rejected a suggestion that Sinn F\u00e9in had been complacent. The party\u2019s share of the vote so far is two percentage points higher than its 2019 local election performance but remains well below the 2020 general election performance and polling last year. The party won 24.5 per cent of the vote in the 2020 general election and had been polling above 30 per cent until recent polls indicated a slide in their support. Mr Cullinane warned against underestimating the resilience of the Sinn F\u00e9in party and said some council seats would \u201ccome down to very complicated transfers\u201d. \u201cObviously we expected to do better, I\u2019m not saying that it was a good result for Sinn F\u00e9in, of course I\u2019m not,\u201d he said. \u201cAbsolutely there was no complacency. When we don\u2019t have a good day, we accept it. We will have to ask the questions you asked me: why did we not get the votes that we expected to get?\u201d Arriving at the count centre for the Dublin seat in the European Parliament at the RDS, Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said it had been a \u201cmixed day\u201d for his candidates, but it was too early to say whether Ciar\u00e1n Cuffe would retain his seat in Dublin or Grace O\u2019Sullivan would retain hers in Ireland South. Sin\u00e9ad Gibney, the Social Democrats candidate for Dublin, admitted she was facing an uphill struggle to claim a seat in the capital, but at local level the party appears to have added to its representatives. The party\u2019s strategists expect the party to gain seats in Bandon-Kinsale with Ann Bambury, Caroline Winstanley in Bray West, Danny Alvey in Wicklow, Jen Cummins in the South West Inner City, Paddy Monahan in Donaghmede and P\u00e1draig Rice in Cork City South Central. Labour\u2019s MEP candidate for Dublin Aodh\u00e1n \u00d3 R\u00edord\u00e1in said he expected to be in the mix for a seat in Dublin, claiming the election was an important turning point for his party. \u201cWe have got our self-confidence back,\u201d he said at the RDS. In Midlands-North-West incumbent MEP Luke \u201cMing\u201d Flanagan said he was happy with tallies so far. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens, but if someone said to me three or four weeks ago that the tallies were saying what they were saying, I\u2019d be happy at this stage,\u201d he told reporters at the count centre. Sinn F\u00e9in would \u201cstruggle\u201d to secure a seat in the constituency, he said, \u201cwhich is extraordinary. When you look at some of the opinion polls from just over a year ago.\u201d A partial tally of European votes in Dublin, which comes with significant caveats and health warnings attached, had Fianna F\u00e1il\u2019s Barry Andrews ahead of his rivals on 13.1 per cent, with Regina Doherty of Fine Gael on 12.3 per cent. Ms Doherty said that a sense of momentum stemming from the election of Simon Harris as Fine Gael leader and Taoiseach just over two months ago had energised the party\u2019s campaigns. She said the party was having a \u201cgood weekend\u201d and there was a \u201cgood feeling all around\u201d. Tallies had Mr \u00d3 R\u00edord\u00e1in on 12.2 per cent but the ballot watchers warned that it included the entirety of Clontarf, one of his strongest voting bases in his constituency of Dublin Bay North. Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s Lynn Boylan was on 10.6 per cent and Clare Daly (Independents for Change) was on 7.2 per cent, with Mr Cuffe on 8.4 per cent.

It thrives on tales that veer off the beaten path, especially when they come straight from the lives of its stars. Kate Hudson, with her sunny demeanor and no-nonsense approach to life, recently turned a regular chat on the Howard Stern Show into an intriguing glimpse into the supernatural. This isn't your average eerie anecdote; it's a firsthand account that might just sway even the most steadfast skeptics.\n\nWhen Stern probed Hudson about the whispers (figuratively speaking) surrounding her and her mother, Goldie Hawn's, alleged ability to connect with the other side, he asked, \"You and your mother can see dead people, right?\" What followed was a conversation so riveting it could have filled seats in theaters.\n\nHudson, always one to take things in stride, replied with a chuckle, \"I can see everything.\" But quickly, she made sure to clarify that her experiences weren't as cut and dry as Hollywood's big-screen adaptations. \"It's not like that,\" she said. \"It's like, you get these sort of messages.\"\n\nShe dived into stories of her childhood that were more akin to scenes from a supernatural thriller than real life. \"When I was a little girl, it was actually quite wild because I would see ghosts all the time,\" Hudson confessed. She likened her younger self's experiences to \"The Sixth Sense,\" saying, \"It was a bit 'I see dead people' when I was younger.\"\n\nStern, intrigued, ventured into the realm of existential inquiries, half in jest questioning his own fate after death. Hudson shared her belief that the afterlife might be more layered and complex than we can fathom. \"It's more scientific than we even know. I think it's very multidimensional,\" she mused. \"We're just not all-knowing. And we'll see it when we get there, but I think it's gonna be quite extraordinary,\" she explained, per Us Weekly.\n\nHudson's willingness to keep an open mind and her knack for enjoying the offbeat not only show how curious she is but also how much she loves checking out new ideas. She's not the only one with stories like this; Hollywood is full of interesting tales just waiting to be told.\n\nTake Jennifer Aniston, for example. She's not just into ghost stories; she actually shared that she had a ghost roommate once. Then there's Kate Siegel, who's known for her horror flicks -- and is bringing her kids along for the ride. t goes to show, Hollywood's love affair with the paranormal isn't just for the big screen -- it's part of the stars' real lives too.", "source": {"uri": "sheknows.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SheKnows"}, "authors": [{"uri": "maggie_clancy@sheknows.com", "name": "Maggie Clancy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Hudson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kate Hudson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodie_Turner-Smith", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jodie Turner-Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_story", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ghost story"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Howard_Stern_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Howard Stern Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Stern", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Howard Stern"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldie_Hawn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goldie Hawn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joshua Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supernatural"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sixth_Sense_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Sixth Sense (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thriller film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ghost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Siegel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kate Siegel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Aniston", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Aniston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranormal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paranormal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Existentialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Afterlife"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/kate-hudson-psychic-abilities.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552903", "eventUri": "eng-9552903", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

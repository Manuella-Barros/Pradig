We have played two matches here but we don't have much awareness about its nature. It behaves differently on different days, so even the curator is confused,\" Rohit said. \"So, you can imagine the kind of thinking we need to put in. We don't know on which pitch we are playing (against Pakistan), so, whoever plays better cricket will win the match,\" he added. The Indian skipper also pointed out that the slowness of the outfield had also added to the team's worries ahead of the high voltage clash. \"The outfield is slow. Some shots get lot of bounce on the field, and some others do not roll on the field. So running between the wickets is important. We need to play as per conditions,\" he said. \"Playing good cricket holds the key, not opposition, not pitch. Yes, it's tough but that's why I would like to highlight the experience we have. The blows count for nothing,\" said Rohit, referring to the hits he and Rishabh Pant took in their tournament-opener against Ireland due to the uneven bounce. On Friday, the organisers had admitted the problems with the playing surface of the aforementioned pitch and assured that remedial work was taking place before Sunday\u2019s match. \u201cT20 inc [the organising committee] and the ICC recognise that the pitches used so far at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium have not played as consistently as we would have all wanted. The world-class grounds team have been working hard since the conclusion of yesterday\u2019s game to remedy the situation and deliver the best possible surfaces for the remaining matches,\u201d a statement from the organizers had revealed.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/rohit-sharma-india-vs-pakistan-pitch-t20-world-cup-2024-curator-9380491/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/Rohit-Sharma-7.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:07:02", "author": "Sports Desk", "authors": ["Sports Desk"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.28}

Danny (43) said: \u201cI couldn\u2019t articulate, I couldn\u2019t write anything for seven to eight months. I started hitting the drink pretty hard and just really went off the rails, as you do during those situations \u201cIt would have been around Christmas time that I\u2019d had my fill of Guinness, you know, back home in Ireland. \u201cI got back here (London) on December 27 and just went \u2018That\u2019s it, I\u2019m finished. I\u2019m finished drinking, I\u2019m finished feeling sorry for myself. It\u2019s not what (Mark) would have wanted\u2019.\u201d Remembering his bandmate, who was also in the band My Town with him, Danny said: \u201cWe\u2019d been friends for nearly 30 odd years. We wrote these songs together and his memory lives on through his music. We\u2019ve always said that. \u201cWhat\u2019s our legacy? I don\u2019t have any kids, so for me, it\u2019s my music. But for him, it\u2019s his kids, his family and what he\u2019s done for Irish music. \u201cHe\u2019s a genius lyricist and we are never going to fill his shoes. Why would we even want to try? \u201cWe\u2019ve retired the three-piece and now we\u2019ve got two other members in. It\u2019s not the past \u2014 we never will repeat that \u2014 but it\u2019s a new chapter for The Script.\u201d Danny is continuing the band alongside Glen Power with new bassist Ben Sargeant and guitarist Ben Weaver ahead of the release of their new album Satellites. He said: \u201c(We tried to make the music) a bit more uplifting. We feel that after the year that we had last year, we could do with a bit of positivity. \u201cI went off the rails after Mark passed away, like everybody does. I was out drinking, smoking, everything. \u201cI had a writer\u2019s block for a long time last year. It was only around Christmas time that I came up with lyrics. It was the first time I was really able to articulate how I felt about the situation. The floodgates really opened.\u201d Tickets for the The Script\u2019s tour are available now", "summary": "<p>Danny O\u2019Donoghue was only able to begin writing again at the start of this year after the death of his bandmate Mark Sheehan in April 2023.</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/style/celebrity/celebrity-news/the-script-singer-danny-odonoghue-on-bandmates-death-i-hit-the-drink-and-couldnt-write-a-thing/a1714959931.html", "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/HFImF_ObylndJz2QsggpbGKyZW4=/0x11:1240x837/550x550/prod-mh-ireland/a9d8746a-8fee-4bb6-981b-61900d458e5f/00c862bc-e42b-4ed0-98e1-c2fcbfed68fb/zm%20mark.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:20:01", "author": "Kelly Allen", "authors": ["Kelly Allen"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.199}

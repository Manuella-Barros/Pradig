The 91-year-old was charged on Friday with five crimes including rape, indecent assault on a female, sexual assault and forcible confinement, Peel Regional Police said. He was released with conditions and would appear at the Ontario Court of Justice in Brampton, Ontario, at a later date, the police statement said. Peel Regional Police Constable Tyler Bell said there was more than one accuser but declined to say how many. \u201cObviously, this is a high-profile case. Our special victims unit is bound to protect the victims and in doing so that\u2019s why were are being vague,\u201d Bell said. \u201cThere is more than one victim but we won\u2019t confirm that number yet.\u201d Police allege the sexual assaults occurred from the 1980s to as recent as 2023. Bell said they were appealing for people to come forward if they had information or had been victims. Stronach did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He has hired prominent Canadian defence lawyer Brian Greenspan. \u201cMr. Stronach categorically denies the allegations of impropriety which have been brought against him,\u201d Greenspan said in an email. \u201cHe looks forward to the opportunity to fully respond to the charges and to maintain his legacy both as a philanthropist and as an icon of the Canadian business community.\u201d Stronach, born in Austria, became one of Canada\u2019s wealthiest people by creating Magna in his garage in 1957 and building it into one of the world\u2019s largest suppliers of auto parts. He also founded The Stronach Group, a company specialising in horse racing. He made a brief foray into Austrian politics more than a decade ago and has been named to the Order of Canada, one of the country\u2019s highest honours. According to a Magna spokesperson, Stronach has had no affiliation with the company since relinquishing control in 2010. \u201cWe have recently been made aware of the charges filed against Frank Stronach,\u201d Dave Niemiec said in an email Friday evening. \u201cMagna has no knowledge of the investigation or the allegations that have been raised beyond what has been reported in the media.\u201d Niemiec said the company would not comment further on the ongoing legal matter. In 2018, Stronach sued his daughter, two grandchildren and former business associate Alon Ossip for over $500 million in Ontario Superior Court alleging they mismanaged the family\u2019s assets which he wanted to take back control of. Belinda Stronach, a former Canadian member of parliament, countersued her father, saying in a statement of defence that he lost vast sums of money on pet projects. The case was later settled.", "summary": "Frank Stronach has been charged with five crimes including rape, indecent assault on a female, sexual assault and forcible confinement.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3265908/canadian-auto-parts-billionaire-frank-stronach-91-arrested-sexual-assault-charges", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/06/08/6b0becac-f4e9-436f-b61f-a53e26c88664_71bfc01d.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:00:12", "author": "Associated Press", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "cn", "sentiment": -0.394}

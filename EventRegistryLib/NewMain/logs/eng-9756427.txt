GBA primary market residential sales slowed in 1H 2024 compared to the same period last year, under the continuing global high interest rate environment. However, market sentiment strengthened following the introduction of supportive housing policies in May. The CRE investment market (large-sized deals at >RMB100 million) was primarily driven by state-owned enterprises and mainland investors.\n\nLooking ahead, the central government stated at the Third Plenary Session in July 2024 that municipal governments will be granted greater decision-making authority to regulate the real estate market. This is expected to bring greater momentum to the market, thereby supporting a recovery in residential transactions and price stabilization in 2H 2024. The central government stated at the Session that it will lift restrictions on the market, while also ensuring effective regulation, as well as leveraging the market's role by fostering a fairer environment for private enterprises and foreign companies to participate in economic and industry development. We can expect this to bring greater market vitality and to benefit the property market in the long run. In the investment market, we can anticipate that investors will continue to pay attention to the logistics sector, given the sector's strong demand and stable rental returns.\n\nGBA Residential Market\n\nThe GBA primary residential market recorded approximately 133,000 transactions in the 1H 2024 period. This performance was down 15% h-o-h and 40% y-o-y, in part due to the relatively high base of comparison from 1H 2023 amid the impetus of the border reopening. However, the central government's implementation of the \"517\" new housing policies in mid-May -- including the cancellation of the new home loan rate lower limit, lowering of the individual housing provident fund loan rates, and the adjustment of the minimum down- payment ratio -- helped to bolster sentiment in the market. In turn, primary residential transactions grew by 19% in June over the prior month to nearly 29,000 units, higher than the average monthly transaction volume in 2H 2023 and reflecting solid end-user demand in the GBA residential market.\n\nAlva To, Cushman & Wakefield's Vice President, Greater China & Head of Consulting, Greater China said, \"At the recent Third Plenary Session, the central government granted greater decision-making power to municipal governments to regulate the real estate market, and proposed a series of measures to boost the economy, including the intention to lift restrictions on the market while ensuring effective regulation and to relax different economic control measures. Coupled with the earlier implementation of the \"517\" supportive housing policy, we believe that GBA residential transaction volume will gradually expand in 2H 2024. We expect average monthly transaction numbers in 2H 2024 to reach around 28,000 to 30,000 units, potentially bringing the 2024 total annual first-hand residential transactions to 300,000 to 313,000 units, a drop of 17% to 20% y-o-y, with the decline front-loaded in 1H 2024.\n\n\"On the other hand, connectivity between GBA cities has been greatly strengthened given the ongoing improvement in the transportation network in recent years, including the high-speed rail, Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge and Shenzhen Zhongshan Passage. This will help drive more Hong Kong and Macao residents to buy properties in GBA cities. Housing price differences between Hong Kong and mainland cities also make GBA properties attractive to some Hong Kong people, especially for those who find Hong Kong purchase entry prices too high. Furthermore, the Chinese mainland has recently introduced guidelines to facilitate Hong Kong and Macao residents to take domestic mortgage loans for GBA properties, with RMB funds remitted for mortgage loan payments exempted from the remittance limit. As Hong Kong continues to integrate with the GBA, we expect to see increasing buying interest from Hong Kong residents, supporting a more stable outlook for the GBA residential market.\"\n\nAs for residential prices, although overall primary home prices are more swayed by the quality level of newly launched projects, first-hand residential prices in the nine GBA mainland cities rose and fell in a roughly 50-50 split in 1H 2024. For secondary home prices, using Shenzhen as an example, the Cushman & Wakefield Shenzhen mid-to-high-end secondary home price index fell by 1.9% in 1H 2024 (Chart 2). Looking ahead, we believe the central government's active relaxation of housing cooling measures, combined with the positive messages on the economy released in the Third Plenary Session, will help to support market sentiment and price stability in the GBA during 2H 2024.\n\nGBA CRE Investment Market\n\nOverall investment momentum in 1H 2024 slowed compared to last year in the face of continuing high global interest rates and foreign borrowing costs. The GBA CRE investment market (large-sized deals at >RMB 100 million) recorded 26 large transactions totaling RMB11.9 billion in the 1H period, accounting for about 17% of the overall Chinese mainland investment market (Chart 3). Of the 26 transactions, 23 were at less than the RMB1 billion mark, with some involving discounted deals. The GBA commercial property investment market continues to focus on the two mainland first-tier cities, Shenzhen and Guangzhou, recording total transactions of RMB6.3 billion and RMB5.6 billion respectively in 1H 2024.\n\nIn terms of buyer category, the GBA commercial real estate investment market is dominated by state-owned enterprises and domestic investors. Domestic capital accounted for 99% of the GBA CRE market transactions in 1H 2024, with overseas buyers and institutional investors remaining conservative (Chart 4). By property type, the office/R&D office sector continued to take the largest share of the market, accounting for more than 33% of the total transaction consideration, supported by attractive pricing and hence allowing end-users and capital-rich investors to bottom-fish. Mixed-used assets took a 30% share of total consideration and industrial/logistics properties 17%.\n\nCharli Chan, Cushman & Wakefield's Deputy Managing Director, Capital Markets, China commented, \"Looking to 2H 2024, of the different sectors, we believe that logistics assets are still the most attractive for growth potential. Taking Guangzhou, Foshan, Shenzhen and Dongguan as examples, the cap rate of logistics properties in these GBA cities is similar to that of Shanghai and Beijing, at the level of around 5%. However, logistics vacancy rates in Foshan, Guangzhou, Dongguan and Shenzhen stood at 1%, 4%, 7% and 8%, respectively, far lower than the 19% of Shanghai and Beijing. In fact, with the ongoing enhancement of transportation connectivity across GBA cities, coupled with growing warehousing demand from 3PLs driven by cross-border e-commerce expansion and increasing last-mile logistics activity in the South China region, the growth potential of the GBA logistics sector cannot be overlooked. As well, the new warehouse supply pipeline in Shenzhen and Guangzhou remains limited, and we can anticipate that future demand will spill over to surrounding areas such as Foshan and Dongguan. Hence, we believe that the GBA logistics sector will continue to attract investors' attention into the future.\"\n\nPlease click here to download photos.\n\nCaption:\n\nAlva To, Cushman & Wakefield's Vice President, Greater China & Head of Consulting, Greater China\uff08Left\uff09and Charli Chan, Cushman & Wakefield's Deputy Managing Director, Capital Markets, China\uff08Right).\n\nHashtag: #CushmanandWakefield\n\nThe issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.\n\nAbout Cushman & Wakefield\n\nCushman & Wakefield (NYSE: CWK) is a leading global commercial real estate services firm for property owners and occupiers with approximately 52,000 employees in nearly 400 offices and 60 countries.

We expect average monthly transaction numbers in 2H 2024 to reach around 28,000 to 30,000 units, potentially bringing the 2024 total annual first-hand residential transactions to 300,000 to 313,000 units, a drop of 17% to 20% y-o-y, with the decline front-loaded in 1H 2024.\n\n\"On the other hand, connectivity between GBA cities has been greatly strengthened given the ongoing improvement in the transportation network in recent years, including the high-speed rail, Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge and Shenzhen Zhongshan Passage. This will help drive more Hong Kong and Macao residents to buy properties in GBA cities. Housing price differences between Hong Kong and mainland cities also make GBA properties attractive to some Hong Kong people, especially for those who find Hong Kong purchase entry prices too high. Furthermore, the Chinese mainland has recently introduced guidelines to facilitate Hong Kong and Macao residents to take domestic mortgage loans for GBA properties, with RMB funds remitted for mortgage loan payments exempted from the remittance limit. As Hong Kong continues to integrate with the GBA, we expect to see increasing buying interest from Hong Kong residents, supporting a more stable outlook for the GBA residential market.\"\n\nAs for residential prices, although overall primary home prices are more swayed by the quality level of newly launched projects, first-hand residential prices in the nine GBA mainland cities rose and fell in a roughly 50-50 split in 1H 2024. For secondary home prices, using Shenzhen as an example, the Cushman & Wakefield Shenzhen mid-to-high-end secondary home price index fell by 1.9% in 1H 2024 (Chart 2). Looking ahead, we believe the central government's active relaxation of housing cooling measures, combined with the positive messages on the economy released in the Third Plenary Session, will help to support market sentiment and price stability in the GBA during 2H 2024.\n\nGBA CRE Investment Market\n\nOverall investment momentum in 1H 2024 slowed compared to last year in the face of continuing high global interest rates and foreign borrowing costs. The GBA CRE investment market (large-sized deals at >RMB 100 million) recorded 26 large transactions totaling RMB11.9 billion in the 1H period, accounting for about 17% of the overall Chinese mainland investment market (Chart 3). Of the 26 transactions, 23 were at less than the RMB1 billion mark, with some involving discounted deals. The GBA commercial property investment market continues to focus on the two mainland first-tier cities, Shenzhen and Guangzhou, recording total transactions of RMB6.3 billion and RMB5.6 billion respectively in 1H 2024.\n\nIn terms of buyer category, the GBA commercial real estate investment market is dominated by state-owned enterprises and domestic investors. Domestic capital accounted for 99% of the GBA CRE market transactions in 1H 2024, with overseas buyers and institutional investors remaining conservative (Chart 4). By property type, the office/R&D office sector continued to take the largest share of the market, accounting for more than 33% of the total transaction consideration, supported by attractive pricing and hence allowing end-users and capital-rich investors to bottom-fish. Mixed-used assets took a 30% share of total consideration and industrial/logistics properties 17%.\n\nCharli Chan, Cushman & Wakefield's Deputy Managing Director, Capital Markets, China commented, \"Looking to 2H 2024, of the different sectors, we believe that logistics assets are still the most attractive for growth potential. Taking Guangzhou, Foshan, Shenzhen and Dongguan as examples, the cap rate of logistics properties in these GBA cities is similar to that of Shanghai and Beijing, at the level of around 5%. However, logistics vacancy rates in Foshan, Guangzhou, Dongguan and Shenzhen stood at 1%, 4%, 7% and 8%, respectively, far lower than the 19% of Shanghai and Beijing. In fact, with the ongoing enhancement of transportation connectivity across GBA cities, coupled with growing warehousing demand from 3PLs driven by cross-border e-commerce expansion and increasing last-mile logistics activity in the South China region, the growth potential of the GBA logistics sector cannot be overlooked. As well, the new warehouse supply pipeline in Shenzhen and Guangzhou remains limited, and we can anticipate that future demand will spill over to surrounding areas such as Foshan and Dongguan. Hence, we believe that the GBA logistics sector will continue to attract investors' attention into the future.\"\n\nPlease\n\nclick here to download photos.\n\nCaption:\n\nAlva To, Cushman &

GBA primary market residential sales slowed in 1H 2024 compared to the same period last year, under the continuing global high interest rate environment. However, market sentiment strengthened following the introduction of supportive housing policies in May. The CRE investment market (large-sized deals at >RMB100 million) was primarily driven by state-owned enterprises and mainland investors.\n\nLooking ahead, the central government stated at the Third Plenary Session in July 2024 that municipal governments will be granted greater decision-making authority to regulate the real estate market. This is expected to bring greater momentum to the market, thereby supporting a recovery in residential transactions and price stabilization in 2H 2024. The central government stated at the Session that it will lift restrictions on the market, while also ensuring effective regulation, as well as leveraging the market's role by fostering a fairer environment for private enterprises and foreign companies to participate in economic and industry development. We can expect this to bring greater market vitality and to benefit the property market in the long run. In the investment market, we can anticipate that investors will continue to pay attention to the logistics sector, given the sector's strong demand and stable rental returns.\n\nGBA Residential Market\n\nThe GBA primary residential market recorded approximately 133,000 transactions in the 1H 2024 period. This performance was down 15% h-o-h and 40% y-o-y, in part due to the relatively high base of comparison from 1H 2023 amid the impetus of the border reopening. However, the central government's implementation of the \"517\" new housing policies in mid-May -- including the cancellation of the new home loan rate lower limit, lowering of the individual housing provident fund loan rates, and the adjustment of the minimum down- payment ratio -- helped to bolster sentiment in the market. In turn, primary residential transactions grew by 19% in June over the prior month to nearly 29,000 units, higher than the average monthly transaction volume in 2H 2023 and reflecting solid end-user demand in the GBA residential market.\n\nAlva To, Cushman & Wakefield's Vice President, Greater China & Head of Consulting, Greater China said, \"At the recent Third Plenary Session, the central government granted greater decision-making power to municipal governments to regulate the real estate market, and proposed a series of measures to boost the economy, including the intention to lift restrictions on the market while ensuring effective regulation and to relax different economic control measures.

We expect average monthly transaction numbers in 2H 2024 to reach around 28,000 to 30,000 units, potentially bringing the 2024 total annual first-hand residential transactions to 300,000 to 313,000 units, a drop of 17% to 20% y-o-y, with the decline front-loaded in 1H 2024.\n\n\"On the other hand, connectivity between GBA cities has been greatly strengthened given the ongoing improvement in the transportation network in recent years, including the high-speed rail, Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge and Shenzhen Zhongshan Passage.

At present, the GBA has entered a new phase of accelerated development with greater breadth and depth. The development of the GBA is set to bring more room for the development of Hong Kong professional services. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government will adopt a more in-depth approach and focus on exploring how talents and enterprises of different industries, including the legal profession, can capitalise on the significant opportunities brought about by the GBA, and at the same time help promote the high-quality development of the GBA.\n\nMs Chan added that under \"one country, two systems\", Hong Kong is the only common law jurisdiction within the country and a leading centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region, and has been well-trusted by international business communities and investors. In April this year, the Department of Justice (DoJ) released for the first time the \"Action Plan on the Construction of Rule of Law in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area\", which sets forth the guiding principle of \"Three Interfaces, Two Connects and One GBA\", promoting the interfaces of mechanisms, regulatory frameworks and talents, thereby enabling the GBA to capitalise on its unique strengths under \"one country, two systems and three jurisdictions\". Hong Kong's legal profession can play a crucial role in the high-quality development of the GBA.\n\nAt today's seminar, leaders from the Justice Bureau, Nansha District of Guangzhou, and the Qianhai Authority of Shenzhen were invited as guests to introduce the facilitation policies and measures for the legal services industry in Nansha and Qianhai respectively. During the panel discussion, a number of legal professionals from Hong Kong and Guangzhou shared their views on the unique advantages enjoyed by Hong Kong's legal professionals in GBA development, the demand for Hong Kong's legal services by Mainland enterprises, as well as the strategies for developing business in the GBA.\n\nThe \"GoGBA Sector Series\" is a joint initiative of the GBA Office and HKTDC, which aims to provide more specific, in-depth and targeted information and support to the industry. In addition to keynote speeches and panel discussions, small group advisory workshops and one-on-one consultation services were also arranged at the seminar, where experts answered questions and offered advice on the development of the Hong Kong's legal profession in the Mainland cities of the GBA. Furthermore, the DoJ and HKTDC will jointly organise a trade mission to visit Shenzhen and Foshan from August 6 to 8, to learn about the latest development of the legal profession in the GBA, and to promote further exchanges as well as mutual co-operation.\n\nFor more information about the GBA, please visit the dedicated website (www.bayarea.gov.hk/en), which also covers the content of the Greater Bay Area Information Station (www.bayarea.gov.hk/gbais/en) for easy browsing by members of the public.", "source": {"uri": "government-world.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Government World Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hksar_gov@government-world.com", "name": "Hksar Gov", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong\u2013Hong_Kong\u2013Macao_Greater_Bay_Area", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Guangdong\u2013Hong Kong\u2013Macao Greater Bay Area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Trade_Development_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong Trade Development Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Game Boy Advance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Macau"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Macau"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Central_Committee_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "20th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_country,_two_systems", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "One country, two systems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mainland China"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nansha_District", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nansha District"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nansha District"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qianhai", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qianhai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Hong_Kong", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Hong Kong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Common law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asia-Pacific"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guangzhou"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guangzhou"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foshan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foshan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Foshan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shenzhen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shenzhen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Indoor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Indoor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202407/23/P2024072300665_photo_1277911.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9756427", "eventUri": "eng-9756427", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "dateEnd": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 3763, "textEnd": 3776}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 265, "textEnd": 272}], "sentiment": 0.6000000000000001, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Recent developments have pointed to a robust recovery in residential sales, particularly following the easing of market cooling measures and the implementation of supportive housing policies earlier this year.\n\nAccording to Yicai Global, the increased willingness of Hong Kong and Macau residents to buy properties in the GBA has been notably influenced by policy adjustments in cities like Guangzhou, which recently relaxed home-buying restrictions.\n\nReal estate developers report a surge in visits and sales, especially after local incentives were introduced, including a notable discount offered by New World China to Hong Kong residents, which resulted in significant immediate interest.\n\nThe policy changes in Guangzhou, which came into effect on July 5, now allow residents from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and overseas to purchase one property up to 120 square meters in restricted areas, with no limit on size or number of properties in other areas. This easing of restrictions is part of a broader move to make the GBA more accessible and attractive to potential buyers from these regions, who frequently travel and work across these cities due to their proximity and economic ties.\n\nThe Dow Jones Institutional News reported that these policy relaxations are part of the \"517\" policy introduced by the central government, which has spurred not just residential but also commercial real estate activity across the GBA. The policy includes measures such as the elimination of the new home loan rate lower limit and adjustments to the down-payment ratios, which have collectively boosted market sentiment.\n\nInvestment in the GBA's real estate market reached RMB 11.9 billion in the first half of 2024, showcasing the area's appeal not just for residential but also commercial investors, particularly in logistics due to strong demand and potential for capital appreciation. The GBA's investment market in the first six months of 2024 was predominantly driven by state-owned enterprises and private investors, indicating robust confidence in the region's growth prospects.\n\nConnectivity enhancements, such as the opening of new mega bridges like the Shenzhen-Zhongshan Link and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, have also played a crucial role in increasing the attractiveness of the GBA for Hong Kong and Macau residents. These infrastructure developments have made commuting and integration across the region smoother, encouraging more residents from the SARs to consider the GBA as a viable location for second homes or investment properties.", "source": {"uri": "macaudailytimes.com.mo", "dataType": "news", "title": "Macau Daily Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Macau"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Macau"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Guangzhou"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guangzhou"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Bay Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real estate development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New World"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_administrative_regions_of_China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Special administrative regions of China"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-owned_enterprise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State-owned enterprise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong\u2013Zhuhai\u2013Macau_Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong\u2013Zhuhai\u2013Macau Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renminbi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renminbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commuting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commuting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Commercial", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Commercial", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/macaudailytimes.com.mo/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2-ontheagenda.jpg?fit=670%2C443&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9756427", "eventUri": "eng-9756427", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-05", "textStart": 1002, "textEnd": 1008}], "sentiment": 0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

This could push total new home sales to up to 313,000 units this year, although that would be 20 percent lower than last year.\n\nThe third plenary session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which concluded last Thursday, stated that municipal governments will be granted greater decision making authority to regulate the real estate market.\n\nTo noted that a growing number of Hong Kong and Macao residents are contemplating buying properties on the mainland as the transportation network improves. Infrastructure projects, including the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge and the Shenzhen-Zhongshan Link, have enhanced connectivity in the region.\n\n\"Housing price differences between Hong Kong and mainland cities also make GBA properties attractive to some Hong Kong people, especially those who find Hong Kong purchase entry prices too high,\" he said.\n\nREAD MORE: HK needs to tackle its own problems with sweeping reforms\n\n\"As Hong Kong continues to integrate with (other cities) in the Bay Area, we expect to see increasing buying interest from Hong Kong residents, supporting a more stable outlook for the Bay Area residential market.\"\n\nInvestment in commercial property in the Bay Area, meanwhile, softened in the first half compared with a year earlier as high interest rates dampened sentiment. The market recorded 26 large transactions in the first six months, totaling 11.9 billion yuan ($1.6 billion). That accounted for roughly 17 percent of the overall investment market on the Chinese mainland.\n\nThe firm forecasts that logistics assets will be the \"most attractive\" type of real estate in terms of growth potential, as enhancement of regional transportation connectivity fuels the logistics sector and drives warehousing demand.", "source": {"uri": "chinadailyasia.com", "dataType": "news",

GBA is intended to facilitate capacity-building exercises, technical support for national programs, policy lessons-sharing, technology advancements, and implementation of internationally recognized standards & codes through participation of a wide spectrum of stakeholders. Since launch, GBA has garnered enormous support globally as its current membership has expanded to 24 members countries and 12 International Organizations with a trajectory of on-going growth. Till date, three meetings of the Temporary Executive Committee (TEC) of the GBA, i.e. a committee of member countries responsible for proposing the establishment of the GBA, have been held. During the TEC meetings, the immediate initiatives of GBA have also been defined including Biofuels Workshop series and Biofuels Country Landscapes (Policy Framework).\n\nGBA has also significantly enhanced its presence on the global pedestal by representation at international forums such as COP28 (Dubai), World Economic Forum (Switzerland), India Energy Week 2024 and World Biogas Summit 2024 (UK). GBA was also invited as an International Organization to the Energy Transitions Working Group (ETWG) meeting under the G20 presidency of Brazil and at International Forum on Sustainable Biofuels under the Italian G7 Presidency.\n\nGBA aims at, inter alia, providing additional opportunities to Indian industries by positioning India as a knowledge base and as a production hub for biofuels including

However, a meaningful recovery in prices will take time amid economic headwinds, property consultancy Cushman & Wakefield said on Tuesday.\n\nTotal transactions for new houses in the bay area numbered 28,584 in June, nearly 20 per cent more than in May, driven by a boost in demand that followed an unprecedented package of government easing measures. The year-on-year decline narrowed to 8.5 per cent in June from 35 per cent in May.\n\nThe Greater Bay Area (GBA) is the government blueprint encompassing Hong Kong, Macau and nine mainland cities in Guangdong, which China aims to develop into an enormous economic and business hub.\n\nCushman expects some 180,000 new homes to change hands in the second half of the year, up from 133,000 in the first six months. This would further narrow the annualised decline to 20 per cent over the period and take transactions for the whole of 2024 to around 310,000.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the GBA residential transaction volume will gradually expand in the second half of the year,\u201d said Alva To, vice-president for Greater China at Cushman & Wakefield.\n\nHe credited Beijing\u2019s ambitious rescue package launched in May that included a 300 billion yuan relending facility to clear excess inventory, as well as positive messages about further market reforms that emerged from this month\u2019s third plenum, a meeting of the Central Committee of the ruling Communist Party that laid out China\u2019s economic road map for the medium term.\n\nThe primary home market for the bay area recorded 132,833 transactions in the first half of 2024, down 15 per cent from the second half of 2023. That figure was also 40 per cent lower than the same period last year, having been dragged down by slow demand stemming from economic headwinds, according to Cushman.\n\nGuangzhou, the provincial capital of Guangdong, saw 30,000 new residential units sold in the first half of the year, an 8.7 per cent decline when compared with the second half of last year. Shenzhen, dubbed China\u2019s Silicon Valley, saw new home sales fall 12.7 per cent to 15,299 units in the same period.\n\nBoth cities witnessed a strong rebound in transactions last month, having eased home-purchasing restrictions and lowered mortgage rates to lure buyers late in May.\n\nHome transactions in Guangzhou\u2019s primary market reached 7,623 in June, the most in a year, while more than 10,000 second-hand homes found buyers, a surge of 33 per cent from May. In Shenzhen, the second-hand market saw 5,309 units change hands, the most in more than three years, according to data compiled by Centaline Property.\n\n\u201cThe worst time for the residential property market is over,\u201d said To. \u201cPrices are expected to stabilise gradually in the future with the recovery in demand, though the pace will be slow.\u201d\n\nThe launch of the Shenzhen-Zhongshan link is another favourable factor bolstering home sales in the bay area. The newly constructed bridge-tunnel reduces the travel time within the zone, encouraging buyers from Hong Kong and other major cities to purchase houses in Zhongshan.\n\nThis has made the Zhongshan home market resilient. While other cities in the bay area have felt the effects of the depressed market \u2013 Zhuhai, for example, saw a 21.3 per cent drop in average house prices in the first six months, the prices of Zhongshan houses have increased by 2.5 per cent compared with the end of 2023.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong\u2013Hong_Kong\u2013Macao_Greater_Bay_Area", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Guangdong\u2013Hong Kong\u2013Macao Greater Bay Area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cushman_&_Wakefield", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cushman & Wakefield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guangdong"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guangdong"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Macau"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Macau"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Committee_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_economic_reform", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chinese economic reform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renminbi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renminbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greater China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shenzhen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shenzhen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuhai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zhuhai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Zhuhai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhongshan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zhongshan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Zhongshan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guangzhou"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guangzhou"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2024/07/03/clean-thumb.jpg?itok=irXZseAa", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9756427", "eventUri": "eng-9756427", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

According to the proposed (GBA) bill presented on Monday, Bengaluru could be divided into up to 10 corporations, although the exact number is yet to be finalised.\n\nThe bill proposes that for every one million residents, one city municipal council can be formed, encompassing between 50 and 200 wards. Given a population density of 5,000 people per sq km, each council could cover an area of up to 200 sq km. The current jurisdiction of BBMP is 708 sq km, but the proposed GBA jurisdiction will expand to approximately 1,400 sq km. This expansion will include highly developed areas like Electronic City.\n\n3-tier administration\n\nThe State Government plans to implement a three-tier administrative system for the city, consisting of the Greater Bengaluru Authority (GBA), , and . This new structure will include roles such as the Mayor, Commissioners, Joint Commissioners, Standing Committee, Zonal Committee, Ward Committee, and Area Sabha. The GBA will oversee major , including flyovers, express elevated roads, arterial and sub-arterial road construction and maintenance, rainwater drainage systems, drinking water supply, and sewage systems. Additionally, the authority will have the power to determine property tax rates, announce rebates, and recommend new taxes to the government. Most administrative powers will be centralised within the GBA.\n\nCM to head GBA\n\nThe GBA will be chaired by the Chief Minister, with the Minister and the Bangalore Development Minister serving as Vice Chairpersons. The Chief Secretary of the GBA will act as the Member Secretary. The authority will also include key officials such as the Home Minister, Urban Development Minister, Transport Minister, Energy Minister, and MLAs from the Greater Bangalore area. Additional members will comprise the Mayors of municipal corporations, two nominated members from each , the BDA Commissioner, BWSSB Chairman, BMTC MD, BMRCL MD, Bescom MD, Bangalore City Police Commissioner, Bangalore Solid Waste Management Director, GBA's Chief , Principal Chief Engineer, and Directors of Fire and Emergency Services.\n\nBDA wings to be clipped\n\nAfter the formation of the GBA, the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) will no longer have the authority to approve land use and development maps; it will solely focus on project implementation. The GBA will be responsible for deciding the allocation of funds released by the state government to various municipalities. The bill establishing the GBA was drafted based on a report submitted in July by a committee led by BS Patil, the former Chief Secretary of the government. The committee, formed to reform the Greater Bangalore Municipal Corporation, included retired IAS officer Siddaiah and urban expert V Ravichandar. Their report served as the foundation for the bill. The GBA will encompass several key entities, including the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB), Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (Bescom), BDA, and the Metro among other city-related departments. These entities will function under the umbrella of the Joint Bengaluru Authority (JBA).\n\n5-year Mayoral term\n\nCurrently, the term of the Mayor for the BBMP is one year, and many have complained that it is insufficient. The new corporations proposed under the GBA will extend the Mayor's term to five years. Under the GBA, the city council formed after the municipal election will elect the Mayor and Deputy Mayor in their first meeting, with both officials serving a five-year term. Additionally, each city council will establish six standing committees: the Administration, Education, and Social Justice Standing Committee; the Taxation, Revenue, and Accounts Standing Committee; the Public Works and Engineering Standing Committee; the Public Health and Natural Disaster Management Standing Committee; the Forest, Environment, Lakes, and Horticulture Standing Committee; and the Urban Planning and Infrastructure Standing Committee. Each committee will consist of five members, who will be elected by the councilors.\n\n*******************************************************************************\n\nSeparate security force\n\nThe bill proposes the creation of a dedicated security force for GBA. This force will be tasked with safeguarding municipal assets, preventing revenue loss, and addressing bylaw violations. The GBA will hold quarterly meetings chaired by either the Chief Minister or the Minister responsible. Additionally, the bill suggests establishing a distinct executive committee to carry out the decisions made during these meetings.\n\nThis committee will be led by the Minister for Bengaluru Development or a Minister appointed by the Chief Minister, with the Chief Executive serving as the member secretary.\n\n5 or 10 corporations?\n\nThe BBMP restructuring report, submitted five years ago, recommended the formation of five councils and 400 ward divisions. This proposal was approved by the government. To implement these recommendations, a bill needs to be drafted. According to Clause 1 of the bill, up to 10 councils could be established. However, the government has decided to proceed with the formation of only five councils, as advised by the committee members.\n\nChief Commissioner for GBA\n\nUnlike the current setup with a Chief Commissioner for BBMP, the bill proposes the establishment of a Chief Commissioner for the GBA. This Chief Commissioner will be an officer no lower than the rank of Additional Chief Secretary to the Government, with a tenure of three years.\n\nThe Chief Commissioner will serve as the principal executive officer of the GBA, overseeing its supervision and control.

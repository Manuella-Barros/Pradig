He mentioned that the NADDC is in advanced discussions with both local and international financial institutions to address this issue.\n\n\"We are exploring various funding options, not only with the Development Bank but also with other potential sources, including international partners,\" Osanipin stated. \"We are discussing ways to secure funds specifically for the auto industry.\"\n\nRegarding the magnitude of the funding required, Osanipin indicated that the sector needs between $1 trillion and $5 trillion. He emphasized that banks and partners are showing interest in the funding proposals.\n\n\"We are not investors; our role is to initiate the process. For the sector to achieve its growth potential, an estimated $1 trillion in funding is necessary, though it can be distributed over time,\" he explained. \"Initially, we can allocate around $1 billion.\n\n\" These discussions are already underway with our funding partners. This funding is intended for industry players like Innoson, PAN in Kaduna, and JAC. For instance, Innoson might need several million dollars to advance to the next level. These auto firms require substantial funding, and we are working to facilitate that.\"\n\nOsanipin also outlined the Council's plans for the accreditation and certification of workshops converting vehicles to Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). He stated that the Council would use the National Occupational Standard (NOS) to train Nigerians for this purpose.\n\n\"The first step in promoting CNG is ensuring the availability of CNG vehicles, which is why we developed NOS and obtained NABTEB certification approvals. We will use this curriculum to train Nigerian engineers,\" he said.\n\nHe further explained the accreditation process for workshops: \"Workshops can apply for accreditation through our website, detailing their facilities and personnel. To certify the personnel, they must demonstrate capability and have undergone training using our curriculum.

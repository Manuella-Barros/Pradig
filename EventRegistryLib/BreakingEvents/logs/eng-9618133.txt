I think we have a lot of work to do, we have a lot more Championships to win together.\"\n\nPerez has been with the team since Red Bull picked him up for 2021 when it was forced to drop Alex Albon after he failed to get close enough to Verstappen. Perez has assisted Verstappen to three consecutive drivers' titles and contributed to the last two Red Bull constructors' championship wins.\n\nVerstappen has a contract until the end of 2028 but there's been rumours of discontent with the team ever since controversy surrounding Horner kicked off earlier this year.\n\nAs for Sainz, his 2025 options now appear to be picking between two back-of-the-grid teams, with Red Bull sticking with Perez and Mercedes still set on promoting its protege Kimi Antonelli.\n\nIt's either the future Audi works team Sauber or Williams for 2025. Alpine has a vacancy following news of Esteban Ocon's exit at the end of the year, but a return to Enstone, where Sainz raced when it was Renault for just over a year, doesn't appear to be a realistic option.", "source": {"uri": "the-race.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Race"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_suttill@the-race.com", "name": "Josh Suttill", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Horner", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christian Horner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Tsunoda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yuki Tsunoda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Ricciardo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Honda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Powertrains", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull Powertrains"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_F1_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alpine F1 Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Albon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Albon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauber_Motorsport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sauber Motorsport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esteban_Ocon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Esteban Ocon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz in Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Audi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renault"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.the-race.com/content/images/size/w1200/2024/06/XPB_1279462_HiRes.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618133", "eventUri": "eng-9618133", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

But the Perez-Verstappen combination is one that has ultimately secured five of the last six world championships on offer, and is on course to add another two to that tally this year.\n\nDespite coming under increasing pressure from their F1 rivals of late, Red Bull see no reason to make a change.\n\nRed Bull's decision to offer Perez a new deal means another door has slammed shut for Carlos Sainz, who is on the hunt for a drive after losing his Ferrari seat to Lewis Hamilton.\n\nSainz, a former Red Bull junior, had been linked with Red Bull as a possible replacement for Perez, with Horner even going as far as to admit that he was in contention.\n\nHowever, a Red Bull seat continues to elude the Spaniard, who will now have to consider his options and make a big decision about his own future.\n\nSainz was believed to be waiting on Red Bull to make a call about their driver line-up for 2025 before committing to another project, having been heavily linked to the likes of Sauber/Audi and Williams.\n\nOne of those two teams now looks like the most likely landing spot for Sainz, with Mercedes seemingly favouring the idea of promoting their highly-rated teenage prodigy Andrea Kimi Antonelli from Formula 2.\n\nAs well as Sainz, Daniel Ricciardo and Yuki Tsunoda have also been overlooked.\n\nThe pair drive for Red Bull's sister team RB and have both been mooted as options to replace Perez at some point or another.\n\nIndeed, Ricciardo had been touted as Red Bull's first choice open to take Perez's seat if the latter did not perform this year, but the Australian's own displays in 2024 have damaged any dreams he may have harboured of making a fairytale return to the senior team.\n\nIt will be a bitter pill for teammate Tsunoda to swallow. The 24-year-old Japanese racer has been in fantastic form this season and has finally found the consistency and maturity he was lacking at the start of his F1 career.\n\nTsunoda has held the upper hand over Ricciardo so far this year and can feel somewhat hard done by to not even find himself considered for a Red Bull F1 seat in 2025.\n\nWith no route to the senior team - on paper, at least - until 2027 at the earliest, might Tsunoda now consider alternative options away from the Red Bull family?\n\nPerez's contract extension could be seen as an attempt to keep Verstappen - and his influential camp - happy.\n\nDespite being contracted to Red Bull until 2028 and repeatedly insisting that he has no desire or intention to leave, speculation has continued to swirl about Verstappen's future amid public courting from Mercedes.\n\nVerstappen gets on with Perez well and knows he has the beating of him. With the right car underneath him, Verstappen is a sure-fire bet to win the championship both this year and in 2025. As time has gone on, Perez seems to have accepted his place as Verstappen's rear-gunner.\n\nSo why would Red Bull risk potentially destabilising that harmony by bringing in an unknown quantity alongside Verstappen? A highly-motivated Sainz would arrive with a point to prove, as would young, ambitious prospects such as Lando Norris or Oscar Piastri.\n\nRed Bull know exactly what they have with Verstappen and Perez so a driver change now would represent too much of an unnecessary risk that they simply don't need to take.", "source": {"uri": "crash.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crash"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lewis_larkam@crash.net", "name": "Lewis Larkam", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Horner", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christian Horner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Ricciardo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Kimi_Antonelli", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrea Kimi Antonelli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauber_Motorsport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sauber Motorsport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Junior_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull Junior Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIA_Formula_2_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIA Formula 2 Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz in Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Audi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Piastri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Tsunoda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yuki Tsunoda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull Racing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Alcoholic_Beverages", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Alcoholic Beverages", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Walking", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Walking", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Rodeo", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Rodeo", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.crash.net/styles/xl/s3/2024-06/SI202404210294_hires_jpeg_24bit_rgb.jpg?itok=dh1qoqA6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618133", "eventUri": "eng-9618133", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

We have a great challenge this year and I have full trust in the whole team that the future is bright here and I am excited to be part of it.\"\n\nVerstappen's Red Bull contract runs to the end of the 2028 season, although speculation lingers that the triple world champion could yet leave at some point before then with Mercedes' Toto Wolff making public his serious interest in signing the Dutchman to replace the Ferrari-bound Lewis Hamilton.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports F1 at the recent Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, Verstappen said: \"It's like I say - I'm good, I'm relaxed, I'm happy and my contract is until 2028.\"\n\nAlthough it had become increasingly clear in recent weeks that Perez was edging towards a contract renewal for 2025, the announcement of a two-year term nonetheless represents something of a surprise.\n\nIt means Perez will also stay on for the first year of F1's new big regulation change, when Red Bull are developing their own engine for the first time.\n\nWith Red Bull's 2024 car again proving dominant in the early races of this year, Perez had started this season brightly and finished second to Verstappen in three of this season's first four grands prix.\n\nBut, with Ferrari and McLaren in particular having closed the gap on Red Bull since then, Perez has failed to finish on the podium in the last three races - and failed to qualify in the top 10 at the last two.\n\nAfter dropping out of Q1 last time out in Monaco, Perez was involved in a huge crash on the first lap of the race after contact with Kevin Magnussen's Haas.\n\nPerez has slipped out of the top four of the Verstappen-led Drivers' Championship behind the Ferrari drivers and McLaren's Lando Norris\n\nHorner referenced the Mexican's recent dip in form in Red Bull's statement confirming the extended deal, although backed Perez to hit back.\n\n\"Checo has had a strong start to 2024 with second places in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Japan and then his podium in China,\" added Horner.\n\n\"The past few races have been tough, there is convergence on the grid, but we are confident in Checo and look forward to his return to proven form and performance, that we so often see.\"\n\nPerez added: \"We have a great challenge this year and I have full trust in the whole team that the future is bright here and I am excited to be part of it.\n\n\"I want to thank everyone for all the trust they are putting in me, it is a lot and I want to pay it back with excellent results on track, and off track. I think we have a lot of work to do, we have a lot more championships to win together.\"\n\nAlthough Verstappen has been absolutely dominant in the team-mate head-to-head - Perez last out-qualified the Dutchman 26 races ago, at the 2023 Miami GP - Red Bull have been pleased with the generally harmonious intra-team dynamic between the two drivers during a period of stunning success at the team.\n\nPerez famously played a key role in the 2021 title-deciding Abu Dhabi, holding up race leader Hamilton mid-way through the race, before the controversial Safety Car conclusion that ultimately swung the title Verstappen's way.\n\nHe finished fourth in the Drivers' Championship in his debut season at the team, improving to third in 2022. He then finished runner-up to to Verstappen in 2023 despite a mid-season nosedive in form that briefly appeared to call his immediate future at the team into question and, at the very least, ramp up the pressure for a 2025 contract renewal.\n\nSainz, who has lost his Ferrari seat to Hamilton, had appeared in the running for a return to the Red Bull stable after a strong start to the season but their decision to stick with Perez appears to have distilled the Spaniard's 2025 decision into a straight call between Williams and Sauber, who are morphing into Audi for 2026.\n\nAfter making his own return to the Red Bull fold last year, initially as a third driver before taking over a race seat at RB, Ricciardo had described it as his \"dream\" to return to the senior outfit he left on his own accord in 2018.\n\nHowever, Ricciardo's candidature to replace Perez has been undone by the form of RB team-mate Yuki Tsunoda, who has outperformed the experienced Australian so far.\n\nDespite that form, Tsunoda himself has never been thought to be in the running for the main Red Bull team as an alternative to Perez. Nonetheless, the in-form Japanese driver, who has scored 19 of RB's 24 points this season, has been linked with possible moves to other teams.\n\nNine seats remain unfilled on the 20-car 2025 grid. Esteban Ocon's end-of-season exit from Alpine was announced on Monday.", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But perhaps it should be, given the Mexican's performances alongside Max Verstappen.\n\nA case could be made for it being the wrong move for Red Bull and, indeed, Formula 1, so let's make it.\n\nAny neutral fan wants the top seats to be taken by the best drivers. It stands to reason you'd want to have as much competition at the front as possible. And from a team's point of view, you normally want to score as heavily with both cars as possible. Constructors' championship points mean, quite literally, prizes.\n\nRed Bull has had a dominant enough car that it hasn't had to worry about this since the ground effect rules arrived in 2022. Famously, Verstappen would have won the constructors' crown last year on his own.\n\nBut recent evidence suggests the field is catching up - Ferrari is just 24 points behind in the constructors' standings - and Red Bull might not have that luxury in future. Given the high quality of everything else Red Bull does, it seems a little strange to have that chink in its armour.\n\nFor those feeling we're being harsh on Perez, a popular figure who earned a chance in a frontrunning team after years of performing strongly in the midfield, let's look at some of the facts.\n\nFirstly, on the supertimes matrix, Perez is the worst-performing driver compared to his team-mate in 2024 apart from Logan Sargeant at Williams.\n\nSupertimes are based on the fastest single lap by each driver at each race weekend, expressed as a percentage of the fastest single lap overall (100.000%) and averaged over the season. In other words, it's a measure of raw pace:\n\nSome will argue that Verstappen is a tough benchmark and, seeing as the Dutchman is already becoming one of F1's greats, that's true. But this overlooks two things.\n\nThe first is that top teams tend to employ top drivers; you're always going to come up against the best at the front and Perez is not alone in having a tough colleague.\n\nThe other is that no driver, however brilliant, can take a car faster around a circuit than it can go. The very best might get to 99% but they can't defy physics; the job of the very good driver against a great one is to get as close as possible.\n\nPerez's gap to Verstappen on raw speed has also been pretty consistent. This isn't about one of the much-discussed 'Perez off his game' moments. In 2021 he was 0.7% behind on average across the season, in 2022 0.545% and in 2023 0.761%. These are big gaps in a modern F1 context.\n\nFor comparison, Valtteri Bottas was 0.116% behind Lewis Hamilton across their five seasons together, while in 2018 Daniel Ricciardo was 0.138% behind Verstappen. Alex Albon, a far less experienced F1 driver than Perez, was 0.784% behind Verstappen in 2020 and he lost his Red Bull drive...\n\nPerez scored 48% of Verstappen's total in 2021, a year when Red Bull arguably had a marginally better car than Mercedes and won the drivers' championship but lost the constructors' crown\n\nYou could argue that raw speed isn't Perez's greatest strength, that he's better at the races. But even there he can rarely get close to an unhindered Verstappen, who has proved better at maintaining tyre life while lapping quickly, something that was previously considered a Perez strength.\n\nAt the start of 2022, we took on the challenge of finding the best number two drivers in F1 history. During the course of that research, we picked out three classes of team-mates based on the percentage of their number one's points score.\n\nIf a driver scored 80% or more of their team leader, that tended to mean a team actually had two equal number ones or at least a 'number 1.5' close enough to give the lead driver a headache.\n\nAs fans, this is the sort of combination we most want to see, but it can be problematic for teams, as most famously seen with Nigel Mansell and Nelson Piquet at Williams, and Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost at McLaren.\n\nDrivers scoring 55-79% tend to be ideal as useful number two drivers for a leading team. Think Bottas or Rubens Barrichello.\n\nThose managing 55% or less are not doing enough, unreliability and misfortune aside, and can cost a team a constructors' title.\n\nPerez scored 48% of Verstappen's total in 2021, a year when Red Bull arguably had a marginally better car than Mercedes and won the drivers' championship but lost the constructors' crown. Bottas scored 58% of Hamilton's total, which made the difference.\n\nPerez improved to 67% in 2022, fell to 50% against an admittedly remarkable score from Verstappen last year, and is currently on 63%. Across their time together at Red Bull, Perez has racked up 887 points compared to Verstappen's 1593.5. That's just under 56%, perilously close to dropping into the danger zone.\n\nIn a wider context, F1 also needs as many competitive drivers at the front as it can get. That was this writer's frustration during Kimi Raikkonen's second stint at Ferrari, where he was consistently the sixth-best performer across the top three teams. Charles Leclerc almost immediately showed that Sebastian Vettel wasn't unbeatable at Ferrari when he arrived in 2019.\n\nWhen one team is dominating, as Red Bull has for the past two years, it makes a big difference if the two drivers in the best car are evenly matched. McLaren's domination in the late-1980s was still fascinating thanks to the duel between Senna and Prost, while Nico Rosberg was close enough to Hamilton across 2014-16 to at least mean that the result of each race wasn't a foregone conclusion. The gap between the two Red Bulls since the start of 2022 has undoubtedly made F1 less exciting.\n\nNone of that is Red Bull's concern, of course. But what it should be concerned about is making sure it has all bases covered and its second seat has been a problem since Ricciardo left at the end of 2018.\n\nRed Bull's junior programme, which has done so much for motorsport, hasn't quite produced a suitable replacement, though it's probably fair to say Pierre Gasly and Albon have become more complete performers since they left the senior team.\n\nThis isn't to say Perez shouldn't be an F1 driver. Indeed, his knowledge of Red Bull and experience as a six-time race winner in his 265 starts could be invaluable to one of the teams further down the grid, but we've now seen enough to know he's not quite a topliner.\n\nSo, who should Red Bull have gone for? For a team with the money and dynamism it has shown in the past, it's surprising it hasn't made more of an effort to go and get another big name, such as Verstappen's mate Lando Norris. Or gone for Carlos Sainz, the best driver currently available.\n\nThere are even some left-field options, such as Yuki Tsunoda, given his fine performances against RB team-mate Ricciardo, or Esteban Ocon, though he has an even more tumultuous past with Verstappen than Sainz.\n\nKeeping Verstappen happy is, of course, a primary concern. Red Bull knows that, even if it produces a merely competitive car, Verstappen will have it at or near the front, which might be important in a post-Adrian Newey/post-Honda era.\n\nRed Bull is clearly banking on keeping Verstappen despite all the recent turmoil, but even that might not be enough to ensure lucrative constructors' championship successes\n\nBut it could be in real trouble if he decides to go elsewhere. Could Perez really lead the team?\n\nGiven the fact he failed to finish second in the 2022 points race and is currently fifth, surely not. So Red Bull is clearly banking on keeping Verstappen despite all the recent turmoil, but even that might not be enough to ensure lucrative constructors' championship successes in 2025-26. Either way, Red Bull has left itself vulnerable.\n\nMcLaren bent over backwards to keep Senna in the early 1990s - some argued to the detriment of car development such were his wage demands - but he jumped ship to Williams as soon as he could. Even with a young Mika Hakkinen in the wings, McLaren didn't even win another race for three years...", "source": {"uri": "motorsport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Motorsport.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valtteri_Bottas", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Valtteri Bottas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Sargeant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logan Sargeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_effect_(cars)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ground effect (cars)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz in Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Albon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Albon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Piquet", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nelson Piquet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Mansell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nigel Mansell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubens_Barrichello", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rubens Barrichello"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayrton_Senna", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ayrton Senna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Prost", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alain Prost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Ricciardo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Tsunoda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yuki Tsunoda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esteban_Ocon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Esteban Ocon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Junior_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull Junior Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prost_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prost Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mika_H\u00e4kkinen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mika H\u00e4kkinen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimi_R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Rosberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nico Rosberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Vettel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sebastian Vettel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Gasly", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pierre Gasly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorsport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motorsport"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Drivers", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device_Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device Drivers", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn-9.motorsport.com/images/amp/6zQeeqkY/s6/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618133", "eventUri": "eng-9618133", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

P\u00e9rez finished as runner-up in last year's drivers' championship behind teammate Max Verstappen.\n\n\"I am delighted to be staying here to continue our journey together and contribute to this team's great history for two more years,\" P\u00e9rez said in a statement. \"Being part of the team is an immense challenge, and one I love.\n\n\"We have a great challenge this year and I have full trust in the whole team that the future is bright here and I am excited to be part of it.\"\n\nRed Bull team principal Christian Horner felt it was \"an important time\" for Red Bull to lock in its driver lineup for next year, with Verstappen under contract until 2028.\n\n\"Continuity and stability are important for the team,\" Horner said. \"Checo and Max are a successful and robust partnership, securing our first ever one-two finish for the team in the championship last year.\"\n\nRed Bull could have had its pick of free agents for next year given its recent domination in F1. But in the end, it opted to stick with P\u00e9rez for a fifth season, as well as ensuring he will remain part of its team through to the new cycle of F1 car design rules that will start in 2026.\n\nP\u00e9rez's future has faced regular scrutiny during his time at Red Bull, particularly in light of the gulf in performance to Verstappen off the garage. Verstappen won 19 races last year to P\u00e9rez's two as the Mexican suffered a mid-season dip in performance, picking up only one podium in the final eight races.\n\nBut P\u00e9rez returned for 2024 with a shift in mindset, experimenting less with the setup of his car in a bid to catch up with Verstappen, and instead, focusing more on maximizing his own results. He said in Australia he felt \"a lot more together\" with the car, something reflected in his three second-place finishes in the first four races of the season.\n\nThese performances helped convince Red Bull that continuity would be the best for its lineup. P\u00e9rez is well-liked within the team and has enjoyed a largely civil relationship with Verstappen across the garage during their time together.\n\nAlthough P\u00e9rez has struggled in the last couple of races, finishing eighth at Imola and dropping out in the first stage of qualifying before getting caught up in a first-lap crash in Monaco, Horner has shown little sign of concern over his form.\n\nHorner said after the race in Monaco that Red Bull \"need to make sure that we have got both cars up there scoring points, because we cannot dismiss the threat of Ferrari and McLaren in both championships.\"\n\nThe two-year contract should provide P\u00e9rez a level of stability that has been missing at points in his F1 career, and was something he thrived upon in 2022 when he last signed a multi-year extension with Red Bull.\n\nRed Bull's vacant seat was one of the most coveted on the grid for 2025 given the team's recent domination of F1, meaning confirmation of P\u00e9rez has big ramifications on the driver market.\n\nThe driver this most affects is Carlos Sainz, who had been looking to remain with a front-running team following his departure from Ferrari at the end of the year. It is understood that concerns within Red Bull over past friction with Verstappen during their season together as rookies at Toro Rosso in 2015 played a part in any deal not being seriously pursued.\n\nWith Red Bull now shut off and Mercedes looking increasingly likely to sign teen protege Andrea Kimi Antonelli as Lewis Hamilton's replacement for next year, it means Sainz has been frozen out of the top teams on the current grid. His most realistic options are now Sauber, which will become Audi in 2026, or Williams, with both teams making the Spaniard their number-one target for next season.\n\nConfirmation for P\u00e9rez also puts an end to Daniel Ricciardo's hopes of a return to Red Bull in the near future. Upon his return to F1 last year with Red Bull's sister team, now known as RB, Ricciardo was clear in his desire to get back to the senior squad, only for him to struggle for performance through the early part of this season.\n\nRed Bull is yet to confirm its driver plans for RB in 2025, but Yuki Tsunoda has been impressive this year with regular points finishes. Ricciardo finished fourth in the Miami sprint race, and has shown flashes of pace, but is yet to record a Sunday points haul.\n\nRed Bull also has reserve driver Liam Lawson as part of its program, and his stock remains high after an impressive five-race stint deputizing for the injured Ricciardo last year.\n\nP\u00e9rez's renewal is the second announcement this week concerning the driver market for this year after Alpine confirmed on Monday that Esteban Ocon will leave the team at the end of the season.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"},

However, Perez has won praise for his defensive driving to keep rivals off Verstappen's back, especially when he held up Lewis Hamilton before Verstappen took his first title in Abu Dhabi in 2021.

I think we have a lot of work to do, we have a lot more championships to win together.\"\n\nAlthough Verstappen has been absolutely dominant in the team-mate head-to-head - Perez last out-qualified the Dutchman 26 races ago, at the 2023 Miami GP - Red Bull have been pleased with the generally harmonious intra-team dynamic between the two drivers during a period of stunning success at the team.\n\nPerez famously played a key role in the 2021 title-deciding Abu Dhabi, holding up race leader Hamilton mid-way through the race, before the controversial Safety Car conclusion that ultimately swung the title Verstappen's way.\n\nSainz, who has lost his Ferrari seat to Hamilton, had appeared in the running for a return to the Red Bull stable after a strong start to the season but their decision to stick with Perez appears to have distilled the Spaniard's 2025 decision into a straight call between Williams and Sauber, who are morphing into Audi for 2026.\n\nAfter making his own return to the Red Bull fold last year, initially as a third driver before taking over a race seat at RB, Ricciardo had described it as his \"dream\" to return to the senior outfit he left on his own accord in 2018.\n\nHowever, Ricciardo's candidature to replace Perez has been undone by the form of RB team-mate Yuki Tsunoda, who has outperformed the experienced Australian so far. Despite that form, Tsunoda himself has never been thought to be in the running for the main Red Bull team.", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"}, "authors":

Hill simply replied by claiming that Max Verstappen will not have it as easy as he had it last year.\n\nWhen asked about the same on the most recent episode of the F1 Nation podcast, the former F1 driver replied, \"I definitely think it is game on. I definitely think that there are two teams that are showing pace and closing the gap on certain circuits to Red Bull\".\n\nHe then added, \"You won't even remember Monaco\" in a few weeks' time. His comments seem to suggest that there will be more race weekends when Verstappen and Red Bull struggle this year.\n\nThe 63-year-old's remarks come at a time when Verstappen has found it difficult to dominate week in and week out as he did last season. In all of 2023, the 26-year-old lost just three races out of 22.\n\nAnd come 2024, he has already lost three after the first eight rounds. Out of those three losses for Verstappen, two of them came in the last three race weekends.\n\nAll this seems to suggest that Verstappen and Red Bull will find it difficult to defend their titles. The Dutchman currently has a 31-point lead in the Drivers' Championship to second-placed Charles Leclerc.\n\nMeanwhile, the Constructors' Championship is extremely tight at the moment. Red Bull are just 24 points ahead of second-placed Ferrari. However, with Verstappen yet to compete on his favorite tracks, it will not be easy for either Ferrari or McLaren to break Red Bull's juggernaut just yet.\n\nF1 is all set to take place in Canada this weekend, following which the remaining European leg of races will resume. Since most of the races in Europe feature traditional circuits, Verstappen seems to have a liking for them and has performed exceptionally well on such tracks in the previous few campaigns.\n\nMoreover, Red Bull advisor Helmut Marko also claimed recently that the Verstappen factor may just help them retain their Constructors' title this season despite the likes of Ferrari and McLaren having closed the gap significantly this year. However, before the Dutchman gets the chance to compete at his favorite venues, he may need to pull through this weekend in Canada and get the best result possible there.\n\nThe 26-year-old himself admitted that he expects himself and Red Bull to struggle in Montreal. When asked about how he expects his weekend in Canada to pan out, Verstappen replied, \"It probably won't be easy with the kerbing. Our car isn't good over the kerbs and they resurfaced the track, so you don't know what to expect\".\n\nIf Verstappen does indeed struggle in Canada, it will give a further boost to both Ferrari and McLaren that they indeed can take the challenge to Red Bull this year. And a win for a driver other than Verstappen in Canada is also likely to be exciting for the fans, who have often complained about the Dutchman's continuous dominance in recent times.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vidit_dhawan@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Vidit Dhawan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damon_Hill", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Damon Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmut_Marko", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helmut Marko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/06/380d37d5-max-verstappen-imago-hochzwei.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618133", "eventUri": "eng-9618133", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Perez has signed a new two-year deal keeping him with the team not only next year but also in 2026.\n\nPerez said: \"I am delighted to be staying here to continue our journey together and contribute to this team's great history for two more years. Being part of the team is an immense challenge, and one I love. We have a great challenge this year and I have full trust in the whole team that the future is bright here and I am excited to be part of it.\"\n\nThe two parties verbally agreed to continue their partnership last month and have now put pen to paper on the terms of the contract extension. That decision was made after the team ruled out Carlos Sainz, who is leaving Ferrari at the end of this season, as a candidate for the seat.\n\nIt left Perez as the clear candidate for the race seat which has been the subject of much speculation over the last 12 months. The 34-year-old has been fighting for his future since a poor run of form last season which began in May 2023 with a wretched weekend at the Monaco Grand Prix.\n\nHis short-lived title challenge against team-mate Verstappen faded badly as Perez struggled to get the most out of the Red Bull car which dominated the championship. He finished second in the drivers' standings, but with fewer than half the number of points amassed by the Dutchman.\n\nTeam principal Christian Horner challenged Perez to start the new season strongly and got a response from his driver, who secured four podiums from the first five races. It was enough to convince Red Bull that the Mexican deserves to keep his seat.\n\nHorner said: \"Now is an important time to confirm our line-up for 2025 and we are very pleased to continue working together with Checo. Continuity and stability are important for the team and both Checo and Max are a successful and robust partnership, securing our first ever one-two finish for the team in the championship last year.\n\n\"Checo has had a strong start to 2024 with second places in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Japan and then his podium in China. The past few races have been tough, there is convergence on the grid, but we are confident in Checo and look forward to his return to proven form and performance, that we so often see.\"\n\nPerez's form has slipped in the last two race weekends - he finished down in eighth at Imola and crashed on the first lap of the Monaco race, having been only 18th fastest in qualifying. But Red Bull struggled as a whole across those two Grands Prix, especially the latter, with rivals closing the performance gap.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

Red Bull had considered other targets, including Sainz, 29, but decided last month not to pursue the Spaniard further. There have been some reports from Spain claiming Sainz could still join sister team RB, but Mirror Sport understands those claims are wide of the mark.\n\nHis main options for a 2025 seat are Audi, who have been keen on the Ferrari driver for some time, and Williams. Esteban Ocon, who is leaving Alpine at the end of the year, is also in the running for both those seats and it may be that the Frenchman fills one and Sainz the other.\n\nAs for their RB seats, Red Bull remain open to their current in-house options. Yuki Tsunoda has been in impressive form this year and is likely to earn a renewal, leaving a straight fight for the other seat between current holder, Daniel Ricciardo, and reserve Liam Lawson.",

There was speculation he might be replaced after difficulty matching the pace of his teammate and defending champion Max Verstappen.\n\nThe 34-year-old Perez, nicknamed \"Checo\", has not won a race since the Azerbaijan Grand Prix in April 2023, even as Verstappen sealed last year's title with a record 19 wins. However, Perez has won praise for his defensive driving to keep rivals off Verstappen's back, especially when he held up Lewis Hamilton before Verstappen took his first title in Abu Dhabi in 2021. Verstappen leads the standings this season with 169 points ahead of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc with 138. Perez is fifth with 107.\n\n\"I want to thank everyone for all the trust they are putting in me, it is a lot and I want to pay it back with excellent results on track, and off track,\" Perez said in a team statement. \"I think we have a lot of work to do, we have a lot more Championships to win together.\"\n\nWith seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton leaving Mercedes for Ferrari next year, Red Bull could be the only one of F1's three biggest teams to keep the same lineup for 2025.\n\nThe two-year extension also means Perez will drive under the new rules being introduced in 2026, when cars will be more reliant on the electric component of their hybrid systems.\n\nRed Bull driver Sergio Perez of Mexico arrives to the pits before the Formula One Monaco Grand Prix race at the Monaco racetrack, in Monaco, Sunday, May 26, 2024.

Perez had been set to be a free agent at the end of the season.\n\nPerez was caught in an opening lap crash at Monaco after he started 16th following an elimination in the first round of qualifying. He was eighth in the previous race at Imola after starting 11th.\n\nPerez's future at Red Bull has been a bit murky since Max Verstappen became the most dominant driver in the series. As Verstappen has won 49 of 74 races and three championships since the start of 2022, Perez has just four victories in that span.\n\nA season ago, Perez finished second in the standings with two wins thanks to how dominant Red Bull's car was. Even though he was on the fastest team in the series, Perez had serious issues in qualifying. Perez's average starting position was 9.3 and ranked 10th among 20 drivers.\n\nThe car's speed ultimately won out over the course of a race. As Verstappen had an absurd average finish of 1.3, Perez was second in the series at 5.9.\n\nPerez's contract extension likely keeps Red Bull's driver lineup intact for the next two seasons. Verstappen is locked into a long-term contract with the team and rumors of a push by Mercedes to lure Verstappen to replace Lewis Hamilton have seemed to disappear. Lead Red Bull designer Adrian Newey announced he was leaving the team this season in the wake of the controversy that surrounded Horner at the start of the season.\n\nWith Perez staying at Red Bull, the free-agent options for Carlos Sainz continue to dwindle for the 2025 season. The Ferrari driver is getting replaced by Hamilton. Sauber -- soon to be the Audi factory team in 2026 -- and Williams have been mentioned as possible destinations for him. Mercedes may be a long shot option, though the team could promote 17-year-old junior driver Kimi Antonelli to replace Hamilton next season.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imola", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauber_Motorsport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sauber Motorsport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Newey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Newey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz in Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Audi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device_Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device Drivers", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/nwNesqSWJerdrUrM_e8lZA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-06/93287510-228d-11ef-bbad-f60fe89c97d0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618133", "eventUri": "eng-9618133", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

The Briton said: \"Now is an important time to confirm our line-up for 2025 and we are very pleased to continue working together with Checo.\n\n\"Continuity and stability are important for the team and both Checo and Max are a successful and robust partnership, securing our first ever one-two finish for the team in the championship last year.

However, according to The Race's expert Glenn Freeman, Verstappen will stay put, and the links to other teams will die down before the summer break.\n\nOut of all the potential destinations for Verstappen to choose from, Mercedes emerged as the frontrunner but on a podcast, Freeman said that he would be \"surprised\" if the move went through.\n\nHe feels that people in Verstappen's entourage are more open to the idea of a move away from Milton-Keynes than Verstappen himself. Plus, he sees Red Bull returning to winning ways soon. \"I think when we get back to conventional tracks, we are still gonna see Red Bull have an advantage. So I think there will still be some comfortable victories in the weeks and months to come.\"\n\nEven though Red Bull isn't running away with the title after eight races so far in 2024 (as they did in 2023), winning the Championship shouldn't be a daunting task, as Freeman pointed out.\n\nOn the other hand, his father Jos Verstappen doesn't seem to care too much about Red Bull's on-track performances. After falling out with team principal Christian Horner, he publicly claimed that the Briton would be the reason behind Red Bull's downfall.\n\nVerstappen continues to state that he doesn't see himself leaving Red Bull in the near future. But, Jos remains adamant about their departure from the Austrian team and even met with Mercedes boss Toto Wolff earlier this year. The final decision, however, rests on Verstappen's shoulders.\n\nRed Bull's diminishing dominance isn't a sign that they are turning into a weaker team. McLaren and Ferrari, its main rivals, are the ones who have made huge strides, leading to Red Bull losing two races already this season.\n\nRed Bull's chief advisor Helmut Marko also revealed that the sim data is not translating into their off-track performance. Verstappen admitted to the same in Monaco and insisted that there was no permanent solution. What this has done is turned the Championship battle into a three-way tussle, with Ferrari and McLaren predicted to push until the very end.\n\nVerstappen's stance on Red Bull's problems will be visible when F1 returns to more 'traditional' circuits as Freeman pointed out. Winning there should shut the exit rumors down unless backstage politics play a major role in pushing Verstappen out of Red Bull.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mahim_suhalka@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Mahim Suhalka", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jos Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Horner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian Horner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmut_Marko", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helmut Marko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toto_Wolff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toto Wolff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Rodeo", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Rodeo", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/06/e1f8c437-1920-1080-20.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618133", "eventUri": "eng-9618133", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Perez has signed a new two-year deal keeping him with the team not only next year but also in 2026.\n\nPerez said: \"I am delighted to be staying here to continue our journey together and contribute to this team's great history for two more years. Being part of the team is an immense challenge, and one I love. We have a great challenge this year and I have full trust in the whole team that the future is bright here and I am excited to be part of it.\"\n\nThe two parties verbally agreed to continue their partnership last month and have now put pen to paper on the terms of the contract extension. That decision was made after the team ruled out Carlos Sainz, who is leaving Ferrari at the end of this season, as a candidate for the seat.\n\nIt left Perez as the clear candidate for the race seat which has been the subject of much speculation over the last 12 months. The 34-year-old has been fighting for his future since a poor run of form last season which began in May 2023 with a wretched weekend at the Monaco Grand Prix.\n\nHis short-lived title challenge against team-mate Verstappen faded badly as Perez struggled to get the most out of the Red Bull car which dominated the championship. He finished second in the drivers' standings, but with fewer than half the number of points amassed by the Dutchman.\n\nTeam principal Christian Horner challenged Perez to start the new season strongly and got a response from his driver, who secured four podiums from the first five races. It was enough to convince Red Bull that the Mexican deserves to keep his seat.\n\nHorner said: \"Now is an important time to confirm our line-up for 2025 and we are very pleased to continue working together with Checo. Continuity and stability are important for the team and both Checo and Max are a successful and robust partnership, securing our first ever one-two finish for the team in the championship last year.\n\n\"Checo has had a strong start to 2024 with second places in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Japan and then his podium in China. The past few races have been tough, there is convergence on the grid, but we are confident in Checo and look forward to his return to proven form and performance, that we so often see.\"\n\nPerez's form has slipped in the last two race weekends - he finished down in eighth at Imola and crashed on the first lap of the Monaco race, having been only 18th fastest in qualifying. But Red Bull struggled as a whole across those two Grands Prix, especially the latter, with rivals closing the performance gap.\n\nAnd the blip has not dissuaded the team from continuing with efforts to tie Perez down to a new deal. Red Bull had considered other targets, including Sainz, 29, but decided last month not to pursue the Spaniard further. There have been some reports from Spain claiming Sainz could still join sister team RB, but Mirror Sport understands those claims are wide of the mark.\n\nHis main options for a 2025 seat are Audi, who have been keen on the Ferrari driver for some time, and Williams. Esteban Ocon, who is leaving Alpine at the end of the year, is also in the running for both those seats and it may be that the Frenchman fills one and Sainz the other.\n\nAs for their RB seats, Red Bull remain open to their current in-house options. Yuki Tsunoda has been in impressive form this year and is likely to earn a renewal, leaving a straight fight for the other seat between current holder, Daniel Ricciardo, and reserve Liam Lawson.", "source": {"uri": "irishmirror.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_moxon@irishmirror.ie", "name": "Daniel Moxon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Horner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian Horner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monaco Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_F1_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alpine F1 Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Tsunoda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yuki Tsunoda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Lawson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liam Lawson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esteban_Ocon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Esteban Ocon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Ricciardo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Audi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imola", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bahrain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bahrain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://i2-prod.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article32957346.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_F1-Grand-Prix-of-Emilia-Romagna-Final-Practice.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618133", "eventUri": "eng-9618133", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

It will take Perez's time at Red Bull to six years, having joined prior to the 2021 season.\n\nIt means other drivers eyeing Red Bull's second seat, such as Sainz and RB pairing Daniel Ricciardo and Yuki Tsunoda, will have to look elsewhere for next year.\n\nHorner said: \"The past few races have been tough, there is convergence on the grid, but we are confident in Checo and look forward to his return to proven form and performance, that we so often see.\n\n\"Last year was a unicorn season and we will need to work hard to retain our titles, but we are assured in our line up and with the team as a whole, which is imperative in what is shaping up to be a close fought championship this year.\n\n\"Now is an important time to confirm our line-p for 2025 and we are very pleased to continue working together with Checo.\"\n\nVerstappen, meanwhile, has a contract until the end of 2028 but has been linked with Mercedes after the furore surrounding Christian Horner at the start of this season. A move to the Silver Arrows would, however, depend on Toto Wolff's team providing a competitive car for the new era of regulations from 2026.\n\nAs for Perez, he finished second in the drivers' championship last year - his best-ever finish in F1 - but won just two races in 2023 compared to Verstappen's haul of 19.\n\nHe has won five races since replacing Alex Albon after the 2020 season and, having penned a new deal, will race for a 15 consecutive season in Formula 1 in 2025.\n\nPerez added: \"I am really happy to commit my future to this great team.

And Ferrari have also proven they are capable of winning race, as Charles Leclerc proved last month in Monaco.\n\nPerez has struggled at times to deliver the results that are now needed of him. Verstappen scored enough points to single-handedly win the title for Red Bull last year, but now that the performance gap is close they need the Mexican to step up.\n\nAnd team principal Horner has backed the 34-year-old to do exactly that after choosing to stick with his current driver line-up. The Briton said: \"Now is an important time to confirm our line-up for 2025 and we are very pleased to continue working together with Checo.\n\n\"Continuity and stability are important for the team and both Checo and Max are a successful and robust partnership, securing our first ever one-two finish for the team in the championship last year.

And despite his at times patchy form in recent times, he insists he is up to the challenge of helping the team to continue its dominance of the sport.\n\nHe said: \"\"I am really happy to commit my future to this great team, it is a challenge like no other racing for Oracle Red Bull Racing, both on track and off track. I am delighted to be staying here to continue our journey together and contribute to this team's great history for two more years.

After a lackluster performance at the Monaco Grand Prix, where the Red Bull Racing team struggled significantly, Verstappen anticipates some improvement in Canada but remains wary of the challenges that lie ahead. The Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, known for its aggressive kerbs and newly resurfaced track, could prove difficult for Red Bull's RB20, which had issues with suspension compliance in Monaco.\n\nIn Monaco, Verstappen managed only a sixth-place finish after a disappointing qualifying session. His teammate, Sergio Perez, fared even worse, crashing out on the first lap after failing to advance beyond Q1. These results have put the team on high alert as they prepare for Montreal's similarly demanding circuit.\n\n\"We have to wait and see [how we'll perform in Canada], new surface as well I think, that might also give us some surprises,\" Verstappen said via F1i. \"But it is probably also not going to be our strongest weekend because of that. But probably a little bit better than [Monaco].\"\n\nRed Bull team principal, Christian Horner, also expressed his thoughts on the challenges posed by the new track conditions in Montreal.\n\n\"It's a track that we've performed well at previously. They've resurfaced the whole circuit again. So let's see,\" Horner noted while acknowledging the increasing competition from teams like Ferrari and McLaren. \"But Ferrari, McLaren, they're quick. It was always going to happen that there was going to be convergence. This has been a tough weekend, but we're still leading both championships.\"\n\nBoth driver and team chief highlighted the car's sensitivity to tracks with specific features such as bumps and kerbs, which are prevalent at street circuits like the one in Montreal. Verstappen admitted:\n\n\"[We'll be weaker at] any track that is bumpy or has kerbs, or you have to ride a lot of kerbs, so the street circuits will probably be a little bit tricky. But hopefully by then, we have a little bit of understanding of what is going on.\"\n\nAs they prepare for what could be a \"tricky\" weekend, the Red Bull team focuses on learning from their recent setbacks. Horner emphasized the importance of understanding the car's response to Montreal's new track conditions.\n\n\"We'll look to take the lessons out of this weekend and apply them to the next one,\" he stated. \"[Canada is] very much about traction, but with a new surface, you don't know what the balance is going to swing to,\" he explained.\n\nDespite the recent challenges and the anticipated difficulties in Canada, the mood within Red Bull Racing remains cautiously optimistic. The RB20 is a fast car, but seems to falter on surfaces where it loses the proximity of its floor to the track - where the majority of its downforce is created.\n\nThe Monaco Grand Prix was a difficult weekend for the coveted Red Bull driver, with struggles during the qualifying session casting a shadow of concern over his upcoming performance in Canada. The racing star only managed to secure a sixth-place start, a position that speaks volumes about the challenges he faced with his Milton Keynes machinery, which he described as \"extremely difficult to drive\" in the Principality.\n\n\"I found it surprising that we were able to compete for so long. We tried everything this weekend to find a better balance, but it just isn't working,\" Verstappen lamented on the ViaPlay broadcast during the race weekend, via Sports Illustrated. He pointed to Perez's unusually poor performance as further evidence of the car's deficiencies, especially given Perez's strong love for street circuits.\n\n\"We set the car up fairly stiff, because soft didn't work anyway. Then you also lock an inside wheel quite quickly, so that makes it difficult to turn the car in tight corners,\" he explained.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_harrington@newsweek.com", "name": "Alex Harrington", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Horner", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christian Horner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_Gilles_Villeneuve", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Circuit Gilles Villeneuve"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monaco Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Street circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downforce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Downforce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Keynes", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milton Keynes"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milton Keynes"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Auto Racing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle Racing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2403097/max-verstappen-monaco-grand-prix.webp?w=1600&h=900&l=53&t=45&q=88&f=981f0d96cb74daedef8f23e8d3548f2d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618133", "eventUri": "eng-9618133", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

But internal conflict at Red Bull in recent months saw Mercedes boss Toto Wolff chance his arm at trying to convince the triple F1 champion to replace the departing Lewis Hamilton.\n\nVerstappen, 26, is reluctant to leave a winning team for one which has slipped to fourth in the F1 pecking order. But the Dutchman is said to be nervous about what the future holds for Red Bull and Mercedes plan to take advantage of that.\n\nMore rule changes are on the horizon for 2026, for which Red Bull are building their own engines in-house for the very first time. They have hired experts from other teams up and down the grid to work on the project, but it remains to be seen how effective they will be in their first effort at an F1 power unit.\n\nOn the other hand, though they have struggled to design competitive cars in recent years, Mercedes have an excellent track record when it comes to building powerful engines. They were streets ahead of anyone else in 2014 when hybrid engines were introduced and the Silver Arrows had a power advantage over their rivals for years.\n\nMercedes are confident they can use the new engines to return to the front of the grid in 2026 and have made a point of bringing up their past success in that area.\n\nTechnical director James Allison said at Imola earlier this month: \"I wasn't in the team in the run-up to 2014 when the new generation of power units were being concocted and the enormous push to make them a reality was taking place. But those of us in the team who were, tell me that the feeling is very similar.\n\nThere is a massive shove going on in HPP [Mercedes High Performance Powertrains] to make a success of that because it will set the course of anyone who's lucky enough to have that in the back of their car for some seasons to come. We're lucky that we will be on the receiving end of all the good investment they are making on our joint behalf.\"\n\nVerstappen is contracted to Red Bull until 2028 but his close ally Helmut Marko has given him a way out of that deal should he wish to use it. The Austrian has tied Red Bull's star driver's fate to his own with a contract clause that allows Verstappen to walk away if he leaves.\n\nVerstappen insists that, for now, he has no intention of going anywhere, saying: \"My future is within Red Bull at the moment.\" Wolff admitted last week his team is currently \"not competitive enough to lure a world champion\".

The opinions and information contained within do not necessarily represent Frontstretch and its staff.\n\nEvery F1 season takes a dramatic turn at some point or another. This year, there have certainly been interesting and divisive storylines hitting the media since before the first grand prix even kicked off. The rumor mill has kicked into overdrive and hasn't stopped.\n\nOn the one hand, Max Verstappen and Red Bull are exerting their control over the sport. Despite strong performances from other drivers, none have been able to meet Verstappen's speed consistently. In fact, Verstappen is always the favorite in the odds that come from major sportsbooks -- and that's not likely to change as the year progresses.\n\nInstead, uncertainty surrounding F1 is now revolving around who will take second place in the driver's championship and where drivers will be next year. Lewis Hamilton will be famously stepping away from Mercedes to join Ferrari -- but what else could happen? Let's take a closer look at three possibilities.\n\nRegardless of what you think about Christian Horner and his (alleged) misconduct, there's at least one sign that all isn't quite as it should be. Head engineer and designer Adrian Newey will be hanging up his hat with Red Bull. It's unclear what motivated the move and where he's heading next -- though it's fact that Red Bull will struggle to find their footing without him.\n\nMany are wondering whether Newey's departure signals a jump from Verstappen. Though the driver is under contract with Red Bull until 2028, there are a few exit clauses, one of which could be centered around Newey. However, it seems highly unlikely that a young and motivated driver like Verstappen would pick up and leave without proof that his vehicle isn't up to snuff.\n\nGeorge Russell has been quietly outperforming his senior teammate for a while now. As of early May, he's got a solid ten-point lead on Hamilton in the driver's championship. Though he's incrementally improved under Toto Wolff's Mercedes, his contract will expire next year. It's unclear whether Russell will try to jump ship before then -- possible to join Ferrari or Red Bull.\n\nThis year has seen tons of rumors surround the Mercedes paddock. First, there was the shocking news that Hamilton would be leaving for Ferrari. Given Red Bull's decisive triumphs over Mercedes in the last few years, Hamilton's departure puts the team in a particularly vulnerable position.\n\nRussell's departure could also spell disaster. However, that's absolutely not guaranteed to be the case, not if it's Verstappen heads to Mercedes. Though this is unlikely, it's not entirely off the table. Other drivers have also been linked to Mercedes, including Carlos Sainz, Fernando Alonso, and junior driver Andrea Antonelli.\n\nAfter his first place finish at the Miami Grand Prix, all eyes are on Lando Norris. Just like Russell, his contract will expire in 2025. And, just like Russell, he's been linked to potential moves to Ferrari or Red Bull. Given both are elite drivers with plenty of time left in their careers, the speculation is fitting. Russell or Norris would likely excel with either team.\n\nEven if Verstappen stays on at Red Bull (which doesn't seem unlikely), Norris and Russell could be competing for a seat at Red Bull. Though Sergio Perez has certainly been putting on a dominant performance in the hopes of keeping his seat, Red Bull hasn't given the driver their overwhelming support.\n\nThat being said, a move from Norris still looks only a far-out possibility. First, there's Zak Brown's focus on the driver. Brown seems to see Norris as McLaren's hero -- now and in the future. Last year, the team managed to woo Norris to a multi-year contract. Though there are plenty of stipulations, it seems like Norris, Brown, and McLaren are on the same page -- especially after the big win in Miami.", "source": {"uri": "frontstretch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Frontstretch"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Newey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Newey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Russell_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Russell (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Horner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian Horner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Antonelli", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrea Antonelli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fernando Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Drivers", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Drivers", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device_Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device Drivers", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://frontstretch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/M431195.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618133", "eventUri": "eng-9618133", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

We know it's an area of the car we need to work on.\n\n\"I think, first of all it's understanding what the issue is, so once we've done that, then you can look at what the relevant fix is.\"\n\nVerstappen brutally likened his experience in qualifying, when he went only sixth quickest after hitting the wall at Ste Devote, to driving a \"go-kart\". But, while the description may have been blunt, Horner said the Dutchman's famously straight-to-the-point analysis of what the RB20 was like to drive ultimately aided the team's work.\n\n\"Listen to Max's comments over the last 10 years. He's just very direct, he's very forthright. It just focuses everyone,\" said the Red Bull chief.\n\n\"There was a very good debrief following qualifying where we really dug into what exactly is the sensation from the driver. He put a big effort into spending time with the engineers [after qualifying]. There's no silver bullet, it's just about working hard and understanding it.\"\n\nAsked what the upgrade plan now was for the RB20, Horner replied: \"It's a continual process. Of course, you're into the law of diminishing returns and of course, your focus changes depending on what your problems are.\n\n\"So I think quite a lot of focus will now take part on, 'OK, why have we had these ride issues? Why is the car struggling on the kerbs?' The RB car is running without suspension from last year, didn't seem to have the same issues. So we need to understand whether it's something that we've introduced.\"\n\nVerstappen has won the last two Canadian GPs from pole position and, while also ostensibly a street circuit, the wall-lined Circuit Gilles Villeneuve features significantly faster sections too.\n\nHowever, the ability of a car to ride the kerbs is also important in Montreal, particularly at the first and final chicanes.\n\nVerstappen said: \"It's still not probably going to be the easiest weekend because of the kerbing and stuff, our car is just not very good at that.\n\n\"They resurfaced the track so that might actually bring some unexpected stuff, you never know the grip levels.\"\n\nHorner added: \"It's a track that we've performed well at previously. They've resurfaced the whole circuit again, so let's see. Ferrari, McLaren - they're quick. It was always going to happen that there was going to be convergence.\"\n\nIndeed, for the first time since September 2021, three races in succession have been one by three different teams.\n\nAfter Verstappen had appeared to be running away with the championship again after winning four of the new season's first five grands prix. The one of those he did not win, Australia, he would have been strongly in the running for too had his car not suffered a rare mechanical retirement.\n\nBut the three grands prix that took place in May provided a different narrative.\n\nLando Norris broke his F1 duck in Miami for McLaren at the start of the month before the Briton then finished right on Verstappen's tail in pursuit of another win a fortnight later at Imola. A week later, Leclerc completed the month by ending his near-two-year victory drought on his home ground of Monaco.\n\nThe top three in the championship - Verstappen, Leclerc and Norris - are covered by 56 points, just over the equivalent of two race wins, while in the Constructors' Championship, Red Bull's lead over Ferrari is down to just 24 points in a record-length season where there are still 16 races remaining.\n\nHeading into a period towards the August summer break when there will be six races in eight weeks, Horner said: \"I think McLaren made a big step. I think Ferrari's step was very subtle. So let's see over the next two or three races.\n\n\"We're now getting into the meat of the championship, Let's see Montreal, Barcelona, Austria, Silverstone - let's see over the next few circuits how things pan out. It's a marathon not a sprint.\"\n\nAsked about the three circuits that follow Montreal, Horner said: \"We don't take anything for granted but I think those tracks will play more to the strengths of the car.\n\n\"The car's won five places and had a second place in Miami and won two Sprint races. So it's not like it's gone from being a good car to a bad car, it's just that this circuit hasn't played to our strengths and we need to understand what are those weaknesses and how do we address them.\"", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports_F1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

But even though the upcoming Canadian GP threatens to pose the same problems, Red Bull advisor, Helmut Marko is confident that the Dutchman can pull a favorable result out of the bag.\n\nF1Maximaal.nl quoted the Austrian as saying,\n\n\"On circuits where we will not be very competitive, we can always count on the Verstappen factor. He is currently in top form and he can make the difference.\"\n\nThe RB20 has shown that it is prone to struggle on street circuits. The aerodynamic characteristics of the ground-effects era of Red Bull cars have handed them a handicap on tracks that are bumpy in nature or when the fastest line around the track is over kerbs.\n\nMarko also revealed that raising the car's height to make it more compliant over kerbs would worsen their problems. The current regulations have shaped the RB20 to be at its optimum when run at a lower height. Any adjustments on that end would reportedly lose the Milton-Keynes-based team a ton of downforce.\n\nVerstappen, however, is looking on the bright side. Although he admits that Montreal won't be an easy track for Red Bull, the 26-year-old believes nothing can get as bad as Monaco. According to him, the recently resurfaced Canadian GP track is bound to give the fans a few surprises.\n\nIn 2022 and 2023, Red Bull dominated F1, with the team winning 21 out of 22 races in the latter year. Verstappen won 19 of them and the expectation was to continue with his domination. However, this year, the Austrian stable seems to have gotten something wrong with the car.\n\nThis might still not be the case. The RB20 is an evolution of the concept of that the team ran in 2022 as well as 2023. Therefore, the limitations should also remain the same.\n\nWhat has changed, however, is the work Red Bull's rivals have done over the winter-break. Ferrari and McLaren have closed the gap down to Red Bull. This has made the margins really small at the font of the grid.

The Sky Sports presenter highlighted how Verstappen could potentially use the RB20 as a scapegoat for a possible exit from Red Bull. Interestingly, Kravitz's comments came after the Dutchman brushed the wall during qualifying in Monaco which ended up ruining his weekend.\n\nDuring a discussion on the Cameron F1 podcast, Windsor expressed his disbelief over Kravitz's claims. He stated, \"I don't understand at all. He [Max Verstappen] doesn't need a scapegoat if he wants to leave Red Bull. It's pretty clear why he'll leave. It's because Adrian Newey has left.\"\n\nWith Newey, the design genius behind Red Bull's recent dominance, leaving the team, it's only natural for Verstappen to have concerns about the future. As Windsor aptly put it,\n\n\"Why does he need to create any other thing? I mean the truth and the reality is that Adrian is not staying with Red Bull and so there's every reason for Max to be a bit concerned about the future and what he might be doing... It's a big change for him and that's logical as well. He doesn't need to start trashing the car in order to have an excuse to leave.\"\n\nHowever, the Dutch driver's frustrations aren't made up. Red Bull has struggled to extract the maximum potential of the RB20 on circuits with bumpy surfaces and where riding the kerbs is crucial for maximizing lap times.\n\nRed Bull's philosophy behind the RB20 focuses on maintaining a constant ride height to maximize aerodynamic performance. This is achieved by using a very stiff rear axle, which works well on smooth, high-speed circuits but becomes a headache in setting the car up for bumpier tracks.\n\nThe stiff suspension setup limits their ability to adapt to less rigid configurations that might perform better in such conditions. Following the Monaco GP, Verstappen and Red Bull motorsport advisor, Helmut Marko have said that there is something fundamentally wrong with the car.\n\nHelmut Marko recently pointed out a significant issue with Red Bull's simulator data, which shows the car handling kerbs perfectly, something that is clearly not reflected in their on-track performances.\n\n\"Simply put, that means the simulator and reality don't correlate,\" the Red Bull motorsport advisor wrote for Speedweek. \"We are optimistic we can at least find out why the simulator produces data that does not correspond to reality. But Montreal could also be a difficult weekend for us.\"\n\nThis problem is eerily similar to the issues Mercedes faced at the start of the ground-effect regulations in 2022.

Thus, one would expect that all would be well between him and the team. However, that is not the case, as there have been rumors about tensions between the Dutchman and the Milton Keynes outfit, following a slump in their dominant performance and the huge tremor of Adrian Newey's exit.\n\nAmid all this, Red Bull's commercial director Nick Stocker cited how Verstappen is still an integral part of the team. According to Front Office Sports, he stated, \"Max embodies everything Red Bull stands for. We gambled on him when he was young. He was seventeen when he entered Formula 1. We are the only team Max has worked for in F1.\"\n\nHowever, Stocker further addressed that whenever the 26-year-old decides to retire or leave the team, they have a solid backup of young talent. He mentioned,\n\n\"There was a time in Formula 1 when twelve of the twenty drivers on the grid had gone through the Red Bull Junior Academy. We invest in talent and in youth. That embodies the wings giving to people and ideas, a core principle of the Red Bull brand.\"\n\nRegardless, as Verstappen, Christian Horner and all other stakeholders at Red Bull have highlighted, the three-time champion will be staying at the team for the long haul. Despite the recent controversy surrounding Horner, Verstappen shares a good relationship with the team's top management, which won't deteriorate until something dramatic happens.\n\nWhen things went south for Christian Horner over his \"inappropriate behavior\" controversy, there was a cascading effect on the dynamics in Red Bull's top management. Reportedly, power struggles began between the two shareholder factions with Horner and Helmut Marko at different ends of the spectrum.\n\nThis dragged Verstappen into the mix when Marko was under threat of a suspension. The three-time champion was having none of it, as he indirectly warned of a tough situation for Red Bull if the Austrian advisor were to exit.\n\nVerstappen's comments at the Saudi Arabian GP sent shivers down the hierarchy at the Milton Keynes team and its parent company in Austria. In the following days, Marko got a new contract and they dismissed the rumors of his suspension.\n\nAll in all, Verstappen was quite clear that he respected Marko immensely and considered him a key pillar of Red Bull's success. Thus, Marko's exit would have hurt his motivation to stay on the team, something the Austrian outfit had to consider. As a result, they eventually decide to retain Marko.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aishwary_gaonkar@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Aishwary Gaonkar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Horner", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christian Horner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Newey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Newey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Keynes", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milton Keynes"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milton Keynes"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Junior_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull Junior Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmut_Marko", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helmut Marko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Team_Building", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Team Building", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/06/2fa2ee4f-max-verstappen-chinese-gp.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618133", "eventUri": "eng-9618133", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Ferrari and McLaren are close and have dethroned Red Bull twice this season already. The Monaco street circuit, in particular, brought out the RB20's flaws and displayed them on a silver platter. Now, The Race's Edd Straw highlights other tracks that pose a similar challenge for the Milton-Keynes-based outfit.\n\nOn the latest episode of The Race F1 podcast, Straw said, \"Singapore's the really obvious one, but it's really any track that's bumpy with a lot of kerb riding. Conventional circuits should be fine.\"\n\nRed Bull's biggest issues in Monaco were the kerbs and bumps, which is why Straw mentioned Singapore - also a street circuit.\n\n\"Next race in Montreal, not perfect, given the kerbs there. Barcelona, RB20 territory, you'd think. Street tracks like Baku and Vegas obviously won't be ideal. And then we saw Imola was a good example of where it can be difficult.\"\n\nThe kerbs and bumps are compromising Red Bull's ride height. As soon as the RB20 is set a little higher than its optimal window, it starts losing aerodynamic performance. This translates into an uncharacteristically shakier and slower car, which was their biggest problem in Monaco.\n\nVerstappen also highlighted that it is a fundamental problem which doesn't have a temporary solution. \"We have had this problem since 2022, so it is not something new,\" he said as quoted by Reuters.\n\nWith Ferrari and McLaren in the mix for wins too this season, Red Bull has work to do. But once F1 moves to more traditional circuits, Red Bull is expected to start dominating again. So, its rivals will look to take advantage of the places where the Austrian stable won't be strong. A common belief within the F1 paddock is that that the 2024 season will be track-oriented.\n\nThe opening eight rounds of the season have seen Ferrari, Red Bull and McLaren, all being stronger in certain circuits depending on their characteristics. Ferrari boss Frederic Vasseur feels that the scenario will continue till the end of the campaign.\n\nHowever, with the European leg of the calendar featuring more traditional tracks, Red Bull will be at an advantage in the coming weeks. Vasseur sees Verstappen extending his lead in the standings, and doesn't think Ferrari will have it easy.\n\nCanada could prove to be a difficult outing for Red Bull. The Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, too, has kerbs and bumps that should put Verstappen on the back foot. After Canada, however, the Dutchman is expected to be the favourite once again, especially with Red Bull's pending set of upgrades.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mahim_suhalka@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Mahim Suhalka", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curb", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Curb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Street circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aerodynamics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imola", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baku", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baku"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baku"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_Gilles_Villeneuve", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Circuit Gilles Villeneuve"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Rodeo", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Rodeo", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/06/28c55e36-1920-1080-21.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618133", "eventUri": "eng-9618133", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Horner was cleared of any wrongdoing after Red Bull hired an external investigator to look into the complaint.\n\nHis accuser has since appealed that decision and an outcome to that process has yet to be made public. Design guru Adrian Newey then announced his decision to leave the team ahead of the 2025 season.\n\nRecent races have also proven to be disappointing, with No.1 driver Max Verstappen losing out to Lando Norris in the Miami Grand Prix. The Dutchman then finished a lowly sixth in the Monaco Grand Prix last weekend, his worst result in a race he has completed since 2022.\n\nAnd F1 legend Brundle believes that the issues around the team are now beginning to affect results. He insisted that Red Bull should now be looking over their shoulder in both the drivers and constructors championships.\n\n\"It was [Charles] Leclerc's first victory in 39 races believe it or not, and he also broke a string of failing to win from his previous 12 pole positions. But he put in a perfect performance from the first lap of practice until the last lap of the race,\" Brundle told Sky Sports.\n\n\"Ferrari and McLaren are on a fine run, both teams and driver pairings looking very cohesive, focused, and well structured.

Who will win the Canadian Grand Prix? Comment below.\n\n\"I personally have no doubt that the internal events at Red Bull have detracted from their recent performances, and they'll be desperately keen to resume normal service in Montreal next time out.\"\n\nHorner has admitted that his team need to take a look in the mirror to turn around their form. He branded the race at Monaco a \"poor day\" and insisted he would be pouring over the data to find out why.\n\n\"Obviously this race is won on a Saturday and that's where we had a poor day,\" Horner said. \"We need to understand that, understand what the issues were with the ride and the kerbs.\n\n\"It was a very static race, the top 10 finished where they started from, the red flag effectively killed the race because everybody was going to run to the end of the race, so we have some lessons to take out of this weekend and learn from obviously.\n\n\"This circuit [Monaco] hasn't played to our strengths, and we need to understand what are those weaknesses and how do we address them.

But favourites, yes.\n\n\"And then it will be a very tight fight with both McLaren and us. I think we are all three at a very similar level.\n\n\"Our last reference of a normal track is Imola and Miami. And if I see those two tracks, we seem to be half a tenth behind McLaren and maybe a tenth or two behind Red Bull.\n\n\"And yeah, it still means that that any small progress, any small upgrade, any small thing that we bring to the car might switch it to a potential race victory or a winning car.\n\n\"Monaco, we've always been strong. Street circuits like Singapore and last year in Monaco, it shows the strengths of the Ferrari.\"\n\nSainz has agreed with Ferrari boss Frederic Vasseur's view that Red Bull's errors during qualifying in Monaco show what can happen when its rivals are under pressure.\n\n\"And at the same time, being within 24 points of the Red Bull in the Constructors, you see that when you put them under pressure yesterday,\" he continued.\n\n\"Max did a mistake in Q3 run two, Checo was out in Q1.\n\n\"We all just need to be there, you know, to show that these things can happen to Red Bull too. And yesterday is the best example.\"\n\nWhile Sainz has reiterated that Red Bull will rounds weekends on traditional tracks as favourites, he asserts that the competition has the pace to \"capitalise\" on errors.\n\n\"I think Ferrari we will have our opportunities in these sort of tracks,\" Sainz assessed.\n\n\"I think McLaren will have their opportunities, but when I talk about a normal track we can talk about maybe a Barcelona.\n\n\"Canada, I think is quite specific, but a Barcelona or any European track, where I consider it to be a normal track, I still think Red Bull will be favourites.\n\n\"But I don't think they'll dominate like they used to do. And I think that's good news for the championship.\n\n\"And it's just worth being within a tenth or two in quali, that even if they're favourites, they cannot afford to do any mistakes.\n\n\"And that's where both Ferrari and McLaren, we can capitalise, which is a position that in Bahrain race one, no one was there to be there.\"", "source": {"uri": "motorsportweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Motorsport Week"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Street circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imola", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bahrain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bahrain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.motorsportweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MonacoGP-Sainz-5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618133", "eventUri": "eng-9618133", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Red Bull", "body": "Perez's latest contract extension will see him carry on as Max Verstappen's team-mate for six consecutive seasons, into F1's new regulations cycle.\n\nThe 34-year-old Mexican started off the 2024 season well alongside Verstappen, taking three runner-up spots over the first four grands prix that helped him gain momentum to salvage his seat for 2025.\n\nA recent dip in form appeared to cast some doubts over Red Bull's final decision, but amid a volatile driver market, the Milton Keynes-based team has now opted to play it safe and keep its driver line-up stable for the next two years.\n\n\"Now is an important time to confirm our line-up for 2025 and we are very pleased to continue working together with Checo,\" team principal Christian Horner said.\n\n\"Continuity and stability are important for the team and both Checo and Max are a successful and robust partnership, securing our first ever one-two finish for the team in the championship last year.\n\n\"Checo has had a strong start to 2024 with second places in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Japan and then his podium in China.\"\n\nPerez added: \"I am delighted to be staying here to continue our journey together and contribute to this team's great history for two more years.\n\n\"Being part of the team is an immense challenge, and one I love.\n\n\"I want to thank everyone for all the trust they are putting in me, it is a lot and I want to pay it back with excellent results on track, and off track.\"\n\nThe news cements earlier reports that departing Ferrari driver Carlos Sainz was formally out of the running for a Red Bull seat, as he is now left to ponder whether he takes up Audi's long-standing offer or signs for Williams instead.\n\nPerez's renewal also means that RB's in-form driver Yuki Tsunoda is frozen out of a potential promotion to Red Bull's main team, with the Japanese widely expected to stay at RB for another year.\n\nPerez took five of his six career grand prix wins for Red Bull since joining in 2021.\n\nWhile initially trying to take on Verstappen and fight for world championships himself, Horner credited Perez for being less fixated on his team-mate's performances this year.\n\nThe decision to stick with the Mexican, who currently lies fifth in the drivers' standings after eight races, appears to be one taken in favour of intra-team harmony.\n\nMeanwhile, questions remain over his ability to help Red Bull defend its constructors' titles as rival outfits Ferrari and McLaren close the gap.\n\n\"The past few races have been tough, there is convergence on the grid, but we are confident in Checo and look forward to his return to proven form and performance, that we so often see,\" Horner insisted.", "source": {"uri": "motorsport.com", "dataType":

pick from, including Ferrari's Carlos Sainz, but have opted for the safety and stability of P\u00e9rez for the forseeable future.\n\n- Watch LIVE: F1 Canadian GP, Sunday, June 9, 12:30 p.m. ET on ESPN+\n\nAlthough initially believed to have been offered a one-plus-one deal, Tuesday's news explicitly stated a two-year contract for the six-time race winner.\n\nWhile his form has been erratic, sources have told ESPN that P\u00e9rez has always been the favoured option for teammate Max Verstappen.\n\nPerez is well liked by Verstappen and within Red Bull, which has held him in good stead for a new deal in a year which has seen considerable turmoil behind the scenes with Christian Horner's sexual misconduct investigation and the imminent departure of design chief Adrian Newey.\n\nRed Bull hopes the P\u00e9rez extension will also quieten the noise around Verstappen's future, with doubts still lingering about whether the defending world champion will see out his own contract, which runs until 2028.\n\nLinks of a Verstappen move to Mercedes have quietened in recent weeks but the Dutchman has done little to end the talk of a move.\n\nRed Bull felt going in a different direction with Verstappen's teammate for 2025 risked further destabilising things and reigniting talk of him wanting out.\n\nAway from Red Bull, Perez's deal will likely speed up an decision on the future of Sainz.\n\nThe Ferrari driver has been holding off on committing to a deal with Williams or Audi -- who have taken control of Sauber ahead of a full rebrand in 2026 -- until the Red Bull option was closed off.\n\nSources told ESPN over the course of the Monaco Grand Prix that Williams has emerged as the front-runner for Sainz.\n\nBoth options are believed to be in play, however, enthusiasm for the Audi project appears to have waned in recent months, many in the paddock are skeptical the German manufacturer can be immediately competitive on arrival.\n\nAudi has already signed Nico H\u00fclkenberg from Haas on a two-year deal but wants a marquee signing for its other seat.\n\nOne-time race winner Esteban Ocon will now be a prominent name in the remaining driver market speculation going forward, after Alpine confirmed on Monday he will leave the team at the end of 2024.\n\nRB driver Yuki Tsunoda's future is also uncertain but will be high on the list for the likes of Alpine and Audi given his red-hot form this year.", "source": {"uri": "espn.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Red Bull arrived at the Canadian Grand Prix with a commanding 135-point lead over Mercedes in the Constructors' Championship standings, with Max Verstappen and Sergio P\u00e9rez having won every race to that point. Verstappen held a similarly commanding lead in the Drivers' Championship, and it certainly felt like the season was done and dusted.\n\nAs the grid arrives in Montreal for the ninth race of the 2024 season it feels, as Oscar Piastri told me last week, like it is all to play for.\n\nThe circuit arrives at the Canadian Grand Prix with Red Bull still in the lead, but holding just a 24-point lead over Ferrari, with McLaren certainly in the mix as well. Not only that, but Ferrari has a pair of wins on the season -- Carlos Sainz Jr. in Australia and Charles Leclerc in Monaco -- while Lando Norris broke through with his maiden F1 win at the Miami Grand Prix.\n\nWhen I spoke with Norris' teammate last week, I asked Piastri if a title fight was truly in the cards.\n\nHe assured me that one is.\n\nI asked Piastri if McLaren and Ferrari can keep the pressure on Red Bull, and turn the 2024 season into a true title fight.\n\n\"I think so,\" was the immediate reply.\n\n\"I think Red Bull is still gonna be incredibly strong at pretty much everywhere. I think it's kind of just a coincidence that the last two or three races have been a little bit less comfortable [for Red Bull],\" continued the McLaren driver. \"But there's definitely gonna be more opportunities for both us and Ferrari.\n\n\"The Constructors' [Championship] I would say is still open. We're still a third of the way through the year. So it's definitely still all to play for. I would say, of course, we're at a bit of a disadvantage being as far back as we are, but it's certainly not impossible. And yeah, I think even in the Drivers' Championship, it's not done and dusted yet. If you were to say anyone apart from Max [Verstappen] being the favorite, it's probably ambitious.\n\n\"But I don't think either championship is over by any means.\"\n\nWhile Piastri told me that Montreal could be another circuit where McLaren shows some pace, this could be another difficult weekend for Red Bull. According to Senior Advisor Dr. Helmut Marko, the team could struggle this weekend. In his weekly debrief for Speedweek, Marko predicted that Red Bull could struggle in the Canadian Grand Prix.\n\n\"The problem starts in the simulator, which indicated that the car was going over the curbs perfectly. Simply put, that means that the simulator and reality don't correlate. And Monaco wasn't the first race track where we had this problem; it was the first time that it was relatively severe in Singapore. The simulator spat out something that didn't correspond to reality. That's the first point we'll address,\" wrote Marko.\n\n\"We are optimistic that we can at least find out why the simulator produces data that does not correspond to reality. But Montreal could also be a difficult weekend for us.\"\n\nGame on in Montreal.\n\nWhen the 2024 F1 season began, the upcoming driver transfer market looked like the major source of drama. While the potential for a true title fight has changed that calculation, speculation continues apace regarding next year's driver grid.\n\nWill we see more news on that front this week in Montreal?\n\nThe answer to that is yes, as Alpine announced Monday morning that the team will part ways with Esteban Ocon at the end of the 2024 season.\n\nAs of this moment only two teams -- Ferrari and McLaren -- have truly settled their lineups for 2025. Aston Martin is a strong contender for the third team on that list, as Fernando Alonso has signed a new deal with the team and Lance Stroll is likely assured of a spot for next year.\n\nOutside of those teams, however, every other team on the grid has at least one spot that remains unsettled.\n\nThe two biggest seats on the grid -- the seat Lewis Hamilton is vacating at Mercedes and Sergio P\u00e9rez's current spot at Red Bull -- are the most coveted. Mercedes seems to be taking their time with a decision, as they evaluate all options including young phenom Andrea Kimi Antonelli, so we might not hear news on that front this weekend.\n\nAs for Red Bull, however, the team sent some signals on social media that perhaps news is coming regarding a new deal for P\u00e9rez. Will that come to fruition over these next few days?\n\nOver the past few weeks, the word out of Brackley has been \"progress.\"\n\nAs Mercedes rolled out a series of upgrades, starting with the Miami Grand Prix, the team has shown some minor steps forward. Perhaps their biggest step forward came in Monaco as the team banked 17 points with George Russell's P5 and Hamilton's P7, the team's best points tally on a non-sprint weekend this season.\n\n\"That was the best race of our season so far. We had good pace and were able to show that near the end, despite being on 70-lap old Medium [tires],\" said Russell after the Monaco Grand Prix. \"We were closing on the top four at the end and only finished a handful of seconds off P1. There are plenty of positives to take from the weekend as a whole.\"\n\n\"There have been plenty of encouraging signs from our performance this weekend. The team has worked so hard to bring updates to the car and we've got more to come across the next few races,\" described Hamilton. \"We have taken a step forward with the car and, if we can continue to make a few more, then we can hopefully get ourselves into the fight with the three teams ahead of us.\"\n\nCan Mercedes continue -- or even accelerate -- this progress starting in Montreal? The team added a new front wing for Russell's W15 in Monaco, and Hamilton will have that upgrade on his car for the Canadian Grand Prix. That could mean another big step forward for the Silver Arrows this week.\n\n\"Overall, the weekend was another indication that we are moving in the right direction. We were just 25 milliseconds off P3 in Qualifying, which is an annoying margin to miss out on a likely podium by,\" said Trackside Engineering Director Andrew Shovlin following the Monaco Grand Prix. \"That said, a few weeks ago we couldn't even talk about podiums. We'll have both cars on the latest updates in Montreal with a few additional bits on top. We'll keep working hard and hopefully better results are not far away.\"\n\nA season ago, the fight for seventh between Williams, Haas, Alfa Romeo (now Sauber), and AlphaTauri (now VCARB) might have been the most thrilling battle on the grid. Williams emerged victorious in that fight, fending off a late charge from AlphaTauri down the stretch.\n\nA similar fight for seventh is shaping up yet again.\n\nRight now it is Haas in that spot, as they sit seventh in the Constructors' Championship with seven points on the year. Williams and Alpine sit eighth and ninth, respectively, with a pair of points each. Williams has the advantage due to Albon's P9 in the Monaco Grand Prix the last time out.\n\nSauber rounds out the field, yet to open their account this season.\n\nBut with these four teams bunched so closely, it all remains to play for in the important battle for seventh. And there are millions of dollars on the line in this fight. While exact payouts are not known, Williams received an estimated $87 million for finishing seventh a season ago, while AlphaTauri received an estimated $78 million.\n\nHaas, the last-place finishers a season ago, received an estimated $60 million.\n\nCanada was kind to Williams a season ago, as Albon's seventh-place finish was one of the team's best results of the year. The quick and flowing Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve, with a number of long straights, suited the FW45, the team's challenger a year ago. While Williams believes the FW46 is a more well-rounded car, this could be a weekend where Williams has an advantage.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"},

But probably a little bit better than [Monaco].\n\n\"[We'll be weaker at] any track that is bumpy or has kerbs, or you have to ride a lot of kerbs, so the street circuits will probably be a little bit tricky. But hopefully by then we have a little bit of understanding of what is going on.\"\n\nDespite Verstappen's assertions, Horner stated that Red Bull had historically performed well at Montreal and hoped that the team's understanding from Monaco could help to continue that form.\n\nHe agreed with Verstappen, who has won the past two Canadian Grands Prix, that the resurfacing could throw up a few curveballs but and noted the increasing challenge from the teams behind it in the championship.\n\n\"It's a track that we've performed well at previously. They've resurfaced the whole circuit again. So let's see,\" Horner said.\n\n\"But Ferrari, McLaren, they're quick. It was always going to happen that there was going to be convergence. This has been a tough weekend, but we're still leading both championships.\n\n\"We'll look to take the lessons out of this weekend and apply to the next one.\n\n\"[Canada is] very much traction, historically was there, but with a new surface you don't know what the balance is going to swing to.\"\n\nRed Bull advisor Helmut Marko explained that the key issue behind Red Bull's struggles on bumpy circuits was due to a correlation issue with the simulator, in which virtual set-ups that offered good kerb-riding traits did not translate to the real world.\n\nThe Austrian reckoned that the team would be able to tap into its previous dominance when the calendar returns to Barcelona in June.\n\n\"The basic problem is not the tracks, but the fact that the correlation between the simulator and the track doesn't work. In the simulator, we drive over the kerbs without any problems,\" he said.\n\n\"Here, let's use the Verstappen expression, the car bounces like a kangaroo. That's the problem, which was also evident in the set-up at Miami and partly in Imola.\n\n\"That's where we need to start, but we believe that when we get to real circuits like Barcelona, for example, we'll find our way back to our old form.\"", "source": {"uri": "motorsport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Motorsport.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre_Dame_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Notre Dame Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Notre Dame Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Magnussen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Street circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmut_Marko", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helmut Marko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imola", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Contract_Manufacturing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Contract Manufacturing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Software", "label": "dmoz/Science/Software", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Software/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Science/Software/Simulation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://cdn-2.motorsport.com/images/amp/01WLWR5Y/s6/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618133", "eventUri": "eng-9618133", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Horner was cleared of any wrongdoing after Red Bull hired an external investigator to look into the complaint.\n\nHis accuser has since appealed that decision and an outcome to that process has yet to be made public. Design guru Adrian Newey then announced his decision to leave the team ahead of the 2025 season.\n\nRecent races have also proven to be disappointing, with No.1 driver Max Verstappen losing out to Lando Norris in the Miami Grand Prix. The Dutchman then finished a lowly sixth in the Monaco Grand Prix last weekend, his worst result in a race he has completed since 2022.\n\nAnd F1 legend Brundle believes that the issues around the team are now beginning to affect results. He insisted that Red Bull should now be looking over their shoulder in both the drivers and constructors championships.\n\n\"It was [Charles] Leclerc's first victory in 39 races believe it or not, and he also broke a string of failing to win from his previous 12 pole positions. But he put in a perfect performance from the first lap of practice until the last lap of the race,\" Brundle told Sky Sports.\n\n\"Ferrari and McLaren are on a fine run, both teams and driver pairings looking very cohesive, focused, and well structured. This means that Red Bull are very much looking in their rear mirrors in both the Drivers' and Constructors' Championships and it appears to be game-on with so many races to come.\n\nbHAVE YOUR SAY! Who will win the Canadian Grand Prix? Comment below.\n\n\"I personally have no doubt that the internal events at Red Bull have detracted from their recent performances, and they'll be desperately keen to resume normal service in Montreal next time out.\"\n\nHorner has admitted that his team need to take a look in the mirror to turn around their form. He branded the race at Monaco a \"poor day\" and insisted he would be pouring over the data to find out why.\n\n\"Obviously this race is won on a Saturday and that's where we had a poor day,\" Horner said. \"We need to understand that, understand what the issues were with the ride and the kerbs.\n\n\"It was a very static race, the top 10 finished where they started from, the red flag effectively killed the race because everybody was going to run to the end of the race, so we have some lessons to take out of this weekend and learn from obviously.\n\n\"This circuit [Monaco] hasn't played to our strengths, and we need to understand what are those weaknesses and how do we address them. It's a continual process once you are into the law of diminishing returns, and of course your focus changes depending on what your weaknesses are.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishmirror.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_leeks@irishmirror.ie", "name": "Jacob Leeks", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Brundle", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Martin Brundle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Horner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christian Horner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Newey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Newey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monaco Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_position", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pole position"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://i2-prod.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article32953224.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_brundle-55.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618133", "eventUri": "eng-9618133", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Checo's overly ambitious bid to take the lead at Turn 1 ended in a collision and a first-lap retirement.\n\nMax Verstappen marched on to a record 16th win of the season, and Daniel Ricciardo, the man openly in contention to one day take P\u00e9rez's seat, put in the best performance yet since returning to F1.\n\nWith three races in the next four weeks to end the season, F1 2023 still has plenty of big storylines brewing, many of which came up in the post-Mexico mailbag. Let's get into it.\n\nEditor's note: Questions have been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nAlright, we all want to know: is Checo P\u00e9rez getting fired? -- Zee I.\n\nP\u00e9rez claimed after Austin that he still had a lot of untapped potential after altering his approach in response to his post-summer break struggles. On home soil, Mexico was the ideal weekend for him to make good on that promise -- only to end in tears when he tried going around the outside of two cars at Turn 1.\n\nWe saw the footage on the TV feed of P\u00e9rez talking to Christian Horner on the Red Bull pit wall after his retirement. Horner said he told P\u00e9rez, \"You're going for the lead in your home race, you wouldn't be a racing driver if you weren't going for it.\"\n\nWhile true, it was also an ample opportunity thrown away. The Red Bull clearly had the pace to take P\u00e9rez to the podium, which would have pretty much sewn up P2 in the championship. Now the gap to Lewis Hamilton is just 20 points - a margin that, with the Mercedes' recent pace, could easily be wiped away.\n\nFor the second week in a row, Horner denied P\u00e9rez would lose his seat if he didn't finish as runner-up in the standings, claiming it was \"not as binary as that.\"\n\n\"Checo has an agreement with us for next year, and that's our intention, for him to be in the car in 2024,\" Horner added.\n\n\"Intention\" was the word that stood out. Yes, Red Bull wants to have him in the car next year. But if the performances show no sign of lifting upwards in the final three races, and if he were to lose second in the championship, would that force a rethink?\n\nP\u00e9rez's form this year hasn't cost Red Bull anything in the constructors' championship, thanks to Verstappen's domination. The world champion has twice as many points (480) as P\u00e9rez. But the team cannot assume that will be the case next year. In the event a Ferrari, Mercedes or McLaren emerges as a more regular, serious threat, the second driver becomes important again for Red Bull's title hopes.\n\nDo you think if Daniel Ricciardo can keep this momentum for the rest of the season, he can be a real contender for a 2024 Red Bull seat? -- Benqian W.\n\nAnd here's the other side of the narrative. Daniel Ricciardo couldn't have timed his best performance since returning to F1 in July any better. Hitting a new peak in his comeback right when the driver whose seat he is trying to take suffers his most significant setback yet? That's the kind of story \"Drive to Survive\" lives for.\n\nI asked Horner after the race what he thought of Ricciardo's weekend. He called the Australian's form in Mexico \"outstanding\" and that \"it looked like the Daniel of old\" -- a ringing endorsement of Red Bull's decision to bring him back into the fold this year.\n\nIt certainly fuels the possibility of Ricciardo being a real contender to replace P\u00e9rez for 2024. Remember: the way Red Bull operates its F1 contracts allows it to move its drivers across both Red Bull Racing and AlphaTauri, which is why previous swaps (Verstappen and Daniil Kvyat in 2016; Alex Albon and Pierre Gasly in 2019) have been so straightforward.\n\nRicciardo said upon his return to the F1 grid with AlphaTauri in July that it was a move with 2025 in mind - when he wants to be back in a Red Bull. Now, he has the chance to build on his impressive Mexico weekend through the final three races and make a compelling argument to Red Bull he's ready to return to the seat he vacated at the end of 2018.\n\nIt'll take more than one strong weekend in Mexico to make a strong enough case. But if Ricciardo can replicate that form in the final three races, potentially lifting AlphaTauri from last to seventh in the constructors' single-handedly, it would be a big statement -- and surely put Ricciardo at the front of the queue should Red Bull waver on its \"intention\" to field P\u00e9rez next year.\n\nAt what point is Fernando Alonso going to lose faith and retire? Aston Martin has gone from second quickest to arguably slowest in alarmingly quick time. He can't go through another year fighting for minor points at best, can he? -- Greg S.\n\nThe rate at which Aston Martin has slipped back this year has been shocking. Alonso's season swung from being a correct pit call away from victory in Monaco to struggling to score points. The team has gone from P2 to P5 in the constructors', while Alonso could fall as far as eighth in the drivers' standings before the season ends.\n\nThe Spaniard admitted after the race that Aston Martin now has nothing to fight for in the final three races. That's a far cry from his tune a few races ago, when he thought McLaren was being overconfident believingit would pass for fourth in the championship. That aged like milk.\n\nAlonso always knew this would be a long-term project at Aston Martin. He said earlier in the season that fighting for podiums was his expectation for year two, not year one, suggesting he always had patience going into this project.\n\nBut as you rightly say, fighting for minor points is not where Alonso wants to be. Aston Martin needs to replicate its impressive winter step into 2023 heading into 2024, only this time, there's greater competition with McLaren in the mix. It's going to make it tough.\n\nI think the early part of next year will be critical for Alonso's faith in the Aston Martin project. He's got the taste of podiums and competing at the front again. It's a hunger he'll want to ensure is satisfied.\n\nDo Lando Norris and McLaren have the pace to win a race this season? -- Alex M.\n\nWithout a few factors going their way, no, I don't think Norris or McLaren can win any of the final three races. But that's chiefly because of how utterly dominant the Verstappen/Red Bull combination continues to be.\n\nNorris is performing at a ridiculously high level right now. His fightback in Mexico was superb, and he'd have been on the podium without his messy qualifying. He spoke in Austin about the chance of winning this year and said the best opportunity had passed by in Qatar when he was frustrated to miss out on pole and have a chance at challenging Verstappen.\n\nThe Brazil sprint weekend could throw a few curveballs that present an opportunity to the chasing pack. Mercedes should do well at Interlagos -- George Russell won there last year -- but the McLaren car is increasingly looking like the best all-rounder and second-quickest car. Even when the team downplays its chances going into a weekend, it does so with Verstappen in mind. Podiums through the rest of the season remain possible.\n\nIt's been a mighty turnaround by McLaren this year. I just don't think it'll quite be enough to win a race before the season is out when Verstappen and Red Bull are in the form they are.\n\nWhat is the fewest amount of grand prix winners in an F1 season? What other records are on the table if Verstappen wins the remaining races? -- Wing C.\n\nWe've never had a season where fewer than three drivers have won races, which 2023 will tie unless someone besides Verstappen, P\u00e9rez or Carlos Sainz wins one of the last three races.\n\nMercedes' domination in the first years of the V6 hybrid era meant F1 only got three different winners in 2014 (Lewis Hamilton, Nico Rosberg and Ricciardo) and 2015 (Hamilton, Rosberg and Sebastian Vettel).\n\nTechnically, the 1950 F1 season only had two 'grand prix' winners. Nino Farina and Juan Manuel Fangio each won three grands prix, with the seventh round being the Indianapolis 500 (which was not run to grand prix regulations but was still part of the championship.)\n\nIf Verstappen wins the remaining races, he'll finish with 19 wins for the season and a win ratio of 86 percent, smashing the record of 75 percent held by Alberto Ascari from 1952, when he won six out of eight races. Verstappen only needs to win one of the last three races to beat that landmark.\n\nSweeping the remaining races would put Verstappen clear of Alain Prost and Sebastian Vettel on the all-time wins list with 54 victories, only leaving Michael Schumacher (91) and Hamilton (103) to beat.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The calls for evolution have only grown stronger in the wake of a race stifled by an early red flag, that ended with the top 10 cars finishing exactly where they started.\n\nIt was understandably one of the biggest topics in our post-race mailbag. But there are plenty of other major storylines brewing in F1, be it the tension at Alpine after Esteban Ocon's collision with Pierre Gasly or the pending movement in the driver market. Here are some of your biggest questions answered.\n\nEditor's note: questions have been lightly edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nWhat are the chances of a track layout change at Monaco to allow the chances of more overtaking? It's clear the track isn't going away anytime soon, but a couple more straights would give more opportunities to overtake. -- Chris L.\n\nWill F1 actually try to make changes to the format or track to make it more exciting? Would Monaco allow that to happen? It seems like Monaco has more leverage than other tracks on the calendar and may be resistant to any changes. -- Eric D.\n\nChanging the layout in Monaco is something F1 has explored multiple times, particularly in recent years, given the current generation of large, wide cars. But, with the confines of Monaco, it's always something that has proven almost impossible to make a reality.\n\nThe race is already one of the most difficult weekends on the calendar from a logistical and planning point of view, squeezing the paddock into a small patch of land alongside the harbor. To try and find any new routes or make the track wider at all is going to be a serious challenge, but I anticipate it's something this year's bore-fest will reignite.\n\nMonaco, as a race, has traditionally been quite resistant to change. When its previous contract was agreed after the 2022 race, there were a number of terms that changed to bring it closer in line with other races on the calendar, such as an increased hosting fee (albeit still at a comparatively low rate) and even smaller things such as allowance for the TV helicopter to fly over the harbor.\n\nAt a time when new events are redefining what it means to host a great grand prix, it's harder for Monaco to simply lean on its history and prestige and not get with the times. Both Madeline and I wrote about its significance, but that cannot be a free pass to avoid change.\n\nAs Christian Horner put it on the Friday of race week: \"To protect the next 70 years here, I think there needs to be some evolution.\" - Luke Smith\n\nIs this race (Monaco) a good sign that Max Verstappen won't run away with it this year? -- Dylan S.\n\nAs Luke wrote last week (and I wholeheartedly agree with), the last three races give F1 a glimmer of hope that Verstappen won't run away with the title like he has in previous seasons. Imola and Monaco highlighted some of the weaknesses in the RB20, like bumps and how it rides over curbs. But Verstappen said in Monaco, \"For the last few years, we had a car advantage, and it gets masked a little bit.\"\n\nBut it's more than just a \"fundamental problem,\" which Verstappen noted has existed with the car since the regulations changed in 2022. The gap at the front seems to be narrowing as McLaren and Ferrari make gains, but as Carlos Sainz noted, \"My common sense tells me that on normal tracks, Red Bull should still be favorites. Not domination, like we were seeing, hopefully not. But favorites, yes.\" -- Madeline Coleman\n\nRumors are swirling that Esteban Ocon will get benched because of his reckless attempt at overtaking Pierre Gasly. When was the last time something like that happened, and do you think it's a real possibility here? -- Luke S.\n\nThe situation at Alpine is proving to be one of the most intriguing 'backfield' storylines so far this season. The team is going through a lot of change while struggling on track, making every point more precious than before -- and Ocon's lunge all the more costly, given a double-points finish would surely have been on the cards.\n\nTeam principal Bruno Famin's in-race chat to French TV station Canal+ in Monaco sparked talk of Ocon potentially being benched for Canada when he warned there would be \"consequences.\" Alpine then announced today that Ocon would be leaving the team at the end of the season, but this has been on the cards for some time and was not a direct response to what happened in Monaco, although it would have undoubtedly been some kind of factor.\n\nWe know Ocon will be in the car for Canada and the rest of the season, but I'd still anticipate there to be firmer team orders in place in response to what happened in Monaco.\n\nThe last time a driver sat out a race because of their on-track behavior was in 2012 when Romain Grosjean sat out the Italian Grand Prix after causing a multi-car accident at the first corner at Spa. But this was due to the race stewards at the time opting to hand him a race ban instead of his team, Lotus, taking the decision itself. - Luke Smith\n\nIs there any potential for Yuki Tsunoda to jump into a Red Bull Racing seat with his recent great performances? Is there an opportunity to jump into another seat for 2025? -- Wing C.\n\nI fully agree that Tsunoda's performances this year for RB have been fantastic. He's been quietly ticking away with regular points finishes, typically a step ahead of Daniel Ricciardo, and has a consistency that was lacking in the early part of his career.\n\nBut there's still zero sign that he's in contention for a Red Bull F1 seat anytime soon. Everything points to Sergio P\u00e9rez getting another contract extension for next year, meaning barring a shock exit for Max Verstappen, Red Bull will run the same line-up for a fifth consecutive season and leave no room elsewhere.\n\nP\u00e9rez is a known quantity for Red Bull, while Tsunoda's past inconsistency and temper flare-ups have always left some reservations among the top players at Red Bull. As much as he's been working to change that on track, particularly this year with some success, there's still never been much of a push for him to move up to the senior team.\n\nIn Monaco, Tsunoda said he was \"very happy\" with RB and that he felt a \"big loyalty\" to the Red Bull program, given its support of him. But he admitted he'd consider an alternative offer that could present him a better opportunity for the future, and also noted the upcoming link between Honda, which has backed him since Formula Four, and Aston Martin from 2026. \"It's pretty open,\" Tsunoda said. \"But so far, I'm happy with (RB).\"\n\nI'd love to see what Tsunoda could do with a top-tier car. He's quick and has clearly matured since his early days of radio rage in F1. For next year, sticking with RB looks to be the best bet. -- Luke Smith\n\nAs a follow-up, what has Perez done right to apparently be offered a new contract? -- Chris L.\n\nThe dream scenario for any reigning championship team is having drivers consistently score the maximum points every weekend. For Red Bull, that means when Verstappen is consistently bagging wins with healthy margins (though there are a few outliers this year), Sergio P\u00e9rez needs to be right there with the Dutchman.\n\nHe successfully did so at the start of the year, scoring four podium finishes in five races. Heading into the Chinese Grand Prix weekend, it looked like P\u00e9rez had made a step forward and found consistency. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said that weekend, \"I think he's worked hard over the winter. He's come in with a change, perhaps, slightly to his approach to grand prix weekends, and he's been very close in the four races so far this season, particularly at a track like Suzuka, where last year he struggled quite a bit, but certainly this year he was very competitive.\"\n\nIn Monaco, questions already began about whether a downward spiral would start. P\u00e9rez qualified P11 in Imola the week before, and P\u00e9rez qualified P11, his worst qualifying position so far this year. When asked if he was concerned about the potential of a downward spiral forming, Horner expressed confidence in his driver.\n\n\"No, I don't think so. I think he's driven very well so far this year. Obviously, Imola was a tricky qualifying or a tricky Saturday for him, going back to FP3. But I think when you look at the drives that he's put in across a variance of circuits this year, he's performing well. So in the fullness of time, we'll work out what we're going to do.\"\n\nMonaco turned out worse, as we all know, but it's worth remembering that P\u00e9rez was only half a second off of P1 in Q1. That's how fine the margins were in Monaco. Horner said after Monaco, \"This weekend's been pretty brutal for him. Yeah, I mean, obviously, we need to make sure that we have got both cars up there scoring points, because we cannot dismiss the threat of Ferrari and McLaren in both championships.\"\n\nImola and Monaco are blips for P\u00e9rez, but his performance at the beginning of the season shows why he should still be in contention for a new contract. He brings stability to Red Bull and is well-liked in the team. While they have had on-track moments in the past, it's been civil between P\u00e9rez and Verstappen.\n\nIt'll come down to whether P\u00e9rez can bounce back because he has shown that he can score consistent points to help build a margin to teams surging behind. -- Madeline Coleman\n\nIt's just been announced that Gene Haas is suspending operations of his Stewart-Haas Racing team in the NASCAR Cup Series. While this will not have an immediate impact on the Haas F1 Team's performance, does this, in the long term, possibly lead to a better future for a Haas team, one with more direct funding and more success, from points finishes all the way to that first potential win? -- Craig R.\n\nHonest question. Is there evidence that the NASCAR team was diverting resources or attention away from the F1 operation? -- Franco T.\n\nLast week, news broke in the NASCAR world that Stewart-Haas Racing is closing its operations at the end of the 2024 season. Our colleagues Jeff Gluck and Jordan Bianchi reported that the move was anticipated for weeks. But the move understandably prompted questions about Gene Haas's other motorsports team over in F1.\n\nWhen I contacted Haas F1 to see if the NASCAR decision would impact the F1 operations, a spokesperson said, \"Business as usual for Haas F1 Team - Gene fully engaged and committed.\"\n\nIt's worth remembering that Haas reportedly is a billionaire, and it's his call on how to invest in the operations. When I visited the US F1 headquarters in North Carolina last fall, actual F1-focused employees were scarce, but I noticed quite a few SHR employees working around Xfinity driver Riley Herbst's car. It sounds strange to hear NASCAR-focused employees outweighing F1 in the F1 factory, but Haas' F1 operations are split across three countries.\n\nTherefore, as unfortunate as it is for the NASCAR

This has led Sainz to seek new opportunities in Formula 1's competitive grid. Amidst this transition, the Spaniard has sparked interest from several teams, reflecting his valued skill set and strong performances. Today, however, Sergio Perez has been confirmed for an extended contract at Red Bull, and this decision to extend the Mexican driver's contract through 2026 has closed this door for Sainz, as Perez continues to demonstrate his worth with notable achievements such as five wins and 29 podiums.\n\nInitially eyed by the Milton Keynes outfit, Sainz's future seemed promising. Helmut Marko, Red Bull's consultant, noted the serious consideration for him.\n\n\"We're talking to him; he's having his strongest season in Formula One. But he has a very lucrative offer from Audi that we can't match or beat,\" Marko admitted ahead of the Chinese Grand Prix. However, Red Bull's recent decision to extend Sergio Perez's contract through 2026 has closed this door for Sainz, as Perez continues to demonstrate his worth with notable achievements such as five wins and 29 podiums.\n\nChristian Horner, Red Bull's team principal, expressed contentment with their current line-up in a press release from the team:\n\n\"Now is an important time to confirm our line-up for 2024 and we are very pleased to continue working together with Checo.

Last year was a unicorn season and we will need to work hard to retain our titles, but we are assured in our lineup and with the Team as a whole, which is imperative in what is shaping up to be a close-fought Championship this year.\"\n\nPerez himself expressed his satisfaction with Red Bull's decision, valuing the prolonged partnership and its potential.\n\n\"I am really happy to commit my future to this great Team, it is a challenge like no other racing for Oracle Red Bull Racing, both on track and off track. I am delighted to be staying here to continue our journey together and contribute to this Team's great historical record for two more years.\n\n\"Being part of the Team is an immense challenge, and one I love.

However, what his fans probably won't know is that the Dutchman is also a keen follower of the art of Equestrian mastery.\n\nThe Longines Global Champions Tour (LGCT) is one of the most prestigious show-jumping series in the world. And just like Formula 1, the LGCT is a world championship that features 15 rounds all over the globe.\n\nFor the Grand Prix of Ramatuelle/St Tropez, German equestrian Max Kuhner mesmerized the fans in attendance as he grabbed the win. As it turns out, Verstappen was also in attendance as the two Grand Prix winners and namesakes came face to face.\n\nVerstappen's outing at the LGCT Grand Prix was not a sponsor obligation. Rather, it seemed like a good day of distraction before the Canadian GP next weekend. Red Bull have struggled for performance during the last few races, and Montreal could be more of the same.\n\nThe last three races have exposed the RB20 and the limitations that the ground-effects Red Bull cars have had.

Mandatory Credit: Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports / Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAccording to former F1 driver and Sky Sports F1 Germany pundit Ralf Schumacher, Sergio Perez's role at Red Bull Racing extends beyond his performance on the track; it significantly impacts the team's finances, specifically in managing the hefty salary of teammate Max Verstappen. The three-time F1 champion commands an impressive annual salary of $70 million, according to Forbes, placing a substantial financial demand on Red Bull Racing.\n\nSchumacher recently shed light on the critical financial dynamics within the Austrian team. He pointed out the importance of Perez's contribution through his sponsorship deals. He explained, as quoted by Planet F1:\n\n\"You shouldn't forget, as long as Max Verstappen stays, that's what I've heard at least once, the budget limits are relatively tight at Red Bull, and Perez brings money.\"\n\nThe team is reportedly heavily reliant on Perez's sponsorship influx from heavyweights like Disney, Telcel, Mobil, Claro, Nescaf\u00e9, and KitKat.\n\nDespite the crucial financial role he plays, Perez's recent performances have raised concerns. However, it is still anticipated that the Mexican driver remains the first choice for the team. Speaking about Perez's current performance and recent struggles, team principal Christian Horner commented:\n\n\"Well, look, I mean, this weekend's been pretty brutal for him.\n\n\"We need to make sure that we've got both cars up there scoring points, because we cannot dismiss the threat of Ferrari and McLaren in both championships.\"\n\nPerez, whilst speaking with Sky Sports F1 in April, also commented:\n\n\"I'm very relaxed about it. It's my 14th season in F1. Whatever comes next, I'm really pleased with what I've done in the sport so far and I believe it will be a matter of time.\n\n\"The driver market is moving and the next few weeks, there will be a lot of movement for sure.

Mandatory Credit: Peter Casey-USA TODAY Sports / Peter Casey-USA TODAY Sports\n\nRalf Schumacher has openly encouraged Max Verstappen to consider a move from Red Bull to Mercedes, citing potential benefits for both the driver and the team post-Monaco Grand Prix. Such a move could significantly alter the landscape of Formula 1, especially with the reported internal disputes happening within the Milton Keynes team.\n\nThe implications of such a high-profile move are substantial. Verstappen, currently with Red Bull -- a team that has consistently provided him with a championship-contending car since the change in regulations in 2022 -- could transform the dynamics within the F1 paddock. Ralf Schumacher's viewpoint carries weight, considering his deep insights into the operational cultures of top-tier racing teams like Mercedes.

Here's what you need to know:\n\nMarko's comments about P\u00e9rez after the Italian Grand Prix sparked widespread condemnation through the F1 paddock, and sparked a big fan backlash on social media.\n\nThe 80-year-old has a senior role within the Red Bull group as its motorsport adviser, playing a key role in the development of young drivers and deciding who races for its two F1 teams, Red Bull Racing and AlphaTauri.\n\nMarko apologized both publicly and directly to P\u00e9rez. The driver said Thursday in Singapore that he was not personally offended by the comments, and that he had a good personal relationship with Marko.\n\nRed Bull's F1 team principal, Christian Horner, said on Sky Sports on Friday that Marko's comments \"weren't right,\" and explained the team did not issue a statement because he was not an employee of the team -- but instead is part of the Red Bull group.\n\n\"He's not an employee of Red Bull Racing, so in terms of why didn't we put out a statement,\" Horner said. \"He's part of the Red Bull wider group, and the group issued that apology through the (Red Bull-owned) ServusTV channel.\"\n\nThe FIA took action by issuing Marko with a written warning over the comments. Article 1.2 of the FIA's Code of Ethics states: \"There shall be no discrimination between participants to the FIA activities on the basis of race, skin color, gender, sexual orientation, ethnic or social origin, language, religion, philosophical or political opinion, family situation or disability.\"\n\nBeyond the warning against Marko, the FIA has an Ethics Committee that can investigate alleged breaches of its Ethics Code \"upon complaints from one of the FIA parties or third parties.\"\n\nThe lack of action from Red Bull over Marko's comments drew criticism from Mercedes F1 driver Lewis Hamilton, F1's only Black driver, who has been the sport's leading voice on inclusion and combatting racism in recent years.\n\nHamilton said to Sky Sports on Thursday in Singapore that Marko's comments were \"completely unacceptable\" and there \"needs to be more done\" than just giving an apology.\n\nHamilton's Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, said Friday: \"It's not only what has been said, but it's the mindset, that you can even come out with these things.\n\n\"That hasn't got any place in Formula 1.

At such a time, the Milton-Keynes-based outfit needs both its drivers to perform at the highest level. But with Sergio Perez's form dipping recently, Team Principal Christian Horner may have to make a decision about the Mexican's future soon.\n\nF1 expert Peter Windsor was recently asked to share his opinion on whether Horner should consider sacking Perez on Cameron's F1 YouTube channel. Windsor replied,\n\n\"Only if he wants Carlos Sainz in that car. Only if he thinks that he is possibly going to need to ramp up the overall pace of the two drivers together as a combination. And he may well be thinking that\".\n\nSainz is looking for an F1 seat himself, as Lewis Hamilton will be replacing him on the team in 2025. A top team in his mind, Red Bull could be the perfect destination for the Madrid-born driver. Especially, if he wants to win races.\n\nHowever, Horner has been vocal about wanting to keep Perez on the team. Taking his comments on the Mexican in 2024 into consideration, Perez's future with the Austrian stable looks to be safe, for now.\n\nIn 2023, Horner criticized Perez and asked him to improve his overall performance to avoid getting sacked. However, his tone towards the Guadalajara-born driver seems to have changed recently. Horner has even begun complimenting Perez more when he brings in good results for the team.\n\nAs such, a dip in form doesn't bother Horner too much.

The full extent of Red Bull's current \"problem\" with its 2024 model may not emerge until after the upcoming Canadian Grand Prix.\n\nDr. Helmut Marko is apprehensive about the team's downturn in competitive performance recently seen in Monaco.\n\nDuring the Monaco Grand Prix, Marko highlighted an inconsistency between the car's simulated and actual handling on rough track surfaces - bumps and big kerbs. This issue was identified when the car's handling deficiencies became apparent, and it was realized that these could not be quickly resolved.\n\n\"If we change the (ride) height, we lose a lot of downforce,\" Marko explained to Sport1. \"That's why we are limited in this area. We mainly focused on aerodynamic efficiency when designing our car.\"\n\n\"However, we believe that we will still have the advantage on conventional tracks like Barcelona. If not, then we really do have a problem.\"\n\nWhile Montreal is a speedier track than Monaco, it shares the characteristic bumps and heavy kerb use, which Marko acknowledges might pose \"another difficult race\" for Red Bull.\n\n\"We understand the problems,\" he reported to motorsport-magazin.com, \"but we do not understand why they exist.\n\n\"Obviously this happened to us in Singapore 2023 as well.\"\n\nSince Monaco, Marko notes that engineers have been intensively working on adjustments.\n\n\"I think we will go to Canada with a different basic setting,\" he disclosed, \"so that it is not as stiff as in Monaco. That practically cost us the entire first day of practice.\"\n\nAnother challenge, Marko points out, is the financial impact of Sergio Perez's crash in Monaco, which has significantly strained the team's development budget.\n\n\"Of course there will be another upgrade,\" he stated, \"but that is now all under the condition that we have three million less. But the package is already in the works because we have to do something extra due to the stronger Ferrari and McLaren.\"\n\nDespite these challenges, Marko remains confident in one key asset. \"On circuits where we will not be very competitive, we can always count on the Verstappen factor,\" the 81-year-old expressed. \"Max is currently in top form and he can make the difference.\"\n\nID:545066:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect2694:", "source": {"uri": "sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Mole"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gmm_f1@sportsmole.co.uk", "name": "Gmm F1", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmut_Marko", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Helmut Marko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monaco Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downforce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downforce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Ferrari", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Kit_Cars_and_Replicas", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Kit Cars and Replicas", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image_Galleries", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image Galleries", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/RC", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/RC", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://sm.imgix.net/24/10/helmut-marko.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618133", "eventUri": "eng-9618133", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 98, "relevance": 1}

A specialist barrister was appointed to look into the claims and found in Horner's favour, with Red Bull GmBH dismissing the claim. The employee in question was subsequently suspended, but has appealed the outcome of the investigation.\n\nThe furore not only placed huge pressure on Horner - with Verstappen's father, Jos, calling publicly for the Englishman to resign - it also raised questions about Verstappen's future.\n\nThe three-time world champion is under contract at Red Bull until 2028 but has been courted assiduously by Mercedes, who have held off naming a replacement for Ferrari-bound Lewis Hamilton partly to see whether they might be able to prise the world champion from Red Bull.\n\nHamilton's defection to Ferrari to replace Sainz opened up the possibility of the Spaniard returning to the Red Bull family, having driven for sister team Toro Rosso from 2015-17. But if he does so now, it will be as Verstappen's replacement.\n\nVerstappen has so far played down talk of him leaving, saying in Miami last month that he was happy with Red Bull \"at the moment\" and stressing that for him the most important thing was team harmony and the competitiveness of the car.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it's not about money for me,\" the Dutch driver said. \"I'm already very happy of course with what I'm having at the team. It's really important about having the quickest car, and of course a good environment. That's what we have currently, and that's also what I asked for. As long as the environment is right and we have the quickest car, then it's quite straightforward.\"\n\n\"I know myself that if I will be driving for P5 or P6, you get quite grumpy with yourself. So, it's always about performance at the end of the day. I mean, everyone knows that, Toto [Wolff, Mercedes team principal] also knows that.\"\n\nIt is thought that if Verstappen does eventually leave for Mercedes, he is far more likely to do so in 2026, when new technical regulations come into effect. That is realistically Mercedes' next opportunity to be genuinely competitive, given how far behind they are at the moment. That said, there will be some interest in how Red Bull fare over the next month or two given the increased competitiveness of McLaren and Ferrari.\n\nMcLaren's Lando Norris and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc have won two of the last three races, and while Verstappen still has a healthy lead in the drivers' standings, the title race suddenly looks far more interesting. Red Bull will hope to show Verstappen and the world they are still the team to beat in Canada this weekend.\n\nIn the release regarding P\u00e9rez - who could qualify only 18th in Monaco last time out, before suffering a horrific opening lap crash - Red Bull noted that the Mexican, 34, enjoyed his most successful season in Formula One last year, finishing second in the drivers' championship. It was the first time the team had ever achieved a one-two finish in the drivers' championship.\n\nHorner emphasised his desire to see the pairing continue together. \"Continuity and stability are important for the team and Checo and Max are a successful and robust partnership, securing our first ever one-two finish for the Team in the Championship last year,\" he said. \"Checo has had a strong start to 2024 with second places in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Japan and then his podium in China. The past few races have been tough, there is convergence on the grid, but we are confident in Checo and look forward to his return to proven form and performance, that we so often see.\n\n\"Last year was a unicorn season and we will need to work hard to retain our titles, but we are assured in our line up and with the team as a whole, which is imperative in what is shaping up to be a close fought championship this year.\"\n\nP\u00e9rez, who has won five races since joining Red Bull in 2020, added: \"I want to thank everyone for all the trust they are putting in me, it is a lot and I want to pay it back with excellent results on track, and off track. I think we have a lot of work to do, we have a lot more championships to win together.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Horner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christian Horner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz in Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuderia_Toro_Rosso", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scuderia Toro Rosso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bahrain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bahrain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RgHdCmbB4OqfXK92NG7zyw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/0854f44401e89546c50056fdc150fe2f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9618133", "eventUri": "eng-9618133", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 455220844, "relevance": 2}

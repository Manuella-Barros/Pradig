His casting follows the recent announcement of Paul Walter Hauser also joining the film in a similarly undisclosed role.\n\nMalkovich is an acclaimed actor whose distinguished career spans several decades and a multitude of impactful roles in both film and theater. He is widely recognized for his performances in films such as Places in the Heart and In the Line of Fire, for which he received Academy Award nominations. Malkovich has also earned a Primetime Emmy Award for his role in Death of a Salesman, and has been nominated for a BAFTA Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and three Golden Globe Awards.\n\nMarvel Studios recently announced the cast for its Fantastic Four reboot, setting the stage for a new era of MCU adventures. Stepping into the roles of the beloved superhero team are Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards, Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm, Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Ben Grimm, and Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm.\n\nThe Fantastic Four characters were created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, with the team making its first comic book appearance in 1961. The previous Fantastic Four movies, while popular, were not well-received by fans or critics, and Marvel Studios has an opportunity to right the wrongs of the past and deliver a feature that is true to the spirit of the comics.\n\nBehind the scenes, The Fantastic Four will be brought to life under the direction of Matt Shakman, with Josh Friedman writing the screenplay. With production slated to begin in summer 2024, Marvel fans can look forward to the film's journey to theaters in July 2025, marking a new chapter in the MCU.\n\nFantastic Four opens on July 25, 2025.

However, we are getting to the point in casting where we don't know who is playing what and what is happening. The last bit of casting we got was for an unknown role, and now we have another one. According to Deadline, John Malkovich has reportedly joined the cast of The Fantastic Four. People will probably assume that Malkovich will be playing a villain role, considering he is an older man, but we don't know much about the plot of this film, so it's hard to tell one way or another. Some casting announcements will continue to pile well into production, so expect to get more of these before the year ends.\n\nOn Valentine's Day, Marvel Studios finally put all of us out of our collective misery and announced the cast of The Fantastic Four. The project was first announced in the summer of 2019, so people have wondered who would play Marvel's First Family since then. However, word finally came down, and we learned that the cast would include Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards (aka Mr. Fantastic), Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm (aka the Invisible Woman), Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm (aka the Human Torch) and Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Ben Grimm (aka the Thing). We also know that Matt Shakman is directing the project, and it currently has a release date of July 25, 2025, after some more release date shuffling that also occurred.

Details on how he will fit into the superhero movie are being kept under wraps for now.\n\nMalkovich has appeared in prominent movie roles since the '80s, and made a name for himself with projects like Of Mice and Men in 1992 and Being John Malkovich in 1999. More recently, the star was featured in Space Force, Bird Box, Burn After Reading, and Deepwater Horizon. The actor almost saw his Marvel debut with Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 4 before that film was eventually shelved.\n\nFantastic Four has been one of the most hotly anticipated MCU films since Marvel Studios announced it back in 2020. The supergroup, which has appeared in other live-action incarnations in the past, has never gotten their own standalone MCU entry, so Marvel has assembled a stellar crew to help introduce them.\n\nThe main cast of heroes includes Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards, Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm, Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Ben Grimm/The Thing, and Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm. We also learned that Ozark star Julia Garner will appear as the Silver Surfer with Paul Walter Hauser also attached in a mystery role, and with Malkovich now onboard, too, it's looking like Fantastic Four is primed to deliver a stacked list of names. This includes the fact that the movie is directed by WandaVision and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia alum Matt Shakman.\n\nFantastic Four comes to theaters on July 25, 2025.

Malkovich's casting is the second Fantastic Four casting in a row with no role attached, following the recent reported addition of Paul Walter Hauser to the film.\n\nThe core cast of Fantastic Four includes Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic, Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm/Invisible Woman, Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm/Human Torch, Eben Moss-Bachrach as Ben Grimm/Thing, and Julia Garner as Shalla-Bal/Silver Surfer.\n\nThis leaves the question of who Malkovich might be playing in the film. Given his age difference with Pedro Pascal (Malkovich is 70, Pascal is 49), it's unlikely he's playing Doctor Doom, who is usually depicted as Reed's college rival. There's the chance he's playing Galactus, who will almost certainly be in the film, given the presence of Julia Garner's Silver Surfer.\n\nMy personal pick, and it may be a long shot, but it's worth considering, is Ivan Kragoff/Red Ghost, a Soviet cosmonaut who is caught in the same so-called 'Cosmic Rays' that give the FF their powers. Along with his own power of intangibility, Kragoff also has three 'Super-Apes' who were also empowered by the Cosmic Rays. There's Igor the shapeshifting baboon, Mikhlo the invincible gorilla, and Peotr the telekinetic orangutan.\n\nWith the movie's apparent late '60s space race era setting, it's not the biggest stretch in the world to imagine a rival cosmonaut playing a role in the movie. And who doesn't love apes?\n\nWhoever he's playing, Malkovich's reputation as both a serious thespian and an actor who's willing to go out on a limb for the right concept precedes him. Malkovich is a two time Academy Award winner for best supporting actor, and also developed a cult following thanks in large part to the surreal conceptual film Being John Malkovich, in which he played a fictionalized version of himself. And of course, he's recently been playing a comedy role in Netflix's Space Force.\n\nFantastic Four is slated to release in July 2025.", "source": {"uri": "gamesradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "gamesradar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "george_marston@gamesradar.com", "name": "George Marston", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Malkovich", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Malkovich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reboot_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reboot (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Walter_Hauser", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Walter Hauser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Garner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julia Garner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Surfer_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver Surfer (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanessa_Kirby", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vanessa Kirby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doom (1993 video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimm_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grimm (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telekinesis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telekinesis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Force_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space Force (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Future Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space Race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ape", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orangutan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orangutan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gorilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_following", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cult following"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapeshifting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shapeshifting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surrealism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Quotations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fkg3uzWDdk4PTRy4485qTm-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554692", "eventUri": "eng-9554692", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

And their casting is getting, well, interesting. The latest to join the Matt Shakman film is someone that I never thought I would see in the MCU and yet here we are.\n\nTo be fair, this actor was almost a villain in the Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies. I am talking about John Malkovich, of course. Malkovich will be joining Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards, Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm, Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Ben Grimm. We're all screaming.\n\nJulia Garner was also recently cast as Shalla-Bal, the female Silver Surfer. Both Malkovich and Paul Walter Hauser have been cast in the movie but their characters have not yet been disclosed. Fans are already having fun online trying to figure out who Malkovich can be playing.\n\nI do think the idea of Malkovich as Galactus would be the funniest possible outcome. But the ideas didn't just stop there.\n\nThere were some genuine pitches though for who Malkovich can be playing. Multiple people suggested the Puppet Master or Willy Lumpkin but we'd also have to see who Hauser is playing and if they're connected.\n\nHowever, before Film Twitter starts yelling about Malkovich turning to Marvel money, it is important to remember that he has done a lot of movies you probably wouldn't expect him to.\n\nTwitter user @johnathanmb32 wrote, \"This had me wondering just how many big blockbusters Malkovich has worked on, and man what a wild group of high-grossing movies.\" From the '90s on, Malkovich was in a surprising number of legit blockbusters (and lots more super-high-grossing films that straddle the \"blockbuster\" line). So it does make sense he'd happily take on something as big as the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nWhat will be exciting about this though is trying to figure out who he is actually playing. I hope it is Willy Lumpkin. That feels like a perfect Malkovich role.\n\n(featured image: Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)", "source": {"uri": "themarysue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Mary Sue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_leishman@themarysue.com", "name": "Rachel Leishman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Malkovich", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Malkovich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Shakman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Shakman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_in_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spider-Man in film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanessa_Kirby", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vanessa Kirby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Raimi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Raimi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Walter_Hauser", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Walter Hauser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebon_Moss-Bachrach", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ebon Moss-Bachrach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Garner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julia Garner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Surfer_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver Surfer (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Studios_Motion_Pictures", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blockbuster (entertainment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.themarysue.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Marvel-Fantastic-Four-Valentines-Day-promo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554692", "eventUri": "eng-9554692", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Also cast are Julia Garner as a female Silver Surfer and Paul Walter Hauser in an undisclosed role which some have theorized could be Mole Man or the robot H.E.R.B.I.E. John Malkovich also signed on.\n\nIneson is said to be playing Galactus, an intergalactic being who eats the life force of planets. And now he just picked the wrong planet to nosh on.\n\nIn the Marvel comics, Galactus, created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, has appeared as a towering human-life figure. The character made his big-screen debut in 2007's Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer wherein he was appeared in the form of a CGI-generated cosmic cloud. It was an appearance that did not go well with audiences.\n\nMatt Shakman is directing the feature, which has Marvel taking the interesting creative choice of setting the story in the 1960s, the era when the super-team was first created. Eric Pearson, Josh Friedman, Jeff Kaplan, and Ian Springer wrote the screenplay. Peter Cameron (WandaVision) has also done some writing on the project.\n\nIneson is currently on screens as a priest in 20 Century's The First Omen and last year played a key role in Gareth Edwards' The Creator. He had a role in Robert Eggers' Viking drama The Northman and reteams with the filmmaker for vampire thriller Nosferatu, whose A-list cast includes Nicholas Hoult, Aaron Taylor Johnson, Emma Corrin, Bill Skarsgard, and Willem Dafoe.

Potentially set in the 1960s, as gracefully hinted by the reference-filled reveal poster, the cast sees the award-winning Pedro Pascal as Mr. Fantastic, Vanessa Kirby as the Invisible Woman, Joseph Quinn as the Human Torch, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach as the Thing.\n\nArguably, Ben Grimm is the most important member of The Fantastic Four, as he originally said against going on the mission that gave the group their powers and was most drastically affected by it. As the Thing, Grimm has been through immense character development, which can finally be properly portrayed in live action within the MCU. Although there are hundreds of Fantastic Four comic arcs, a select few Thing-centred stories could help prepare Moss-Bachrach for his take on the character.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n10 \"The Fantastic Four!\"\n\nFantastic Four #1 (Vol.1)\n\nClose\n\nRelease Date\n\nAugust 8th 1961\n\nWriter\n\nStan Lee\n\nPenciler\n\nJack Kirby\n\nInker(s)\n\nGeorge Klein, Christopher Rule\n\nColorist\n\nStan Goldberg\n\nLetterer\n\nArtie Simek\n\nEditor\n\nStan Lee\n\nRelated The 30 Strongest Marvel Characters Some of Marvel's most powerful heroes like Thor and Hulk get challenged by relatively new heroes, but they still prove themselves among the strongest.\n\nThe Fantastic Four first debuted on the shelves in comic book stores in August 1961, in which they gained their superhuman abilities from cosmic rays on a space mission gone wrong. Although there are many versions of The Fantastic Four's origin story in Marvel Comics and beyond, these are by far the most iconic and recognizable and are well-known by comic book fans.\n\nAs Marvel Studios' The Fantastic Four is heavily implied to take place in the '60s, it would make sense that their comic book origins from the same time period would heavily influence their MCU origins. Furthermore, as the much-anticipated film is being directed by WandaVision's Matt Shakman, it is guaranteed to live and breathe that historical era, meaning that Moss-Bachrach should familiarize himself with this specific Fantastic Four origin story (and the chapters that follow) to best prepare for his '60s Thing.\n\n9 \"The Hulk Vs. The Thing\"\n\nFantastic Four (Vol.1) #25\n\nRelease Date\n\nJanuary 10th, 1964\n\nWriter\n\nStan Lee\n\nPenciler\n\nJack Kirby\n\nInker\n\nGeorge Roussos\n\nLetterer\n\nSam Rosen\n\nEditor\n\nStan Lee\n\nThe Thing and the Incredible Hulk are two of Marvel's strongest superheroes and have brawled many times throughout Marvel Comics, often ending with the Hulk besting the Thing. The two titans first fought in Fantastic Four (Vol.1) #12, but the battle was short, and their true strengths were not on show. In #25, fans saw the pair brutally come to blows, where the violent conflict showcased the sheer determination and strength possessed by Ben Grimm for the first time - when he managed to take on the revenge-filled Hulk and buy time for the Avengers.\n\nThis specific storyline would be the perfect choice for Moss-Bachrach to read, as it is one of Thing's earliest memorable battles, showcasing the legendary character's strength. The Hulk has already gone up against Thor, Thanos, and Fenris in the MCU, so fans can already visualize just how strong the Thing will be. Furthermore, the comic beautifully demonstrates Thing's dedication and willpower by holding his own against a stronger hero at the risk of his demise to save others - showing his resilience, empathy, and selflessness, which should be traits of the MCU's Thing.\n\n8 \"And They Shall Call Him Champion\"\n\nMarvel Two-In-One Annual (Vol.1) #7\n\nRelease Date\n\nJune 22nd 1982\n\nWriter\n\nTom DeFalco\n\nPenciler\n\nRon Wilson\n\nInker(s)\n\nBob Camp, Mike Esposito, Frank Giacoia, Dan Green, Armando Gil, Chic Stone\n\nColorist\n\nGeorge Roussos\n\nLetterer\n\nJim Novak\n\nEditor\n\nJim Salicrup\n\nTime and time again, the Thing proves himself to be a resilient, powerful, and dedicated Marvel hero, even against galactic threats. In this comic arc, the debuting villain, the self-named Champion, summons different heroes of Earth, like Thor, Wonder Man, Colossus, and the Thing, to face him in a duel (to boost his ego). After beating or disqualifying each hero, the Champion finally fights the Thing - and not only does he last the longest, but he never taps out.\n\nThis impresses the Champion, prompting him to leave Earth untouched and ultimately crown the Thing as the winner. Once again, the Thing has proved his worth, this time in a substantial Marvel Comics crossover, showing just how far he is willing to go to emerge victorious. With multiple powerful villains guaranteed to threaten Earth in the MCU's future, this is a great story for Moss-Bachrach to read to see how the Thing interacts with other heroes beyond The Fantastic Four and to witness the Thing's honorable traits further.\n\n7 \"Clobberin' Time\"\n\nClobberin' Time (Vol. 1) #1-5\n\nRelease Date\n\nMarch 29th 2023 - July 5th 2023\n\nWriter\n\nSteve Skroce\n\nPenciler\n\nSteve Skroce\n\nInker\n\nSteve Skroce\n\nColorist\n\nBryan Valenza\n\nLetterer\n\nJoe Sabino\n\nEditor(s)\n\nMartin Biro, Annalise Bissa, Tom Brevoort\n\nRelated 10 Important Lessons Marvel Heroes Constantly Forget While some Marvel heroes may be the best there is at what they do, there are a few integral lessons every character learns that they always forget.\n\nAlongside his missions and experiences with The Fantastic Four, the Thing has had dozens of solo adventures throughout Marvel Comics history and the present. The recent comic series Clobberin' Time set the Thing on a time-traveling journey across the Marvel Universe, where he is front and center, teaming up with villains like Dr. Doom and heroes like the Hulk to stop the latest multiversal threat -- Ogdu Fraize.\n\nVastly different from the stories the Thing is often a part of, this short series gives fans a fresh new perspective to see the titular hero through, seeing him take on the role and responsibilities of a leader, which are often characteristics of other Fantastic Four members. This refreshing and modern take on the Thing should be used as part of Moss-Bachrach's portrayal of the Thing, as it demonstrates a fully fleshed-out solo superhero worthy of his own stories.\n\n6 \"Rock Bottom\"\n\nThing: Freakshow (Vol. 1) #1-4\n\nRelease Date\n\nJune 5th 2002 - September 18th 2002\n\nWriter\n\nGeoff Johns\n\nPenciler\n\nScott Kolins\n\nInker\n\nAndy Lanning\n\nColorist\n\nDavid Self\n\nLetterer\n\nRandy Gentile\n\nEditor\n\nTom Brevoort\n\nHaving grown fed up with constantly being seen as a monster by the public and feeling alone within The Fantastic Four, the Thing leaves town and heads for Florida. However, things don't quite go to plan, and through a series of unfortunate events, the Thing finds himself drawn to a circus in Michigan. Here, he reconnects with Istav the Accursed Albino, someone he bullied in his youth.\n\nThe duo makes amends (somewhat) and team up when caught in a Kree-Skrull conflict over a baby Watcher. This story sees the Thing facing his past mistakes and dealing with them, offering fans a further peek into Ben Grimm's origins through an exciting and unique story. This comic book would be worthy of Moss-Bachrach's comic reading list, as it enhances the character of the Thing by exploring his uncomfortable past, which is often ignored in comic book movies.\n\n5 \"The More Things Change...\"\n\nFantastic Four (Vol. 1) #238\n\nRelease Date\n\nOctober 1981\n\nWriter\n\nJohn Byrne\n\nPenciler\n\nJohn Byrne\n\nInker\n\nJohn Byrne\n\nColorist\n\nBob Sharen\n\nLetterer\n\nJim Novak\n\nEditor(s)\n\nJim Salicrup, Lance Tooks\n\nReed Richards has felt guilty for the hero's rocky fate since the fateful event that gave the Fantastic Four their superhuman abilities. Throughout The Fantastic Four comics, the genius has attempted to cure the Thing but constantly fails or falls short of a true solution. Reed finally comes to terms with his inability to cure the Thing - just for Franklin Richards to reveal that Ben has been subconsciously responsible for this failure.\n\nThis was a shocking yet understandable realization - the Thing is deeply in love with Alicia Masters, and was worried that she wouldn't love him as Ben. This tragic story would be great for Moss-Bachrach to read in preparation for his role, as it explains why Reed has failed to cure the Thing and offers a tragic look into his mind.\n\n4 \"This Man, This Monster\"\n\nFantastic Four (Vol.1) #51\n\nRelease Date\n\nMarch 10th 1966\n\nWriter\n\nStan Lee\n\nPenciler\n\nJack Kirby\n\nInker\n\nJoe Sinnott\n\nLetterer\n\nArtie Simek\n\nEditor\n\nStan Lee\n\nRelated 10 Reasons The Fantastic Four Will Beat Superman: Legacy At The Box Office The Fantastic Four is making their big screen return and Marvel's First Family is facing off with Superman: Legacy and the birth of the DCU.\n\nDarker than most other Fantastic Four comics, 'This Man, This Monster' sees Ben, already struggling with his identity, drugged by someone who wants to end Reed Richards and take his power. The impostor becomes a part of Reed's experiment in Ben's place and actually saves Reed's life after hearing how much Reed cares about Ben.\n\nAlthough this story doesn't directly focus on Ben Grimm, it demonstrates that The Fantastic Four genuinely cares about the Thing despite his struggle with identity. This would be a great story to read in preparation for the role, as it neatly encapsulates Ben's identity crisis and his team's love for him.\n\n3 \"That Night...\"\n\nMarvel Fanfare (Vol.1) #15\n\nRelease Date\n\nApril 10th 1984\n\nWriter\n\nBarry Windsor-Smith\n\nPenciler\n\nBarry Windsor-Smith\n\nInker\n\nBarry Windsor-Smith\n\nLetterer\n\nJim Novak\n\nColorist\n\nBarry Windsor-Smith\n\nEditor\n\nAl Milgram\n\nVastly different from the other stories covered thus far, 'That Night...' follows the Thing as he is 'haunted' by Johnny Storm, the hot-headed Human Torch. This playful comic story highlights Thing's close relationship with the other members of The Fantastic Four, demonstrating that, despite his tough exterior, Ben Grimm is a kind and lovable person.\n\nThis story allows fans to view the Thing as a character through another fresh lens, this time through a more heartwarming perspective. Rather than seeing a powerful warrior who never gives up or an aspiring romantic struck with love, fans see a family man. Once again, Moss-Bachrach should consider this lovable version of the character for his portrayal of the Thing.\n\n2 The Thing's Solo/Team-Up Adventures\n\nMarvel Two-In-One (Vol.1) #1-100\n\nRelease Date\n\nJan 1974 - June 1983\n\nWriter\n\nVarious\n\nPenciler\n\nVarious\n\nInker\n\nVarious\n\nLetterer\n\nVarious\n\nColorist\n\nVarious\n\nEditor\n\nVarious\n\nThis classic Marvel series has continued into modern Marvel Comics, with the original volume running for 100 issues in just under a decade. In each issue, the Thing teamed up with other Marvel characters (such as Man-Thing, Spider-Man, and more) to take on different villains in fun, unique, standalone storylines.\n\nThrough this series, fans are given a much deeper look into the Thing's personality and how he interacts with different characters, which fans will see happen in the MCU. Furthermore, this series helps to establish the Thing as his own character, separate from The Fantastic Four, so it could be beneficial for Moss-Bachrach to read over.\n\n1 \"Remembrance of Things Past\"\n\nFantastic Four (Vol.3) #56\n\nClose\n\nRelease Date\n\nJune 5th 2002\n\nWriter\n\nKarl Kesel\n\nPenciler\n\nStuart Immonen\n\nInker\n\nScott Koblish\n\nLetterer(s)\n\nRichard Starkings, Albert Deschesne\n\nColorist\n\nLiquid!\n\nEditor\n\nTom Brevoort\n\nThis story dives back into the Thing's time in the Yancy Street Gang as Ben Grimm reflects on his time with the group. From his initiation to the death of his parents, readers are given an in-depth look into the Thing's troublesome past. The story also sees Ben making things right with shopkeeper Hiram Sheckerberg, someone the gang used to harass.\n\nThis story perfectly captures Ben's time in the Yancy Street Gang by showing how far his character has developed from the gang and by showing his regret. Furthermore, this story also discusses elements of Ben's Jewish heritage, making it the perfect story to read in preparation for a truly satisfying Ben Grimm portrayal.\n\nThe Fantastic Four\n\nOne of Marvel's most iconic families makes it back to the big screen, the Fantastic Four.\n\nDirector Matt Shakman Release Date July 25, 2025 Cast Pedro Pascal , Ebon Moss-Bachrach , Vanessa Kirby , Joseph

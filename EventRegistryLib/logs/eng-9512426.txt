Picture: Gallo Images/Die Burger/Lulama Zenzile\n\nThe South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) has made scathing findings against the Eastern Cape Liquor Board (ECLB) and government over the Enyobeni tragedy.\n\nNearly two years ago, 21 partygoers died at the Enyobeni Tavern in Scenery Park, East London, and now the SAHRC has released an investigative report related to the tragedy.\n\nThe commission's investigation looked into the systemic challenges linked with the deaths, which included 12 boys and nine girls aged between 13 to 21 years old.\n\nInitial reports suggested that the deaths may have resulted from carbon monoxide poisoning or suffocation resulting from a stampede, however, both theories were ruled out.\n\nA formal inquest into the exact cause of death is still pending.\n\nThe SAHRC's 86-page report made several damning findings against the ECLB, the South African Police Service (Saps), the Buffalo City metropolitan municipality, and other government departments.\n\nAddressing the media on Thursday, SAHRC commissioner Nomahlubi Berlinda Khwinana said the ECLB's conduct contributed to the violation of \"fundamental human rights\" in the unfolding of the Enyobeni tragedy.\n\nShe said the liquor board persisted in issuing liquor licences \"without the requisite capacity to adequately monitor and enforce compliance\" despite acknowledging \"severe human capital challenges\".\n\nALSO READ: Enyobeni trial: Public outrage over 'disappointing' 100-day sentence or R5 000 fine meted on owners, but NPA is satisfied\n\n\"By continuously issuing liquor licences knowing it would not have the capacity to oversee and inspect the operations of licence holders such as taverns, the ECLB deliberately neglected to protect vulnerable members of society against the illicit trade of alcohol and its associated alcohol harms,\" Khwinana told reporters.\n\nThe commissioner said the Buffalo City metro failed to fulfil its obligations in ensuring the protection of human rights, \"particularly in relation to zoning regulations, monitoring of liquor licence applications, and the establishment of a LDAC [local drug action committee]\".\n\n\"The commission concludes that the municipality's conduct regarding the Enyobeni Tavern tragedy reveals significant shortcomings in its regulatory oversight and responsiveness to community concerns.\"\n\nThe report noted that Saps officials from the Scenery Park police station confirmed their awareness of complaints against the Enyobeni tavern as far back as December 2021.\n\nSubsequent complaints were lodged with police over the years.\n\n\"The commission finds that the Saps failed to fulfil its duty to protect public safety and uphold relevant regulations, thereby contributing to a range of human rights violations in relation to the Enyobeni tavern tragedy.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Enyobeni Tavern: Scenery Park community commemorate victims a year later\n\nKhwinana said the police's inadequate response to reports of underage drinking and other violations at the tavern raised concerns about the thoroughness of its investigations.\n\n\"[The police's] reactive approach focused on dialogue rather than strict enforcement of relevant laws and regulations.\"\n\nThe report further stated that police officials also observed untoward behaviour of patrons and non-compliance on the part of the Enyobeni Tavern and \"yet failed to effectively investigate and maintain public order\".\n\nThe Department of Health was also found wanting regarding its handling of the incident.\n\n\"The initial reports suggesting methanol poisoning as the cause of death, later refuted, followed by the emergence of suffocation due to overcrowding as the purported cause, created confusion and distress among the affected families.\n\n\"The lack of clarity and consistency in the information provided exacerbated their trauma and denied them the dignity of knowing the truth about the circumstances of their loved ones' deaths.\"\n\nRELATED: Parents doubtful as Enyobeni Tavern inquest pushed to May\n\n\"Furthermore, the obstacles faced by family members in accessing relevant information, and the department's explanation citing confidentiality and legal constraints, raise questions about transparency and accountability in the investigation process, further eroding the families' sense of dignity and respect.\"\n\nThe commissioner highlighted that the repeated postponement of formal inquest proceedings to investigate the deaths denied the victims' families closure and \"perpetuating their suffering\".\n\nAdditionally, the SAHRC found that the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of Social Development neglected to prioritise crucial legislative measures aimed at curbing alcohol abuse.\n\nAmong others, the commission recommended illegal liquor outlets must be identified in communities and ascertain their legal status.\n\nIt also suggested that police should prioritise regular patrols and inspections in areas with high alcohol-related incidents to deter unlawful behaviour.\n\nThe report recommended the Department of Education embark on a proactive campaign to eradicate or prevent \"pens down\" celebrations and instead look into alternatives such as concerts, sporting events and cultural festivals.\n\nIn February, Enyobeni owners, Siyakhangela and Vuyokazi Ndevu, were found guilty of selling alcohol to minors and were each given a sentence of a R5 000 fine or 100 days in prison.",

The commission made several damning findings against the SA Police Service (SAPS), the Eastern Cape Liquor Board (ECLB), the Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality (BCMM) and government departments.\n\nOn Thursday, the SAHRC's Eastern Cape provincial office released its final investigative report into the systemic challenges associated with this tragedy. The 86-page report revealed shortcomings in the liquor regulations enforcement by the ECLB as well as police negligence in addressing community concerns about under-age drinking. The SAHRC also criticised the departments of trade and industry and social development for neglecting important legislative requirements to combat alcohol abuse among young people.\n\nREAD: Enyobeni Tragedy: Parents still reeling as tavern owner insists he is innocent\n\nThe report further found against the BCMM for inadequate oversight and monitoring of zoning and building regulations compliance.\n\nThe report stated:\n\nThe commission's Eastern Cape manager, Eileen Carter, released the report at the Chandler's Guest House in East London. Carter said they recommended that the ECLB should consider implementing an immediate moratorium on issuing new on-site liquor licences until adequate resources are allocated to ensure thorough compliance with existing regulations.\n\nOn 26 June 2022, a group of youngsters aged between 14 and 20 died at the tavern while celebrating the end of exams, commonly known as \"pens-down parties\". The teenagers' bodies were discovered on the floor and tables, with the youngest victim being only 13.\n\nAfter a two-month investigation, the provincial health department revealed that the youths had either been crushed or suffocated to death due to overcrowding, according to a toxicology report.\n\nREAD: Watch | 'R5k lenient sentencing of Enyobeni owners not enough to stop tavern owners from breaking the law'\n\nThe tavern's owners, Siyakhangela and Vuyokazi Ndevu, were convicted in February for selling alcohol to minors and fined R5 000 or 100 days of imprisonment.\n\nRole of police\n\nThe SAHRC's report highlighted that SAPS officials from the Scenery Park Police Station acknowledged being aware of complaints about the Enyobeni tavern and underage-drinking as early as December 2021. Further complaints were lodged with the police over the years. The commission found that SAPS did not fulfill its duty to protect the public and enforce relevant regulations, thereby contributing to various human rights violations related to the Enyobeni tavern tragedy.\n\nThe report stated:\n\n\"Failure to enforce these regulations effectively may indicate systemic deficiencies in training or oversight within the agency. SAPS officials from the Scenery Park Police Station confirmed that they were aware of complaints against the Enyobeni Tavern as far back as December 2021 after which several further complaints over the years were lodged with SAPS officials.\"\n\nThe commission also found that the department of health's handling of the Enyobeni tragedy resulted in violations of the right to dignity of the victims' families. The report highlighted that the initial reports of methanol poisoning as the cause of death, later proven false, followed by the emergence of suffocation due to overcrowding, caused confusion and distress among the affected families.\n\nThe SAHRC further noted that the repeated postponement of formal inquest into the deaths prolonged the agony and uncertainty for the bereaved families, which worsened their suffering.", "source": {"uri": "news24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "news24"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thapelo_lekabe@news24.com", "name": "Thapelo Lekabe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavern", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tavern"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Cape", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Cape"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Eastern Cape"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_London,_South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "East London, South Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liquor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_Police_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South African Police Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Commission_on_Human_Rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Commission on Human Rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_drinking_age", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Legal drinking age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_City_Metropolitan_Municipality", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Negligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigative_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investigative journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toxicology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moratorium_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moratorium (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zoning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanol_toxicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Methanol toxicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphyxia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asphyxia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inquest"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3401/76c819a242b54942b838b3f19d7a9ac3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9512426", "eventUri": "eng-9512426", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

The Commission calls for decisive action to address systemic deficiencies and safeguard the rights of all citizens, particularly the most vulnerable among us,\" the report reads.\n\nThe Enyobeni tragedy occurred on 26 June 2022 when 21 young people died in mysterious circumstances at the Enyobeni Tavern in Scenery Park, East London.\n\nThe commissioners dedicated the report to those who died: Lithemba Velaphi, Mbulelo Rhangile, Inathi Nkani, Kungentando Nzima, Ovayo Mateyise, Bongolethu Ncandana, Anathi Ngqoza, Sinothando Mgangala, Simamkele Sobetwa, Aluncedo Monela, Simele Bolsiki,

following an investigation initiated by the SAHRC, found there were \"systemic deficiencies across multiple sectors, underscoring the urgent need for comprehensive reforms to protect vulnerable populations and uphold human rights\".\n\nCommissioners suggested a moratorium on all liquor licences in the province until sufficient monitoring capacity has been established within the Eastern Cape Liquor Board.\n\nAs the formal inquiry into the deaths of the 21 individuals unfolds, it becomes increasingly apparent that the Enyobeni Tavern tragedy cannot be viewed in isolation but rather must be contextualised within the prevalent alcohol-related issues gripping South African society, the commissioners wrote.\n\nThe SAHRC has held several government departments responsible for the failures that led to the deaths, including the South African Police Service, the Buffalo City Metro and the Eastern Cape Liquor Board.\n\nThe commissioners also found that the uncertainty created by several statements about different causes of death, which were issued by the Eastern Cape health department, affected the dignity of the deceased.\n\n\"The Commission's investigation unearthed systemic deficiencies across multiple sectors, underscoring the urgent need for comprehensive reforms to protect vulnerable populations and uphold human rights,\" reads the report titled \"Enyobeni: A Sobering Account\".\n\nThe key findings include:\n\nThere was insufficient oversight and capacity within the Buffalo City Metro to monitor compliance with zoning and building regulations, it said, and also cited \"delayed and opaque processes within the Department of Health regarding investigation findings and inquest proceedings\".\n\nRead more in Daily Maverick: Enyobeni Tavern owners each fined

with liquor regulations and building standards; and urgently establishing local drug action committees within its jurisdiction to help prevent drug and alcohol abuse.", "source": {"uri":

In the past three years, the ECLB granted 1,689 new licenses and inspectors identified 869 illegal shebeens.\n\nRead more in Daily Maverick: Enyobeni Tragedy -- SAHRC slams police, national departments for 'systemic deficiencies', urges liquor licence moratorium\n\nUnder current legislation, liquor inspectors can identify problems at liquor outlets but rely on councillors and law enforcement to implement by-laws, with municipalities playing a key role in approving liquor licences.\n\nMvoko said that the provincial government was training ward councillors on their role in considering liquor licence applications.\n\n\"The Eastern Cape Liquor Board has developed a programme to train the ward councillors in some municipalities throughout the province in their legislated roles in the consideration of liquor licence applications in their areas of jurisdiction. A total of 12 municipalities (including ward councillors, officials and ward committee members) were trained this financial year.\"\n\nHe said that previously there was non-compliance by ward councillors to conduct community consultation meetings and submit reports on liquor licence applications, meaning some licences were approved without being properly considered.\n\n\"This results in the ECLB not complying with the legislated 60-day period within which a liquor licence application has to be considered. As a result [of the training], there has been vast improvement on this matter.\"\n\nWhen asked for a response to the understaffing claim during the SAHRC's investigation, the chairperson of the ECLB, Mbuyi Makala, said the following: \"In terms of the capacity we don't have much capacity as [the] Eastern Cape Liquor Board because we currently only about 22 inspectors who are supposed to look at the whole of the province.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the ECLP, Dr Mgwebi Msiya, said their legal team was currently studying the report.\n\nAlmost two years after the Enyobeni tragedy, a definitive cause of death for the 21 deceased is still not known.\n\nThe owner of the tavern, Vuyokazi Ndevu, and her husband Siyakhangela were criminally convicted for selling alcohol to minors. They each received a R5,000 fine or the option to spend 100 days in prison.\n\n\"This underscores a critical connection between the events of June 25-26, 2022, and the broader landscape of harmful alcohol consumption in South Africa,\" the SAHRC's report found.\n\n\"As the formal inquiry into the deaths of the 21 individuals unfolds, it becomes increasingly apparent that the Enyobeni Tavern tragedy cannot be viewed in isolation but rather must be contextualised within the prevalent alcohol-related issues gripping South African society,\" the report continues.\n\n\"The Commission confirms it did not and is not mandated to investigate the criminal liability in respect of this tragic occurrence. Without however delving into the forensic specifics of the fatalities, the Commission recognised the direct correlation between the events of that tragic evening and the systemic and pervasive culture of alcohol abuse within the country,\" the report added.\n\nThe investigation by the SAHRC uncovered damning evidence of neglect on the side of the ECLB.\n\nSince December 2021, about six months before the incident, residents reported increased noise levels from the tavern, a significant surge in the number of patrons; disregard for operating hours; instances of underage drinking both within and outside the tavern; incidents of public indecency, including urination and sexual conduct in public areas, driveways, and residents' yards; damage to and theft of property by tavern patrons; and disposal of empty bottles into residents' yards.\n\n\"Despite reporting these issues to the Scenery Park police station and the ECLB on numerous occasions, residents noted a lack of positive interventions,\" read the SAHRC report.\n\n\"Significantly, the Commission was informed that in May 2022, SAPS officials conducted a door-to-door campaign, allowing residents near the tavern to submit affidavits detailing challenges they faced. Twenty affidavits, each representing a household, were submitted during this campaign. Allegations further arose that an ECLB official was present during this campaign.\n\n\"Following the door-to-door campaign, a meeting was convened at the Scenery Park police station, attended by concerned residents, SAPS officials, and an ECLB representative. The meeting focused on addressing challenges outlined in the affidavits against the Enyobeni Tavern. However, residents reported a lack of subsequent engagement or action from SAPS officials post-meeting, whether in the form of investigations or patrols in the affected area.\"\n\nIn answering a question from the SAHRC, the ECLB admitted that Ndevu had a valid registration certificate for the sale of liquor under the trading name of Enyobeni.\n\nTwo community consultation reports were received regarding its liquor license application, one from the former ward councillor and one from the ward committee.\n\n\"No objections were received, and the application was supported,\" the ECLB stated.\n\nIn 2021, the ECLB however received complaints that the tavern was not complying with Covid-19 lockdown regulations.\n\nThe ECLB said they did not have the competency to enforce the lockdown regulations and that their liquor inspectors could not legally enforce the regulations so the matter was referred to the police.\n\n\"It is impossible for the ECLB to fulfil its mission of mitigating the adverse effects of excessive alcohol consumption when it is so severely understaffed. For the ECLB enforcement officers to carry out their role and ensure that our communities are protected from alcohol abuse, they must be supported and their numbers boosted,\" said the DA's Kruger.

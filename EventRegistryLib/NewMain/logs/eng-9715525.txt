The negotiations fell through, and by that, what I mean is that we failed to agree on the payment terms. We are currently engaging all stakeholders on the way forward with respect to the negotiations.\n\n\"And that is, by the way, what can be done under the Memorandum of Understanding that we signed with the preferred bidder. That it allows us to negotiate on the payment terms,\" he stated.\n\nRATIONALE\n\nSSNIT has suffered criticisms following the decision to put its 60% shares in its hotels across the country on sale.\n\nIn 2018, the Trust stepped up to find a strategic investor to revamp their loss-prone hotels, which are La Palm Royal Beach Hotel, Labadi Beach Hotel, Elimina Beach Resort, Busua Beach Resort, Ridge Royal Hotel and Trust Lodge.\n\nAddressing journalists yesterday, the DG, Mr. Osafo-Maafo, stated that their hotels were constantly making losses.\n\nHe argued further that Labadi Beach Hotel, which is making some profit, was not at the level expected by the Trust.\n\nHe said that the hotels were frequently requesting SSNIT to fund maintenance and operational activities and worker emoluments.\n\nAlso, the hotels required a regular injection of significant capital to run effectively, thus the decision to allow investors to participate in the hotels.\n\nHe ran journalists through the performances of each of the hotels to justify the decision to sell the Trust's investments.\n\n\"I don't think anyone running an investment fund in the world would be sitting and earning substandard returns. We have to address the issue,\" he explained.\n\nHe added, \"If you look at these hotels, they are capital-intensive businesses; they require... continuous capital expenditure.\n\n\"SSNIT doesn't have the necessary funding to do that. The businesses have been making consistent losses,\" he remarked.\n\nDUE PROCESSES\n\nThe DG debunked claims that due processes were not followed and that the state had been short-changed.\n\nHe told journalists that SSNIT went through international competitive tendering processes as prescribed by the Public Procurement Act to settle on the preferred investor, who bid more than what had been valued.\n\nHe said the independent Transactional Advisor guided the selection of a strategic investor and advertisements for an expression of interest for a strategic partner for the SSNIT hotels were placed in the dailies.\n\nHe also debunked claims that Rock City Hotels did not submit a Tax Clearance Certificate, which is a legal requirement.\n\n\"To answer that question, Rock City submitted a Tax Clearance Certificate. We verified the Tax Clearance Certificate,\" the DG responded to The Chronicle's question.\n\nBEST OPTION\n\nThe DG told journalists that considering the circumstances, changing the management of the hotels was not considered prudent due to the continuous losses the hotels had been accruing.\n\n\"We've been through quite a lengthy process to do so. Bear in mind that we've also tried having external management companies run the SSNIT hotels and that hasn't resolved the problem either.\n\n\"So, for us, we look at it twofold: that we are looking to resolve a problem and do so with the introduction of a strategic investor and we outlined the reasons there.\n\n\"Consistent losses by almost all of our hotels, I know you are aware that Labadi doesn't make profit but the returns are below [expectation]. They haven't paid us (SSNIT) any dividends, with the exception of Labadi. Labadi Beach Resort only started paying dividends for the last two years. They haven't from inception,\" he stated.\n\nOBJECTIVE\n\nAccording to him, the Trust added Labadi Beach Hotel to the sale, though it is making a profit, because SSNIT wants to maximize overall returns.\n\n\"We want to maximize what we get out of it and the question that I asked somebody the other day is, if you were selling your car or even your house, you will make an attempt to actually paint it.\n\n\"You wouldn't wait for your car to be put on stone and then say now this is the time to sell it. You make it look good. There's no reason why if a business is doing well and we seek to maximise capital from it to invest elsewhere, we shouldn't do so.\n\n\"The reason is simple.

(SSNIT), says the decision to sell the Trust's 60 percent shares in six hotels is to \"improve profitability\" and ensure the SSNIT scheme is sustained in the long-term.\n\nAddressing the press in Accra on Monday, he said the move to select a strategic investor to take over operations of the \"non-performing\" hotels was \"consistent\" with the strategy and investment policy of the Trust.\n\n\"What we seek to do at SSNIT is to improve investment returns so if a part of our business is yielding substandard returns, we have to address the issue...We are looking to take the hotel business to a world class standard that is why we [want] to bring private investors and we are looking to do so from the capital we raise from selling our equity,\" he stated.\n\nSSNIT is offloading its assets to operators, including Labadi Beach Hotel, La Palm Royal Beach Hotel, Ridge Royal Hotel, Busua Beach Resort, and Elmina Beach Resort.\n\nMr Maafo, in his address, said the \"struggling hotels\" had made consistent losses, and made \"frequent request for maintenance capital\", among other factors, which justified the need for a private investor.\n\nThe Director General explained that Trust had, in the past, relied on external management companies to run the SSNIT hotels but that approach did not \"resolve the problems either\".\n\nHe noted that some of the hotels had to fall on the Trust to pay the social security contributions of employees working at the facilities, while others could not afford payment for auditors to audit business accounts.\n\n\"I don't think anyone running an investment fund anywhere in the world would be sitting on assets which are earning substandard returns and seek to do nothing...\n\n\"A group of the hotels have not been able to pay their auditor's fees and so accounts since 2018 have not been audited...So if you put all of that together, what we have to do is to take action and that is what we are seeking to do,\" Mr Maafo emphasised.\n\nHighlighting the track record of some of the hotels, he said about [GH\u00a2] 200 million had been \"pushed into the operations of some of the hotels with no return in sight\".\n\nRidge Royal Hotel, according to Mr Maafo, owed about 44 million of the investment SSNIT had made in the business and \"none of the debt had been serviced\".\n\nIn the wake of public concerns, he said discussions regarding the sale of the hotels began in 2018, with the bidding and evaluation processes gone through \"transparent and lengthy processes\".\n\nRock City Hotels, the highest bidder for the hotels, Mr Maafo added, \"came top after technical and financial proposal\" had been evaluated, adding that the Trust would continue engaging stakeholders on various negotiations regarding the sale of the hotels.", "source": {"uri": "ghanabusinessnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ghana Business News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He emphasized that Spartan Ives' technical proposal fell short of the required standards, scoring below the necessary threshold of 50%. Consequently, their financial proposal was never assessed, and their bid envelope remained unopened in adherence to legal procedures.\n\n\"The claim by Mr. Freddy Blay that SSNIT rejected a bid of $150 to $200 million is unsubstantiated,\" Osafo-Maafo asserted. \"We followed due process outlined by the law, where evaluations are conducted first before financial assessments.\"\n\nIn response, Freddy Blay confirmed in an interview that Spartan Ives Limited had indeed submitted a bid to acquire SSNIT's hotel assets, offering up to $200 million for the stake. Blay expressed disappointment that the bid was not considered further by SSNIT. This decision could have significant implications for Spartan Ives Limited's future business prospects.\n\nMeanwhile, Osafo-Maafo defended SSNIT's recent decision to sell a 60% share in four hotels -- Labadi Beach Hotel, La Palm Royal Beach Resort, Elmina Beach Resort, and Ridge Royal Hotel -- to a private investor. He justified the move as necessary to address the hotels' ongoing financial challenges, citing persistent losses despite various management approaches and a significant increase in operating costs.\n\n\"We underwent a rigorous process to reach this decision, considering the hotels' unsustainable financial performance,\" Osafo-Maafo explained. \"Attempts with external management did not yield positive results. Introducing a strategic investor was the optimal solution to revive the fortunes of these properties.\"\n\nOsafo-Maafo further highlighted the financial strain on SSNIT due to the hotels' underperformance. \"Labadi Beach Hotel, for instance, has struggled to generate profits, and dividends have been minimal,\" he disclosed. \"Our aim now is to optimize returns and redirect resources efficiently.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsghana.com.gh", "dataType": "news", "title": "News Ghana"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_and_National_Insurance_Trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social Security and National Insurance Trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sparta"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Patriotic_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Patriotic Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labadi_Beach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labadi Beach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elmina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Elmina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Hotels_and_Motels", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Hotels and Motels", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://newsghana.com.gh/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SSNIT.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715525", "eventUri": "eng-9715525", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Notably, Rock City Hotel Limited expressed interest in all six hotels and emerged as the exclusive bidder for Lots 2 and 3.\n\nHe said their proposal stood out as the most robust and compelling among the submissions received and based on the evaluation outcomes, Rock City Hotel Limited proved to be the top bidder for all Lots and selected Lots 1 and 2 as their preferred choices.\n\nAccording to him, Rock City, has submitted a bid that surpasses the valuation suggested by the Independent Transaction Advisor adding that the bid guarantees that SSNIT will obtain a fair market price for the transaction.\n\nAs a result, Rock City, has initiated talks with SSNIT to acquire a 60% ownership share in four hotels including, Labadi Beach Hotel, La Palm Royal Beach Resort, Ridge Royal Hotel, and Elmina Beach Resort saying; these discussions align with the Request for Proposal (RFP) guidelines.\n\nHe was quick to add that, It is important to note that the negotiation process is still ongoing and has not been finalized at this stage.\n\nMr Kofi Osafo-Marfo, pledged SSNIT's Commitment to Sustainability by securing the Scheme's future through strategic actions aimed at lowering portfolio risks, enhancing investment returns, increasing cost efficiency, and actively addressing outstanding debts with employers and the Government.", "source": {"uri": "theheraldghana.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald Ghana"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_and_National_Insurance_Trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social Security and National Insurance Trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitality_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hospitality industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_City_(venue)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rock City (venue)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social Security (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accra", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accra"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Accra"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Addo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth Addo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiduciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiduciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procurement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Procurement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temple University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labadi_Beach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labadi Beach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privately_held_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privately held company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elmina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Elmina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxor", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luxor"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Luxor"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Hotels_and_Motels", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Hotels and Motels", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/theheraldghana.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SSNIT-3.jpg?fit=1080%2C809&ssl=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715525", "eventUri": "eng-9715525", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Bear in mind, we've also tried having external management companies running the SSNIT hotels and that hasn't resolved the problem either.\n\n\"So, for us, we look at it twofold, that we are looking to resolve a problem and do so with the introduction of a strategic investor and we outlined the reasons there.\"\n\n\"Consistent losses by almost all of our hotels. I know you are aware that Labadi doesn't make a profit, but the returns are below [par]. They haven't paid us any dividends with the exception of Labadi. Labadi Beach Resort only started paying dividends for the last 2 years. They haven't from inception,\" he stated.\n\nDespite its profitability, Osafo-Maafo also justified the inclusion of Labadi Beach Hotel in the sale.\n\nHe stated that this decision was guided by SSNIT's objective to optimise overall returns, as the current profits from the hotel were considered inadequate.\n\n\"We want to maximize what we get out of it and the question that I asked somebody the other day is if you were selling your car or even your house, if you were selling your house, you'd make an attempt to actually paint it.\n\n\"You wouldn't wait for your car to be put on stones and then say, now this is the time to sell it. You make it look good. There's no reason why if a business is doing well and we seek to maximise capital from its to invest elsewhere, we shouldn't do so.\"\n\n\"The reason is simple. Returns are lower than we believe they should be, but also cash always has alternative uses. So why not? There's a good investment rationale for that,\" he stated.\n\nExplore the world of impactful news with CitiNewsroom on WhatsApp!\n\nClick on the link to join the Citi Newsroom channel for curated, meaningful stories tailored just for YOU: https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaCYzPRAYlUPudDDe53x", "source": {"uri": "citinewsroom.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Citinewsroom - Comprehensive News in Ghana"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labadi_Beach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Labadi Beach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labadi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labadi"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Due process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social Security (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accra", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accra"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Accra"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elmina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Elmina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Lodging", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Lodging", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Hotels_and_Motels", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Hotels and Motels", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://citinewsroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ssnit-1-750x375-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715525", "eventUri": "eng-9715525", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

These hotels are not making profits, they brought in management and still the hotels were not profitable.\n\n\"So now they think of having a partner.

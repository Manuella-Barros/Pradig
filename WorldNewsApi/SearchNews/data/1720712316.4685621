{"id": 231983270, "title": "Future PM must focus on EU to fix Brexit damage, says business group", "text": "The next UK government should focus on a better trading relationship with the EU after Brexit costs made exports more difficult, one of the country\u2019s most influential business groups has said. The Federation of Small Businesses (FBS) published its election manifesto on Friday, citing \u201cstronger trade relations with the UK\u2019s major trade partners, including the EU\u201d as one of its priorities. Martin McTague, national chair of the FSB, said Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU has impacted some small businesses negatively if exporting to the EU. He told The Independent: \u201cWhat we are seeing in specific areas is a really big drop-off for exporters... \u201cLocation is very important and a lot of small businesses don\u2019t have the resources to take on the distant markets. Vicinity is important. A lot of them have been put off by the additional burden that Brexit has caused.\u201d Asked whether improving relations with the EU was important, he said: \u201cI think that\u2019s much more important to the small business community. The larger businesses have got the capacity and resilience and resources, frankly, to weather whatever storms are out there and deal with the problems. \u201cAnd they are prepared to up sticks and move to the continent, whereas that is not an option for most small businesses. So having a better trading relationship is important.\u201d Mr McTague said that although an improved relationship with the EU is \u201cslowly emerging\u201d, his organisation would like any incoming government to \u201cput more emphasis on that\u201d. Previously released research from the FSB showed that almost one in 10 small firms that used to export or import goods has stopped doing so in the past five years, in part due to costs, the volume of paperwork, and supply chain or logistical issues. The FSB\u2019s manifesto also calls for a future government to reform business rates and enshrine in law measures to clamp down on big businesses with poor payment practices towards smaller suppliers. In addition, the group wants to improve small businesses\u2019 access to finance and secure a 33 per cent statutory public procurement target for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). A survey by the FSB found that 96 per cent of small business owners intend to vote but 20 per cent have yet to decide for which party. 33 per cent have a good idea for whom they will vote, but could still change their mind. The top concern for small businesses is that any future government will raise taxes, according to the survey. The FSB\u2019s policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: \u201cSmall business owners and the self-employed are a shrewd and motivated part of the electorate. \u201cThey\u2019re used to weighing up competing offers when running their businesses, and it\u2019s clear from our research that when it comes to the election they\u2019re looking for which of the parties has the most compelling pro-small business offer. \u201cSmall businesses are the key to securing economic recovery, driving innovation, and creating jobs in all parts of the UK. \u201cOur small business manifesto sets out the measures needed to create the conditions for that to happen, many of which do not involve additional spending. The Independent previously reported that Brexit is leaving a hole of almost \u00a3100bn in annual UK exports, making Britain\u2019s economy worse off than it would have been, had it remained in the European Union.", "summary": "<p>Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) calls for future government to put \u2018more emphasis\u2019 on improved EU relationship </p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/general-election-government-trade-brexit-b2558645.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/01/10/10/Martin%20McTague%20headshot.png?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:42:07", "author": "Joe Middleton", "authors": ["Joe Middleton"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.087}

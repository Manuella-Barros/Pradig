The former Nebraska letter-winner committed to the Spartans on Monday.\n\nBuckley has two years of eligibility left. He earned his first letter last fall, playing in eight games for Nebraska.\n\nAt 6-5, 295, Buckley fills a critical need for physically-mature interior defensive linemen at Michigan State following the departure of Simeon Barrow (Miami) and Derrick Harmon (Oregon). While Buckley, who played just nine games in two seasons at Nebraska, is unlikely to fill a starting role at defensive tackle for Michigan State this season, he does provide much-needed depth, and should have an opportunity to compete for spot in the two-deep.\n\nBuckley - who grew up in Wyoming, Mich., a suburb of Grand Rapids - had an offer from Michigan State, as well as offers from Michigan, Florida State, Oregon and TCU out of high school. He chose the Cornhuskers among his 20+ offers. Now he has a chance to wrap up his college career close to home after graduating from Nebraska with honors in just three years.\n\nBuckley made a trip to Michigan State on Saturday morning. He left impressed with the direction the new staff has the program headed.\n\nBuckley was viewed as a developmental piece out of high school with raw traits and athleticism. After redshirting in 2021, he did not play in 2022, although he did make the travel roster for the Huskers. In 2023, he appeared in eight games on the defensive line before making a switch to offensive line late in the season. The plan is for him to play defensive tackle at Michigan State.\n\nBuckley recorded one tackle in 2023 in a loss against Michigan. He was credited with a quarterback hurry in a non-conference game against Louisiana Tech.\n\nBuckley was an Academic All-Big Ten selection in 2022 and 2023. He was awarded the Arthur Ashe Jr. Sports Scholar Award in 2022 and 2023 as well as the Brook Berringer Citizenship Team and Tom Osborne Citizenship Team in 2023.\n\nNebraska head coach Matt Rhule was complimentary of Buckley this spring.\n\n\"Ru'Quan's one of those guys on the team that whatever room he's in is a better room,\" Rhule said, per huskercorner.com. \"He's one of those fundamental leaders that raises the standard of everyone in the room. When he speaks, everyone listens; when he speaks, I listen.\"", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_Spartans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan State Spartans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letterman_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letterman (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Lansing,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Lansing, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Lansing, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska_Cornhuskers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska Cornhuskers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCU_Horned_Frogs_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TCU Horned Frogs football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_State_Seminoles_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida State Seminoles football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wyoming"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wyoming"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Rapids,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Rapids, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grand Rapids, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brook_Berringer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brook Berringer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Rhule", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Rhule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Osborne", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Osborne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Tech_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana Tech University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshirt_(college_sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Redshirt (college sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/04/30000858/RuQuan-Buckley-Nebraska-spring.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543895", "eventUri": "eng-9543895", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

But, it's bigger than that because I love the coaches too, especially the DL coach, so really it's all about development and finding the best way to make myself a GOAT,\" Buckley said told 247Sports' Spartan Tailgate on his decision. \"I am just excited to get coached by (Michigan State defensive lineman) Coach Legi (Suiaunoa) and to just go attack and make even more plays than last year.\"\n\nBuckley will have two years of eligibility remaining with the Spartans, as he redshirted the 2022 season after seeing action in just one game during his true freshman season in 2021.\n\nWith the addition of Buckley, Spartans coach Jonathan Smith has now added six players -- Anthony Jones (Indiana), Kay'ron Lynch-Adams (UMass), Ed Woods (Arizona State), Andrew Dennis (Illinois) and Gillison -- through the portal during the spring window, per 247Sports.\n\nMichigan State ranks No. 20 nationally and No. 2 in the Big Ten, behind only Ohio State, in 247Sports' transfer portal team rankings.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Buckley as he transfers within the Big Ten to Michigan State:\n\nBuckley brings limited playing experience to Michigan State, as he played in only nine career games during his time at Nebraska. He played in a career-high eight games in 2023, recording a total of two tackles across both the 2021 and 2023 seasons.\n\nBuckley is from the state of Michigan, as he attended Godwin Heights High School in Three Rivers. There, he finished with 74 tackles, 22 for a loss and 11 sacks in seven games during his senior season. In addition, he was the first player in school history to commit to a Big Ten program.\n\nBuckley did not receive any rankings as a transfer according to his 247 sports composite page.\n\nHowever, he was a three-star recruit coming out of Godwin Heights in the 2021 recruiting class, per 247Sports. He was ranked the No. 68 defensive lineman and the No. 14-ranked player in the state of Michigan in his class.\n\nBuckley, who enrolled early at Nebraska in January 2021, was recruited by Michigan State in high school and received an offer from the Spartans. However, he chose to play for the Cornhuskers over MSU and several Power Five schools such as Arkansas, Colorado, Indiana, Florida State, Michigan, Oregon and Purdue, among others.", "source": {"uri":

After taking over as Michigan State's football coach over the winter, he was forced to turn around a recruiting class that had lost virtually everyone. The Spartans' class went from the 90s nationally all the way to the top 40.\n\nNow he has to build his squad through the transfer portal after losing dozens of players in recent months.\n\nThe spring transfer window was a whirlwind as projected starters like Derrick Harmon, Simeon Barrow, Geno VanDeMark and Jade Mangham all entered the portal. Replacing them won't be easy, but Smith is doing his best to supplement the current roster with talent from the portal.\n\nWith the defensive line hit hard by the portal, Smith has two official visits planned this weekend to address the issue.\n\nWe already knew about Jay'viar Suggs, a coveted defensive end transfer from Grand Valley State who is visiting this weekend, but now there's another player on campus: Ru'Quan Buckley. The former three-star defensive lineman from Grand Rapids will be in East Lansing this weekend for an official visit, according to Allen Trieu of 247Sports.\n\nBuckley doesn't have the stats to really make him a coveted transfer, as he has played in just nine games for Nebraska in three years and recorded two total tackles, but he has a 6-foot-4 frame and weight of 295 pounds to make him a top player. legitimate lineman ready for the Big Ten. He just needs a change of scenery.\n\nAdditionally, Michigan State recruited him when Mel Tucker was still in town, but lost him to Scott Frost.\n\nWe'll see if Smith can land one or both of the defensive line transfers with ties to Michigan State.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_Spartans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan State Spartans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Harmon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick Harmon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simeon_Career_Academy", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Simeon Career Academy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Valley_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Valley State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/247Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "247Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Frost", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scott Frost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Tucker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mel Tucker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_Spartans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan State Spartans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Rapids,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Rapids, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grand Rapids, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Lansing,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East Lansing, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Lansing, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Tree_Climbing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Tree Climbing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Cosmic_Wimpout", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Cosmic Wimpout", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2400,h_1350,x_0,y_29/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/137/01hx2ge8xy4z9wyj0qfz.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543895", "eventUri": "eng-9543895", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

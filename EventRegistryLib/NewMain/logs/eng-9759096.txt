The crowd was told to leave the stadium, but players remained at the venue and returned to the pitch for a final three minutes of added time in an empty stadium.\n\nMoments before play resumed, Cristian Medina's disputed goal was disallowed by VAR for offside, and Morocco held on for the victory.\n\nBut not before a furious reaction from its fans who thought they'd been denied a critical win against one of international soccer's powerhouses.\n\nObjects were thrown and invading Morocco fans were tackled by security on the field at Stade Geoffroy-Guichard in Saint-Etienne after Medina appeared to tie the game 2-2.\n\nThere were images of some Argentina players flinching when what appeared to be a flare was thrown onto the field.

After warmups, players from both teams stood on the field in the otherwise empty stadium while an official reviewed the video. He offered a brief explanation to Argentina while players on Morocco's bench celebrated.\n\nPlay went on for about three minutes after the resumption before the final whistle was blown.\n\nMorocco had led the game 2-0 before Argentina's fight back. Giuliano Simeone scored in the 68th minute before Medina's effort sparked chaotic scenes.\n\nThe game was broadcast in cafes throughout Morocco, where national pride has swelled since the country advanced to the semifinal in the 2022 World Cup. During a record-breaking heatwave, tea-drinking men screamed at televisions and watched in shock as fans stormed the field.\n\nZak Eddakir, a 28 year-old from Rabat, said the fans' reaction had to do with soccer's importance in Morocco and a natural disappointment at a draw and the idea that a referee's call could end a game.\n\n\"In football, it's normal,\" he said. \"When you see something like that, it's really hard for supporters. Here, football is life. Even the King supports it.\"\n\nHairdresser Khadija Seffany streamed into the street to embrace her friends and neighbors after Morocco emerged victorious. She initially thought the delay in calling the goal offside suggested the referees wanted Argentina to win because Morocco is an Arab country. Every match throughout the Olympics will be important, she said.\n\n\"Here, we're one of the best in the world. We drink football. We eat football,\" Seffany said.\n\nAP writer Sam Metz contributed to this story.\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@eagletribune.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-\u00c9tienne", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saint-\u00c9tienne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-\u00c9tienne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristian_Medina", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cristian Medina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Geoffroy-Guichard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stade Geoffroy-Guichard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Nyberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Nyberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Medina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuliano_Simeone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giuliano Simeone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_invasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch invasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arab world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metz", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metz"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Metz"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabat", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rabat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rabat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/eagletribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/74/974673ee-0f6f-52d3-b671-8caedd4e3bd6/66a14a9003974.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759096", "eventUri": "eng-9759096", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Giuliano Simeone scored in the 68th minute before Medina's effort sparked chaotic scenes.\n\nThe game was broadcast in cafes throughout Morocco, where national pride has swelled since the country advanced to the semifinal in the 2022 World Cup. During a record-breaking heatwave, tea-drinking men screamed at televisions and watched in shock as fans stormed the field.\n\nZak Eddakir, a 28 year-old from Rabat, said the fans' reaction had to do with soccer's importance in Morocco and a natural disappointment at a draw and the idea that a referee's call could end a game.\n\n\"In football, it's normal,\" he said. \"When you see something like that, it's really hard for supporters. Here, football is life. Even the King supports it.\"\n\nHairdresser Khadija Seffany streamed into the street to embrace her friends and neighbors after Morocco emerged victorious. She initially thought the delay in calling the goal offside suggested the referees wanted Argentina to win because Morocco is an Arab country. Every match throughout the Olympics will be important, she said.\n\n\"Here, we're one of the best in the world. We drink football.

Broadcast footage appeared to show a flare-like object go off on the touchline where the two dugouts were located and a number of players were standing. Players ducked and covered their heads, and swiftly left the pitch as riot police stood nearby.\n\nThe game appeared to have ended at 4.10pm BST/11.10am ET, finishing in a 2-2 draw. The broadcast feed cut away and began showing the next fixture between Egypt and the Dominican Republic. The official Olympics match blog also stated that the game had ended.\n\nFans were asked to leave the stadium, with a message appearing on the big screen reading: \"Your session has been suspended. Please make your way to the nearest exit\".\n\nNews broke 90 minutes later that Argentina's equalising goal had been disallowed for offside.\n\nThe players and officials returned to the field and the game resumed shortly after 6pm BST/1pm ET, in a stadium that was completely empty of supporters.\n\nIt is unclear exactly why the match restarted and when that decision was made. The disallowed goal had been scored in the 16th minute of second-half injury time, when there were only supposed to be 15. The Athletic has approached FIFA for clarity on the decision-making process.\n\nWhen it did restart, the referee Glenn Nyberg consulted the pitchside VAR monitor to review Argentina's equaliser.\n\nArgentina's Bruno Amione was judged by the semi-automated offside technology to have been offside in the build-up and the goal was disallowed.\n\nThe players had already been made aware of this decision before returning to the field.\n\nThree minutes of added time were played in the empty stadium before the final whistle was blown at 6.07pm ET/1.07pm ET, nearly two hours after many thought the match was over.\n\nThe Argentina head coach Javier Mascherano could be heard shouting the word \"circus\" from the touchline during the final stages of the game and he was furious afterwards.\n\n\"We were never told that the play (Medina's goal) was being reviewed, no, no, no,\" he said. \"The match was suspended because of security. At no time were we told about the review, in fact the official website of the Olympic Games put the match at 2-2. The match was suspended because of security, at no time did they talk about the review.\n\n\"Afterwards, when we had no news one hour later, we started to notice strange things. What did the referee tell us? No, no, the referee never came, he never gave us an explanation.\n\nDuring the interview, Mascherano also alleged that some of midfielder Thiago Almada's possessions had been stolen while Argentina were training yesterday.\n\n\"Let's turn the page, keep the positive things about the team, especially in the second half, and look for the two wins we're going to need to qualify.\n\n\"What happened on the pitch was scandalous. It's not a local tournament, it's the Olympic Games. How can they stop the game seven times in the second half because someone enters the pitch?! At the second or third time, they have to make a decision. Seven times they (Morocco fans) entered the pitch!\"\n\nArgentina great Lionel Messi, who is not participating at the Games, posted a one-word story on his Instagram account reading \"Insolito\", which translates as \"unbelievable\", accompanied by an embarrassed emoji.\n\nAs the two teams lined up on the pitch before the match, the Argentina national anthem was booed by the crowd, which was predominantly made up of Morocco supporters.\n\nIt was expected that there would be some reaction to the Argentina team competing in France, only 10 days after Argentina international Enzo Fernandez live-streamed a video of him and some of his team-mates singing what the French Football Federation (FFF) has labelled a \"racist and discriminatory song\" following their Copa America final win over Colombia on Sunday night.\n\nThe chant was about the French national team -- who Argentina beat in the men's World Cup final in 2022 -- with derogatory references to France internationals of African descent. The FFF said it would file an official complaint with FIFA. Fernandez later apologised and admitted the song included \"highly offensive language\".\n\nFrance's sports minister Amelie Oudea-Castera branded the chanting \"pathetic\" last Tuesday but Argentina's vice-president, Victoria Villarruel, defended Fernandez.\n\nFernandez, though, is not part of the Argentina Under-23 team at the Olympics and is due to return to club duty with Premier League side Chelsea next week.\n\nBoth teams are back in action on Saturday for the second round of group-stage fixtures.\n\nMascherano's Argentina take on Iraq at the Groupama Stadium in Lyon, while Morocco are back at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard to face Ukraine.\n\nArgentina then play Ukraine in Lyon on Tuesday, while Morocco face Iraq at the Allianz Riviera in Nice.\n\nThe top two teams in the group will qualify for the quarterfinals which take place on Friday, August 2.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The crowd was told to leave the stadium, but players remained at the venue and returned to the pitch for a final three minutes of added time in an empty stadium.\n\nMoments before play resumed, Cristian Medina's disputed goal was disallowed by VAR for offside, and Morocco held on for the victory.\n\nBut not before a furious reaction from its fans who thought they'd been denied a critical win against one of international soccer's powerhouses.\n\nObjects were thrown and invading Morocco fans were tackled by security on the field at Stade Geoffroy-Guichard in Saint-Etienne after Medina appeared to tie the game 2-2.\n\nThere were images of some Argentina players flinching when what appeared to be a flare was thrown onto the field. Bottles and cups were strewn over the pitch by the time the game was paused.\n\nIt was initially thought that the full-time whistle had been blown. Even FIFA's website declared the game over.\n\nAbout an hour after the incident, organizers at the venue confirmed the match was not officially over and VAR would review whether the goal would stand.\n\nPlayers eventually re-entered the field after a long delay and began to warm up before the game could be concluded. After warmups, players from both teams stood on the field in the otherwise empty stadium while an official reviewed the video. He offered a brief explanation to Argentina while players on Morocco's bench celebrated.\n\nPlay went on for about three minutes after the resumption before the final whistle was blown.\n\nMorocco had led the game 2-0 before Argentina's fight back. Giuliano Simeone scored in the 68th minute before Medina's effort sparked chaotic scenes.\n\nThe game was broadcast in cafes throughout Morocco, where national pride has swelled since the country advanced to the semifinal in the 2022 World Cup. During a record-breaking heatwave, tea-drinking men screamed at televisions and watched in shock as fans stormed the field.\n\nZak Eddakir, a 28 year-old from Rabat, said the fans' reaction had to do with soccer's importance in Morocco and a natural disappointment at a draw and the idea that a referee's call could end a game.\n\n\"In football, it's normal,\" he said. \"When you see something like that, it's really hard for supporters. Here, football is life. Even the King supports it.\"\n\nHairdresser Khadija Seffany streamed into the street to embrace her friends and neighbors after Morocco emerged victorious. She initially thought the delay in calling the goal offside suggested the referees wanted Argentina to win because Morocco is an Arab country. Every match throughout the Olympics will be important, she said.\n\n\"Here, we're one of the best in the world. We drink football. We eat football,\" Seffany said.", "source": {"uri": "daytondailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dayton Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Geoffroy-Guichard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stade Geoffroy-Guichard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-\u00c9tienne", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saint-\u00c9tienne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-\u00c9tienne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Medina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuliano_Simeone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giuliano Simeone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_invasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch invasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arab world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabat", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rabat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rabat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.daytondailynews.com/resizer/KE9F9j_rvnB09agdaM2PlGETR-A=/1200x630/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coxohio/KDX7SSHSS2YKGG3XD5JY6G7ZGI.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759096", "eventUri": "eng-9759096", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

The Albiceleste have World Cup and Copa America titles to their name currently while the Atlas Lions will be keen to replicate their 2022 World Cup showing which saw them reach the semifinals. The Paris Games will be Argentina's 10th appearance while Morocco will be making their eight outing at the event.\n\nThe Argentines did not make it out of the group stage in Tokyo back in 2020, but are favorites to triumph under manager Javier Mascherano who won gold in 2004 in Athens but also 2008 in Beijing. South America has dominated Olympic soccer of late with four of the last five gold medals including Argentina's two and another for Brazil who surprisingly missed out on qualification for Paris. After finishing second in the CONMEBOL Pre-Olympic Tournament to Paraguay, Guinea produced a surprise 1-0 friendly win over Mascherano's side.\n\nMorocco are back at an Olympic soccer tournament for the first time since 2012 after qualifying by winning the under-23 Africa Cup of Nations. Issame Charai has since been replaced as head coach by Tarik Sektioui and the Moroccans are fourth favorites to triumph in the French capital. A top two finish in Group B would be a first since 1972 and the Atlas Lions have drawn with Belgium, beaten Wales and lost to group rivals Ukraine in friendlies since Sektioui's arrival.\n\nHere's our storylines, how you can watch the match and more:\n\nGolazo Starting XI Newsletter Get your Soccer Fix from Around the Globe Your ultimate guide to the Beautiful Game as our experts take you beyond the pitch and around the globe with news that matters.\n\nI agree to receive the \"Golazo Starting XI Newsletter\" and marketing communications, updates, special offers (including partner offers), and other information from CBS Sports and the Paramount family of companies.

How both of these sides fare against Ruslan Rotan's team could be decisive given that they are a tricky team to face at this level.\n\nTeam news\n\nArgentina: The 18-man squad includes World Cup winners Julian Alvarez, Nicolas Otamendi, Geronimo Rulli and Thiago Almada and three of those four also won the Copa America earlier this month in the U.S. Otamendi is one of three overage players Mascherano has picked but expect Gonzalo Lujan, Marco Di Cesare and Bruno Amione to be part of the defense with the veteran. Santiago Hezze could join Almada and Cristian Medina or Ezequiel Fernandez in midfield while Alvarez could be in front of Kevin Zenon and Giuliano Simeone up top.\n\nPossible Argentina XI: Rulli; Lujan, Di Cesare, Otamendi, Amione; Almada, Hezze, Medina; Zenon, Alvarez, Simeone.\n\nMorocco: Oussama El Azzouzi will join his teammates late while Achraf Hakimi is the undoubted star turn here. Benjamin Bouchouari, Ilias Akhomach and Abde Ezzalzouli should also form part of Sektioui's preferred starting XI.\n\nPossible Morocco XI: Mohamedi; Hakimi, El Wafi, Boukamir, Nakach; Targhalline, Bouchouari, Richardson; Akhomach, Rahimi, Ezzalzouli.\n\nPrediction\n\nExpect an opening win for the favorites but not as comfortably as some might expect. A narrow victory but a win all the same will do to get Mascherano's side up and running in France.

More info\n\nThe Olympic football tournament kicked off in a state of disarray as chaotic scenes marred Argentina's opening match against Morocco.\n\nArgentina believed they had secured a last-minute equaliser in Saint-Etienne when Cristian Medina headed in a rebound from the crossbar in the 106th minute. However, confusion ensued as fans stormed the pitch and Argentine players sought refuge in the tunnel amidst a barrage of firecrackers being thrown in their direction.\n\nPlay was twice interrupted by pitch invaders - much to Argentina's frustration as they were chasing the game - as tensions reached boiling point following Medina's goal.\n\nREAD MORE: Why is there no Team GB football team at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games?\n\nEurosport viewers were led to believe that the match had ended in a 2-2 draw, but this was not the case. In reality, despite 15 minutes of added time being scheduled, the players were escorted off the pitch with three minutes still remaining.\n\nOver an hour later, it was revealed that VAR had disallowed Medina's close-range header for offside, reports the Mirror. Consequently, over an hour and 20 minutes later, with the stadium now empty, both teams returned to the pitch to play out the final moments, with Morocco once again leading 2-1.\n\nThe players were asked to warm up on the pitch in Saint-Etienne before resuming play at 6pm in the deserted stadium. Morocco managed to hold their lead for the remaining three minutes, securing a 2-1 victory.\n\nThe extraordinary scenes unfolded at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard after Morocco had taken an unexpected 2-0 lead in the match, which initially kicked off at 2pm. Soufiane Rahimi netted the first goal before doubling their lead from the penalty spot.\n\nGiuliano Simeone then reduced the deficit with a finish at the back post, setting up a thrilling finale amid deafening scenes. Moroccan fans were incensed when officials added on 15 minutes and disrupted play twice before the unsavoury incidents at the end.\n\nIn a video shared on social media, Argentina's players can be seen ducking and covering their heads as a firecracker explodes just above them, thrown from the stands.\n\nAfter warming up again, the two teams played out the final three minutes, deep into stoppage time, with Morocco clinging on to secure a 2-1 victory.\n\nHere is a timeline of the chaos:.\n\n3:11 pm - Morocco go 2-0 up with Rahimi's second goal from the penalty spot 4:06 pm - Medina scores in the 15th minute of injury time to make it 2-2 4:09 pm - The game is suspended after firecrackers were thrown towards the Argentina bench 5:38 pm - Argentina's equaliser is ruled out by VAR for offside, 92 minutes after it had been scored 6:00pm - Play resumes for the final three minutes of injury time with the score Argentina 1-2 Morocco 6.07pm -

Bottles and cups were strewn over the pitch by the time the game was paused.\n\nIt was initially thought that the full-time whistle had been blown. Even FIFA's website declared the game over.\n\nAbout an hour after the incident, organizers at the venue confirmed the match was not officially over and VAR would review whether the goal would stand.\n\nPlayers eventually re-entered the field after a long delay and began to warm up before the game could be concluded. After warmups, players from both teams stood on the field in the otherwise empty stadium while an official reviewed the video. He offered a brief explanation to Argentina while players on Morocco's bench celebrated.\n\nPlay went on for about three minutes after the resumption before the final whistle was blown.\n\nMorocco had led the game 2-0 before Argentina's fight back. Giuliano Simeone scored in the 68th minute before Medina's effort sparked chaotic scenes.\n\nThe game was broadcast in cafes throughout Morocco, where national pride has swelled since the country advanced to the semifinal in the 2022 World Cup. During a record-breaking heatwave, tea-drinking men screamed at televisions and watched in shock as fans stormed the field.\n\nZak Eddakir, a 28 year-old from Rabat, said the fans' reaction had to do with soccer's importance in Morocco and a natural disappointment at a draw and the idea that a referee's call could end a game.\n\n\"In football, it's normal,\" he said. \"When you see something like that, it's really hard for supporters. Here, football is life. Even the King supports it.\"\n\nHairdresser Khadija Seffany streamed into the street to embrace her friends and neighbors after Morocco emerged victorious.

Soufiane Rahimi's tap-in and penalty had put Morocco 2-0 up before Giuliano Simeone came off the bench to get one back for Argentina.\n\nThat set up a dramatic finish which was aided by 15 minutes of added time being awarded. It seemed as though they had earned a point when Cristian Medina headed in a rebound off the crossbar in the 106th minute, but it wasn't to be.\n\nThe players were taken off the pitch for security reasons after firecrackers were thrown at the Argentina bench and Morocco supporters invaded the pitch. Amid the confusion, it was believed that the final whistle had been blown with the score at 2-2.\n\nHowever, over an hour later, it emerged that Medina's goal had been ruled out by VAR for offside - and that the match hadn't finished. The players returned to the pitch to play out the final three minutes inside an empty stadium, with Morocco hanging on to win.\n\nThat prompted a reaction from Messi, who took to Instagram to simply write \"Ins\u00f3lito\" in Spanish, which translates as \"extraordinary\" or \"unusual\" in English. It was an ept summation from the legendary forward, who is not a part of the Argentina Olympic team, having recently helped his nation defend their title at the Copa America.\n\nMessi's former team-mate Javier Mascherano, who is coaching the side in France, was extremely animated on the sidelines as the match was frequently interrupted by pitch invaders as Morocco tried to slow the game down. He was seen remonstrating with the referee and did not hold back post-match.\n\n\"It's the biggest circus I've ever seen in my life!\" he told reporters at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard. Argentina are in Group B at the Olympics with Morocco, Iraq and Ukraine. They will try to put their disappointment behind them when they face Iraq in their next match on Saturday.\n\nArgentina had come into the Olympics on a high after beating Colombia to win their second successive Copa America. Messi himself was forced off injured in the final against Colombia and may have played in his final tournament at 37.\n\nThe Olympics are about the next generation of talent, with Nicolas Otamendi one of few older and established stars among the Argentina squad.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Argentina's team seemed to even the score at 2-2 with a last-second goal, but over an hour later, the result came back 2-1 with Morocco winning the game outright. Many are wondering what happened during the match that led to the score being changed and made fans storm the field, forcing the game to be suspended in the first place. Here's a breakdown of the controversial result between Argentina and Morocco in one of the opening soccer matches at the 2024 Olympic Games.\n\nWhat happened during the Argentina Morocco Olympics soccer match?\n\nMany events contributed to the controversy in the Argentina Morocco Olympics soccer match. Here's a timeline of what happened during the match.\n\nAfter 90 minutes of play, Morocco led Argentina 2-1. However, the referee judged that Morocco was wasting time in the second half, leading him to add 15 extra minutes of injury time to the clock. Some fans believed this amount of extra time to be excessive.\n\nAfter the extra 15 minutes elapsed, Morocco's Giuliano Simeone scored a game-tying goal in what seemed to be the final seconds of the match. Some fans for the Moroccan team reacted by throwing bottles and other objects at the Argentine players and some stormed the field in protest. The officials announced that the match was suspended due to fan disruptions, though the Olympic website stated that the game had finished 2-2.\n\nHowever, over an hour later, both teams came out onto the field to an empty stadium. The VAR determined that Argentina's goal was disallowed due to an offsides ruling. This ultimately led Morocco to win 2-1 against Argentina.\n\nWhy was Argentina's goal ruled offsides?\n\nLooking at the replay, the refugees judged that Ignacio Fernandez was offside during Burno Amione's shot that led to Simeone's goal. Since Fernandez contributed to Simeone being able to shoot the goal, the equalizer was ruled out.\n\nHowever, it took officials about an hour and a half to come to the decision. A rule requires that both teams be on the field for the VAR to make the ruling.\n\nThe entire controversy caused soccer legend Lionel Messi to post on Instagram the single word \"ins\u00f3lito,\" which means \"unbelievable\" or a situation that is unheard of.", "source": {"uri": "comingsoon.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "ComingSoon.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nicholas_tan@comingsoon.net", "name": "Nicholas Tan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_invasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitch invasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuliano_Simeone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Giuliano Simeone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morocco national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Replay (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Simeone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diego Simeone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.comingsoon.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/argentina-morocco-olympics-controversy-result-score.jpg?resize=1200,630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759096", "eventUri": "eng-9759096", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The African nation went ahead just before half time through Soufiane Rahimi, and he doubled their lead from the penalty sport shortly after the break.\n\nGiuliano Simeone halved the deficit midway through the second half, and Argentina equalised deep into injury time. And by deep into injury time, we mean in the 16th minute of 15 added on.\n\nIn what was already a feisty affair, that late equaliser kicked things off. The referee blew the whistle after the goal from Cristian Medina, with Argentina thinking they had rescued a point.\n\nWhile Argentina were celebrating, they were targeted by cups and bottles thrown from the stands, with a flare also launched onto the pitch. Earlier in the game, there had been stoppages due to pitch invaders, bringing questions about security.\n\nBut an hour after the whistle went, it was revealed that the game was not over. The referee had in fact blown the whistle to take the players off the pitch, suspending the match for their safety. So, once the stadium had been emptied 90 minutes later, the players returned to the pitch for the final three minutes.\n\nIf that wasn't enough drama, VAR got involved. As the game restarted, Argentina's equaliser was ruled out by VAR, with one of Medina's teammates offside in the build up. Remarkably, the check wasn't made official until the game had kicked off again, with the referee going to the monitor to confirm once the players were all back on the pitch.\n\nThe game resumed with Morocco 2-1 up and they held onto that lead for the final three minutes to take the win.\n\nNaturally, there were a lot of emotions flowing from Argentina manager Javier Mascherano.\n\n\"The biggest circus I have ever seen in my life,\" he told reporters after the match.\n\nHe added: \"Yesterday they broke into the property and robbed us. Thiago Almada's things were stolen. They ask us for a credential for everything but then these things happen.\n\n\"Today they invaded the field seven times and then they threw firecrackers at us. They told us that it was finished 2-2.

But under the guidance of former-star-midfielder-turned-head-coach Javier Mascherano, the South American football juggernaut hopes to capitalize on the absence of rival and 2021 Olympic men's soccer champion, Brazil. Argentina will lean on Manchester City's Julian Alvarez, along with young talent like Thiago Almada and Claudio Echeverri, to chase the Olympic gold they last won in 2008.\n\nMorocco, led by ex-Paris Saint-Germain star Achraf Hakimi, is on the hunt for its first-ever Olympic medal. Morocco has not qualified since London 2012, and did not advance past round 1 in that tournament. Morocco brings veteran goalkeeper Munir Mohamedi as a reliable last line of defense in the contest.\n\nArgentina and Morocco play in Group B, along with Uzbekistan and Iraq. The Olympic men's soccer field is filled with teams vying for their first ever gold medals this year, including the United States, Guinea and Mali.

Over an hour after many thought that Cristian Medina had earned an equaliser for Argentina with the last shot of a dramatic game, their group stage game against Morocco resumed behind closed doors, a VAR check ruling out the equaliser. Having survived three of the most bizarre minutes of football the Olympic Games have ever seen, Morocco emerged victorious to take top spot just after the later game in Group B had begun.\n\nCristian Medina thought he had turned a two goal deficit into a crucial draw for one of the pre-tournament favorites, prompting jubilant scenes on the Argentine bench that were greeted in hostile fashion by the Saint-Etienne crowd, missiles flung in the direction of the pitch. That prompted referee Glenn Nyberg to take the players off the pitch before the game had finished, though that news was not immediately apparent to Olympics organisers.\n\nFor more than half an hour the competition website said the game had been \"interrupted\" before subsequently concluding that the match had in fact finished. An hour after Medina's goal that wasn't, both sides were back on the the field at the Stade Geoffrey-Guichard, supporters having long since departed as they began a 20 minute warm up to be followed by three minutes of further action.\n\nInstead, it was African youth champions Morocco who started much the brighter, Paris Saint-Germain right back Achraf Hakimi a particular bright spark in a controlled start to proceedings. Roared on by a crowd where even those with no rooting interest had taken against Argentina -- perhaps in light of the controversy sparked by a racist chant from the senior squad after they won the Copa America earlier this month -- Morocco probed and interchanged impressively, a flowing team move setting up Soufiane Rahimi to fire them into the lead at close range as half time loomed.\n\nThe drama had only just begun. Though Argentina saw much of the ball in the second half they seemed short on ideas for what to do with it, crashing against an organised opposition defense. Had theirs been set up as effectively then Ilias Akhomach would not have been able to glide past veteran Nicolas Otamendi and into the box. Julio Soler might have felt that the hand he placed on the Villarreal forward's back was not enough to send him down, but it invited danger. Akhomach hit the floor and Nyberg concluded it was a penalty, duly converted by Rahimi.\n\nSoler at least made amends by teeing up substitute Giuliano Simeone soon after, ensuring that Argentina had only one goal to make up going into what appeared to be the final third of the game. However this match in which 33 fouls were committed ran and ran into 15 minutes of added time that were a veritable siege on the Moroccan goal.\n\nIt looked as though Tarik Sektioui's side might have weathered the storm when a flicked header from Julian Alvarez found neither a teammate nor the target late on. However a fine tackle just inside the Moroccan third afforded one last chance for Thiago Almada, formerly of Atlanta United, to create some chaos. Slaloming past two defenders his first shot was blocked, his second spilled by Munir El Kajoui. Otamendi was convinced he had scored off the rebound only to see El Kajoui tip the ball onto the bar. An instant later it was struck again, Bruno Amione's flick bouncing back onto the head of Medina, who appeared to have earned a precious point for the two time gold medalists.\n\nHowever a flurry of missiles, seemingly cups and flares from the stands, appeared to quell Argentine celebrations and prompted the players to abandon the pitch. The 15 minutes of added time were only the start of it then. Not until around 7 p.m. local time was the game even approaching its conclusion, one that felt rather like a training ground drill where 11 red shirts bid to hold firm against Argentina. They did so in impressive fashion, earning a victory that will set them fair in pursuit of a medal.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The crowd was told to leave the stadium, but players remained at the venue and returned to the pitch for a final three minutes of added time in an empty stadium.\n\nMoments before play resumed, Cristian Medina's disputed goal was disallowed by VAR for offside, and Morocco held on for the victory.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Bottles and cups were strewn over the pitch by the time the game was paused.\n\nIt was initially thought that the full-time whistle had been blown. Even FIFA's website declared the game over.\n\nAbout an hour after the incident, organizers at the venue confirmed the match was not officially over and VAR would review whether the goal would stand.\n\nPlayers eventually re-entered the field after a long delay and began to warm up before the game could be concluded. After warmups, players from both teams stood on the field in the otherwise empty stadium while an official reviewed the video. He offered a brief explanation to Argentina while players on Morocco's bench celebrated.\n\nPlay went on for about three minutes after the resumption before the final whistle was blown.\n\nMorocco had led the game 2-0 before Argentina's fight back. Giuliano Simeone scored in the 68th minute before Medina's effort sparked chaotic scenes.\n\nThe game was broadcast in cafes throughout Morocco, where national pride has swelled since the country advanced to the semifinal in the 2022 World Cup. During a record-breaking heatwave, tea-drinking men screamed at televisions and watched in shock as fans stormed the field.\n\nZak Eddakir, a 28 year-old from Rabat, said the fans' reaction had to do with soccer's importance in Morocco and a natural disappointment at a draw and the idea that a referee's call could end a game.\n\n\"In football, it's normal,\" he said. \"When you see something like that, it's really hard for supporters. Here, football is life. Even the King supports it.\"\n\nHairdresser Khadija Seffany streamed into the street to embrace her friends and neighbors after Morocco emerged victorious. She initially thought the delay in calling the goal offside suggested the referees wanted Argentina to win because Morocco is an Arab country. Every match throughout the Olympics will be important, she said.\n\n\"Here, we're one of the best in the world. We drink football. We eat football,\" Seffany said.\n\nAP writer Sam Metz contributed to this story.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your

This wouldn't even happen in a neighbourhood tournament.

Bottles and cups were strewn over the pitch by the time the game was paused.\n\nIt was initially thought that the full-time whistle had been blown.

However, after a delay of more than one hour, Argentina's equalizer was ruled offside followed by the final three minutes of the match being played behind closed doors.\n\nEntering the 90th minute with a scoreline of Argentina 1-2 Morocco, the fourth official signaled 15 minutes of injury time due to the pitch invasions and time-wasting in the second half. Then, incredibly, Boca Juniors midfielder Cristian Medina scored an equalizer in the 16th minute of injury time, and that's when the chaos ensued. Furious Morocco fans invaded the pitch, throwing objects on the field and at Argentina players.\n\nAfter the players left the field, most viewers assumed the game had ended. However, there was plenty of confusion when the official Olympics website indicated that the game had finished.\n\nOr had it?\n\nAfter a delay of more than one hour, the players returned to the pitch while the referee, after consulting the VAR monitor screen, disallowed Argentina's late equalizer. So with the score at Argentina 1-2 Morocco, the final three minutes of the game were played with no fans in the stadium. Ultimately, Morocco hung on to finish the game victorious.\n\nThe match opened up the men's tournament but was interrupted several times by pitch invasions, hurled objects, and lengthy time-wasting.\n\nBoth sides had a slow start to the match. They both played timidly, prodding through each others' defense and searching for any weaknesses. Each side preferred to play short, back-and-forth passes, slowing the game down.\n\nThrough some fancy footwork, the game saw its first goal. The underdogs, who looked ready to follow the senior team in a surprise deep run, took the lead just before halftime. Highly fancied winger Ilias Akhomach completed a roulette past an Argentina defender on the wing, flicking on an effort to El Khannous. El Khannous slammed a cutback from the goal line towards a streaking Soufiane Rahimi. Rahimi, one of the team's overaged players, stabbed his effort past keeper Ger\u00f3nimo Rulli to score.\n\nAs the Moroccans celebrated wildly, a flare was lit and red smoke poured from the stands. Hakimi fired up the crowd, throwing his arms up, and kissing the badge. It was something out of a dream, especially for a soccer-mad nation that has spent billions of dollars and even more hours developing its golden generation.\n\nMorocco would get another chance with El Khannous powering, again, through the goal line. After fighting off, an Argentine defender took down El Khannous in the heart of the penalty box. After a brief VAR check, the referee awarded Morocco a penalty. Rahimi buried his penalty deep into the bottom left corner, narrowly beating the outstretched Rulli and doubling Morocco's lead.\n\nThis time, green flares erupted from the stands.\n\nFrom there, it seemed Morocco had a firm control of the match. They played free-flowing, fluid soccer, constantly bombarding a frail Argentina defense. Super-sub Abde Ezzalzouli raced down the left-hand flank with around a half-hour left in the game and squared the ball to Rahimi. It took an excellent save from Rulli to prevent Rahimi's hattrick.\n\nBut, all of a sudden, Argentina got a goal back. After a crossed ball fell to left-back Julio Soler, Soler's half-volley attempt fell perfectly to Giuliano Simeone at the back post. The Atletico Madrid attacker poked his effort into the goal. With 20 or so minutes of play left, Argentina had ample time to both get a goal back or get their first lead.\n\nArgentina's lifeline in the game wouldn't be the creative stroke of Echeverri or Alvarez, but the 15 minutes of added time tacked onto the game. American commentators thought it was a mistake. However, the numbers slowly drew into the eighth minute, the tenth minute, and the twelfth minute. Morocco bogged the game down by exaggerating injuries and throwing the ball out of play several times. However, 15 minutes of extra time was objectively harsh and would prove to have big consequences.\n\nMorocco lost their creativity and attacking hunger throughout extra time and simply hunkered into their shell. Argentina bombarded Morocco with chance after chance, and it took a couple of amazing saves from Morocco keeper Munir.\n\nWith one of the last kicks of the game, Thiago Almada fired a blasted shot into Munir. Munir couldn't get a firm grip on it, and the ball fell to Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi. Munir barely tipped Otamendi's shot away, sending it into the crossbar.\n\nBruno Amione's header also met the crossbar. The rebound fell flatly to Medina, who easily tapped the ball into an open net. The Argentine team celebrated wildly in front of the cameras. But, Moroccan fans retaliated by throwing drinks and objects at the corner flag.\n\nAfter the full-time whistle, two angry Moroccan fans stormed the pitch and attempted to confront the Argentine players. They were escorted off by security. While the Argentine players lined up to enter the tunnel leading to their locker rooms, Moroccan fans pelted them with more objects, including an object that looked like a flare.\n\nArgentine media reported that players were still resting in the locker room waiting on a final decision from Olympics higher-ups. The IOC decided that the teams would play the final three minutes of the match without fans.", "source": {"uri": "worldsoccertalk.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Soccer Talk"}, "authors":

The late goal didn't go down well with the angry Moroccan fans as they ran onto the pitch and threw bottles from the stands. The chaos ensued. The stewards earned their day's job as they had to literally escort fans out of the ground. However, the bizarre scenes led to confusion as to whether the match was halted or completed.\n\nIt seemed like the game was over as FIFA's official website also declared the same, however, the remaining three minutes of the game took place behind the closer doors. The fans were asked to leave the stadium and the players to remain after the whole controversy. Minutes before the restart, the infamous goal by Christian Medina was disallowed by VAR for offside and Morocco held on to a 2-1 win.\n\nMedina's goal sparked a strangely angry reaction from the fans as they thought that one opportunity of a win over one of the leading football teams was snatched. Morocco was leading rather comfortably 2-0 before Argentina made a strong comeback in the 68th minute through Giuliano Simeone's goal.\n\nArgentina's soccer federation confirmed issuing a formal claim to FIFA taking the \"necessary regulatory measures for such a serious event.\"\n\n\"Paris 2024 is working with the relevant stakeholders to understand the causes and identify appropriate actions,\" a spokesperson for Paris Olympics organizers said.

turns Morocco vs Argentina Paris Olympics football opener into a circus", "body": "New Delhi: The men's football tournament of Paris Olympics descended into chaos as violence marked Morocco's shock 2-1 win over two-time gold medallist Argentina.\n\nThe match was suspended for nearly two hours after agitated Moroccan fans invaded the pitch in Saint-Etienne to protest a late Argentine goal in the 16th minute of added time.\n\nThe Moroccan fans threw objects and had to be tackled by security personnel on the field at Stade Geoffroy-Guichard after Cristian Medina appeared to have pulled Argentina level at 2-2.\n\nImages suggested Argentina players had to take evasive action as a flare was thrown onto the field and the pitch was littered with bottles and cups when the game was paused.\n\nThe teams had left the field after the fans ran onto the pitch only to discover later that the game hadn't concluded but suspended by the referee.\n\nMedina scored for Argentina deep in injury time to salvage what appeared to be a 2-2 draw, but a VAR review ruled out the goal for offside after about two hours of delay.\n\nAfter the stadium was vacated, the teams re-emerged on to the pitch to playing the remaining three minutes and 15 seconds to finish the match after a VAR review had chalked off the Argentine goal.\n\nSoufiane Rahimi's brace had put Morocco in a commanding 2-0 lead before Giuliano Simeone pulled one back for the 2004 and 2008 gold medallists in the 68th minute.\n\n\"I don't remember something like this happening at this level, that the match is suspended for an hour and a half, warming up for 10 minutes and then play three,\" said Argentina manager Javier Mascherano.\n\n\"What happened on the pitch was a scandal, it's not a neighbourhood tournament, it's the Olympics.\"\n\nArgentina's football federation issued a formal appeal to global governing body FIFA to \"take the necessary regulatory measures for such a serious event.\"\n\n\"Paris 2024 is

Fans were instructed to leave the stadium, with messages on the big screen stating the match had been suspended.\n\nThe match was listed as being delayed with the score level at 2-2, with both Argentina and Morocco listing the match as a result on social media.\n\nIn remarkable scenes, players were then recalled to complete the closing stages of the match.\n\nA VAR review on Argentina's goal found that Medina had been offside, with Argentina's equaliser subsequently ruled out.\n\nPlayers were granted a 20 minute warm-up before a resumption at 7pm local time, four hours after the match had kicked off in Saint-Etienne.\n\nThe referee began the resumption of play by confirming Argentina's equalising goal had been ruled out for offside.\n\nArgentina were unable to find another equaliser in the three minutes that were played after the restart, with Morocco celebrating a 2-1 win in extraordinary circumstances.\n\nArgentina's senior men's captain Lionel Messi, who is not part of the squad at the Olympics, reacted to the match be labelling the situation as 'extraordinary' on social media.\n\nThe pre-match build-up had surrounded the anger from Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez engaging in a racist singalong with the Argentinian national team.\n\nThe anger spilled into the Games in France, with missiles forcing their game with Morocco to be suspended.\n\nArgentina were booed by fans at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard in St-Etienne but the situation worsened when they equalised 16 minutes into stoppage time.\n\nA goal from Giuliano Simeone and a stoppage time effort from Cristian Medina saw Argentina fight back to appear to have levelled the match.\n\nMedina's stoppage time goal was followed by a pitch invasion from some Moroccan fans, while firecrackers, flares and bottles were thrown as Swedish referee Glenn Nyberg told the players to leave the pitch.\n\nA message was displayed at the stadium, reading 'your session has been suspended, please leave the stadium'.\n\nPlayers were then recalled to complete the match behind closed doors with fans having left the venue.\n\nMedina's goal was disallowed upon the resumption, with Morocco leading through two Soufiane Rahimi efforts.\n\nThere were more than four hours between the start of the match and the final whistle.\n\nA Paris 2024 statement on the match read: 'The football match between Argentina and Morocco at the Saint-Etienne Stadium was suspended due to a pitch invasion by a small number of spectators.\n\n'The match then restarted and was able to conclude safely. Paris 2024 is working with the relevant stakeholders to understand the causes and identify appropriate actions.'\n\nAnd just over an hour after kick-off in the football, Argentina's rugby sevens side were loudly booed ahead of their clash against Kenya.\n\nThe boos drowning out the anthem came just over a week after Chelsea footballer Fernandez filmed himself and his Argentina team-mates singing a chant directed at France's black players following their Copa America triumph.\n\nThe song, which also singles out Kylian Mbappe, was condemned by the French Football Federation who filed a complaint to FIFA.\n\nFernandez's Chelsea team-mate Wesley Fofana also reposted the video and labelled the chant 'uninhibited racism' before unfollowing Fernandez on Instagram.\n\nTwo other Chelsea players - Malo Gusto and Axel Disasi - also unfollowed Fernandez.\n\nThe midfielder subsequently apologised for the video and insisted he is not racist, while Chelsea reacted by condemning 'all forms of discriminatory behaviour' prior to conducting their own investigation.\n\nBut fans inside the Geoffroy-Guichard Stadium and the Stade de France had clearly not forgotten what has gone on in recent days, and made their feelings clear how they felt about the behaviour of the Argentina footballers last week.\n\nFrance's former football captain Hugo Lloris described the controversial song as an 'attack on French people' this week and urged that it was a mistake that must been learned from.\n\n'It doesn't matter if you are in a moment of euphoria because you have won an important trophy,' he told BBC Sport. 'It demands even more responsibility when you are a winner.\n\n'You don't want to hear or see this kind of thing in football. We all stand against discrimination and racism.\n\n'I just think and hope it is a mistake. We all make mistakes sometimes and hopefully they will learn from it.'\n\nRelations between France and Argentina worsened after the tense and enthralling 2022 World Cup final in Qatar, which saw Lionel Messi and Co narrowly win on penalties following a 3-3 draw.\n\nKylian Mbappe, who netted a hat-trick in the showpiece, was ruthlessly mocked as part of Argentina's overjubilant celebrations.\n\nDespite playing a key role in Argentina's World Cup and Copa America triumphs, Fernandez is not playing at the Olympics and is currently enjoying time away from the pitch ahead of the new season with Chelsea.\n\nHe was paraded at his old club River Plate over the weekend, only for the whole crowd to start singing the chant aimed at France's black players once more.\n\nThe chaotic scenes in France coincided with Chelsea's new head coach Enzo Maresca using his first press conference in the United States to play down talk of Fernandez's footage disrupting their pre-season preparations, claiming they will encounter no issues when he returns.\n\nSpeaking out in the US where Chelsea are currently on their pre-season tour, Maresca said: 'The player did a statement, apologised, and the club did the same. I don't think there is something to add, the situation is already clear.'\n\nAsked if there will be problems bringing him back into the squad, Maresca added: 'I don't think so, to be honest. At the end, they are all human beings, I don't think there are any bad intentions from any one of them.\n\n'When Enzo is back, I don't think we will have any problems, the player already clarified the situation, and the club did the same. There is nothing to add.\n\n'He is not a bad human being. It can happen, I don't think there are any problems at all. I spoke with Enzo, I spoke with a lot of them. The player has made a statement and apologised, it is clear.'\n\nReece James also broached the subject as the Chelsea captain said: 'Enzo acknowledged he did wrong and apologised to the club and the team. I have spoken to Enzo and everyone involved but those conversations have to stay in house.'", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors":

Over hour after many thought that Cristian Medina had earned an equaliser for Argentina with the last shot of a dramatic game, their group stage game against Morocco resumed behind closed doors, a VAR check ruling out the equaliser for an offside.\n\nCristian Medina thought he had turned a two goal deficit into a crucial draw for one of the pre-tournament favorites, prompting jubilant scenes on the Argentine bench that were greeted in hostile fashion by the Saint-Etienne crowd, missiles flung in the direction of the pitch. That prompted referee Glenn Nyberg to take the players off the pitch before the game had finished, though that news was not immediately apparent to Olympics organisers.\n\nFor more than half an hour the competition website said the game had been \"interrupted\" before subsequently concluding that the match had in fact finished. An hour after Medina's goal that wasn't, both sides were back on the the field at the Stade Geoffrey-Guichard, supporters having long since departed as they began a 20 minute warm up to be followed by three minutes of further action.\n\nInstead, it was African youth champions Morocco who started much the brighter, Paris Saint-Germain right back Achraf Hakimi a particular bright spark in a controlled start to proceedings. Roared on by a crowd where even those with no rooting interest had taken against Argentina -- perhaps in light of the controversy sparked by a racist chant from the senior squad after they won the Copa America earlier this month -- Morocco probed and interchanged impressively, a flowing team move setting up Soufiane Rahimi to fire them into the lead at close range as half time loomed.\n\nThe drama had only just begun. Though Argentina saw much of the ball in the second half they seemed short on ideas for what to do with it, crashing against an organised opposition defense. Had theirs been set up as effectively then Ilias Akhomach would not have been able to glide past veteran Nicolas Otamendi and into the box. Julio Soler might have felt that the hand he placed on the Villarreal forward's back was not enough to send him down, but it invited danger. Akhomach hit the floor and Nyberg concluded it was a penalty, duly converted by Rahimi.\n\nSoler at least made amends by teeing up substitute Giuliano Simeone soon after, ensuring that Argentina had only one goal to make up going into what appeared to be the final third of the game. However this match in which 33 fouls were committed ran and ran into 15 minutes of added time that were a veritable siege on the Moroccan goal.\n\nIt looked as though Tarik Sektioui's side might have weathered the storm when a flicked header from Julian Alvarez found neither a teammate nor the target late on. However a fine tackle just inside the Moroccan third afforded one last chance for Thiago Almada, formerly of Atlanta United, to create some chaos. Slaloming past two defenders his first shot was blocked, his second spilled by Munir El Kajoui. Otamendi was convinced he had scored off the rebound only to see El Kajoui tip the ball onto the bar. An instant later it was struck again, Bruno Amione's flick bouncing back onto the head of Medina, who appeared to have earned a precious point for the two time gold medalists.\n\nHowever a flurry of missiles, seemingly cups and flares from the stands, appeared to quell Argentine celebrations and prompted the players to abandon the pitch. The 15 minutes of added time were only the start of it then. Not until around 7 p.m. local time was the game even approaching its conclusion.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_benge@cbssports.com", "name": "James Benge", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristian_Medina", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cristian Medina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Nyberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Nyberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behind_closed_doors_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Behind closed doors (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-\u00c9tienne", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-\u00c9tienne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-\u00c9tienne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soufiane_Rahimi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soufiane Rahimi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achraf_Hakimi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Achraf Hakimi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Soler_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Soler (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuliano_Simeone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giuliano Simeone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilias_Akhomach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ilias Akhomach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Amione", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bruno Amione"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiago_Almada", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thiago Almada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_United_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta United FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarik_Sektioui", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tarik Sektioui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munir_El_Haddadi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Munir El Haddadi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol\u00e1s_Otamendi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villarreal_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Villarreal CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Medina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/07/24/fa8af11a-e7da-4fca-ad04-0e20ba5e43ba/thumbnail/1200x675/22f36b4072d7eb031cc2db34e0a9ec9f/untitled-design-2024-07-24t173945-826.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759096", "eventUri": "eng-9759096", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Here's how what will surely be one of the most dramatic moments of Paris 2024 played out:\n\nWhat had happened before Medina's goal that wasn't?\n\nQuite a lot actually. Argentina were hardly given the warmest of welcomes in Saint-Etienne -- more on that momentarily -- and their opponents Morocco were hardly inclined to make life easy for one of the pre-tournament favorites anyway. Africa's Under-23 champions were outstanding from the outset and were good value for the lead they claimed on the stroke of half time, Soufiane Rahimi sweeping home at the end of a fine team move.\n\nWhen the Al Ain striker doubled his side's lead from the penalty spot in the second half, Julio Soler having pushed Ilias Akhomach in the penalty area, it seemed Morocco were bound for a famous triumph over the two time Olympic champions. Giuliano Simeone halved the deficit but the Atlas Lions were clinging on, at least until the last exchanges. Thiago Almada's jinking on the edge of the box prompting chaos inside it, Munir El Kajoui saving twice, the bar hit twice. Medina headed in at close range and that seemed to be that, the celebrations of Javier Mascherano's side prompting angry reactions in the stand. Still most were of the impression that the game was done, the points were split.\n\nWhy did the crowd have such a problem with Argentina?\n\nGiven that Moroccan immigrants and their descendants make up one of the largest such communities in France, Argentina might always have expected the crowd to be against them in the Stade Geoffrey-Guichard. Events in recent weeks though served to heighten the level of enmity aimed at the Argentine football team. After all, Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez had posted a video to social media in which the victorious Copa America side made racist chants about France and the nationality of their footballers.\n\nTo what extent recent events heightened the hostility is hard to quantify but this was a game that followed several of the more disturbing trends of the footballing summer. At least one supporter had run onto the pitch before Medina's equalizer. When that goal went in more took to the field while objects were thrown at players, who hastily departed to the dressing room.\n\nSo the game was just suspended, right?\n\nIt did not seem so. A string of news outlets, including Reuters and CBS Sports, reported on a game that they believed had reached its conclusion. It only became apparent around half an hour after what most thought had been the game's conclusion that the match had been \"interrupted\", as the Olympics' own live coverage put it. That was then momentarily changed to a final score even as reports emerged from the Argentina camp that the players were unaware whether the game had reached its conclusion.\n\nIn the ground the scoreboard read \"Your session has been suspended, please leave the stadium.\" At just after 7:30 p.m. local time (1:30 p.m. ET) the players returned to the pitch, fans having vacated the stadium, for 20 minutes of warm ups. Three more minutes were to be played. CBS Sports has contacted organisers for clarification on events around the suspension.\n\nOne last chance for Argentina to win the game?\n\nNot quite. What had become apparent in the intervening period was that a VAR check was required on the events leading up to Medina putting the ball in the net. The Boca Juniors player had been offside in the build up. The goal would not stand and Argentina would have three minutes to chase an equalizer. They never really got close. Morocco, quite understandably, packed their box and challenged their opponent to break them down. There was hardly even a save of note for El Kajoui to make. Four hours after the game had kicked off, Morocco were victorious.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nIn footballing terms, Argentina have three days to dust themselves off before they face Iraq in Lyon. Win that game and their meeting with Ukraine on July 30 and they will likely have done enough to qualify for the quarterfinals, allowing them to move on from Wednesday's dramatic events.\n\nHowever frustration is already building at the events around the defeat. Argentina U23s boss Javier Mascherano, formerly of West Ham, described it as \"the biggest circus I have ever seen in my life\". Lionel Messi's one word post on Instagram read \"Ins\u00f3lito\", meaning unusual. Nicolas Tagliafico, another player from the 2024 Copa America winning squad, was altogether less vague. He wrote on X: \"Are we going to talk about the reason why it was suspended or are we going to continue being stupid? If it had been the other way around I can't even imagine what they would be saying.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri":

finished at 7:07pm local time, Morocco claimed victory over the World Cup winners in shocking circumstances.\n\nMedina thought he had drew Argentina level when he headed in a equaliser in the 16th minute of extra time following a chaotic phase of play that saw the ball hit the post twice.\n\nAlmost immediately after there was trouble from the fans as bottles and cans were thrown at the celebrating players with some supporters also breaking onto the pitch.\n\nBoth sets of players were taken off the pitch with the match suspended with still seconds left on the clock.\n\nA decision was then made that the rest of the match would be played in an empty stadium with the referee saying there was still three minutes to play.\n\nAnd in what is the longest VAR check in history, Argentina's equaliser was ruled out after one of the players involved in the attack was offside when Medina scored.\n\nVAR pictures showed that the Argentine was offside by the slimmest of margins with semi-automated technology making the decision.\n\nThe decision was cheered on the Morocco players, who had been forced to stick around.\n\nMorocco went on to win the match 2-1 in the first men's football game of the Paris Olympics with the players having to undergo hefty warm-ups to get up to speed again.\n\nLionel Messi, who is not taking part in the Olympics this summer, was left stunned after reacting on social media.\n\nOn his Instagram story, the Inter Miami star responded by writing: 'Insolito', which loosely translates to 'unusual'.\n\nMorocco sit top of Pool B with Ukraine and

The Games witnessed unprecedented controversy and a major scandal after Argentina's match was suspended due to hooliganism by Morocco fans in the final minutes of the match, their equaliser disallowed, and teams forced to play the final few minutes two hours after scheduled close of the match.The match was halted at 2-2 when several Moroccan fans invaded the pitch and scared the Argentina players with crackers soon after the South Americans scored the equaliser. There was high drama as Argentina's 90+16th minute equaliser was eventually ruled out due to offside after a VAR check which took place two hours after it was scored.\n\nThe score remained 2-1 in favour of Morocco in the remaining time and the African side was eventually declared the winner while the Argentines walked off the ground for a second time, furious over the way the final minutes of the game were handled.\n\nMorocco, led by PSG star Achraf Hakimi, started the game on a strong note and soon took a 2-0 lead. However, Argentina fought back into the game in the second half and twice, the equaliser coming in 90+16 minutes to make it 2-2.\n\nThe Moroccan fans, absolutely fuming at the equaliser after a host of decisions allegedly went against their team including Argentine players not getting a red card. The fans invaded the pitch in anger and threw firecrackers on the ground, which scared the Argentinian players as they rushed back to the dressing room.\n\nMoroccan fans thought their team was robbed of victory and poured into the field, breaching security, resulting in suspension of play. Eventually, the field of play was cleared of the invaders, the two teams returned to the middle and the referee consulted VAR, eventually ruling out the goal.\n\nThe match eventually ended in controversy as the Argentina players were not happy with the way it all ended.\n\nAlso, this incident raised questions over the security of Athletes at the Summer Games in Paris Olympics, a day ahead of the Opening Ceremony, and left the organizing committee red-faced with embarrassment.\n\nArgentina defender Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi was really disappointed with the way the two teams were forced to play the match following a written statement from the organsiers.\n\n\"It's a historic piece of paper.

The crowd was told to leave the stadium, but players remained at the venue and returned to the pitch for a final three minutes of added time in an empty stadium.\n\nMoments before play resumed, Cristian Medina's disputed goal was disallowed by VAR for offside, and Morocco held on for the victory.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Bottles and cups were strewn over the pitch by the time the game was paused.\n\nIt was initially thought that the full-time whistle had been blown. Even FIFA's website declared the game over.\n\nAbout an hour after the incident, organizers at the venue confirmed the match was not officially over and VAR would review whether the goal would stand.\n\nPlayers eventually re-entered the field after a long delay and began to warm up before the game could be concluded. After warmups, players from both teams stood on the field in the otherwise empty stadium while an official reviewed the video. He offered a brief explanation to Argentina while players on Morocco's bench celebrated.\n\nPlay went on for about three minutes after the resumption before the final whistle was blown.\n\nMorocco had led the game 2-0 before Argentina's fight back. Giuliano Simeone scored in the 68th minute before Medina's effort sparked chaotic scenes.\n\nThe game was broadcast in cafes throughout Morocco, where national pride has swelled since the country advanced to the semifinal in the 2022 World Cup. During a record-breaking heatwave, tea-drinking men screamed at televisions and watched in shock as fans stormed the field.\n\nZak Eddakir, a 28 year-old from Rabat, said the fans' reaction had to do with soccer's importance in Morocco and a natural disappointment at a draw and the idea that a referee's call could end a game.\n\n\"In football, it's normal,\" he said. \"When you see something like that, it's really hard for supporters. Here, football is life. Even the King supports it.\"\n\nHairdresser Khadija Seffany streamed into the street to embrace her friends and neighbors after Morocco emerged victorious. She initially thought the delay in calling the goal offside suggested the referees wanted Argentina to win because Morocco is an Arab country. Every match throughout the Olympics will be important, she said.\n\n\"Here, we're one of the best in the world. We drink football. We eat football,\" Seffany said.\n\nAP writer Sam Metz contributed to this story.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your

Cristian Medina's bundled header with one of the last kicks of the game ultimately earned a draw for Javier Mascherano's side, who for much of this game failed to live up to their pre-tournament status as one of the favorites to win gold.\n\nInstead, it was African youth champions Morocco who started much the brighter, Paris Saint-Germain right back Achraf Hakimi a particular bright spark in a controlled start to proceedings. Roared on by a crowd where even those with no rooting interest had taken against Argentina -- perhaps in light of the controversy sparked by a racist chant from the senior squad after they won the Copa America earlier this month -- Morocco probed and interchanged impressively, a flowing team move setting up Soufiane Rahimi to fire them into the lead at close range as half time loomed.\n\nThe drama had only just begun. Though Argentina saw much of the ball in the second half they seemed short on ideas for what to do with it, crashing against an organised opposition defense. Had theirs been set up as effectively then Ilias Akhomach would not have been able to glide past veteran Nicolas Otamendi and into the box. Julio Soler might have felt that the hand he placed on the Villarreal forward's back was not enough to send him down, but it invited danger. Akhomach hit the floor and Glenn Nyberg concluded it was a penalty, duly converted by Rahimi.\n\nSoler at least made amends by teeing up substitute Giuliano Simeone soon after, ensuring that Argentina had only one goal to make up going into what appeared to be the final third of the game. However this match in which 33 fouls were committed ran and ran into 15 minutes of added time that were a veritable siege on the Moroccan goal.\n\nIt looked as though Tarik Sektioui's side might have weathered the storm when a flicked header from Julian Alvarez found neither a teammate nor the target late on. However a fine tackle just inside the Moroccan third afforded one last chance for Thiago Almada, formerly of Atlanta United, to create some chaos. Slaloming past two defenders his first shot was blocked, his second spilled by Munir El Kajoui. Otamendi was convinced he had scored off the rebound only to see El Kajoui tip the ball onto the bar. An instant later it was struck again, Bruno Amione's flick bouncing back onto the head of Medina, who appeared to have earned a precious point for the two time gold medalists.\n\nHowever a flurry of missiles, seemingly thrown cups from the stands, appeared to quell Argentine celebrations and prompted the players to abandon the pitch. For over half an hour after the final whistle the official Olympics coverage of the match labelled it \"interrupted\" while reports in Argentina said that players were waiting in the dressing room for confirmation that a dramatic game had indeed concluded.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_benge@cbssports.com", "name": "James Benge", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soufiane_Rahimi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soufiane Rahimi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achraf_Hakimi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Achraf Hakimi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javier_Mascherano", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Javier Mascherano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AS_Saint-\u00c9tienne", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AS Saint-\u00c9tienne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Header (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilias_Akhomach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ilias Akhomach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Nyberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Nyberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol\u00e1s_Otamendi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Soler_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Soler (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villarreal_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Villarreal CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuliano_Simeone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giuliano Simeone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Amione", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bruno Amione"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiago_Almada", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thiago Almada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_United_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta United FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarik_Sektioui", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tarik Sektioui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munir_El_Haddadi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Munir El Haddadi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/07/24/fa8af11a-e7da-4fca-ad04-0e20ba5e43ba/thumbnail/1200x675/22f36b4072d7eb031cc2db34e0a9ec9f/untitled-design-2024-07-24t173945-826.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759096", "eventUri": "eng-9759096", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Click and follow now!\n\nMorocco's opening game of the football tournament at the Paris 2024 Olympics was marked by a controversial officiating call.\n\nLed by Paris Saint-Germain fullback Achraf Hakimi, the North Africans took to Stade Geoffroy-Guichard against Argentina in the first Group B game.\n\nArgentina were quickly off the blocks, but it was Morocco who drew the first punch courtesy of some brilliant work by Bilal El Khannouss to find Soufiane Rahimi at the back post.\n\nRahimi doubled his side's advantage after the break after Ilias Akhomach was fouled inside the area by Julio Soler.\n\nArgentina, who are under the tutelage of former international Javier Mascherano, dug deep, with substitute Guiliano Simeone halving the deficit in the 68th minute.\n\nAs the South Americans pressed on for an equaliser, the game took a surprising turn after 15 minutes of extra time was added at the end of the second half. Cristian Medina thought he had drawn Argentina level in the 16th minute of stoppage time.\n\nThe added time elicited sharp reactions from fans online, with fans thinking Argentina had managed to grab a point.\n\n\"They had to add 15 mins extra time. Then Argentina scored in the 16 minutes, and they ended the game immediately. They are never beating the allegations.\"\n\n@David said,\n\n\"What a horrible start to Olympic Men's football. Legitimately no justifiable reason to add 15 minutes of extra time, which has just robbed Morocco of a major win.\"\n\nBut in a crucial twist, some fans invaded the pitch after the final whistle, prompting police and stewards to step in. The crowd trouble forced the officials to halt the match pending a VAR review.\n\nMedina's equaliser was chalked off for offside, but by this time, the players had retreated to the dressing rooms as security officials dealt with the pitch invaders.\n\nESPN reports that the players returned to the pitch after almost one hour and completed the remainder of the match. Morocco held on to their lead to register a famous win over the 2008 champions.\n\nIn another report, YEN.com.gh disclosed that Argentina captain, Lionel Messi has named Vinicius and Kylian Mbappe among the frontrunners for the 2024 Ballon d'Or award.\n\nThe Ballon d'Or, which both Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi have largely dominated over the last decade, saw the Argentina captain add another to his record-extending accolade following his triumph at the 2022 FIFA World Cup.", "source": {"uri": "yen.com.gh", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yen.com.gh - Ghana news."}, "authors": [{"uri": "richard_nutakor@yen.com.gh", "name": "Richard Nutakor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soufiane_Rahimi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Soufiane Rahimi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achraf_Hakimi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Achraf Hakimi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Geoffroy-Guichard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Geoffroy-Guichard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Soler_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Soler (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_invasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch invasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javier_Mascherano", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Javier Mascherano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Simeone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diego Simeone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d'Or", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ballon d'Or"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_at_the_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football at the Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cristiano Ronaldo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn.yen.com.gh/images/1200x675/fb3298f5e03aa18b.jpeg?v=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759096", "eventUri": "eng-9759096", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

But that is how it is. We cannot control it. I told the boys that now we need to look forward, try to get the six points that will allow us to qualify and that all this should fill us with energy and anger for what we have ahead of us.\"\n\nMascherano said the captains of the two teams had agreed not to restart the game after Medina put the ball in the net, as projectiles including plastic cups and bottles rained down and spectators invaded the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard pitch.\n\n\"The captains decided not to play on at that point, and as time went on different versions (of events) started to appear,\" he said.\n\n\"The annoying thing is that the match was suspended. If you are going to review something, review it just after the incident,\" he said of Medina's disallowed goal, which appeared to be the equaliser after Giuliano Simeone had earlier pulled one back.\n\n\"At no point were we told the goal was not valid.\"\n\nOf the decision to bring the players back out later on to complete the match, he added: \"They called FIFA. I don't know who took it, but everyone was involved.\n\n\"It is a disgrace that this should happen and poison the tournament. This wouldn't even happen in a neighbourhood tournament.

The game took place at the Geoffroy-Guichard Stadium in Saint-Etienne, which Moroccan fans filled to the brim.\n\nThe game started with high energy from both sides, as Argentina looked to assert their dominance early. However, Morocco's well-organized defense and counter-attacks kept the Albiceleste at bay.\n\nThe first half was a hard-fought battle with numerous attempts from both teams. Argentina's forward Julian Alvarez made several promising runs, but Moroccan goalkeeper Mounir Mohamedi was in top form as he made crucial saves.\n\nAs the first half progressed, Morocco gained momentum, and their efforts paid off right on the stroke of half-time. In the overtime of the first half, a well-executed move saw Ilias Akhomach's backheel find Bilal El Khannouss, who delivered a low cross to Soufiane Rahimi. The latter hammered the ball into the net from close range, giving Morocco a 1-0 lead heading into the break.\n\nThe second half began with the Atlas Lions maintaining their confidence and control. Just four minutes in, Morocco was awarded a penalty after Akhomach was fouled by Argentina's Julio Soler. Rahimi stepped up and calmly converted the spot-kick, sending the ball into the net and extending Morocco's lead to 2-0.\n\nDetermined to fight back, Argentina increased their attacking pressure. In the 67th minute Giuliano Simeone made an immediate impact. Simeone found the back of the net with a well-placed shot, reducing the deficit to 2-1 and reviving Argentina's hopes.\n\nDespite Argentina's efforts to equalize, Morocco's defense held firm.

Some fans even entered the pitch as play was suspended with the score tied at 2-2.\n\nWhen the Argentine players celebrated their second goal, projectiles, including bottles and plastic cups rained down from the stands and several spectators entered the pitch, with the referee promptly blowing the whistle.\n\nIn the injury time, Argentina were 1-2 down, and Cristian Medina scored a goal in the 90+16', which looked like a 2-2 draw, but it was ruled out about two hours after play was suspended.\n\nThe teams left the playing area, but the referee had not blown for full-time and the outcome of the match was completely unclear until the sides finally reappeared two hours later to play out three more minutes in a stadium that was by now emptied of spectators.\n\nArgentina football team captain Lionel Messi, who is not part of their Olympic squad, reacted on his Instagram story after the goal was disallowed and they lost the match.\n\nMessi wrote \"Insolito\" on Instagram story. It translates to 'unbelievable' or 'unusual' in English.\n\nArgentina manager Javier Mascherano was stunned by what happened during the match, and he didn't mince his words while describing it as \"the biggest circus I've ever seen in my life\".\n\nArgentina are looking to win men's football gold for the third time after success in 2004 and 2008, but Javier Mascherano's side trailed 2-0 following a brace by Soufiane Rahimi.\n\nMeanwhile, it was an underwhelming performance from Argentina despite having Nicholas Otamendi, Julian Alvarez and Geronimo Rulli - the Copa America winners, in their squad.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-\u00c9tienne", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-\u00c9tienne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-\u00c9tienne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soufiane_Rahimi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soufiane Rahimi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol\u00e1s_Otamendi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javier_Mascherano", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Javier Mascherano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ger\u00f3nimo_Rulli", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ger\u00f3nimo Rulli"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/07/24/1600x900/Messi_Mascherano_1721845539034_1721845547791.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759096", "eventUri": "eng-9759096", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Subsequent pandemonium saw fans storming the pitch and Argentine players seeking refuge in the tunnel as firecrackers were hurled their way.\n\nAnd over an hour later, it was revealed that VAR had disallowed Medina's close-range goal for offside. Mascherano was furious with the 40-year-old describing it as \"the biggest circus I've ever seen in my life.\"\n\nThe Stade Geoffroy-Guichard was the stage for some shocking scenes after Morocco took a surprising 2-0 lead in the match that kicked off at 2pm.

An extraordinary 15 minutes of added time was given at the end of the game, giving the trailing side enough time to complete their comeback.

They got out of their seats and rushed the field.\n\nThe chaos led to players on Argentina ducking for cover and rushing off the field. Police, including some in full riot gear, came onto the pitch in an effort to bring back order.\n\nYou can see the Argentina team all flinch at the same time as loud bangs were going off from what appear to be firecrackers thrown on the field.\n\nAfter a very long break to subdue fans and get everyone out of the building, it was revealed that the game had not ever finished but instead been suspended due to the chaos in the crowd.\n\nUpon further review, the tying goal was reversed due to Argentina being offside, and the two teams were ordered to continue playing with the score reverting back to 2-1 in favour of Morocco.\n\nThe match was suspended for roughly two hours from when Argentina scored the tying goal to when the two sides were ordered to resume play. During that time the result switched back and forth from final to suspended on the official Olympics website.\n\nAfter resuming play, the two teams played for an additional few minutes with no fans present to finish the game.

They will resume the match with additional three minutes of play without the presence of an audience.\n\nThe match, which saw emotions running high on both sides, has sparked widespread debate and accusations of unfair officiating.\n\nThe large amount of added time, which resulted in Argentina securing an equalizer in the 106th minute, has many fans wondering about the fairness of the call, feeling sympathy for Morocco's side.\n\nThe controversy erupted online as spectators and football enthusiasts alike took to social media platforms to express their disbelief and frustration.\n\nOne X user exclaimed, \"15 MINUTES???!!! This is the most rigged thing ever. How is that even possible? There was nothing, should have been maximum 5 minutes.\"\n\nHis sentiments were echoed by many who felt that such a lengthy addition of time was unprecedented and unjustified towards the Moroccan team.\n\nAnother user on X, voiced his indignation, \"Argentina just got gifted 15 minutes of extra time vs Morocco for literally no reason and the referee didn't whistle until they got one final chance and of course they score to equalize. Even in Olympics, they cheat.\"\n\nOn the same sentiment, another X user added fuel to the fire, stating, \"15 added mins? Argentina getting it easy everywhere...I'm sorry for the Morocco fans and the players.\"\n\nAlso siding with Morocco, another critical voice in the debate lamented, \"15 minutes of additional time, what an absolute shame of referring in this match, these Swedish referees for Argentina-Morocco are a disaster.\"\n\nJoueurs Marocains on X also expressed their frustration, calling the added minutes \"a theft.\"\n\nThe last-minute shot by Cristian Medina brought widespread celebration for Argentina fans. However, this has been overshadowed by the contentious circumstances surrounding the added time allocation.\n\nFans wait on the edges of their seats now to find the outcome after the added 3 minutes of playing time.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) and FIFA, the governing bodies of the Olympics and football respectively, have yet to issue official statements regarding the incident.

However, the subsequent pandemonium saw fans storming the pitch and Argentine players seeking refuge in the tunnel as firecrackers were hurled their way.\n\nPlay had already been interrupted twice by pitch invaders, adding to Argentina's exasperation as they pursued the game.

Over an hour later, it was revealed that VAR had disallowed Medina's close-range header for offside, reports the Mirror.\n\nThis meant that more than an hour and 20 minutes later, with no spectators left in the stadium, the two teams returned to the pitch to finish the final stages, with Morocco maintaining a 2-1 lead. The players were called to warm up on the pitch in Saint-Etienne before resuming play at 6pm.\n\nThe extraordinary scenes at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard unfolded after Morocco had taken an unexpected 2-0 lead in the match, which initially kicked off at 2pm. Soufiane Rahimi netted the first goal before doubling their lead from the penalty spot.\n\nGiuliano Simeone then reduced the deficit with a finish at the back post, setting up a thrilling conclusion amidst uproarious scenes.

though these reports seem erroneous when compared to those currently available from reputable news organisations, or with the official video stream of the game.\n\nNonetheless, this was quite the fiery start to an Olympics during which there will be heavy scrutiny on security processes.\n\nNo doubt the organisers of Paris 2024 will be hoping to put a lid on this kind of incident with the games getting into full swing this weekend.", "source": {"uri": "balls.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.balls.ie"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eoin_harrington@balls.ie", "name": "Eoin Harrington", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AS_Saint-\u00c9tienne", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AS Saint-\u00c9tienne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_overage_players_in_Olympic_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of overage players in Olympic football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_at_the_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football at the Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristian_Medina", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cristian Medina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuliano_Simeone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Giuliano Simeone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goal (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soufiane_Rahimi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soufiane Rahimi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_invasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch invasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-time", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Half-time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marca_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marca (newspaper)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://img.resized.co/balls_ie/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL21lZGlhLmJhbGxzLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAyNFxcXC8wN1xcXC8yNDE2MzAwOVxcXC9VbnRpdGxlZC1kZXNpZ24tMjMucG5nXCIsXCJ3aWR0aFwiOjEyMDAsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjo2MjcsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3d3dy5iYWxscy5pZVxcXC9pbWFnZXNcXFwvYnJhbmQtaW1hZ2UuanBnXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6IjU4NzQyMjJmN2FiYTU0NmNhOWUxZDNhN2QzZDAyNjBjNGRjNjU0NmMifQ==/moroccofansstormpitchaftercontroversialargentinaolympicsdrawballsie.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759096", "eventUri": "eng-9759096", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

The Olympics website showed the match as \"interrupted\".\n\nThe order was eventually given for the game to be resumed and completed more than four hours after it initially kicked off at 2pm BST, with another layer of drama as Medina's equaliser was ruled out for offside by the Video Assistant Referee (VAR).\n\nThe last three minutes were eventually finished in front of empty stands after a delay lasting over an hour, with Morocco holding on to claim a valuable opening 2-1 victory.\n\nFans had earlier been ordered to leave the stadium with a message on the scoreboard that read: \"\"Your session has been suspended, please leave the stadium.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_invasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pitch invasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Geoffroy-Guichard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Geoffroy-Guichard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-\u00c9tienne", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-\u00c9tienne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-\u00c9tienne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuliano_Simeone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Giuliano Simeone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soufiane_Rahimi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soufiane Rahimi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javier_Mascherano", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Javier Mascherano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Juniors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boca Juniors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Summer_Time", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Summer Time"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/3dfe02c017db6f6744f7f5e9dde58a92", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759096", "eventUri": "eng-9759096", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Instead, it's a U23 tournament with three overage players allowed. For instance, Christian Pulisic won't be there for the USA and Lionel Messi isn't there for Argentina.\n\nOn Wednesday, Morocco took a 2-1 lead against Argentina deep into the second half, until Argentina scored a crazy equalizer in stoppage time.\n\nA 106th minute goal that's not in extra time is insane. But, it got crazier. Fans stormed the pitch.\n\nThis caused the players to be evacuated to the locker rooms while authorities handled the situation. When the players were brought out, it got even weirder.\n\nTurns out, Argentina was offside.\n\nSo, hours after the goal was given, it was disallowed.

Cristian Medina's bundled a header with one of the last kicks of the game seemed to have earned a draw for Javier Mascherano's side, who for much of this game failed to live up to their pre-tournament status as one of the favorites to win gold.\n\nHowever a stream of what appeared to be missiles hurled from the stands after the equaliser appear to have stopped the game from reaching its conclusion. At the time of writing the Olympics' official website has not confirmed the completion of the game while reports from Argentina state that the players remain in the locker room awaiting the conclusion of the match.\n\nInstead, it was African youth champions Morocco who started much the brighter, Paris Saint-Germain right back Achraf Hakimi a particular bright spark in a controlled start to proceedings. Roared on by a crowd where even those with no rooting interest had taken against Argentina -- perhaps in light of the controversy sparked by a racist chant from the senior squad after they won the Copa America earlier this month -- Morocco probed and interchanged impressively, a flowing team move setting up Soufiane Rahimi to fire them into the lead at close range as half time loomed.\n\nThe drama had only just begun. Though Argentina saw much of the ball in the second half they seemed short on ideas for what to do with it, crashing against an organised opposition defense. Had theirs been set up as effectively then Ilias Akhomach would not have been able to glide past veteran Nicolas Otamendi and into the box. Julio Soler might have felt that the hand he placed on the Villarreal forward's back was not enough to send him down, but it invited danger. Akhomach hit the floor and Glenn Nyberg concluded it was a penalty, duly converted by Rahimi.\n\nSoler at least made amends by teeing up substitute Giuliano Simeone soon after, ensuring that Argentina had only one goal to make up going into what appeared to be the final third of the game. However this match in which 33 fouls were committed ran and ran into 15 minutes of added time that were a veritable siege on the Moroccan goal.\n\nIt looked as though Tarik Sektioui's side might have weathered the storm when a flicked header from Julian Alvarez found neither a teammate nor the target late on. However a fine tackle just inside the Moroccan third afforded one last chance for Thiago Almada, formerly of Atlanta United, to create some chaos. Slaloming past two defenders his first shot was blocked, his second spilled by Munir El Kajoui. Otamendi was convinced he had scored off the rebound only to see El Kajoui tip the ball onto the bar. An instant later it was struck again, Bruno Amione's flick bouncing back onto the head of Medina, who appeared to have earned a precious point for the two time gold medalists.\n\nHowever a flurry of thrown cups from the stands appeared to quell Argentine celebrations and may have prompted the players to abandon the pitch before the game was formally concluded.\n\nThis page is being updated", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_benge@cbssports.com", "name": "James Benge", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javier_Mascherano", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Javier Mascherano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AS_Saint-\u00c9tienne", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AS Saint-\u00c9tienne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilias_Akhomach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ilias Akhomach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soufiane_Rahimi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soufiane Rahimi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achraf_Hakimi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Achraf Hakimi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol\u00e1s_Otamendi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Soler_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Soler (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuliano_Simeone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giuliano Simeone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Amione", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bruno Amione"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Nyberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Nyberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiago_Almada", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thiago Almada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_United_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta United FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarik_Sektioui", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tarik Sektioui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munir_El_Haddadi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Munir El Haddadi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villarreal_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Villarreal CF"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/07/24/fa8af11a-e7da-4fca-ad04-0e20ba5e43ba/thumbnail/1200x675/22f36b4072d7eb031cc2db34e0a9ec9f/untitled-design-2024-07-24t173945-826.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759096", "eventUri": "eng-9759096", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

This is what Celine Dion charges just for singing a song at the Olympic Games\n\nThe Olympic Games have not yet officially started... and we already have the first big scandal: the match between Argentina and Morocco resumed hours after everyone thought it was over.\n\nAdding to the drama is the fact that after the players and referee returned to the field, the Albiceleste's 2-2 goal by Medina in the 106th minute was ruled off, giving the shock win to Morocco.\n\nAll the drama kicked off after what looked to be the goal that made it 202.. At that moment, in the middle of the celebration, a firecracker went off in the middle of the crowd of Argentine players. Fortunately, it did not hit any players and no injuries were reported.\n\nUnfortunately, this was not the only incident at St.-\u00c9tienne. As soon as the 2-2 [later rules off] was scored, there was a pitch invasion by the Morocco fans, the majority of whom were in the stands. The security forces were unable to control the spontaneous supporters who jumped from the stands.\n\nThe referee, Glenn Nyberg, decided to send the players to the locker room for safety. It looked like the game was over... but it wasn't.\n\nAccording to an official, there were still \"4-5 minutes left to play\". The referee wanted to restart the match, and so did the IOC, but the players refused for their own safety.\n\nThis was not an isolated incident. In fact, the match had 16 minutes of added time in the second half because, while the ball was still in play, several fans jumped onto the pitch, causing the match to be interrupted on several occasions.\n\nThe most surprising thing was yet to come.

New Zealand quickly recovered and Garbett scored a minute later for a 1-0 lead.\n\nAliou Balde appeared to equalize for Guinea in the 62nd minute, but it was ruled offside after video review. The team finally broke through with Amadou Diawara's game-tying goal in the 72nd.\n\nNew Zealand answered a minute later with Waine's goal from out in front.\n\nIt is the fourth time that New Zealand is making an Olympic appearance. The OlyWhites, as they are known, advanced to the quarterfinals at the Tokyo Games before falling to host Japan on penalties.\n\nGuinea was making its Olympic debut.\n\nThe match in Nice was sparsely attended, with temperatures in the coastal city reaching the upper 80s Fahrenheit (30 Celsius). Fans also were late in arriving because of an accident that delayed tram service to the match.\n\nSPAIN 2, UZBEKISTAN 1\n\nSergio Gomez scored the winning goal in Spain's 2-1 victory over Uzbekistan to open Group C.\n\nThe match at Parc des Princes in Paris was the first official competition of the Olympics and drew some 35,000 fans.\n\nMarc Pubill scored in the 29th minute for Spain, which won the gold medal at the 1992 Olympics. The team has won silver twice since then, most recently at the Tokyo Games.\n\nEldor Shomurodov converted on a penalty kick in first-half stoppage time to tie it for resilient Uzbekistan, which was making its first Olympic appearance.\n\nGomez had a penalty saved by Abduvohid Nematov in the 59th minute, but some three minutes later he scored from about 12 yards out front of Uzbekistan's goal.\n\nEGYPT 0, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC 0\n\nEgypt and the Dominican Republic played to a scoreless draw in Group C in Nantes.\n\nPeter Gonzalez's apparent goal for the Dominican Republic early in the match was called back because of a foul in the run-up.\n\nEgypt has been to the Olympics 13 times, the most by an African nation, but has never finished higher than fourth. The team made the quarterfinals at the Tokyo Games.\n\nIt was hoped that Mohamed Salah would join Egypt as a senior player for the Olympics, but he declined to focus on Liverpool's preseason. The team is captained by Mohamed Elneny, the former Arsenal midfielder.\n\nThe Dominican Republic was making its Olympic debut.\n\nAP Soccer Writer Anne M.

This was a return to what we've seen in previous FIFA-sanctioned competitions -- lengthy stoppage time -- after Euro 2024 had seen only small amounts added on.\n\nWould there be time for Argentina to force an equaliser?\n\nWhat happened: The 15 minutes of stoppage time were up, and the game had ticked into the 16th when Thiago Almada saw his shot from the edge of the area saved by Munir El Kajoui.\n\nBut the move wasn't over. El Kajoui spilled the ball back out into the centre of goal, with Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi seeing his follow-up effort expertly touched onto the bar by the fine reactions of the goalkeeper.\n\nThe ball bounced down and fell for substitute Bruno Amione on the edge of the six-yard box, who attempted to head back across goal into the far corner. His effort came back off the bar and landed onto the head of Cristian Medina, who had the simple task of nodding into an empty net.\n\nArgentina had done it. It was 2-2 in the 106th minute of the game.\n\nMorocco's fans were furious that Argentina had been allowed to score after time had supposedly elapsed. There were images of some Argentina players flinching when what appeared to be a flare was thrown in their direction. Bottles and cups were strewn over the field by the end as Morocco fans invaded the pitch.\n\nSwedish referee Glenn Nyberg took both sets of players off the pitch, and a message on the big screen in the stadium read: \"Your session has been suspended please make your way to the nearest exit.\"\n\nEveryone assumed the game was over. Scores pages displayed full-time. But it wasn't, and soon the Olympics website showed the match as \"interrupted.\" And while this was happening the VAR, Paolo Valeri of Italy, was of course carrying out his usual checks on a goal.\n\nVAR decision: Goal disallowed, offside against Amione.\n\nVAR review: Play had been stopped for an hour-and-a-half when news came through that Argentina's dramatic equaliser had been ruled out for offside. Against which player? At that stage, we didn't know.\n\nSuch is the nature of the Olympic football tournament -- eight games are played in eight cities across the host country in just eight hours -- that it's difficult to get detailed information, even more so when a stadium has been cleared to prevent any further crowd disturbances meaning there are no public announcements.\n\nWhile the perception will be that it had taken the VAR at least 90 minutes to disallow the goal, it would have been ruled out almost instantly in the course of a routine check through FIFA's semi-automated offside technology.\n\nAs Medina's \"goal\" caused such problems among supporters inside Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, making an immediate decision to disallow it could potentially have caused further crowd issues. The organisers may have felt it was safer to wait until the ground was cleared before announcing the goal had been disallowed through VAR, and that the game would restart behind closed doors -- even if it came across as confusing and was seen as one of VAR's craziest moments.\n\nWhen Otamendi hit his shot, Amione was in front of the last defender. That the keeper got a touch and the ball came back off the bar doesn't reset the offside phase -- Amione remains active and he plays the ball he's offside, and the goal had to be chalked off.\n\nThe players came back out onto the pitch to warm up just before 7 p.m. local time.\n\nAlmost two hours after the game had been \"interrupted,\" Nyberg officially disallowed the goal for a VAR intervention. In a surprising move, he went through the unnecessary ceremonial process of visiting the pitchside monitor, which he wouldn't have done for an offside during the game, and then made the TV signal to the empty ground.\n\nPlay restarted with a free kick to Morocco in their own penalty area.

For 90 minutes, the game was a fairly conventional one that the Moroccans led 2-1. Then, everything went haywire.\n\nFirst, the game's referees put an astounding 15 minutes of stoppage time on the clock -- allowing the Argentinians to apparently tie the game 2-2 at the death. Vehement protests from Morocco's fans led the referees to suspend the game after 16 minutes of stoppage time.\n\nDuring the lengthy stoppage -- which lasted in excess of an hour and a half -- the officials went to video review and ruled Argentina midfielder Cristian Medina's equalizer offside.\n\nFinally, the game was re-started without fans and the Moroccans finished out the victory.\n\nGot all that?\n\nThis is only day one of the competition, if you can believe it.

Argentina has ramped up purchases from Morocco, with cars, salt, and fertilizers leading the influx.\n\nConversely, Moroccan exports to Argentina, encompassing cereals and animal products, witnessed an even steeper rise of over 68%.\n\nThis positive trend extends beyond a single year. Trade between Morocco and Argentina has tripled in the past five years, solidifying Argentina's position as both Morocco's second-largest export destination and third-largest import source within Latin America.\n\nNotably, Morocco emerged as Argentina's top fertilizer supplier in 2023, fulfilling nearly half the nation's needs.\n\nThis development has sparked discussions on forging a more strategic partnership in this sector, potentially mirroring successful initiatives undertaken with India and Nigeria through investments by the Office Ch\u00e9rifien des Phosphates (OCP).\n\nThe phone conversation appears to have set the stage for a multifaceted partnership between Morocco and Argentina. The burgeoning trade relationship, coupled with a shared commitment to regional stability, suggests a promising future for cooperation between the two nations.\n\nArgentina's growing reliance on Moroccan fertilizer presents an opportunity for a strategic alliance, potentially modeled after successful ventures with other countries.\n\nThis strategic partnership could ensure a steady supply of essential agricultural inputs for Argentina while solidifying OCP's presence in the region.\n\n\u00a9 Morocco World News.

"Messi calls Argentina Paris Olympics loss to Morocco 'unusual' after one of the most insane endings in history - CBSSports.com", "body": "The Albiceleste were denied their comeback draw after two-hours of deliberation Getty Images\n\nLionel Messi has called Argentina's Olympic men's soccer defeat to Morocco \"unusual\" after the Albiceleste were denied a late equalizer via a VAR check which occurred almost two hours after the game originally appeared to finish in Saint-Etienne.\n\nThe Inter Miami man who helped the South Americans to become world and continental champions posted his one word response after Javier Mascherano's men had a goal for 2-2 ruled out after 16 minutes of added time at the end of what was eventually declared a 2-1 loss.\n\nCristian Medina thought that he had completed the fightback after Soufiane Rahimi's double put the Moroccans ahead only for Giuliano Simeone to pull one back before Medina's apparent late heroics for the two-time gold medalists.\n\nWhat happened next could turn out to be one of the most dramatic moments of the entire Paris Games -- and we have not even had the opening ceremony yet -- with a wave of projectiles and even field invaders fforcing the players to leave the field close to the end of 15 minutes of time added on.\n\nHowever, it took almost two hours for the Medina goal to be ruled out and the final minutes completed which saw the Atlas Lions register a vital win instead after reaching its conclusion in training session conditions rather than a game scenario with a separate warm-up was required too.\n\nThe game appeared to have finished despite the VAR check on Medina's goal before it became clear that it was in fact \"interrupted\" and spectators present were urged to \"leave the stadium\" because the \"session has been suspended.\"\n\nThe players returned to the field to warm up before the three final minutes were played out and the Moroccans were confirmed as winners and the reasons for such messy handling of the final moments remains unclear -- for now.\n\nArgentina have not been out of the headlines in recent weeks after Enzo Fernandez's social media post sparked a racism scandal which has ignited tension with Olympic hosts and Messi's incredulity comes days after it was suggested publicly that he apologize.\n\nMessi is not the only Argentine soccer figure to have reacted with head coach Mascherano calling it \"the biggest circus I have ever seen in my life\" which was also echoed by Nicolas Tagliafico who also used the word \"circus\" while Rodrigo De Paul called for unity \"against everyone else.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_johnson@cbssports.com", "name": "Jonathan

I was like, 'Wow, what is going on?'\" said Argentina's Gaston Revol.\n\n\"But it's OK. I understand it is because of a soccer game or something, maybe. They hate us. But I can work with it.

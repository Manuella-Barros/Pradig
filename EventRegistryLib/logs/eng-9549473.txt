They've spent the past four years working out at their Henderson, Nev., headquarters, often dealing with the scorching Las Vegas area heat. During their time in Oakland, the Raiders held camp in Napa, Calif., from 1996 to 2019. They camped in Oxnard, Calif., for most of their tenure in Los Angeles (1985-95) and trained in Santa Rosa, Calif., for the bulk of their first Oakland stint.\n\nUnlike in Henderson, Raiders fans will be able to attend practices in some capacity at Costa Mesa.\n\nThe Raiders did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Costa Mesa site has most recently been used as the training camp home of the Los Angeles Chargers, who this year will move into their new practice facility in El Segundo. The Chargers are still under contract with the city of Costa Mesa through August 2026 -- though they declined their option this year and plan to hold camp at their new facility -- so the agreement does not guarantee the Raiders can use the facility in future years. The Raiders will have to submit a letter of interest by Jan. 1, 2025, if they want to return for that year's training camp.\n\nFirst-year Raiders general manager Tom Telesco served as the Chargers GM for the last 11 years, so he knows the new venue well. The team, of course, has a strong fan base in the Southern California region from its 13-year run in Los Angeles from 1982 to '94. The Raiders won two Super Bowls during those L.A. years and still regularly dominate the crowd when they play on the road against the Chargers and Los Angeles Rams.\n\nThe addition of the Raiders means that five NFL teams will hold training camp within 100 miles of each other in Southern California. That includes the Rams, who will camp at their new practice facility in Woodland Hills, and the Chargers. The Dallas Cowboys continue to hold their camp in Oxnard, while the New Orleans Saints this year will be on the campus of UC Irvine, which was previously used by the Rams, due to construction on the club's permanent facility in Metairie, La.\n\nThe Raiders' deal with Costa Mesa also includes $600,000 for improvements to the fields at the complex, a donation of 100 tickets to an NFL preseason game in Southern California, a $10,000 donation to a local youth sports team, outdoor weight training equipment to Costa Mesa High School and a Ford transit van for recreation programs in underserved areas.\n\n\"I'm pleased to welcome the Las Vegas Raiders and their loyal fans, 'Raider Nation,' to the great city of Costa Mesa for training camp this summer,\" Costa Mesa mayor John Stephens said in a news release announcing the proposed agreement.\n\nNFL training camps begin in late July. The agreement calls for use of the facility from approximately July 19 through Aug. 11.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He added that the city has become well-versed in hosting NFL training camps after being the home of the Chargers from 2017 to 2023.\n\n\"We have a proof of concept with having a training camp at Jack Hammett,\" Stephens said. \"It was a very successful endeavor for us.\"\n\nThe Chargers are moving to their new practice facility in El Segundo this year and will hold their training camp there. Their departure opened an ideal spot for NFL teams to move their camp, with the Raiders and Houston Texans expressing interest in using the facility.\n\nStephens said the Raiders and Costa Mesa city management were able to negotiate a deal in recent days that put the proposal on a fast track.\n\nThe only obstacle will be marketing the team in Southern California. By league rules, the Rams and Chargers own marketing rights in the area.\n\nRaiders counsel Lucas Paule, who represented the franchise Tuesday, said the club is in discussions with both teams about reaching an accord.\n\n\"We need to be cognizant of that,\" Paule said. \"We are in open conversations with both teams about the logistics of it.\"\n\nPaule expressed confidence that the Raiders will reach an accord with both teams.\n\n\"Those talks are still ongoing,\" he said. \"And especially now that the city has approved it, we feel confident enough to say we will be here.\"\n\n-- Pay $600,000 for field improvements, including some irrigation and flattening the field surface at the sports complex;\n\n-- Hold a team training camp for children ages 6 to 12;\n\n-- Give 100 tickets for local students to attend an NFL game in Southern California;\n\n-- Donate outdoor weight training equipment to Costa Mesa High School;\n\n-- Donate $10,000 to a local youth sports team.\n\nThe original agreement said camp would be open to the public, but that likely won't be the case. The setup would be similar to practices at the Raiders' facility in Henderson, where only season ticket holders, guests and sponsors were allowed to attend.\n\nThe Raiders are in talks with Costa Mesa High School, which is adjacent to Jack Hammett, about building a temporary locker room and weight room facility to use during camp.\n\nThe Raiders have not announced how much of camp will be spent in Costa Mesa, but as part of the agreement, they must hold at least 10 practices there. They haven't announced camp dates. The city council discussed July 19 to Aug. 11 as a potential window.\n\nSince moving to Las Vegas in 2020, the Raiders have held training camp at their Henderson practice facility.

After spending nearly their first 60 years in California, the Raiders moved to Las Vegas in 2019, marking a significant change in the organization's and the NFL's direction. The Silver and Black have successfully transitioned to the desert, routinely selling out Mark Davis' prized Allegiant Stadium.\n\nAlthough Las Vegas is home now, Raiders fans and Davis himself make it clear the team's ties to California will never die. Nor should it. The Raiders represent more than a football team. They represent a way of life to the millions of people who make up Raider Nation, most of whom began following the team while in Los Angeles and Oakland, respectively.\n\nAs Las Vegas begins a new era and looks to move past the disappointments of the last few seasons on the field, Davis and the Raiders have extended an olive branch to their fans in California by moving their training camp to Costa Mesa, California, just south of Los Angeles where the Raiders made many memories for their fans. The one-year deal between the Raiders and the City of Costa Mesa was approved by the Costa Mesa City Council on Tuesday.\n\nThe Raiders will always be synonymous with California. There are still people who mistakenly refer to them as the Oakland Raiders and fans who still wear Los Angeles and Oakland Raiders memorabilia as a sign of their longstanding following of the team. For many Raiders fans, their fandom was passed down from prior generations of fans in their family.\n\nNo matter where the Raiders go, they will always represent California.\n\nThe Raiders recently requested to use the Jack Hammet Sports Complex in Costa Mesa, the former training location of the Los Angeles Chargers. Moving training camp is a meaningful gesture by the organization for the team, its fans, and the community. The Raiders have pledged multiple forms of resources to benefit the Costa Mesa community, proving the training camp move is more significant than football.\n\nConsidering the connection, it would be hard to imagine new Raiders general manager Tom Telesco didn't have at least a small part in the idea to move this year's Raiders training camp to his former team's former facility. However, regardless of where the idea came from, it is another wise move made by Telesco and the Raiders organization.\n\nKeeping their connection to California strong will be vital in the fanbase's continued support in Las Vegas.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Mesa,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Costa Mesa, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Costa Mesa, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Davis_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Davis (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Raiders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Raiders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegiant_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allegiant Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Chargers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Chargers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Raiders", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Raiders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Telesco", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Telesco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritual_Beings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritual Beings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5472,h_3078,x_0,y_211/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/raiders_today/01hxcvj91fb78716ytwp.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549473", "eventUri": "eng-9549473", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

This situation limits the Raiders in terms of marketing and operations -- especially regarding public involvement and brand growth in the region. The conditions established by the NFL regarding territorial rights mean the Raiders cannot open their practices to the general public, unlike teams like the Dallas Cowboys, who have a longstanding tradition of doing so in Southern California and were grandfathered in when the NFL returned to Los Angeles in 2016.\n\nGiven these limitations, the chance to attend the Raiders' training camp in Costa Mesa becomes a rare and coveted privilege. The Jack Hammett Sports Complex, where the camp will be held from approximately July 19 to August 11, will only be accessible to a select few, including season ticket holders, chosen guests, and sponsors.\n\nAlthough fans will be upset that they cannot attend Raiders training camp, this highlights the dimension of competitiveness between franchises with geographical competition and the NFL's move to increasingly private training sessions, limiting fan participation. The same applies to media access, which has become much more restrictive over the past 20 seasons.\n\nBefore Raiders fans feel singled out, it's worth noting that the New Orleans Saints are facing a similar situation this season. The Saints are also training in Irvine at UC Irvine, subject to the same restrictions. However, the Saints' circumstances differ significantly as Southern California was once the Raiders' home, and the area has a substantial fan base. This loyalty is evident whenever the Raiders play the Chargers or Rams in the region.\n\nRelated: Las Vegas Raiders may strike gold with undrafted offensive tackle Andrew Coker\n\nMoving the Raiders training camp to Costa Mesa might be a great idea to get the team out of the oppressive summer heat of Southern Nevada and to a larger facility to help facilitate preparation for the season. Still, it's another example of the NFL limiting fan participation at a time when the league is looking to expand internationally.\n\nRaider Nation has a long history of great fan events and team-fan interactions, which appears to be in jeopardy -- at least for one year.\n\nWith ticket prices, merchandise, concessions and trips to see your team on the road at an all-time high, the impact of limiting fans' access to their favorite teams could have a long-term impact the NFL must consider. Raiders training camp is historically a family and generational event where they meet and get to know players, which isn't possible during the season.", "source": {"uri": "sportsnaut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportsnaut.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_gulbransen@sportsnaut.com", "name": "Scott Gulbransen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Mesa,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Costa Mesa, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Costa Mesa, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Raiders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Raiders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raider_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raider Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandfather_clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grandfather clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Irvine", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Irvine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Saints", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Saints"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irvine,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Irvine, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Irvine, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://sportsnaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/fans-1-scaled-1-scaled-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549473", "eventUri": "eng-9549473", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-07-19", "dateEnd": "-08-11", "textStart": 1273, "textEnd": 1293}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

The Saints needed a new location during construction of a new cafeteria at the team complex.\n\nNew Orleans is no stranger to preseason stints in SoCal since the Saints have participated in joint workouts with the Chargers five times in the past seven years.\n\nThat is unlikely to happen this year since the teams will meet in the regular season.\n\nThe Rams will be holding training camp in Southern California but have not made an announcement yet on the exact location. Offseason workouts are taking place at California Lutheran College in Thousand Oaks, where their facility has been since 2016, but they are moving to Woodland Hills at some point this year.\n\nLike Thousand Oaks, temporary facilities will be in place while the team finalizes plans on a permanent facility in Woodland Hills, where owner Stan Kroenke bought 100 acres last year.\n\nWith the exception of the 2020 pandemic year, the Cowboys have held a portion of their camp in Oxnard since 2012. They also trained in Oxnard six times between 2001 and 2010.\n\nNone of the five teams have announced their joint workout plans.

There hasn't been a cluster of teams training in such close proximity since the late 1990s, when five teams trained in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n\nBack then it was called the Cheese League. This summer, it might as well be the Beach League with the Chargers, Rams, Raiders, New Orleans Saints and Dallas Cowboys all in the area.\n\nThe Raiders will be at the Jack Hammett Sports Complex, which hosted the Chargers from 2017 to 2023. The complex has two full-length football fields, room for bleachers and plenty of parking for fans compared to the Chargers' headquarters, which was 2 miles away.\n\nIt is also a location new Raiders general manager Tom Telesco knows quite well after having served as Chargers GM from 2013 to 2023.\n\nThe Bolts will hold camp at their new facility in El Segundo, which they will move into next month after the end of offseason workouts.\n\nThe Saints will practice at UC Irvine, which hosted the Rams from 2016 to 2019 and 2021 to 2023. The Saints needed a new location during construction of a new cafeteria at the team complex.\n\nNew Orleans is no stranger to preseason stints in SoCal since the Saints have participated in joint workouts with the Chargers five times in the past seven years.\n\nThat is unlikely to happen this year since the teams will meet in the regular season.\n\nThe Rams will be holding training camp in Southern California but have not made an announcement yet on the exact location. Offseason workouts are taking place at California Lutheran College in Thousand Oaks, where their facility has been since 2016, but they are moving to Woodland Hills at some point this year.\n\nLike Thousand Oaks, temporary facilities will be in place while the team finalizes plans on a permanent facility in Woodland Hills, where owner Stan Kroenke bought 100 acres last year.\n\nWith the exception of the 2020 pandemic year, the Cowboys have held a portion of their camp in Oxnard since 2012. They also trained in Oxnard six times between 2001 and 2010.\n\nNone of the five teams have announced their joint workout plans. That usually doesn't happen until after the preseason schedule comes out. That is expected to happen next Wednesday, when the NFL also is slated to release the regular-season schedule.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Raiders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Raiders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_City_Council", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles City Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Saints", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Saints"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Mesa,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Costa Mesa, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Costa Mesa, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Telesco", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Telesco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Irvine", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Irvine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Segundo,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "El Segundo, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "El Segundo, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Lutheran_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California Lutheran University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Kroenke", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stan Kroenke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodland_Hills,_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Woodland Hills, Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Woodland Hills, Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousand_Oaks,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thousand Oaks, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Thousand Oaks, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxnard,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oxnard, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oxnard, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2023/11/do_not_delete_sports-2023-11-e67ff22d7739531b4934072abdcbdf60-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549473", "eventUri": "eng-9549473", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

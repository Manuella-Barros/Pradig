Denis Shapovalov of Canada defeated Rafael Nadal of Spain 6-3, 4-6, 6-7. Minas Panagiotakis/Getty Images/AFP\n\nCanadian teenager Denis Shapovalov shocked top seeded Rafael Nadal to reach the quarter-finals of the ATP Montreal Masters tournament, temporarily spoiling the Spaniard's chances of returning to world number one.\n\nThe 18-year-old Shapovalov continued his giant killing form at the hardcourt tournament by rallying to stun Nadal in three sets 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7/4) on Thursday.\n\n\"I was just swinging for the fences,\" said Shapovalov, who needed a wild card to get into the tournament.\n\nThe 31-year-old Nadal would have returned to No. 1 in the world if he had reached the semi-finals.\n\nBut Nadal struggled to get the ball to Shapovalov's backhand and didn't have an answer for the Canadian's blistering forehand winners.\n\nNadal described it as the worst loss of the season for him for a number of reasons.\n\n\"Worst loss of the year because I lost against a player with a lower ranking,\" Nadal said. \"At the same time because of the opportunity I had to get back to Number One.\"\n\nShapovalov's biggest win of his young career against the 15-time Grand Slam winner came as a result of some inspired tennis in front of a boisterous home crowd who cheered his every shot.\n\n\"He won. It is an amazing for him. It is a great story. I am not happy to be part of this story,\" Nadal said.\n\nShapovalov, who is ranked 143rd in the world, quickly got on a roll in Montreal, beating Brazil's Rogerio Dutra Silva in the opening round 4-6, 7-6 (10/8), 6-4. He then defeated former US Open winner Juan Martin Del Potro in the second round in straight sets 6-3 7-6 (7/4) to set up the showdown with Nadal.\n\nShapovalov fell behind 3-0 before winning seven of the final eight points of the third set tiebreaker. He closed out the match with a forehand winner down the line and celebrated by falling onto his back then covering his face with his hands.\n\nNadal easily won the first set but couldn't put the free-swinging Canadian away with a second set victory.\n\nThe third game of the second set lasted 14 minutes with Shapovalov finally holding serve when Nadal's volley sailed into the net. Shapovalov managed to win the game despite double faulting three times.\n\n\"Was it only 14 minutes?,\" Shapovalov asked. \"It felt like three hours.\n\n\"I just kept fighting. I knew it was going to be really tough. I went for my shots in the big moments and I caught a couple of lines got a little bit lucky.\"\n\nShapovalov said he didn't think he had a chance to win at all before the match. It wasn't until he levelled the sets at one each that he realized he could beat the 10-time French Open champion.\n\n\"The whole day I was like - there's no chance. I will go and have fun but there is no way I am beating this guy,\" Shapovalov said.\n\n\"I went up a break in the second set early and even though he broke me back I felt like - OK, I am capable of breaking him.\n\n\"So when I won that second set I thought let's go one more set and who knows, anything can happen.\"\n\nShapovalov blasted a total of nine aces. He also had seven double faults and won 67 percent of his first serve points.\n\n'Dream come true'\n\n\"It is incredible. I can't even talk right now. I grew up watching Rafa so just to be able to compete with him is one thing but to come out winning is a dream come true for me.\"\n\nNadal won 77 percent of his first serve points, but had just two aces and six double faults in the two hour, 45 minute center court match.\n\nThis is a setback for Nadal in the buildup to the US Open starting August 28 but he still has a chance to regain No. 1.\n\n\"The worst thing is playing bad in matches that really matter,\" Nadal said. \"You have to win these matches. I didn't today.

AFP PHOTO\n\nNadal described it as the worst loss of the season for him for a number of reasons.\n\n\"Worst loss of the year because I lost against a player with a lower ranking,\" Nadal said. \"At the same time because of the opportunity I had to get back to Number One.\"\n\nShapovalov's biggest win of his young career against the 15-time Grand Slam winner came as a result of some inspired tennis in front of a boisterous home crowd who cheered his every shot.\n\n\"He won. It is an amazing for him. It is a great story. I am not happy to be part of this story,\" Nadal said.\n\nShapovalov, who is ranked 143rd in the world, quickly got on a roll in Montreal, beating Brazil's Rogerio Dutra Silva in the opening round 4-6, 7-6 (10/8), 6-4. He then defeated former US Open winner Juan Martin Del Potro in the second round in straight sets 6-3 7-6 (7/4) to set up the showdown with Nadal.\n\nShapovalov fell behind 3-0 before winning seven of the final eight points of the third set tiebreaker. He closed out the match with a forehand winner down the line and celebrated by falling onto his back then covering his face with his hands.\n\nNadal easily won the first set but couldn't put the free-swinging Canadian away with a second set victory.\n\nThe third game of the second set lasted 14 minutes with Shapovalov finally holding serve when Nadal's volley sailed into the net. Shapovalov managed to win the game despite double faulting three times.\n\n\"Was it only 14 minutes?,\" Shapovalov asked. \"It felt like three hours.\n\n\"I just kept fighting. I knew it was going to be really tough. I went for my shots in the big moments and I caught a couple of lines got a little bit lucky.\"\n\nShapovalov said he didn't think he had a chance to win at all before the match. It wasn't until he levelled the sets at one each that he realized he could beat the 10-time French Open champion.\n\n\"The whole day I was like - there's no chance. I will go and have fun but there is no way I am beating this guy,\" Shapovalov said.\n\n\"I went up a break in the second set early and even though he broke me back I felt like - OK, I am capable of breaking him.\n\n\"So when I won that second set I thought let's go one more set and who knows, anything can happen.\"\n\nShapovalov blasted a total of nine aces. He also had seven double faults and won 67 percent of his first serve points.\n\nDream come true\n\n\"It is incredible. I can't even talk right now. I grew up watching Rafa so just to be able to compete with him is one thing but to come out winning is a dream come true for me.\"\n\nNadal won 77 percent of his first serve points, but had just two aces and six double faults in the two hour, 45 minute center court match.\n\nThis is a setback for Nadal in the buildup to the US Open starting August 28 but he still has a chance to regain No. 1.\n\n\"The worst thing is playing bad in matches that really matter,\" Nadal said. \"You have to win these matches.

prospect for the future fought off four match points in a second-set tiebreaker and defeated Rogerio Dutra Silva of Brazil 4-6, 7-6 (8), 6-4 in the first round of the Rogers Cup Canadian Open tennis championships.\n\n\"It was pretty tough out there, tough conditions,\" said the 18-year-old Shapovalov, who has reached the second round in each of the past two years. \"Dutra Silva is a real fighter. I was struggling a little bit with the rhythm on my serve, I wasn't putting a lot of (first serves) in the first two sets or first set and a half. Then I kind of found my range in the tiebreaker.\n\nThis wasn't a vintage serving game for the left-handed Shapovalov. He put only 50 per cent of his first serves into play, but he came up with the big shots when he needed them. He had four of his 12 aces in the tiebreaker and ended the match with a wide service winner, which forced Dutra Silva off the court on the ad side.\n\nShapovalov took control of the deciding set when he broke Dutra Silva's serve for a 4-3 lead. The Brazilian fell behind 15-40 and Shapovalov ripped a backhand winner for the break.\n\nShapovalov had to dig deep to survive the second-set tiebreaker. He fell behind 3-0 before delivering a pair of aces. Dutra Silva had two match points at 6-4, but an unforced error erased one point and Shapovalov pulled even with a half-volley drop shot for a winner.\n\nA backhand winner and an ace by Shapovalov allowed the Canadian to fight off the other match points and Dutra Silva double-faulted to give Shapovalov a 10-8 win in the tiebreaker.\n\nShapovalov said the match points were a blur, but he remembered saving the third one.\n\n\"I remember I was pretty far back and I went for a backhand down the line, which was pretty good,\" Shapovalov said. \"I wasn't holding back. I just told myself: He's got to win it from me, I'm not going to give it to him. Yeah, I think I did a good job to stay tough out there.\"\n\nShapovalov said the crowd, which included hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, gave him a lift and probably put extra pressure on Dutra Silva.\n\nNext up for Shapovalov is Argentine Juan Martin del Potro, the 2009 U.S. Open champion. That match slated for centre court Wednesday afternoon after Roger Federer plays against Canadian Peter Polansky.\n\nShapovalov wasn't the only player who had to dig deep for a spot in the second round. Pablo Carreno Busta, the 11th seed from Spain outlasted Karen Khachanov of Russia 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 and ninth-seeded David Goffin of Belgium beat Yuichi Sugita of Japan, 4-6, 6-1, 6-4.

teenager Denis Shapovalov was amazed he had beaten tennis superstar Rafael Nadal.\n\nThe 18-year-old from Richmond Hill, Ont., shocked himself, the crowd that roared with every point he scored and the tennis world with his 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (4) victory over top-seeded Nadal in the third round of the Rogers Cup on Thursday night at a sold out Uniprix Stadium.\n\nShapovalov dropped to the ground and covered his face in joy and surprise as the cheers reached deafening levels after the match point fell, completing his comeback from a 3-0 deficit in the third-set tiebreaker.\n\n\"It's what I dreamed of all my life growing up, playing guys like Rafa (Nadal), Roger (Federer), Andy (Murray),\" said Shapovalov. \"You know, my dream came true today.\"\n\nThe victory put him into a quarter-final Friday against France's Adrian Mannarino, who beat Hyeon Chung 6-3,6-3.\n\nIt was one of the biggest wins in Canadian tennis history and it came at the tournament that some still call the Canadian Open.\n\nShapovalov became the youngest player to reach the tournament's quarter-finals since Bjorn Borg in 1974.\n\nHe also became the youngest quarter-finalist at a Masters Series tournament ever and is the youngest to beat a player ranked in the top two in the world since Nadal beat Federer in 2004 in Miami.\n\nRead more:\n\nTennis Canada CEO sees great things in nation's young stars:

top 100 in the world in a week that saw him save four match points in a first round win over Rogerio Dutra Silva, then beat 2009 U.S. Open winner Juan Martin Del Potro in the second round before toppling Nadal.\n\n\"I'm very thankful that I'm in this position,\" said Shapovalov, who had hockey great Wayne Gretzky and Olympic swimming star Penny Oleksiak cheering for him from the seats. \"If I didn't save those four match points in the first round, there wouldn't even be a chance to play Juan Martin or Rafa.\n\n\"It's difficult to say how I was feeling during the match. It was extremely hard physically and mentally. Rafa is such a warrior. I'm just so happy to come out with the win.\"\n\nNadal, who could have claimed the No. 1 ranking if he had reached the semifinals this week, said it was the worst match he played all year, but he had kind words for Shapovalov.\n\n\"He played well,\" the 31-year-old said. \"He has a great potential.\n\n\"I wish him the best. He has everything to become a great player. He played with the right determination in the important moments.\"\n\nShapovalov looked unfazed in facing the biggest opponent of his young career. After Nadal cruised through the first set, Shapovalov kept battling, breaking service while taking a 3-0 lead in the second. When Nadal would start taking control of a game, the younger of the two lefthanders would respond with big serves or impressive forehands down the lines.\n\nNadal fought off two break points to hold serve at 4-2, then earned his own break to win back the momentum from the 2016 Wimbledon junior boys champion, only to see Shapovalov snatch it back and clinch the second set.\n\nThe two held serve through the third. Nadal went up 3-0, but Shapovalov used two aces to fight back and complete the upset victory over the 10-time French Open champion.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T14:38:00Z", "sim": 0.8745098114013672, "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "title": "theStar.com", "id": "1354"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "15:44:00", "url": "https://www.thestar.com/sports/tennis/2017/08/10/denis-shapovalov-upsets-top-seed-rafael-nadal-at-rogers-cup.html", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8651651", "image": "https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/sports/2017/08/10/denis-shapovalov-upsets-top-seed-rafael-nadal-at-rogers-cup/shapa.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "14:38:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

(AFP)\n\nCanadian teenager Denis Shapovalov shocked top seeded Rafael Nadal to reach the quarter-finals of the ATP Montreal Masters tournament, temporarily spoiling the Spaniard's chances of returning to world number one.\n\nThe 18-year-old Shapovalov continued his giant killing form at the hardcourt tournament by rallying to stun Nadal in three sets 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7/4) on Thursday.\n\n\"I was just swinging for the fences,\" said Shapovalov, who needed a wild card to get into the tournament.\n\nThe 31-year-old Nadal would have returned to No. 1 in the world if he had reached the semi-finals.\n\nBut Nadal struggled to get the ball to Shapovalov's backhand and didn't have an answer for the Canadian's blistering forehand winners.\n\nNadal described it as the worst loss of the season for him for a number of reasons.\n\n\"Worst loss of the year because I lost against a player with a lower ranking,\" Nadal said. \"At the same time because of the opportunity I had to get back to Number One.\"\n\nShapovalov's biggest win of his young career against the 15-time Grand Slam winner came as a result of some inspired tennis in front of a boisterous home crowd who cheered his every shot.\n\n\"He won. It is an amazing for him. It is a great story. I am not happy to be part of this story,\" Nadal said.\n\nShapovalov, who is ranked 143rd in the world, quickly got on a roll in Montreal, beating Brazil's Rogerio Dutra Silva in the opening round 4-6, 7-6 (10/8), 6-4. He then defeated former US Open winner Juan Martin Del Potro in the second round in straight sets 6-3 7-6 (7/4) to set up the showdown with Nadal.\n\nShapovalov fell behind 3-0 before winning seven of the final eight points of the third set tiebreaker. He closed out the match with a forehand winner down the line and celebrated by falling onto his back then covering his face with his hands.\n\nNadal easily won the first set but couldn't put the free-swinging Canadian away with a second set victory.\n\nThe third game of the second set lasted 14 minutes with Shapovalov finally holding serve when Nadal's volley sailed into the net. Shapovalov managed to win the game despite double faulting three times.\n\n\"Was it only 14 minutes?,\" Shapovalov asked. \"It felt like three hours.\n\n\"I just kept fighting. I knew it was going to be really tough. I went for my shots in the big moments and I caught a couple of lines got a little bit lucky.\"\n\nShapovalov said he didn't think he had a chance to win at all before the match. It wasn't until he levelled the sets at one each that he realized he could beat the 10-time French Open champion.\n\n\"The whole day I was like - there's no chance. I will go and have fun but there is no way I am beating this guy,\" Shapovalov said.\n\n\"I went up a break in the second set early and even though he broke me back I felt like - OK, I am capable of breaking him.\n\n\"So when I won that second set I thought let's go one more set and who knows, anything can happen.\"\n\nShapovalov blasted a total of nine aces. He also had seven double faults and won 67 percent of his first serve points.\n\n'Dream come true'\n\n\"It is incredible. I can't even talk right now. I grew up watching Rafa so just to be able to compete with him is one thing but to come out winning is a dream come true for me.\"\n\nNadal won 77 percent of his first serve points, but had just two aces and six double faults in the two hour, 45 minute center court match.\n\nThis is a setback for Nadal in the buildup to the US Open starting August 28 but he still has a chance to regain No. 1.\n\n\"The worst thing is playing bad in matches that really matter,\" Nadal said. \"You have to win these matches. I didn't today. I have another week in Cincinnati and then I have the Grand Slam coming.\"\n\nElsewhere on Thursday, Roger Federer maintained his career-long winning streak over David Ferrer with a 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 victory to reach the quarter-finals after a three-set battle with the veteran Spaniard.\n\nIn other matches Thursday, Germany's Alexander Zverev defeated Nick Kyrgios 6-4, 6-3, Roberto Bautista outlasted Gael Monfils 4-6, 7-6 (7/5), 7-6 (7/2) and Kevin Anderson of South Africa cruised past Sam Querrey 6-4, 6-1.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-28", "textEnd": 3545, "textStart": 3536}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T07:51:00Z", "sim": 0.8745098114013672, "source": {"uri": "emirates247.com", "title": "Emirates 24|7", "id": "508"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "07:51:00", "url": "http://www.emirates247.com/sports/nadal-s-pursuit-of-no-1-derailed-by-canadian-teen-2017-08-11-1.657455", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8562467", "image": "http://cache.emirates247.com/polopoly_fs/1.657456.1502435967!/image/image.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "07:51:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Denis Shapovalov of Canada celebrates his victory over Rafael Nadal of Spain. Photo by Minas Panagiotakis/Getty Images/AFP\n\nMONTREAL, Canada - Canadian teenager Denis Shapovalov shocked top seeded Rafael Nadal to reach the quarterfinals of the ATP Montreal Masters tournament, spoiling the Spaniard's chances of returning to world number one.\n\nThe 18-year-old Shapovalov continued his giant killing form at the hardcourt tournament by rallying to stun Nadal in three sets 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7/4) on Thursday, August 10 (Friday Manila time).\n\n\"I was just swinging for the fences,\" said Shapovalov, who needed a wild card to get into the tournament.\n\nThe 31-year-old Nadal would have returned to No. 1 in the world if he reached the semifinals.\n\nBut Nadal struggled to get the ball to Shapovalov's backhand and didn't have an answer for the Canadian's blistering forehand winners.\n\n\"He played well. He has great potential,\" Nadal said. \"I wish him the best. He played with the right determination.\"\n\nShapovalov's biggest win of his young career against the 15-time Grand Slam winner came as a result of some inspired tennis in front of a boisterous home crowd who cheered his every shot.\n\nShapovalov, who is ranked 143rd in the world, had just 3 wins this season coming into the tournament. He quickly got on a roll in Montreal, beating Brazil's Rogerio Dutra Silva in the opening round 4-6, 7-6 (10/8), 6-4.\n\nHe then defeated former US Open winner Juan Martin Del Potro in the second round in straight sets 6-3 7-6 (7/4) to set up the showdown with Nadal.\n\nShapovalov fell behind 3-0 before winning 7 of the final eight points of the 3rd set tiebreaker.

He also had seven double faults and won 67 percent of his first serve points.\n\n'Dream come true'\n\n\"It is incredible. I can't even talk right now. I grew up watching Rafa so just to be able to compete with him is one thing but to come out winning is a dream come true for me.\"\n\nNadal won 77% of his first serve points, but had just two aces and 6 double faults in the two hour, 45 minute center court match.\n\nElsewhere on Thursday, Roger Federer maintained his career-long winning streak over David Ferrer to advance to the quarter-finals after a 3-set battle with the veteran Spaniard.\n\nFederer, 36, had never lost in 16 previous meetings with the 35-year-old Ferrer, whom he first defeated 14 years ago at the Vienna Indoor tournament.\n\nBut while Ferrer managed to take the opening set - ending Federer's 32-set streak - the Swiss ace raised his game to win 4-6, 6-4, 6-2.\n\n\"I actually feel really happy because I know I can play a lot better. David can play a lot better, too,\" Federer said.\n\n\"We battled, both tried to find a way to win. You know, he had a good start, I had a better finish.\"\n\nIn other matches Thursday, Germany's Alexander Zverev defeated Nick Kyrgios 6-4, 6-3, Roberto Bautista outlasted Gael Monfils 4-6, 7-6 (7/5), 7-6 (7/2) and Kevin Anderson of South Africa cruised past Sam Querrey 6-4, 6-1. - Rappler.com", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-10", "textEnd": 531, "textStart": 522}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T00:45:00Z", "sim": 0.8705882430076599, "source": {"uri": "rappler.com", "title": "Rappler", "id": "7948"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "00:45:00", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/other-sports/178429-nadals-pursuit-derailed-canadian-teen-shapovalov", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8725968", "image": "https://assets.rappler.com/612F469A6EA84F6BAE882D2B94A4B421/img/A0E2CB26ED6B4C58B0F30FC098E7AA0F/063_829660198-2.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "00:45:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Shapovalov showed why he's regarded as the future of Canadian tennis as he fought off four match points in a second-set tiebreaker and defeated Rogerio Dutra Silva of Brazil 4-6, 7-6 (8), 6-4 in the first round of the Rogers Cup Canadian Open tennis championships on Tuesday.\n\n\"It was a bit stressful, but the crowd pulled me through,\" said the 18-year-old from Toronto, who has reached the second round in each of the past two years. \"I hope we can keep it going.\"\n\nNext up for Shapovalov is Argentine Juan Martin del Potro, the 2009 U.S. Open champion. That match will be on centre court Wednesday afternoon, following Roger Federer's match.\n\nThis wasn't a vintage serving game for the left-handed Shapovalov. He put only 50 per cent of his first serves into play, but he came up with the big shots when he needed them. He had four of his 12 aces in the tiebreaker and ended the match with a wide service winner that forced Dutra Silva off the court on the ad side.\n\nShapovalov took control of the deciding set when he broke Dutra Silva's serve for a 4-3 lead. The Brazilian fell behind 15-40 and Shapovalov ripped a backhand winner for the break,\n\nShapovalov had to dig deep to survive the second-set tiebreaker. He fell behind 3-0 before delivering a pair of aces. Dutra Silva had two match points at 6-4, but an unforced error erased one point and Shapovalov pulled even with a half-volley drop shot for a winner.\n\nAn unforced error and an ace by Shapovalov allowed the Canadian to save the other match points and Dutra Silva double-faulted to give Shapovalov a 10-8 win in the tiebreaker.\n\nShapovalov wasn't the only player who had to dig deep for a spot in the second round. Pablo Carreno Busta, the 11th seed from Spain, outlasted Karen Khachanov of Russia 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, while ninth-seeded David Goffin of Belgium beat Yuichi Sugita of Japan, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2. American serving machine Sam Querrey needed 18 aces and three sets to eliminate French qualifier Vincent Millot 4-6, 7-6 (4), 7-5 and Korean Hyeon Chung beat Spaniard Feliciano Lopez 6-1, 4-6, 7-6 (3).\n\nThere's no shortage of star power on centre court Wednesday. Second-seeded Federer will play Peter Polansky of Toronto at 12:30 p.m.\n\nRafael Nadal, the top seed, will make his tournament debut in the evening session beginning at 6:30 p.m. He will play Croatian Borna Coric. That will be followed by Canadian Milos Raonic, the No. 6 seed, facing France's Adrian Mannarino.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-09T01:30:00Z", "sim": 0.8666666746139526, "source": {"uri": "slam.canoe.com", "title": "canoe.com", "id": "11150"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "01:30:00", "url": "http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Tennis/ATP/2017/08/08/22743905.html", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8092606", "image": "http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Tennis/ATP/2017/08/08/shap650.jpg", "date": "2017-08-09", "time": "01:30:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-09"}

of the opportunity I had to get back to Number One.\"\n\nShapovalov's biggest win of his young career against the 15-time Grand Slam winner came as a result of some inspired tennis in front of a boisterous home crowd who cheered his every shot.\n\n\"He won. It is an amazing for him. It is a great story. I am not happy to be part of this story,\" Nadal said.\n\nShapovalov, who is ranked 143rd in the world, quickly got on a roll in Montreal, beating Brazil's Rogerio Dutra Silva in the opening round 4-6, 7-6 (10/8), 6-4. He then defeated former US Open winner Juan Martin Del Potro in the second round in straight sets 6-3 7-6 (7/4) to set up the showdown with Nadal.\n\nShapovalov fell behind 3-0 before winning seven of the final eight points of the third set tiebreaker. He closed out the match with a forehand winner down the line and celebrated by falling onto his back then covering his face with his hands.\n\nNadal easily won the first set but couldn't put the free-swinging Canadian away with a second set victory.\n\nThe third game of the second set lasted 14 minutes with Shapovalov finally holding serve when Nadal's volley sailed into the net. Shapovalov managed to win the game despite double faulting three times.\n\n\"Was it only 14 minutes?,\" Shapovalov asked. \"It felt like three hours.\n\n\"I just kept fighting. I knew it was going to be really tough. I went for my shots in the big moments and I caught a couple of lines got a little bit lucky.\"\n\nShapovalov said he didn't think he had a chance to win at all before the match. It wasn't until he levelled the sets at one each that he realized he could beat the 10-time French Open champion.\n\n\"The whole day I was like - there's no chance. I will go and have fun but there is no way I am beating this guy,\" Shapovalov said.\n\n\"I went up a break in the second set early and even though he broke me back I felt like - OK, I am capable of breaking him.\n\n\"So when I won that second set I thought let's go one more set and who knows, anything can happen.\"\n\nShapovalov blasted a total of nine aces. He also had seven double faults and won 67 percent of his first serve points.\n\n\"It is incredible. I can't even talk right now. I grew up watching Rafa so just to be able to compete with him is one thing but to come out winning is a dream come true for me.\"\n\nNadal won 77 percent of his first serve points, but had just two aces and six double faults in the two hour, 45 minute center court match.\n\nThis is a setback for Nadal in the buildup to the US Open starting August 28 but he still has a chance to regain No. 1.\n\n\"The worst thing is playing bad in matches that really matter,\" Nadal said. \"You have to win these matches. I didn't today. I have another week in Cincinnati and then I have the Grand Slam coming.\"\n\nElsewhere on Thursday, Roger Federer maintained his career-long winning streak over David Ferrer with a 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 victory to reach the quarter-finals after a three-set battle with the veteran Spaniard.\n\nIn other matches Thursday, Germany's Alexander Zverev defeated Nick Kyrgios 6-4, 6-3, Roberto Bautista outlasted Gael Monfils 4-6, 7-6 (7/5), 7-6 (7/2) and Kevin Anderson of South Africa cruised past Sam Querrey 6-4, 6-1.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-28", "textEnd": 3449, "textStart": 3440}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T07:28:00Z", "sim": 0.8588235378265381, "source": {"uri": "dailytimes.com.pk", "title": "dailytimes.com.pk", "id": "1244"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "07:28:00", "url": "http://dailytimes.com.pk/sports/11-Aug-17/nadals-pursuit-of-no-1-derailed-by-canadian-teen", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8558843", "image": "http://dailytimes.com.pk/static/uploads/original/7b0c6b9775ce1eabe10c2d1330e3b5b9.jpg ", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "07:28:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

sixteen play at the Rogers Cup tennis tournament in Montreal on Aug. 10, 2017. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Paul Chiasson\n\nEven Canadian teenager Denis Shapovalov was amazed he had beaten tennis superstar Rafael Nadal.\n\nThe 18-year-old from Richmond Hill shocked himself, the crowd that roared with every point he scored, and the tennis world with his 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (4) victory over top-seeded Nadal in the third round of the Rogers Cup on Thursday night at a sold out Uniprix Stadium.\n\nShapovalov dropped to the ground and covered his face in joy and surprise as the cheers reached deafening levels after the match point fell, completing his comeback from a 3-0 deficit in the third-set tiebreaker.\n\n\"It's what I dreamed of all my life growing up, playing guys like Rafa (Nadal), Roger (Federer), Andy (Murray),\" said Shapovalov. \"You know, my dream came true today.\"\n\nThe victory put him into a quarter-final Friday against France's Adrian Mannarino, who beat Hyeon Chung 6-3,6-3.\n\nIt was one of the biggest wins in Canadian tennis history and it came at the tournament that some still call the Canadian Open.\n\nShapovalov became the youngest player to reach the tournament's quarter-finals since Bjorn Borg in 1974.\n\nHe also became the youngest quarter-finalist at a Masters Series tournament ever and is the youngest to beat a player ranked in the top two in the world since Nadal beat Federer in 2004 in Miami.\n\nShapovalov will reach his goal of moving into the top 100 in the world in a week that saw him save four match points in a first round win over Rogerio Dutra Silva, then beat 2009 U.S. Open winner Juan Martin Del Potro in the second round before toppling Nadal.\n\n\"I'm very thankful that I'm in this position,\" said Shapovalov, who had hockey great Wayne Gretzky and Olympic swimming star Penny Oleksiak cheering for him from the seats. \"If I didn't save those four match points in the first round, there wouldn't even be a chance to play Juan Martin or Rafa.\n\n\"It's difficult to say how I was feeling during the match. It was extremely hard physically and mentally. Rafa is such a warrior. I'm just so happy to come out with the win.\"\n\nRelated stories:\n\nSportsnet: Shapovalov shoots to star status with win over all-time great Nadal\n\nSportsnet: Denis Shapovalov's upset of Rafael Nadal historic in more ways than one\n\nBig Read: Shapovalov doing what it takes to succeed at tennis's highest level\n\nNadal, who could have claimed the No. 1 ranking if he had reached the semifinals this week, said it was the worst match he played all year, but he had kind words for Shapovalov.\n\n\"He played well,\" the 31-year-old said. \"He has a great potential.\n\n\"I wish him the best. He has everything to become a great player. He played with the right determination in the important moments.\"\n\nShapovalov looked unfazed in facing the biggest opponent of his young career. After Nadal cruised through the first set, Shapovalov kept battling, breaking service while taking a 3-0 lead in the second. When Nadal would start taking a control of a game, the younger of the two lefthanders would respond with big serves or impressive forehands down the lines.\n\nNadal fought off two break points to hold serve at 4-2, then earned his own break to win back the momentum from the 2016 Wimbledon junior boys champion, only to see Shapovalov snatch it back and clinch the second set.\n\nThe two held serve through the third. Nadal went up 3-0, but Shapovalov used two aces to fight back and complete the upset victory over the 10-time French Open champion.\n\nSecond-seeded Roger Federer, a 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 winner over Spain's David Ferrer, isn't one to gloat over his stunning record against Spaniard, who was ranked third in the world in 2013.\n\nWithout playing especially well, the 19-time Grand Slam champion from Switzerland stretched his career record against the Ferrer to 17-0. It started with a win in Vienna in 2003.\n\n\"Maybe in the beginning he was not as good as he is now,\" Federer said of Ferrer. \"Maybe I won five times because I'm better than he was.\n\n\"I was No. 1 in the world. I played him on hard courts also. I didn't play him often on clay. Also, there were many tight matches, so maybe it became a mental thing for him. I have a lot of respect for David. As a person, he's very nice. He's a great fighter on the court. So this type of head-to-head is a bit strange.\"\n\nIn Friday's quarter-finals, second-seeded Federer will face 12th-seeded Roberto Bautista Agut of Spain, against whom he is 6-0. Bautista Agut outlasted Frenchman Gael Monfils 4-6, 7-6 (5), 7-6 (2) in a two hours 56 minutes battle.\n\nUnseeded Argentine Diego Schwartzman posted a strange win over American Jared Donaldson 0-6, 7-5, 7-5 to advance to a quarter-final meeting with Robin Haase, the 52nd-ranked Dutchman who upset seventh-seeded Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria 7-6 (3), 4-6, 6-1.\n\nKevin Anderson of South Africa downed American Sam Querrey 6-4, 6-1 and will next play fourth-seeded Alexander Zverev, who ousted 16th seeded Nick Kyrgios 6-4, 6-3.\n\nFederer, who breezed past Canadian Peter Polansky in the second round on Wednesday, looked lost in the opening set, spraying balls long, wide or into the net, but gradually rediscovered at least some of the form that has seen the 36-year-old Swiss put back the clock with two grand slam wins this year.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-10", "textEnd": 169, "textStart": 156}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T09:47:00Z", "sim": 0.8549019694328308, "source": {"uri": "citynews.ca", "title": "CityNews", "id": "2068"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "09:47:00", "url": "http://www.citynews.ca/2017/08/11/richmond-hill-teen-denis-shapovalov-upsets-rafael-nadal-rogers-cup/", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8582463", "image": "http://www.citynews.ca/wp-content/blogs.dir/sites/10/2017/08/11/0811-denisshapovalov.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "09:47:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Denis Shapovalov shocked top seeded Rafael Nadal to reach the quarterfinals of the ATP Montreal Masters tournament, spoiling the Spaniard's chances of returning to world number one.\n\nThe 18-year-old Shapovalov continued his giant killing form at the hardcourt tournament by rallying to stun Nadal in three sets 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7/4) on Thursday.\n\n\"I was just swinging for the fences,\" said Shapovalov, who needed a wild card to get into the tournament.\n\nThe 31-year-old Nadal would have returned to No. 1 in the world if he reached the semi-finals.\n\nBut Nadal struggled to get the ball to Shapovalov's backhand and didn't have an answer for the Canadian's blistering forehand winners.\n\n\"He played well. He has great potential,\" Nadal said. \"I wish him the best. He played with the right determination.\"\n\nShapovalov's biggest win of his young career against the 15-time Grand Slam winner came as a result of some inspired tennis in front of a boisterous home crowd who cheered his every shot.\n\nShapovalov, who is ranked 143rd in the world, had just three wins this season coming into the tournament. He quickly got on a roll in Montreal, beating Brazil's Rogerio Dutra Silva in the opening round 4-6, 7-6 (10/8), 6-4. He then defeated former U.S. Open winner Juan Martin Del Potro in the second round in straight sets 6-3 7-6 (7/4) to set up the showdown with Nadal.\n\nShapovalov fell behind 3-0 before winning seven of the final eight points of the third set tiebreaker. He closed out the match with a forehand winner down the line and celebrated by falling onto his back then covering his face with his hands.\n\nNadal easily won the first set but couldn't put the free-swinging Canadian away with a second set victory.\n\nThe third game of the second set lasted 14 minutes with Shapovalov finally holding serve when Nadal's volley sailed into the net. Shapovalov managed to win the game despite double faulting three times.\n\n\"Was it only 14 minutes?,\" Shapovalov asked. \"It felt like three hours.\n\n\"I just kept fighting. I knew it was going to be really tough. I went for my shots in the big moments and I caught a couple of lines got a little bit lucky but at the end of the day that is what tennis is.\"\n\nShapovalov said he didn't think he had a chance to win at all before the match. It wasn't until he levelled the sets at one each that he realized he could beat the 10-time French Open champion.\n\n\"The whole day I was like - there's no chance. I will go and have fun but there is no way I am beating this guy,\" Shapovalov said.\n\n\"I went up a break in the second set early and even though he broke me back I felt like - OK, I am capable of breaking him.\n\n\"So when I won that second set I thought let's go one more set and who knows, anything can happen.\"\n\nShapovalov blasted a total of nine aces, including some on his second serve. He also had seven double faults and won 67 percent of his first serve points.\n\n\"It is incredible. I can't even talk right now. I grew up watching Rafa so just to be able to compete with him is one thing but to come out winning is a dream come true for me.\"\n\nNadal won 77 percent of his first serve points, but had just two aces and six double faults in the two hour, 45 minute center court match.\n\nElsewhere on Thursday, Roger Federer maintained his career-long winning streak over David Ferrer to advance to the quarter-finals after a three-set battle with the veteran Spaniard.\n\nFederer, 36, had never lost in 16 previous meetings with the 35-year-old Ferrer, whom he first defeated 14 years ago at the Vienna Indoor tournament.\n\nBut while Ferrer managed to take the opening set -- ending Federer's 32-set streak -- the Swiss ace raised his game to win 4-6, 6-4, 6-2.\n\n\"I actually feel really happy because I know I can play a lot better. David can play a lot better, too,\" Federer said.\n\n\"We battled, both tried to find a way to win. You know, he had a good start, I had a better finish.\"\n\nIn other matches Thursday, Germany's Alexander Zverev defeated Nick Kyrgios 6-4, 6-3, Roberto Bautista outlasted Gael Monfils 4-6, 7-6 (7/5), 7-6 (7/2) and Kevin Anderson of South Africa cruised past Sam Querrey 6-4, 6-1.\n\n\u00a9 2017 AFP", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T06:44:00Z", "sim": 0.843137264251709, "source": {"uri": "japantoday.com", "title": "Japan Today", "id": "18472"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "06:44:00", "url": "https://japantoday.com/category/sports/nadal's-pursuit-of-no.-1-derailed-by-canadian-teen", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8552589", "image": "https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/e1/ab/84289584c32e1fc785d2f86568b0ac75377e/e1ab84289584c32e1fc785d2f86568b0ac75377e.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "06:44:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

I just told myself, 'He's got to win it from me. I'm not going to give it to him.'\n\n\"I think I did a good job to stay tough out there.\"\n\nAfter dropping the opening set, Shapovalov's margin for error was slim.\n\nThe Richmond Hill, Ont., native's comeback looked unlikely when he quickly fell behind 3-0 in the second-set tiebreak. He fired back-to-back aces to give himself a fighting chance.\n\nDown 6-4 -- the first match point -- Dutra Silva made an unforced error. Now 6-5, Shapovalov hit a clever drop shot just out of his opponent's reach. On the third match point, Dutra Silva sent his backhand long. Down 8-7, Shapovalov hit his sixth ace of the set to fend off elimination for the fourth time.\n\nWith the Canadian now in front 9-8, Dutra Silva double faulted to give Shapovalov the second-set victory.\n\n\"I'm sure he felt the crowd getting on him,\" said Shapovalov. \"After every match point I saved, they went pretty crazy. It adds to the nerve for the other guy. They were so alive, so intense.\"\n\nIn the third set, Shapovalov fired four aces. He broke Dutra Silva to take a 4-3 lead in the set and never looked back.\n\nOn triple match point, Shapovalov fired a serve that handcuffed Dutra Silva. The 18-year-old dropped his racket and threw his arms in the air as the centre court crowd at Uniprix Stadium erupted in cheers.\n\n\"Obviously after the breaker, I felt the momentum was shifting towards my way,\" said Shapovalov. \"I thought if I could get an early break, it would help me. I think I played really good tennis in the third set.\"\n\nIt's the second straight year that Shapovalov has advanced into the tournament's second round after beating Nick Kyrgios during his opening match in 2016 in Toronto.\n\nThe win is Shapovalov's first on hard court this year (1-3). It's also just his second victory on the ATP world tour in 2017.\n\nHe'll now face Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina, ranked No. 31, in the second round.\n\n\"He's one of my idols,\" said Shapovalov of del Potro. \"Growing up I saw him win the U.S. Open. So it's going to be an extremely tough match. But I live for these moments. I live to be in these matches. I think it's going to be a great battle.\"\n\nShapovalov's service game was his undoing in the first set. He was broken twice in the 41-minute set. Shapovalov's first serve regularly clocked in at over 200 kilometres per hour, but it lacked the accuracy to be effective. The Canadian had an abysmal first-serve success rate of 40 per cent in the opening set.\n\nBut as the youngster's serve improved, so did his confidence.\n\n\"I couldn't really find my rhythm in the first set,\" said Shapovalov. \"I felt like in the tiebreaker I really loosened up and just started going for my serves. I hit a bunch of aces there. In the third set, that kind of continued.\"\n\nEarlier in the afternoon, South Korea's Hyeon Chung upset Feliciano Lopez of Spain 6-1, 4-6, 7-6(3).\n\nChung, ranked No. 56 in the world, took advantage of several mistakes made by the 28th-ranked Lopez, including eight double faults, to win the two hour 16 minute match.\n\nThe opening match on centre court at Uniprix Stadium was supposed to feature 10th-ranked Tomas Berdych, but he pulled out with a rib injury. Berdych's withdrawal ended a streak of 12 consecutive appearances in Canada for the Czech player.\n\n\"I am sorry I have to apologize (to) all my Montreal fans,\" tweeted Berdych. \"I couldn't play, because of my rib disfunction I need to get well to go to office soon!!\"\n\nNo. 85 Ernesto Escobedo took his spot and upset 63rd-ranked Nikoloz Basilashvili in straight sets 7-6(4), 6-4.\n\nIn the final match of the day, third-seeded Dominic Thiem was upset in the second round by Diego Schwartzman 6-4. 6-7, 7-5 in a match that needed two hours 55 minutes. Thiem is the highest-ranked player at the tournament to be eliminated so far.\n\nAlso, American Jack Sock downed Pierre-Hugues Herber 7-6(4), 6-3 in first-round play, while fellow American Jared Donaldson beat Benoit Pare 6-2, 7-5 in the first second-round match of the tournament.\n\nBorna Coric easily defeated Mikhail Youzhny 6-2, 6-4 to set up a meeting with Rafael Nadal in the second round.\n\nPaolo Lorenzo downed American Frances Tiafoe 7-6(3), 0-6, 6-2. American Sam Querrey avoided an upset, rallying to beat qualifier Vincent Millot of France 4-6, 7-6(4), 7-5.\n\nIn doubles, Canadians Vasek Pospisil and Daniel Nestor lost 4-6, 6-4, 10-2 to Spaniards David Ferrer and Roberto Bautista Agut.\n\nMilos Raonic from Thornhill, Ont., was initially scheduled to play his opening match on Tuesday, but a minor injury forced him to postpone it to Wednesday.

fought off four match points in a second-set tiebreaker and defeated Rogerio Dutra Silva of Brazil 4-6, 7-6 (8), 6-4 in the first round of the Rogers Cup Canadian Open tennis championships on Tuesday.\n\n\"It was a bit stressful, but the crowd pulled me through,\" said the 18-year-old from Toronto, who has reached the second round in each of the past two years. \"I hope we can keep it going.\"\n\nNext up for Shapovalov is Argentine Juan Martin del Potro, the 2009 U.S. Open champion. That match will be on centre court and the tentative starting time is 12:30 p.m.\n\nThis wasn't a vintage serving game for the left-handed Shapovalov. He put only 50 per cent of his first serves into play, but he came up with the big shots when he needed them. He had four of his 12 aces in the tiebreaker and ended the match with a wide service winner that forced Dutra Silva off the court on the ad side.\n\nShapovalov took control of the deciding set when he broke Dutra Silva's serve for a 4-3 lead. The Brazilian fell behind 15-40 and Shapovalov ripped a backhand winner for the break,\n\nShapovalov had to dig deep to survive the second-set tiebreaker. He fell behind 3-0 before delivering a pair of aces. Dutra Silva had two match points at 6-4, but an unforced error erased one point and Shapovalov pulled even with a half-volley drop shot for a winner.\n\nAn unforced error and an ace by Shapovalov allowed the Canadian to save the other match points and Dutra Silva double-faulted to give Shapovalov a 10-8 win in the tiebreaker.\n\nShapovalov wasn't the only player who had to dig deep for a spot in the second round. Pablo Carreno Busta, the 11th seed from Spain, outlasted Karen Khachanov of Russia 3-6, 6-3, 6-2, while ninth-seeded David Goffin of Belgium beat Yuichi Sugita of Japan, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2. American serving machine Sam Querrey needed 18 aces and three sets to eliminate French qualifier Vincent Millot 4-6, 7-6 (4), 7-5 and Korean Hyeon Chung beat Spaniard Feliciano Lopez 6-1, 4-6, 7-6 (3).\n\nThere's no shortage of star power on centre court Wednesday. Second-seeded Roger Federer will play Peter Polansky of Toronto after the Shapovalov-del Potro match.\n\nRafael Nadal, the top seed, will make his tournament debut in the evening session beginning at 6:30 p.m. He will play Croatian Borna Coric. That will be followed by Canadian Milos Raonic, the No. 6 seed, facing France's Adrian Mannarino.\n\nphickey@postmedia.com", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-08T22:23:00Z", "sim": 0.8392156958580017, "source": {"uri": "montrealgazette.com", "title": "Montreal Gazette", "id": "2649"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "22:23:00", "url": "http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/rogers-cup-shapovalov-survives-4-match-points-wins-first-round-match", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8072234", "image": "http://wpmedia.montrealgazette.com/2017/08/0809-spt-rogers-0223.jpg?w=640", "date": "2017-08-08", "time": "22:23:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-08"}

Canadian teenager Denis Shapovalov shocked top seeded Rafael Nadal to reach the quarter-finals of the ATP Montreal Masters tournament, spoiling the Spaniard's chances of returning to world number one.\n\nThe 18-year-old Shapovalov continued his giant killing form at the hardcourt tournament by rallying to stun Nadal in three sets 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7/4) on Thursday.\n\n\"I was just swinging for the fences,\" said Shapovalov, who needed a wild card to get into the tournament.\n\nThe 31-year-old Nadal would have returned to No. 1 in the world if he reached the semi-finals.\n\nBut Nadal struggled to get the ball to Shapovalov's backhand and didn't have an answer for the Canadian's blistering forehand winners.\n\n\"He played well. He has great potential,\" Nadal said. \"I wish him the best. He played with the right determination.\"\n\nShapovalov's biggest win of his young career against the 15-time Grand Slam winner came as a result of some inspired tennis in front of a boisterous home crowd who cheered his every shot.\n\nShapovalov, who is ranked 143rd in the world, had just three wins this season coming into the tournament. He quickly got on a roll in Montreal, beating Brazil's Rogerio Dutra Silva in the opening round 4-6, 7-6 (10/8), 6-4. He then defeated former US Open winner Juan Martin Del Potro in the second round in straight sets 6-3 7-6 (7/4) to set up the showdown with Nadal.\n\nShapovalov fell behind 3-0 before winning seven of the final eight points of the third set tiebreaker. He closed out the match with a forehand winner down the line and celebrated by falling onto his back then covering his face with his hands.\n\nNadal easily won the first set but couldn't put the free-swinging Canadian away with a second set victory.\n\nThe third game of the second set lasted 14 minutes with Shapovalov finally holding serve when Nadal's volley sailed into the net. Shapovalov managed to win the game despite double faulting three times.\n\n\"Was it only 14 minutes?,\" Shapovalov asked. \"It felt like three hours.\n\n\"I just kept fighting. I knew it was going to be really tough. I went for my shots in the big moments and I caught a couple of lines got a little bit lucky but at the end of the day that is what tennis is.\"\n\nShapovalov said he didn't think he had a chance to win at all before the match. It wasn't until he levelled the sets at one each that he realized he could beat the 10-time French Open champion.\n\n\"The whole day I was like - there's no chance. I will go and have fun but there is no way I am beating this guy,\" Shapovalov said.\n\n\"I went up a break in the second set early and even though he broke me back I felt like - OK, I am capable of breaking him.\n\n\"So when I won that second set I thought let's go one more set and who knows, anything can happen.\"\n\nShapovalov blasted a total of nine aces, including some on his second serve. He also had seven double faults and won 67 percent of his first serve points.\n\n- 'Dream come true' -\n\n\"It is incredible. I can't even talk right now. I grew up watching Rafa so just to be able to compete with him is one thing but to come out winning is a dream come true for me.\"\n\nNadal won 77 percent of his first serve points, but had just two aces and six double faults in the two hour, 45 minute center court match.\n\nElsewhere on Thursday, Roger Federer maintained his career-long winning streak over David Ferrer to advance to the quarter-finals after a three-set battle with the veteran Spaniard.\n\nFederer, 36, had never lost in 16 previous meetings with the 35-year-old Ferrer, whom he first defeated 14 years ago at the Vienna Indoor tournament.\n\nBut while Ferrer managed to take the opening set -- ending Federer's 32-set streak -- the Swiss ace raised his game to win 4-6, 6-4, 6-2.\n\n\"I actually feel really happy because I know I can play a lot better. David can play a lot better, too,\" Federer said.\n\n\"We battled, both tried to find a way to win. You know, he had a good start, I had a better finish.\"\n\nIn other matches Thursday, Germany's Alexander Zverev defeated Nick Kyrgios 6-4, 6-3, Roberto Bautista outlasted Gael Monfils 4-6, 7-6 (7/5), 7-6 (7/2) and Kevin Anderson of South Africa cruised past Sam Querrey 6-4, 6-1.\n\nShares", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-11", "textEnd": 224, "textStart": 218}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T06:28:00Z", "sim": 0.8392156958580017, "source": {"uri": "capitalfm.co.ke", "title": "Capital News", "id": "333"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "06:29:00", "url": "http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/sports/2017/08/11/nadals-pursuit-no-1-derailed-canadian-teen/", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8550312", "image": "https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/sports/files/2017/08/3dcd82e350bfcf902ed8316a16b57fa7e6e1a563.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "06:28:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

The two left-handers battled for two hours and 46 minutes.\n\nShapovalov, the youngest player in the top 200, has been making his mark on the second-tier Challenger circuit, but his performance this week shows he has no respect for his elders. He reached the third round with wins over Rogerio Dutra Silva and 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro. With the win, Shapovalov should crack the top 100 in the rankings for the first time. next week He could go as high as No. 66 if he wins his quarter-final match against Adrian Mannarino. They will play on centre court at 6:30 p.m. Friday.\n\nA single service break provided Nadal with the first set, but the young Canadian was just getting warmed up.\n\nOn two occasions in the second set, Shapovalov fell behind 0-30 on his serve, but he responded by winning four consecutive points. At 4-4, he pulled even with two aces, one of them clocked at 133 miles an hour. He was broken in the seventh game, but Shapovalov broke Nadal's serve a second time at 4-5 to secure the second set.\n\nShapovalov's serve let him down at 1-1 in the third set when he double-faulted three times and faced three break points. But he persevered to win a game that went to deuce 10 times. The players then held serve throughout the set to force a deciding tiebreaker.\n\nNadal had a mini-break on the first point of the tiebreaker, but gave it back with a double-fault for 3-3 and Shapovalov earned his first match point when Nadal netted a backhand to fall behind 6-4. Shapovalov won it on the next point with a forehand winner down the line. Shapovalov recorded two of his nine aces in the tiebreaker.\n\nShapovalov played an aggressive game throughout and had 49 winners and 41 unforced errors. Nadal had only 18 winners and 29 unforced errors.\n\nShapovalov fought off nine of 11 break points and Nadal said he wasn't surprised the youngster went for big shots on those points.\n\n\"He has nothing to lose. Is win-win for him,\" said Nadal, who needed to reach the semifinals here to reclaim the No. 1 spot in the rankings. \"If he loses playing a good match, was good for him. If he lose in straight sets, already he played a good tournament. If he wins, he's amazing. He won. Is amazing for him. Just well done for him.

amazed he had beaten tennis superstar Rafael Nadal.\n\nThe 18-year-old from Richmond Hill, Ont. shocked himself, the crowd that roared with every point he scored, and the tennis world with his 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (4) victory over top-seeded Nadal in the third round of the Rogers Cup on Thursday night at a sold out Uniprix Stadium.\n\nShapovalov dropped to the ground and covered his face in joy and surprise as the cheers reached deafening levels after the match point fell, completing his comeback from a 3-0 deficit in the third-set tiebreaker.\n\n\"It's what I dreamed of all my life growing up, playing guys like Rafa (Nadal), Roger (Federer), Andy (Murray),\" said Shapovalov. \"You know, my dream came true today.\"\n\nThe victory put him into a quarter-final Friday against France's Adrian Mannarino, who beat Hyeon Chung 6-3,6-3.\n\nIt was one of the biggest wins in Canadian tennis history and it came at the tournament that some still call the Canadian Open.\n\nShapovalov became the youngest player to reach the tournament's quarter-finals since Bjorn Borg in 1974.\n\nHe also became the youngest quarter-finalist at a Masters Series tournament ever and is the youngest to beat a player ranked in the top two in the world since Nadal beat Federer in 2004 in Miami.\n\nShapovalov will reach his goal of moving into the top 100 in the world in a week that saw him save four match points in a first round win over Rogerio Dutra Silva, then beat 2009 U.S. Open winner Juan Martin Del Potro in the second round before toppling Nadal.\n\n\"I'm very thankful that I'm in this position,\" said Shapovalov, who had hockey great Wayne Gretzky and Olympic swimming star Penny Oleksiak cheering for him from the seats. \"If I didn't save those four match points in the first round, there wouldn't even be a chance to play Juan Martin or Rafa.\n\n\"It's difficult to say how I was feeling during the match. It was extremely hard physically and mentally. Rafa is such a warrior. I'm just so happy to come out with the win.\"\n\nNadal, who could have claimed the No. 1 ranking if he had reached the semifinals this week, said it was the worst match he played all year, but he had kind words for Shapovalov.\n\nHe has everything to become a great player.Rafael Nadal\n\n\"He played well,\" the 31-year-old said. \"He has a great potential.\n\n\"I wish him the best. He has everything to become a great player. He played with the right determination in the important moments.\"\n\nShapovalov looked unfazed in facing the biggest opponent of his young career. After Nadal cruised through the first set, Shapovalov kept battling, breaking service while taking a 3-0 lead in the second. When Nadal would start taking a control of a game, the younger of the two lefthanders would respond with big serves or impressive forehands down the lines.\n\nNadal fought off two break points to hold serve at 4-2, then earned his own break to win back the momentum from the 2016 Wimbledon junior boys champion, only to see Shapovalov snatch it back and clinch the second set.\n\nThe two held serve through the third. Nadal went up 3-0, but Shapovalov used two aces to fight back and complete the upset victory over the 10-time French Open champion.\n\nSecond-seeded Roger Federer, a 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 winner over Spain's David Ferrer, isn't one to gloat over his stunning record against Spaniard, who was ranked third in the world in 2013.\n\nWithout playing especially well, the 19-time Grand Slam champion from Switzerland stretched his career record against the Ferrer to 17-0. It started with a win in Vienna in 2003.\n\n\"Maybe in the beginning he was not as good as he is now,\" Federer said of Ferrer. \"Maybe I won five times because I'm better than he was.\n\n\"I was No. 1 in the world. I played him on hard courts also. I didn't play him often on clay. Also, there were many tight matches, so maybe it became a mental thing for him. I have a lot of respect for David. As a person, he's very nice. He's a great fighter on the court. So this type of head-to-head is a bit strange.\"\n\nIn Friday's quarter-finals, second-seeded Federer will face 12th-seeded Roberto Bautista Agut of Spain, against whom he is 6-0. Bautista Agut outlasted Frenchman Gael Monfils 4-6, 7-6 (5), 7-6 (2) in a two hours 56 minutes battle.\n\nUnseeded Argentine Diego Schwartzman posted a strange win over American Jared Donaldson 0-6, 7-5, 7-5 to advance to a quarter-final meeting with Robin Haase, the 52nd-ranked Dutchman who upset seventh-seeded Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria 7-6 (3), 4-6, 6-1.\n\nKevin Anderson of South Africa downed American Sam Querrey 6-4, 6-1 and will next play fourth-seeded Alexander Zverev, who ousted 16th seeded Nick Kyrgios 6-4, 6-3.\n\nFederer, who breezed past Canadian Peter Polansky in the second round on Wednesday, looked lost in the opening set, spraying balls long, wide or into the net, but gradually rediscovered at least some of the form that has seen the 36-year-old Swiss put back the clock with two grand slam wins this year.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T14:45:00Z", "sim": 0.8274509906768799, "source": {"uri": "huffingtonpost.ca", "title": "The Huffington Post Canada", "id": "355"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "15:04:00", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/08/11/denis-shapovalov-canadian-teen-beats-rafael-nadal-at-rogers-cu_a_23074742/", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8643815", "image": "https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/630x331+0+67/resize/1200x630!/format/jpg/quality/85/https%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fimages%2Fdims%3Fcrop%3D4778%252C3515%252C0%252C0%26quality%3D85%26format%3Djpg%26resize%3D630%252C463%26image_uri%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fo.aolcdn.com%252Fhss%252Fstorage%252Fmidas%252Fa0865ecd031390585de5411b496d0fe9%252F205559306%252FRTS1BAFS.jpeg%26client%3Da1acac3e1b3290917d92%26signature%3D6a0315faf0cdbfd17720b67367aba65aa6594408", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "14:45:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

He leapt in the air as he closed out the match.\n\n\"I've been against the wall a couple times this week and I'm very happy I've come out several times just playing really good tennis in those situations,\" Shapovalov said. \"I think it really shows how I've improved mentally, along with just finding my game at the right moments.\"\n\nAfter facing a run of veterans, he will be up against the 20-year-old Zverev, who beat Kevin Anderson of South Africa 7-5, 6-4.\n\nThe second-seeded Federer continued his mastery over 12th-seeded Roberto Bautista Agut of Spain with a 6-4, 6-4 victory.

But, as I have practiced with him quite a bit, maybe I am better prepared than if I would have never hit with him before.\"\n\nFederer broke serve for a 5-4 lead in the first set and broke again for 2-1 in the second en route to the victory in a little more than an hour.

reach the quarter-finals of the ATP Montreal Masters tournament, spoiling the Spaniard\u00b4s chances of returning to world number one.\n\nThe 18-year-old Shapovalov, who needed a wild card to get into the tournament, continued his giant killing form at the hardcourt tournament by rallying to beat Nadal in three sets, 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7/4) on Thursday.\n\nNadal would have returned to No. 1 in the world if he had defeated Shapovalov Thursday, and then Chung Hyeon or Adrian Mannarino on Friday.\n\nShapovalov\u00b4s stunning upset against the reigning French Open champion came as a result of some inspired tennis in front of a boisterous home crowd who cheered his every shot.\n\nShapovalov had just three wins this season coming into the tournament. He quickly got on a roll in Montreal beating Brazil\u00b4s Rogerio Dutra Silva in the opening round 4-6, 7-6 (10/8), 6-4. He defeated former US Open winner Juan Martin Del Potro in the second round in straight sets 6-3 7-6 (7/4) to set up the showdown with Nadal.\n\nShapovalov won seven of the final eight points of the third set tiebreaker before closing out the match with a forehand winner down the line. He celebrated by falling onto his back then covering his face with his hands.\n\nShapovalov blasted a total of nine aces, including ones on his second serve that handcuffed Nadal. He also had seven double faults and won 67 percent of his first serve points.\n\nNadal won 77 percent of his first serve points but had just two aces and six double faults in the two hour, 45 minute center court match.\n\nElsewhere on Thursday, Roger Federer maintained his career-long winning streak over David Ferrer to advance to the quarter-finals after a three-set battle with the veteran Spaniard.\n\nFederer, 36, had never lost in 16 previous meetings with the 35-year-old Ferrer, whom he first defeated 14 years ago at the Vienna Indoor tournament.\n\nBut while Ferrer managed to take the opening set -- ending Federer\u00b4s 32-set streak -- the Swiss ace raised his game to win 4-6, 6-4, 6-2.\n\n\"I actually feel really happy because I know I can play a lot better. David can play a lot better, too,\" Federer said. \"We battled, both tried to find a way to win. You know, he had a good start, I had a better finish.\"\n\nA strangely error-prone Federer was unable to generate his usual fluency early on, and quickly found himself giving away early breaks to trail 4-1 in the first set.\n\nNowhere was Federer\u00b4s wayward performance better illustrated than in the seventh game, when he squandered three break points at 0-40 to allow Ferrer to take a 5-2 lead.\n\nFederer held for 5-3 and looked to have clawed his way back into the set with a break of Ferrer\u00b4s serve in the next game to make it 5-4.\n\nBut Federer was struggling again as he served to level the set, finding himself a set point down. He saved the first with an ace but Ferrer made no mistake with his second set point, converting to take the opener 6-4.\n\nFederer responded quickly in the second set, going a break up to lead 3-2 before holding for a 4-2 lead.\n\nWith Federer slowly improving his first serve, Ferrer was unable to carve out the break opportunities he had found in the first set.\n\nThe set went with serve as Federer leveled.\n\nAn early break in the decider put him in control as a weary Ferrer began to tire.\n\nSome vintage play at the net helped put Federer 4-2 up with Ferrer seemingly unable to summon a response.\n\nThe decisive break came in the seventh game, with Ferrer netting a forehand return to leave Federer 5-2 up and serving for the match.\n\nFederer promptly went in for the kill, attacking the net and opening up the court to clinch victory with a deft volley.\n\nFederer will now play another Spaniard, Roberto Bautista Agut, in the quarter-finals. Bautista Agut defeated France\u00b4s Gael Monfils in a gruelling slugfest, winning 4-6, 7-6 (7/5), 7-6 (7/2).\n\n\"I hope that this match gives me some better rhythm and confidence against Bautista Agut, who plays actually very similar to David,\" Federer said.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T05:25:00Z", "sim": 0.8235294222831726, "source": {"uri": "geo.tv", "title": "geo.tv", "id": "3799"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "05:25:00", "url": "https://www.geo.tv/latest/153231-top-seed-nadal-upset-by-canadian-teen-shapovalov", "storyUri": "eng-3353129", "id": "8542286", "image": "https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2017-08-11/153231_093403_updates.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "05:25:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Shapovalov will surely once again have the noisy backing of the home crowd, which has so far fired him to victory, but will be facing a huge test against the famed Spaniard. With both playing well so far, a terrific clash should be in store.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly considering Shapovalov turned pro just last year he has not yet played Nadal. Indeed, this will be his first contest against one of the 'Big 4'. The gulf in experience between the two is also understandably huge. Shapovalov will be playing just 13th Tour level match. Of the previous 12, he has won five and lost seven. Nadal, in contrast, having turned pro 16 years ago, has played 1034 matches to date in his career, and has won 853 of them. He is also 73 times a titlist at Tour level, which includes 15 Slams and 30 Masters 1000 titles. Shapovalov has a junior Wimbledon title, and two challengers to his name. Good numbers for an 18-year-old, but some way short of Nadal's monumental haul.\n\nNadal, as the top seed in Montreal, enjoyed a first round bye. As a result, he opened against Borna Coric who had defeated Mikhail Youzhny in the first round. The Croatian had previously scored two victories against Nadal, in Basel in 2014 and in Cincinnati last year, where he thrashed Nadal for the loss of just four games. But a repeat of those defeats never looked likely as Nadal dominated the match from start to finish. Coric managed just six points in the opening four games and was swiftly 5-0 down. He managed to save some honour, pulling back one game, but the set was over and Nadal wrapped it up 6-1. The second was marginally more competitive, but Coric could still do little to hurt Nadal. The Spaniard twice broke serve and came away with a 6-1 6-2 victory. A terrific start to his hard court swing.\n\nDenis Shapovalov, a wildcard entrant, did not enjoy the luxury of a first round bye. The Canadian began against Rogerio Dutra Silva in one of the matches of the tournament so far. He dropped the first set to his Brazilian opponent and had to save four break points at 5-5 in the second. He did so, and made it to a tiebreak, where Dutra Silva fashioned four match points. Shapovalov saved them all, including one with a lovely sliced volley off his shoelaces. He took the set when Dutra Silva double faulted facing his set point. From there Shapovalov looked to be in control, breaking with an excellent backhand pass in the sixth game.\n\nHe served it out to love to set up a meeting with his idol and 2009 US Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro. It looked to be a tough test for the Canadian, but he rose to it superbly. That being said, the big Argentine was not at his best, with his forehand misfiring. Shapovalov took the first set quickly, 6-3. The second was a more tightly contested affair. Del Potro got an early break, but couldn't consolidate it. Shapovalov then broke at five games all, to serve for the match. But he played a horrible game to let Del Potro back into the match. In the tiebreak, however, he stepped his game up. Shapovalov met Del Potro's power with plenty of his own, and despite double faulting on his first match point, Shapovalov made no mistake the second time. His excellent run continues.\n\nShapovalov is in many ways the classic attacking baseliner. He launches into his shots whenever he gets the chance and is equally happy teeing off on the backhand and the forehand side. The young Canadian is also a terrific server, particularly off the first delivery. Against that Nadal brings some of the best defences the game has ever seen, equalled only by Novak Djokovic for court coverage, and a topspin forehand that has brought players as great as Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic to their knees with astonishing regularity.\n\nNadal's court coverage will make it a fascinating battle. How Shapovalov responds to a player who moves so much better than anyone he has ever faced will be key. He will have to be prepared to hit, at times, three or four extra shots to win the point without becoming frustrated. Nadal also defends out of the corners better than most, which will be crucial. Nadal must maintain good depth and width throughout, or as Shapovalov has demonstrated, he will hit players off the court. It promises to be one of the classic contests between defence and attack.\n\nNadal looked in frightening form against Borna Coric. Shapovalov has done brilliantly to get as far as he is, but there is a huge difference between beating Dutra Silva and an out of sorts Del Potro and beating Rafael Nadal. Nadal's experience, forehand and court coverage should see him through the match. Though he will likely have to watch a fair few balls fly past him it is difficult to see Shapovalov finding a way through Nadal enough to pull out the win.

Canadian teenager Denis Shapovalov shocked top seeded Rafael Nadal to reach the quarter-finals of the ATP Montreal Masters tournament, spoiling the Spaniard's chances of returning to world number one.\n\nThe 18-year-old Shapovalov, who needed a wild card to get into the tournament, continued his giant killing form at the hardcourt tournament by rallying to beat Nadal in three sets, 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7/4) on Thursday.\n\nNadal would have returned to No. 1 in the world if he had defeated Shapovalov Thursday, and then Chung Hyeon or Adrian Mannarino on Friday.\n\nShapovalov's stunning upset against the reigning French Open champion came as a result of some inspired tennis in front of a boisterous home crowd who cheered his every shot.\n\nShapovalov had just three wins this season coming into the tournament. He quickly got on a roll in Montreal beating Brazil's Rogerio Dutra Silva in the opening round 4-6, 7-6 (10/8), 6-4. He defeated former US Open winner Juan Martin Del Potro in the second round in straight sets 6-3 7-6 (7/4) to set up the showdown with Nadal.\n\nShapovalov won seven of the final eight points of the third set tiebreaker before closing out the match with a forehand winner down the line. He celebrated by falling onto his back then covering his face with his hands.\n\nShapovalov blasted a total of nine aces, including ones on his second serve that handcuffed Nadal. He also had seven double faults and won 67 percent of his first serve points.\n\nNadal won 77 percent of his first serve points but had just two aces and six double faults in the two hour, 45 minute center court match.\n\nElsewhere on Thursday, Roger Federer maintained his career-long winning streak over David Ferrer to advance to the quarter-finals after a three-set battle with the veteran Spaniard.\n\nFederer, 36, had never lost in 16 previous meetings with the 35-year-old Ferrer, whom he first defeated 14 years ago at the Vienna Indoor tournament.\n\nBut while Ferrer managed to take the opening set -- ending Federer's 32-set streak -- the Swiss ace raised his game to win 4-6, 6-4, 6-2.\n\n\"I actually feel really happy because I know I can play a lot better. David can play a lot better, too,\" Federer said. \"We battled, both tried to find a way to win. You know, he had a good start, I had a better finish.\"\n\n- Error prone -\n\nA strangely error-prone Federer was unable to generate his usual fluency early on, and quickly found himself giving away early breaks to trail 4-1 in the first set.\n\nNowhere was Federer's wayward performance better illustrated than in the seventh game, when he squandered three break points at 0-40 to allow Ferrer to take a 5-2 lead.\n\nFederer held for 5-3 and looked to have clawed his way back into the set with a break of Ferrer's serve in the next game to make it 5-4.\n\nBut Federer was struggling again as he served to level the set, finding himself a set point down. He saved the first with an ace but Ferrer made no mistake with his second set point, converting to take the opener 6-4.\n\nFederer responded quickly in the second set, going a break up to lead 3-2 before holding for a 4-2 lead.\n\nWith Federer slowly improving his first serve, Ferrer was unable to carve out the break opportunities he had found in the first set.\n\nThe set went with serve as Federer leveled.\n\nAn early break in the decider put him in control as a weary Ferrer began to tire.\n\nSome vintage play at the net helped put Federer 4-2 up with Ferrer seemingly unable to summon a response.\n\nThe decisive break came in the seventh game, with Ferrer netting a forehand return to leave Federer 5-2 up and serving for the match.\n\nFederer promptly went in for the kill, attacking the net and opening up the court to clinch victory with a deft volley.\n\nFederer will now play another Spaniard, Roberto Bautista Agut, in the quarter-finals. Bautista Agut defeated France's Gael Monfils in a gruelling slugfest, winning 4-6, 7-6 (7/5), 7-6 (7/2).\n\n\"I hope that this match gives me some better rhythm and confidence against Bautista Agut, who plays actually very similar to David,\" Federer said.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T05:25:00Z", "sim": 0.8156862854957581, "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "title": "News18", "id": "2489"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "05:25:00", "url": "http://www.news18.com/news/sports/montreal-masters-rafael-nadal-upset-by-canadian-teen-shapovalov-1488405.html", "storyUri": "eng-3353129", "id": "8542276", "image": "http://img01.ibnlive.in/ibnlive/uploads/2016/01/nadal_1901getty_750.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "05:25:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

after rallying to defeat Rogerio Dutra Silva of Brazil 4-6, 7-6(8), 6-4.\n\nThe 143rd-ranked Shapovalov got better as the match progressed, needing two hours 26 minutes to upset the 64th-ranked Dutra Silva.\n\nOn triple match point, Shapovalov fired a serve that handcuffed Dutra Silva. The 18-year-old dropped his racket and threw his arms in the air as the centre court crowd at Uniprix Stadium erupted in cheers.\n\nShapovalov's victory looked unlikely after he was broken twice in the 41-minute first set. The Richmond Hill, Ont., native's service game was his undoing to start the match.\n\nRead more:\n\nBouchard out of Rogers Cup after first-round loss to Vekic\n\nMonfils, Kyrgios move on at Rogers Cup in Montreal\n\nShapovalov's first serve regularly clocked in at over 200 kilometres per hour, but it lacked the accuracy to be effective. The Canadian had an abysmal first-serve success rate of 40 per cent in the opening set.\n\nBut as Shapovalov's serve improved, so did the youngster grow in confidence.\n\nThe turning point for Shapovalov, who was granted a wild-card spot in the tournament, came in the second-set tiebreak. Down 3-1, the Canadian fired back-to-back aces to even the set.\n\nShapovalov survived four match points in that tiebreak. Leading 9-8, Dutra Silva double faulted to give Shapovalov the second-set victory.\n\nIn the third set, Shapovalov fired four aces, with his first-serve success rate having increased to a respectable 60 per cent. He broke Dutra Silva to take a 4-3 lead in the set and never looked back.\n\nIt's the second-straight year that Shapovalov has advanced into the tournament's second round after beating Nick Kyrgios during his opening match in 2016 in Toronto.\n\nThe win is Shapovalov's first on hard court this year (1-3). It's also just his second victory on the ATP world tour in 2017.\n\nHe'll now face Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina, ranked No. 31, in the second round.\n\nEarlier in the afternoon, South Korea's Hyeon Chung upset Feliciano Lopez of Spain 6-1, 4-6, 7-6(3).\n\nChung, ranked No. 56 in the world, took advantage of several mistakes made by the 28th-ranked Lopez, including eight double faults, to win the two hour 16 minute match.\n\nLopez is now 10-12 in his career at the Rogers Cup.\n\nThe opening match on centre court at Uniprix Stadium was supposed to feature 10th-ranked Tomas Berdych but he pulled out with a rib injury.

quarter-finals of the ATP Montreal Masters tournament, spoiling the Spaniard's chances of returning to world number one.\n\nThe 18-year-old Shapovalov, who needed a wild card to get into the tournament, continued his giant killing form at the hardcourt tournament by rallying to beat Nadal in three sets, 3-6 6-4 7-6 (7/4) yesterday.\n\nNadal would have returned to No. 1 in the world if he had defeated Shapovalov yesterday, and then Chung Hyeon or Adrian Mannarino today.\n\nShapovalov's stunning upset against the reigning French Open champion came as a result of some inspired tennis in front of a boisterous home crowd who cheered his every shot.\n\nShapovalov had just three wins this season coming into the tournament. He quickly got on a roll in Montreal beating Brazil's Rogerio Dutra Silva in the opening round 4-6 7-6 (10/8) 6-4. He defeated former US Open winner Juan Martin Del Potro in the second round in straight sets 6-3 7-6 (7/4) to set up the showdown with Nadal.\n\nShapovalov won seven of the final eight points of the third set tiebreaker before closing out the match with a forehand winner down the line. He celebrated by falling onto his back then covering his face with his hands.\n\nShapovalov blasted a total of nine aces, including ones on his second serve that handcuffed Nadal. He also had seven double faults and won 67 percent of his first serve points.\n\nNadal won 77 per cent of his first serve points but had just two aces and six double faults in the two hour, 45 minute center court match.\n\nElsewhere yesterday, Roger Federer maintained his career-long winning streak over David Ferrer to advance to the quarter-finals after a three-set battle with the veteran Spaniard.\n\nFederer, 36, had never lost in 16 previous meetings with the 35-year-old Ferrer, whom he first defeated 14 years ago at the Vienna Indoor tournament.\n\nBut while Ferrer managed to take the opening set -- ending Federer's 32-set streak -- the Swiss ace raised his game to win 4-6 6-4 6-2.\n\n\"I actually feel really happy because I know I can play a lot better. David can play a lot better, too,\" Federer said.\n\n\"We battled, both tried to find a way to win. You know, he had a good start, I had a better finish.\"\n\nA strangely error-prone Federer was unable to generate his usual fluency early on, and quickly found himself giving away early breaks to trail 4-1 in the first set.\n\nNowhere was Federer's wayward performance better illustrated than in the seventh game, when he squandered three break points at 0-40 to allow Ferrer to take a 5-2 lead.\n\nFederer held for 5-3 and looked to have clawed his way back into the set with a break of Ferrer's serve in the next game to make it 5-4.\n\nBut Federer was struggling again as he served to level the set, finding himself a set point down. He saved the first with an ace but Ferrer made no mistake with his second set point, converting to take the opener 6-4.\n\nFederer responded quickly in the second set, going a break up to lead 3-2 before holding for a 4-2 lead.\n\nWith Federer slowly improving his first serve, Ferrer was unable to carve out the break opportunities he had found in the first set.\n\nThe set went with serve as Federer leveled.\n\nAn early break in the decider put him in control as a weary Ferrer began to tire.\n\nSome vintage play at the net helped put Federer 4-2 up with Ferrer seemingly unable to summon a response.\n\nThe decisive break came in the seventh game, with Ferrer netting a forehand return to leave Federer 5-2 up and serving for the match.\n\nFederer promptly went in for the kill, attacking the net and opening up the court to clinch victory with a deft volley.\n\nFederer will now play another Spaniard, Roberto Bautista Agut, in the quarter-finals. Bautista Agut defeated France's Gael Monfils in a gruelling slugfest, winning 4-6 7-6 (7/5) 7 -6 (7/2).\n\n\"I hope that this match gives me some better rhythm and confidence against Bautista Agut, who plays actually very similar to David,\" Federer said.\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T08:28:00Z", "sim": 0.8117647171020508, "source": {"uri": "dnaindia.com", "title": "Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India", "id": "492"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "08:28:00", "url": "http://www.dnaindia.com/sports/report-top-seed-nadal-upset-by-canadian-teen-shapovalov-2526574", "storyUri": "eng-3353129", "id": "8568544", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "08:28:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

On Friday, he will look to continue his dream run at his home Masters 1000 tournament when he faces Frenchman Adrian Mannarino, who dismissed #NextGenATP Korean Hyeon Chung 6-3, 6-3 to reach his first Masters 1000 quarter-final in his 31 attempt.\n\nBut this much is clear so far: Shapovalov brings an entirely different level of tennis to Court Central. The 18 year old has now knocked off three top ATP World Tour players on that court during the past two years: Nick Kyrgios last year, Juan Martin del Potro earlier this week and Nadal became his latest upset victim in their marathon two-hour and 46-minute battle.\n\n\"It's a very fast pace right now. It's a lot to take in, obviously. But to be honest, I'm very thankful that I'm in this position,\" Shapovalov said. \"If I didn't save those four match points in the first round [against Dutra Silva], there wouldn't even be a chance to play Juan Martin or Rafa. I'm very thankful for that.\"\n\nThe teenager was under no illusions as to the calibre of opponent across the net from him.\n\nWith \"The Great One\" Wayne Gretzky and his wife in attendance, Shapovalov was ready from the start for another high-octane match in the Canadian metropolis. He fought to 3-3 with Nadal in the opening set, but the Spaniard sprinted through the remainder of the opener and looked as if he would need only two sets.\n\nShapovalov, though, came out strong in the second set, and had two chances to go up 5-1. But Nadal fought back and pushed the second set to 4-4 before Shapovalov recovered to even the third-round match.\n\nOn his first set point, the Canadian mishit a return that Nadal lifted long, and Shapovalov raised his arms to roars from his thousands of fans.\n\nThe Canadian had success exchanging forehands with Nadal and was fearless with his shot selection, taking every cheer as encouragement. For the match, the Canadian finished with 49 winners to 41 unforced errors. He delivered nine aces to only two from Nadal.\n\nShapovalov also dealt an effective 1-2 punch while returning, pushing Nadal to one corner before striking a one-handed backhand or forehand up the line.\n\nBut Nadal, a 30-time Masters 1000 titlist, dug in for the decider, as did Shapovalov. Serving at 1-1, the 18 year old erased three break points and held during a 14-minute and 30-second game, showing the Spaniard he was not going away in the final set. For the match, Shapovalov erased nine of 11 break points.\n\nIn the tie-break, it again looked as if Nadal would finally pull away. He jumped out to a 3/0 lead. But this time it was Shapovalov's turn to fight back, and he won seven of the tie-break's final eight points to earn the biggest win of his life. Fittingly, he blasted a forehand winner on his first match point.\n\nAfter the ball sped past Nadal, Shapovalov tossed his racquet and fell to the court, covering his eyes in disbelief. The crowd's cheers soaked their new home favourite and, after he shook hands with Nadal, Shapovalov finished his celebration by saying thanks. He kissed the court and blew kisses to the crowd.\n\n\"I don't know if a lot of players fold or if he just outplays them at the end,\" Shapovalov said. \"I was down 3-0 in the tie-break. I did a good job to regroup. I knew I had to win both the points off my serve. Yeah, then he gave me a double [fault] to tie it up.\n\n\"I just tried to stay calm, tried to play every point, go for my shots. At the end of the day I really tried to keep playing my game and stick to my tactics.\"", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2014-06-", "textEnd": 724, "textStart": 715}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T02:14:00Z", "sim": 0.8117647171020508, "source": {"uri": "atpworldtour.com", "title": "ATP World Tour", "id": "9695"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "06:19:00", "url": "http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/news/nadal-shapovalov-montreal-2017-thursday", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8548909", "image": "www.atpworldtour.com/-/media/images/news/2017/08/11/03/07/shapovalov-montreal-2017-thursday.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "02:14:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Germany and Kevin Anderson of South Africa.\n\nShapovalov beat 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro in the second round and then knocked off the top-seeded Nadal in a third-set tiebreaker on Thursday in the round of 16.\n\nHe broke service for a 2-1 lead in the third Friday only to hand it back in the next game, but a roar went up when Mannarino wasted a chance to put away a game point and Shapovalov jumped on the chance to break for a 5-4 lead. He leapt in the air as he closed out the match.\n\nThe second-seeded Federer continued his mastery over 12th-seeded Roberto Bautista Agut of Spain with a 6-4, 6-4 victory. The 36-year-old Swiss will next face unseeded Dutchman Robin Haase, a 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 winner over Diego Schwartzman of Argentina.\n\nFederer has won all seven career matches and taken all 16 sets against the 29-year-old Bautista Agut.\n\nHe is 1-0 against Haase after a straight-sets win in Davis Cup play in 2012.\n\nFederer said he knows Haase well from serving with him on the ATP player council and from practicing together.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to a tough match because he can serve very well and he mixes up his tactics a lot,\" Federer said. \"Sometimes he tends to just roll the ball in and use the big serve, or he uses a slice a lot and comes in.\n\n\"So I don't quite know with Robin what I'm going to get. But, as I have practiced with him quite a bit, maybe I am better prepared than if I would have never hit with him before.\"\n\nFederer broke serve for a 5-4 lead in the first set and broke again for 2-1 in the second en route to the victory in a little more than an hour. Federer was coming off a three-set win over another Spaniard, David Ferrer, against whom he is 17-0.\n\n\"My game plan worked better against Bautista Agut than against Ferrer,\" he said. \"I believe it's because I was more aggressive coming to the net.\"\n\nHaase, who upset seventh-seeded Grigor Dimitrov in the third round, reached his first career Masters Series semifinal. The 30-year-old Haase, back to 52nd in the world after battling injuries for much of his career, improved to 5-0 against 36th-ranked Schwartzman.\n\n\"I played a lot of good matches, especially against Dimitrov,\" said Haase. \"It's tough to come back and play that same level.\n\n\"I didn't, but I managed to win because I kept fighting.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T01:43:00Z", "sim": 0.8039215803146362, "source": {"uri": "nationalpost.com", "title": "National Post", "id": "973"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "07:04:00", "url": "http://nationalpost.com/pmn/sports-pmn/federer-canadian-teen-shapovalov-reach-semis-in-montreal/wcm/ae16c77e-3930-48fd-8332-8583900fe1a5", "storyUri": "eng-3353129", "id": "8755868", "image": "http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/bf69214e83fdd5520e4b5d91ba3b7d64?s=200&ts=1502521494", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "01:43:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

semifinals of the Rogers Cup and was joined later Friday by Canadian teenager Denis Shapovalov, who followed his upset of Rafael Nadal with another three-set victory.\n\nThe 18-year-old left-hander from Richmond Hill, Ontario beat France's Adrian Mannarino 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 and will face fourth-seeded Alexander Zverev of Germany on Saturday.\n\nShapovalov beat 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro in the second round and then knocked off the top-seeded Nadal in a third-set tiebreaker on Thursday in the round of 16.\n\nHe broke service for a 2-1 lead in the third set Friday only to hand it back in the next game, but a roar went up when Mannarino wasted a chance to put away a game point and Shapovalov jumped on the chance to break for a 5-4 lead. He leapt in the air as he closed out the match.\n\n\"I've been against the wall a couple times this week and I'm very happy I've come out several times just playing really good tennis in those situations,\" Shapovalov said. \"I think it really shows how I've improved mentally, along with just finding my game at the right moments.\"\n\nAfter facing a run of veterans, he will be up against the 20-year-old Zverev, who beat Kevin Anderson of South Africa 7-5, 6-4.\n\nThe second-seeded Federer continued his mastery over 12th-seeded Roberto Bautista Agut of Spain with a 6-4, 6-4 victory. The 36-year-old Swiss will next face unseeded Dutchman Robin Haase, a 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 winner over Diego Schwartzman of Argentina.\n\nFederer has won all seven career matches and taken all 16 sets against the 29-year-old Bautista Agut.\n\nHe is 1-0 against Haase after a straight-sets win in Davis Cup play in 2012.\n\nFederer said he knows Haase well from serving with him on the ATP player council and from practicing together.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to a tough match because he can serve very well and he mixes up his tactics a lot,\" Federer said. \"Sometimes he tends to just roll the ball in and use the big serve, or he uses a slice a lot and comes in.\n\n\"So I don't quite know with Robin what I'm going to get. But, as I have practiced with him quite a bit, maybe I am better prepared than if I would have never hit with him before.\"\n\nFederer broke serve for a 5-4 lead in the first set and broke again for 2-1 in the second en route to the victory in a little more than an hour. Federer was coming off a three-set win over another Spaniard, David Ferrer, against whom he is 17-0.\n\n\"My game plan worked better against Bautista Agut than against Ferrer,\" he said. \"I believe it's because I was more aggressive coming to the net.\"\n\nHaase, who upset seventh-seeded Grigor Dimitrov in the third round, reached his first career Masters Series semifinal. The 30-year-old Haase, back to 52nd in the world after battling injuries for much of his career, improved to 5-0 against 36th-ranked Schwartzman.\n\n\"I played a lot of good matches, especially against Dimitrov,\" said Haase. \"It's tough to come back and play that same level.\n\n\"I didn't, but I managed to win because I kept fighting.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T04:24:00Z", "sim": 0.800000011920929, "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "title": "Eagle-Tribune", "id": "135"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "04:24:00", "url": "http://www.eagletribune.com/region/federer-canadian-teen-shapovalov-reach-semis-in-montreal/article_b2fab30c-394a-59eb-9218-488426fd84a4.html", "storyUri": "eng-3353129", "id": "8742670", "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/eagletribune.com/content/tncms/custom/image/0820eb90-5b14-11e5-bcdd-c35ca1f29437.jpg?_dc=1442257730", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "04:24:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

He quickly got on a roll in Montreal beating Brazil's Rogerio Dutra Silva in the opening round 4-6, 7-6 (10/8), 6-4. He defeated former US Open winner Juan Martin Del Potro in the second round in straight sets 6-3 7-6 (7/4) to set up the showdown with Nadal.\n\nShapovalov won seven of the final eight points of the third set tiebreaker before closing out the match with a forehand winner down the line. He celebrated by falling onto his back then covering his face with his hands.\n\nShapovalov blasted a total of nine aces, including ones on his second serve that handcuffed Nadal. He also had seven double faults and won 67 percent of his first serve points.\n\nNadal won 77 percent of his first serve points but had just two aces and six double faults in the two hour, 45 minute center court match.\n\nElsewhere on Thursday, Roger Federer maintained his career-long winning streak over David Ferrer to advance to the quarter-finals after a three-set battle with the veteran Spaniard.\n\nFederer, 36, had never lost in 16 previous meetings with the 35-year-old Ferrer, whom he first defeated 14 years ago at the Vienna Indoor tournament.\n\nBut while Ferrer managed to take the opening set -- ending Federer's 32-set streak -- the Swiss ace raised his game to win 4-6, 6-4, 6-2.\n\n\"I actually feel really happy because I know I can play a lot better. David can play a lot better, too,\" Federer said. \"We battled, both tried to find a way to win. You know, he had a good start, I had a better finish.\"\n\n- Error prone -\n\nA strangely error-prone Federer was unable to generate his usual fluency early on, and quickly found himself giving away early breaks to trail 4-1 in the first set.\n\nNowhere was Federer's wayward performance better illustrated than in the seventh game, when he squandered three break points at 0-40 to allow Ferrer to take a 5-2 lead.\n\nFederer held for 5-3 and looked to have clawed his way back into the set with a break of Ferrer's serve in the next game to make it 5-4.\n\nBut Federer was struggling again as he served to level the set, finding himself a set point down. He saved the first with an ace but Ferrer made no mistake with his second set point, converting to take the opener 6-4.\n\nFederer responded quickly in the second set, going a break up to lead 3-2 before holding for a 4-2 lead.\n\nWith Federer slowly improving his first serve, Ferrer was unable to carve out the break opportunities he had found in the first set.\n\nThe set went with serve as Federer leveled.\n\nAn early break in the decider put him in control as a weary Ferrer began to tire.\n\nSome vintage play at the net helped put Federer 4-2 up with Ferrer seemingly unable to summon a response.\n\nThe decisive break came in the seventh game, with Ferrer netting a forehand return to leave Federer 5-2 up and serving for the match.\n\nFederer promptly went in for the kill, attacking the net and opening up the court to clinch victory with a deft volley.\n\nFederer will now play another Spaniard, Roberto Bautista Agut, in the quarter-finals.

amazed he had beaten tennis superstar Rafael Nadal.\n\nThe 18-year-old from Richmond Hill, Ont. shocked himself, the crowd that roared with every point he scored, and the tennis world with his 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (4) victory over top-seeded Nadal in the third round of the Rogers Cup on Thursday night at a sold out Uniprix Stadium.\n\nShapovalov dropped to the ground and covered his face in joy and surprise as the cheers reached deafening levels after the match point fell, completing his comeback from a 3-0 deficit in the third-set tiebreaker.\n\n\"It's what I dreamed of all my life growing up, playing guys like Rafa (Nadal), Roger (Federer), Andy (Murray),\" said Shapovalov. \"You know, my dream came true today.\"\n\nThe victory put him into a quarter-final Friday against France's Adrian Mannarino, who beat Hyeon Chung 6-3,6-3.\n\nIt was one of the biggest wins in Canadian tennis history and it came at the tournament that some still call the Canadian Open.\n\nShapovalov became the youngest player to reach the tournament's quarter-finals since Bjorn Borg in 1974.\n\nHe also became the youngest quarter-finalist at a Masters Series tournament ever and is the youngest to beat a player ranked in the top two in the world since Nadal beat Federer in 2004 in Miami.\n\nShapovalov will reach his goal of moving into the top 100 in the world in a week that saw him save four match points in a first round win over Rogerio Dutra Silva, then beat 2009 U.S. Open winner Juan Martin Del Potro in the second round before toppling Nadal.\n\n\"I'm very thankful that I'm in this position,\" said Shapovalov, who had hockey great Wayne Gretzky and Olympic swimming star Penny Oleksiak cheering for him from the seats. \"If I didn't save those four match points in the first round, there wouldn't even be a chance to play Juan Martin or Rafa.\n\n\"It's difficult to say how I was feeling during the match. It was extremely hard physically and mentally. Rafa is such a warrior. I'm just so happy to come out with the win.\"\n\nNadal, who could have claimed the No. 1 ranking if he had reached the semifinals this week, said it was the worst match he played all year, but he had kind words for Shapovalov.\n\n\"He played well,\" the 31-year-old said. \"He has a great potential.\n\n\"I wish him the best. He has everything to become a great player. He played with the right determination in the important moments.\"\n\nShapovalov looked unfazed in facing the biggest opponent of his young career. After Nadal cruised through the first set, Shapovalov kept battling, breaking service while taking a 3-0 lead in the second. When Nadal would start taking a control of a game, the younger of the two lefthanders would respond with big serves or impressive forehands down the lines.\n\nNadal fought off two break points to hold serve at 4-2, then earned his own break to win back the momentum from the 2016 Wimbledon junior boys champion, only to see Shapovalov snatch it back and clinch the second set.\n\nThe two held serve through the third. Nadal went up 3-0, but Shapovalov used two aces to fight back and complete the upset victory over the 10-time French Open champion.\n\nSecond-seeded Roger Federer, a 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 winner over Spain's David Ferrer, isn't one to gloat over his stunning record against Spaniard, who was ranked third in the world in 2013.\n\nWithout playing especially well, the 19-time Grand Slam champion from Switzerland stretched his career record against the Ferrer to 17-0. It started with a win in Vienna in 2003.\n\n\"Maybe in the beginning he was not as good as he is now,\" Federer said of Ferrer. \"Maybe I won five times because I'm better than he was.\n\n\"I was No. 1 in the world. I played him on hard courts also. I didn't play him often on clay. Also, there were many tight matches, so maybe it became a mental thing for him. I have a lot of respect for David.

weeks ago, Shapovalov, ranked 143rd on the ATP Tour, was playing in tournaments on the Challenger and Futures level in rural Quebec, in places like Drummondville, Gatineau and Sherbrooke. On Thursday night, he prevailed on Center Court at Canada's biggest tennis tournament.\n\n\"I couldn't believe it actually happened,\" Shapovalov said. \"It's tough to explain the emotions that were going through my head at that moment. But it was just pure happiness.\"\n\nMen's tennis this season has been dominated by Nadal, 31, and Roger Federer, who turned 36 on Tuesday. Shapovalov, however, proved capable of handling himself on the big stage. His relentlessness and power were on display throughout the evening. Shapovalov fired nine aces compared to Nadal's two. Several of his serves topped 124 miles per hour. He hit 49 winners, more than double Nadal's 18.\n\nNadal praised Shapovalov's energy after the match.\n\n\"He played with the right determination in the important moments,\" Nadal said.\n\nNadal called it a win-win match for Shapovalov, who had beaten another Grand Slam champion, Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro of Argentina, on Wednesday.\n\nShapovalov plays Adrian Mannarino in the quarterfinals on Friday night.\n\nShapovalov, who was born in Tel Aviv but moved to Canada as an infant, started playing tennis when he was 5 at the club where his mother, Tessa Shapovalova, worked.\n\nA former professional player herself, Shapovalov's mother later opened her own tennis academy in Vaughan, Ontario, outside Toronto. It served as a base for Shapovalov, who resisted the pressure to move to the National Training Center in Montreal. His mother is still one of his coaches.\n\nAfter winning junior tournaments in Ontario, he experienced similar successes at International Tennis Federation junior events around the world. In October 2015, when he was 16, Shapovalov helped Canada secure its first Junior Davis Cup title. Seven months later, he advanced to the semifinals at the French Open junior tournament. Then at Wimbledon, he became the third Canadian to win a junior Grand Slam title, when he defeated Alex De Minaur of Australia in three sets.\n\nThis season, Shapovalov has played ATP Tour events big and small. In March he lost in the final of the Jalisco Open in Guadalajara, Mexico. He was then eliminated either in the first round or in qualifying of his next five consecutive tournaments, including the French Open. Before the Rogers Cup, Shapovalov reached the final in both of the Challenger tournaments he played, winning the title in Gatineau.\n\nNadal, similarly, reached the semifinals in boys singles at Wimbledon when he was 16. He also helped Spain to win a Junior Davis Cup title. And as a teenager Nadal also beat a top-ranked player, stunning Roger Federer in the third round of the Miami Open in 2004.\n\nAfter Thursday's match, Shapovalov tipped his cap to Nadal, now the veteran.\n\n\"He's such a warrior out there,\" said Shapovalov, who, like Nadal, plays left-handed. \"So it's honestly like a dream come true for me to beat a player like that.\"\n\nNadal, who could have returned to the No. 1 ranking by reaching the semifinals here, was asked if Shapovalov reminded him of his own journey through pro tennis.\n\n\"In my opinion it is much more easy when you are 18 than when you are 30,\" Nadal said. \"He has nothing to lose.\"", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-10-", "textEnd": 1824, "textStart": 1812}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {"liCnt": 6}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T20:00:00Z", "sim": 0.7960784435272217, "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "title": "The New York Times", "id": "91"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "20:00:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/11/sports/denis-shapovalov-rafael-nadal-rogers-cup.html", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8692687", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/12/sports/tennis/12TENNISweb/12TENNISweb-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "20:00:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

"CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nMONTREAL (AP) -- Roger Federer advanced to the semifinals of the Rogers Cup and was joined later Friday by Canadian teenager Denis Shapovalov, who followed his upset of Rafael Nadal with another three-set victory.\n\nThe 18-year-old left-hander from Richmond Hill, Ontario beat France's Adrian Mannarino 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 and awaits the winner of the late match between fourth-seeded Alexander Zverev of Germany and Kevin Anderson of South Africa.\n\nShapovalov beat 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro in the second round and then knocked off the top-seeded Nadal in a third-set tiebreaker on Thursday in the round of 16.\n\nHe broke service for a 2-1 lead in the third Friday only to hand it back in the next game, but a roar went up when Mannarino wasted a chance to put away a game point and Shapovalov jumped on the chance to break for a 5-4 lead. He leapt in the air as he closed out the match.\n\nThe second-seeded Federer continued his mastery over 12th-seeded Roberto Bautista Agut of Spain with a 6-4, 6-4 victory. The 36-year-old Swiss will next face unseeded Dutchman Robin Haase, a 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 winner over Diego Schwartzman of Argentina.\n\nFederer has won all seven career matches and taken all 16 sets against the 29-year-old Bautista Agut.\n\nHe is 1-0 against Haase after a straight-sets win in Davis Cup play in 2012.\n\nFederer said he knows Haase well from serving with him on the ATP player council and from practicing together.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to a tough match because he can serve very well and he mixes up his tactics a lot,\" Federer said. \"Sometimes he tends to just roll the ball in and use the big serve, or he uses a slice a lot and comes in.\n\n\"So I don't quite know with Robin what I'm going to get. But, as I have practiced with him quite a bit, maybe I am better prepared than if I would have never hit with him before.\"\n\nFederer broke serve for a 5-4 lead in the first set and broke again for 2-1 in the second en route to the victory in a little more than an hour. Federer was coming off a three-set win over another Spaniard, David Ferrer, against whom he is 17-0.\n\n\"My game plan worked better against Bautista Agut than against Ferrer,\" he said. \"I believe it's because I was more aggressive coming to the net.\"\n\nHaase, who upset seventh-seeded Grigor Dimitrov in the third round, reached his first career Masters Series semifinal. The 30-year-old Haase, back to 52nd in the world after battling injuries for much of his career, improved to 5-0 against 36th-ranked Schwartzman.\n\n\"I played a lot of good matches, especially against Dimitrov,\" said Haase. \"It's tough to come back and play that same level.\n\n\"I didn't, but I managed to win because I kept fighting.\"\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

the Spaniard's chances of returning to World No 1.\n\nThe 18-year-old Shapovalov, who needed a wild card to get into the tournament, continued his giant killing form at the hardcourt tournament by rallying to beat Nadal in three sets, 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7/4) on Thursday.\n\nNadal would have returned to No 1 in the world if he had defeated Shapovalov on Thursday, and then Adrian Mannarino on Friday.\n\nRafael Nadal congratulates Denis Shapovalov on his 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (4) win at Montreal Masters. AP\n\nShapovalov's stunning upset against the reigning French Open champion came as a result of some inspired tennis in front of a boisterous home crowd who cheered his every shot.\n\nShapovalov had just three wins this season coming into the tournament. He quickly got on a roll in Montreal beating Brazil's Rogerio Dutra Silva in the opening round 4-6, 7-6 (10/8), 6-4. He defeated former US Open winner Juan Martin Del Potro in the second round in straight sets 6-3 7-6 (7/4) to set up the showdown with Nadal.\n\nShapovalov won seven of the final eight points of the third set tiebreaker before closing out the match with a forehand winner down the line. He celebrated by falling onto his back then covering his face with his hands.\n\nShapovalov blasted a total of nine aces, including ones on his second serve that handcuffed Nadal. He also had seven double faults and won 67 percent of his first serve points.\n\nNadal won 77 percent of his first serve points but had just two aces and six double faults in the two hour, 45 minute center court match.\n\nElsewhere on Thursday, Roger Federer maintained his career-long winning streak over David Ferrer to advance to the quarter-finals after a three-set battle with the veteran Spaniard.\n\nFederer, 36, had never lost in 16 previous meetings with the 35-year-old Ferrer, whom he first defeated 14 years ago at the Vienna Indoor tournament.\n\nBut while Ferrer managed to take the opening set -- ending Federer's 32-set streak -- the Swiss ace raised his game to win 4-6, 6-4, 6-2.\n\n\"I actually feel really happy because I know I can play a lot better. David can play a lot better, too,\" Federer said. \"We battled, both tried to find a way to win. You know, he had a good start, I had a better finish.\"\n\nError prone\n\nA strangely error-prone Federer was unable to generate his usual fluency early on, and quickly found himself giving away early breaks to trail 4-1 in the first set.\n\nNowhere was Federer's wayward performance better illustrated than in the seventh game, when he squandered three break points at 0-40 to allow Ferrer to take a 5-2 lead.\n\nFederer held for 5-3 and looked to have clawed his way back into the set with a break of Ferrer's serve in the next game to make it 5-4.\n\nBut Federer was struggling again as he served to level the set, finding himself a set point down. He saved the first with an ace but Ferrer made no mistake with his second set point, converting to take the opener 6-4.\n\nFederer responded quickly in the second set, going a break up to lead 3-2 before holding for a 4-2 lead.\n\nWith Federer slowly improving his first serve, Ferrer was unable to carve out the break opportunities he had found in the first set.\n\nThe set went with serve as Federer leveled.\n\nAn early break in the decider put him in control as a weary Ferrer began to tire.\n\nSome vintage play at the net helped put Federer 4-2 up with Ferrer seemingly unable to summon a response.\n\nThe decisive break came in the seventh game, with Ferrer netting a forehand return to leave Federer 5-2 up and serving for the match.\n\nFederer promptly went in for the kill, attacking the net and opening up the court to clinch victory with a deft volley.\n\nFederer will now play another Spaniard, Roberto Bautista Agut, in the quarter-finals. Bautista Agut defeated France's Gael Monfils in a gruelling slugfest, winning 4-6, 7-6 (7/5), 7-6 (7/2).\n\n\"I hope that this match gives me some better rhythm and confidence against Bautista Agut, who plays actually very similar to David,\" Federer said.\n\nPublished Date: Aug 11, 2017 10:26 am | Updated Date: Aug 11, 2017 10:31 am\n\nTags :#Atp#Canadian open#Chung hyeon#David ferrer#Denis shapovalov#French open#Ga\u00ebl monfils#Juan mart\u00edn del potro#Montreal masters#Rafael nadal#Roger federer#Rogerio dutra silva#Sportstracker#Tennis", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-11", "textEnd": 4191, "textStart": 4179, "freq": 2}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T05:25:00Z", "sim": 0.7960784435272217, "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "title": "Firstpost", "id": "2530"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "05:25:00", "url": "http://www.firstpost.com/sports/montreal-masters-rafael-nadal-stunned-by-canadian-teen-denis-shapovalov-roger-federer-through-to-quarters-3918141.html", "storyUri": "eng-3353129", "id": "8542275", "image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Denis-Shapovalov-1024.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "05:25:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Federer was coming off a three-set win over another Spaniard, David Ferrer, against whom he is 17-0.\n\n\"My game plan worked better against Bautista Agut than against Ferrer,\" he said. \"I believe it's because I was more aggressive coming to the net.\"\n\nHaase, who upset seventh-seeded Grigor Dimitrov in the third round, reached his first career Masters Series semifinal. The 30-year-old Haase, back to 52nd in the world after battling injuries for much of his career, improved to 5-0 against 36th-ranked Schwartzman.\n\n\"I played a lot of good matches, especially against Dimitrov,\" said Haase. \"It's tough to come back and play that same level.\n\n\"I didn't, but I managed to win because I kept fighting.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T01:56:00Z", "sim": 0.7921568751335144, "source": {"uri": "federalnewsradio.com", "title": "Federal News Radio", "id": "9518"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "01:56:00", "url": "https://federalnewsradio.com/sports-news/2017/08/federer-canadian-teen-shapovalov-reach-semis-in-montreal/", "storyUri": "eng-3353129", "id": "8731709", "image": "https://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/APTOPIX_Montreal_Tennis_32318.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "01:56:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

He escorted Andreev onto center court, helped with the coin toss, shook hands with the players and posed for photos before the start of the match, which Nadal would win en route to claiming the event's title that year.\n\nBack to the future: that time @denis_shapo was a mascot for Rafael Nadal in 2008...#CoupeRogers pic.twitter.com/Tl4toivrGh\n\n-- Tennis TV (@TennisTV) August 11, 2017\n\nFast forward nine years and Shapovalov, now a fast-rising tennis sensation ranked No. 143 in the world, was back on the court with Nadal. Only this time, Shapovalov was Nadal's opponent. In front of a roaring hometown crowd that included Wayne Gretzky cheering him on, Shapovalov stunned top-seeded Nadal, 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4), to advance to the quarterfinals.\n\n\"It's what I dreamed of all my life growing up, playing guys like Rafa, Roger [Federer], Andy [Murray],\" Shapovalov said after the match. \"You know, my dream came true today.\"\n\n2008 - 2017. #Nadal vs. #Shapovalov, neuf ans plus tard. #CoupeRogers #RogersCup pic.twitter.com/S0E8DlhKm2\n\n-- Tennis Legend (@TennisLegende) August 11, 2017\n\nShapovalov has given Canadian tennis fans plenty to cheer about. He defeated 2009 U.S. Open champion and former top 5 player Juan Martin del Potro in the previous round and swung freely against the 15-time Grand Slam winner Nadal -- a player who Shapovalov said he \"grew up watching.\"\n\n\"I've seen [Nadal] win so many Slams,\" he said after his victory over del Potro. \"Every time I look at him, I think what a ridiculous athlete and what a ridiculous player he is. It's unbelievable to watch.\"\n\nAfter the match, a frustrated Nadal lamented his loss, saying it was \"probably the worst match of the year for me\" because of the missed opportunity to regain the world No. 1 ranking. But still the 31-year-old Spaniard had praise for his much younger opponent.\n\n\"He played well,\" Nadal said. \"He has great potential. I wish him the best. He has everything to become a great player. He played with the right determination in the important moments.\"\n\nShapovalov is among the wave of talented young players 21-and-under that the tour has promoted as the Next Gen. Two of those players -- Shapovalov and 16-year-old Felix Auger-Aliassime -- are from Canada.\n\n\"We've got so many players coming up.

Most of the gifted teens have mental advantages. They have skills and power, and know that they no one expects them to beat high-ranked players in top tournaments. Rather than worry about anything, a teenager can swing freely and apply pressure -- and on their best days, win historic upsets.\n\nOn Thursday evening in Montreal, 18-year-old Denis Shapovalov beat Rafael Nadal 3-6, 6-4, 7-6(4) for the biggest victory of his young career. He's left-handed with a strong serve, a one-handed backhand, and a forehand that he hits hard and deep. And no matter the score against Nadal, Shapovalov played aggressive. He even trailed 3-0 in the third set tiebreaker, before pummeling Nadal 7-points-to-1 the rest of the way.\n\nShapovalov, who will play in the quarterfinals Friday evening, is the youngest quarterfinalist in an ATP Masters 1000 tournament since these events began in 1990. He's also the youngest player in a Rogers Cup quarterfinal since Bjorn Borg, who was 18 when he made it here in 1974.\n\n\"I played really well in the big moments,\" Shapovalov said after the match. \"I'm not sure why. I just played really free in the tiebreaker.\"\n\nNadal knows why: It's good being young and extremely talented. Nadal was once like this. He won the French Open at age 19, the first time he entered the tournament. On a hard court as a 17-year-old, Nadal crushed Roger Federer in a Miami event for top players. Now, at the age of 30, he knows how much tennis changes in your mind as your career builds.\n\n\"In my opinion, is much more easy when you have 18 [years] than when you have 30. [Shapovalov] has nothing to lose,\" Nadal said. \"If he loses in straight sets, already he played a good tournament. If he wins, he's amazing. He won. Is amazing for him.\"\n\nNadal said the match wasn't so thrilling for him. \"Probably the worst match of the year for me,\" he said. \"When you play bad, you have to win these matches. I didn't today.\"\n\nShapovalov was born in Tel Aviv, Israel, but only lived there for nine months, when his parents -- Viktor and Tessa -- moved the family to Canada. He started playing at age 5 with his mother, who is a tennis coach. Clearly she teaches beautiful strokes and Shapovalov listened.\n\nShapovalov seems to have all the tools a player needs to succeed, but give him time -- a lot of time. Like Nadal said, playing as an up-and-coming star is easy against top-ranked players. Shapovalov is currently ranked #143 and was given a wildcard into the event.\n\nPlenty of other young players over the last generation have looked just as gifted as Shapovalov, but so far they haven't won majors and displaced the sport's five top stars: Federer, Nadal, Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic, and Stan Wawrinka. That will change one day; Father Time remains undefeated in the long run.\n\nIt's nice, though, to see an upcoming young player win against the best in the sport. If anything, it shows that tennis can still grow in terms of strategy and ability -- and that even the best can be beaten.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T19:37:00Z", "sim": 0.7921568751335144, "source": {"uri": "weeklystandard.com", "title": "Weekly Standard", "id": "9952"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "19:37:00", "url": "http://www.weeklystandard.com/denis-shapovalov-the-next-tennis-great/article/2009259", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8689683", "image": "http://www.weeklystandard.com/s3/tws15/images/twitter/tws-twitter_1024x512.png", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "19:37:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Nadal would have returned to No. 1 in the world if he had defeated Shapovalov Thursday, and then Chung Hyeon or Adrian Mannarino on Friday.\n\nShapovalov's stunning upset against the reigning French Open champion came as a result of some inspired tennis in front of a boisterous home crowd who cheered his every shot.

He defeated former US Open winner Juan Martin Del Potro in the second round in straight sets 6-3 7-6 (7/4) to set up the showdown with Nadal.\n\nShapovalov won seven of the final eight points of the third set tiebreaker before closing out the match with a forehand winner down the line. He celebrated by falling onto his back then covering his face with his hands. Shapovalov blasted a total of nine aces, including ones on his second serve that handcuffed Nadal. He also had seven double faults and won 67 percent of his first serve points.\n\nNadal won 77 percent of his first serve points but had just two aces and six double faults in the two hour, 45 minute center court match.\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T05:15:00Z", "sim": 0.7882353067398071, "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "title": "The Times of India", "id": "1185"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "05:15:00", "url": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/top-seed-nadal-upset-by-canadian-teen-shapovalov/articleshow/60014936.cms", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8541441", "image": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-60014971/60014971.jpg?68277", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "05:15:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Federer hammered five aces, made just two double faults and won 81 percent of his first serve points in the 68-minute centre court match. He dominated at the net, winning 21 of 25 points. \"It pays off playing aggressively here in Montreal, plus I feel comfortable at net, so why not spend some time there instead of slugging it out from the baseline,\" Federer said. \"I think I did a good job again, even though it was tough to control the ball. I got some decent rhythm going.\" Federer advances to the semi-finals where he will face Robin Haase of the Netherlands, who defeated Diego Schwartzman 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 earlier in the day. Bautista Agut struggled on his serve as he was broken three times and won just 65 percent of his first serve points. \"Today, I felt that I didn't get into the rhythm of the match and I didn't feel the ball well,\" he said. \"Roger plays very fast and he didn't want to rally with me, so he went for his shots.\" Federer posted his seventh consecutive win over the Spaniard and improved his season record to 34-2. He has a ATP Tour high five titles in 2017. He will face Dutchman Haas in just the second career meeting between the two. The pair met in a Davis Cup World Group play-off in 2012 with Federer winning 6-1, 6-4, 6-4. Federer's chances of winning another title this season were given a boost when top seed Rafael Nadal was upset by world No. 143 Denis Shapovalov of Canada on Thursday night.\n\nShapovalov, who needed a wild card to gain entry into the tournament, continued his cinderella run Friday by rallying to beat Frenchman Adrian Mannarino 2-6, 6-3, 6-4. Mannarino became the fourth established ATP player this week to fall at the hands of the 18-year-old lefthanded Canadian. Shapovalov's win over Mannarino came just 24 hours after he defeated 10-time French Open champion Nadal to get into the quarters. Shapovalov also upset former US Open winner Juan Martin Del Potro in the second round. Shapovalov started slowly by dropping the first set before settling into the match in the second. After a rain delay, Shapovalov broke Mannarino to take a 4-2 lead in the second set. Her served out the set in the ninth game. \"It's tough to come out and serve after a 12-minute rain delay. I knew that was a very big turning point,\" Shapovalov said. \"When I broke him I got that little bit of confidence, and I started believing in my shots again.\"\n\nHaase rallied after losing the opening set to improve to 5-0 all-time against Schwartzman. Haase has had to overcome several injuries in his career but says he is finally in a good place. \"I wasn't the player I was before my injury,\" Haase said. \"I was not as fast. I was insecure. I had a lot of problems with other injuries after. Then this kind of eats you up inside mentally. It drains you because you know you can do better. \"I've been working on it a lot in the past few years. I started to believe more and more again. My game is better.\" Fourth seeded Alexander Zverev defeated South Africa's Kevin Anderson in straight sets 7-5, 6-4 to set up a clash of rising stars with Shapovalov. Zverev, 20, is the youngest player ranked in the top 20 in the world and Shapovalov is the youngest since 1990 to reach a Masters 1000 quarter-final.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T20:52:00Z", "sim": 0.7843137383460999, "source": {"uri": "dailytimes.com.pk", "title": "dailytimes.com.pk", "id": "1244"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "20:52:00", "url": "http://dailytimes.com.pk/sports/13-Aug-17/federer-punches-ticket-to-montreal-semis", "storyUri": "eng-3353129", "id": "8842729", "image": "http://dailytimes.com.pk/static/uploads/original/070141de69237eab442c8d76e7ede6fa.jpg ", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "20:52:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Shapovalov also upset former US Open winner Juan Martin Del Potro in the second round.\n\nShapovalov started slowly by dropping the first set before settling into the match in the second. After a rain delay, Shapovalov broke Mannarino to take a 4-2 lead in the second set. Her served out the set in the ninth game.\n\n\"It's tough to come out and serve after a 12-minute rain delay. I knew that was a very big turning point,\" Shapovalov said. \"When I broke him I got that little bit of confidence, and I started believing in my shots again.\"\n\nHaase rallied after losing the opening set to improve to 5-0 all-time against Schwartzman.\n\nHaase has had to overcome several injuries in his career but says he is finally in a good place.\n\n\"I wasn't the player I was before my injury,\" Haase said. \"I was not as fast. I was insecure. I had a lot of problems with other injuries after. Then this kind of eats you up inside mentally.

But the players held serve throughout the set.\n\nNadal had a mini-break on the first point of the tiebreaker, but gave it back with a double-fault for 3-3 and Shapovalov had his first match point when Nadal netted a backhand to fall behind at 4-6.

After a rain delay, Shapovalov broke Mannarino to take a 4-2 lead in the second set. Her served out the set in the ninth game.\n\n\"It's tough to come out and serve after a 12-minute rain delay. I knew that was a very big turning point,\" Shapovalov said. \"When I broke him, I got that little bit of confidence, and I started believing in my shots again.\"\n\nHaase rallied after losing the opening set to improve to 5-0 all-time against Schwartzman.\n\nHaase has had to overcome several injuries in his career but says he is finally in a good place.\n\n\"I wasn't the player I was before my injury,\" Haase said.\n\n\"I was not as fast.

Canadian teenager Denis Shapovalov shocked top seeded Rafael Nadal to reach the quarter-finals of the ATP Montreal Masters tournament, spoiling the Spaniard's chances of returning to world number one.\n\nThe 18-year-old Shapovalov, who needed a wildcard to get into the tournament, continued his giant killing form at the hardcourt tournament by rallying to beat Nadal in three sets, 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7/4) on Thursday.\n\nNadal would have returned to No 1 in the world if he had defeated Shapovalov on Thursday, and then Chung Hyeon or Adrian Mannarino on Friday.\n\nShapovalov's stunning upset against the reigning French Open champion came as a result of some inspired tennis in front of a boisterous home crowd who cheered his every shot.\n\nShapovalov had just three wins this season coming into the tournament. He quickly got on a roll in Montreal beating Brazil's Rogerio Dutra Silva in the opening round 4-6, 7-6 (10/8), 6-4. He defeated former US Open winner Juan Martin Del Potro in the second round in straight sets 6-3 7-6 (7/4) to set up the showdown with Nadal.\n\nShapovalov won seven of the final eight points of the third set tie-breaker before closing out the match with a forehand winner down the line. He celebrated by falling onto his back then covering his face with his hands.\n\nShapovalov blasted a total of nine aces, including ones on his second serve that handcuffed Nadal. He also had seven double faults and won 67 percent of his first serve points.\n\nNadal won 77 percent of his first serve points but had just two aces and six double faults in the two hour, 45 minute centre court match.\n\nElsewhere on Thursday, Roger Federer maintained his career-long winning streak over David Ferrer to advance to the quarter-finals after a three-set battle with the veteran Spaniard.\n\nFederer, 36, had never lost in 16 previous meetings with the 35-year-old Ferrer, whom he first defeated 14 years ago at the Vienna Indoor tournament.\n\nBut while Ferrer managed to take the opening set - ending Federer's 32-set streak - the Swiss ace raised his game to win 4-6, 6-4, 6-2.\n\n\"I actually feel really happy because I know I can play a lot better. David can play a lot better, too,\" Federer said. \"We battled, both tried to find a way to win. You know, he had a good start, I had a better finish.\"\n\nA strangely error-prone Federer was unable to generate his usual fluency early on, and quickly found himself giving away early breaks to trail 4-1 in the first set.\n\nNowhere was Federer's wayward performance better illustrated than in the seventh game, when he squandered three break points at 0-40 to allow Ferrer to take a 5-2 lead.\n\nFederer held for 5-3 and looked to have clawed his way back into the set with a break of Ferrer's serve in the next game to make it 5-4.\n\nBut Federer was struggling again as he served to level the set, finding himself a set point down. He saved the first with an ace but Ferrer made no mistake with his second set point, converting to take the opener 6-4.\n\nFederer responded quickly in the second set, going a break up to lead 3-2 before holding for a 4-2 lead.\n\nWith Federer slowly improving his first serve, Ferrer was unable to carve out the break opportunities he had found in the first set.\n\nThe set went with serve as Federer leveled.\n\nAn early break in the decider put him in control as a weary Ferrer began to tire.\n\nSome vintage play at the net helped put Federer 4-2 up with Ferrer seemingly unable to summon a response.\n\nThe decisive break came in the seventh game, with Ferrer netting a forehand return to leave Federer 5-2 up and serving for the match.\n\nFederer promptly went in for the kill, attacking the net and opening up the court to clinch victory with a deft volley.\n\nFederer will now play another Spaniard, Roberto Bautista Agut, in the quarter-finals.

Roger Federer says, 'he had a good start, I had a better finish.' Photo by Glyn Kirk/AFP\n\nMONTREAL, Canada - Roger Federer maintained his career-long winning streak over David Ferrer to advance to the quarterfinals of the ATP Montreal Masters on Thursday, August 10 (Friday, August 11, Manila time), after a 3-set battle with the veteran Spaniard.\n\nFederer, 36, had never lost in 16 previous meetings with the 35-year-old Ferrer, whom he first defeated 14 years ago at the Vienna Indoor tournament.\n\nBut while Ferrer managed to take the opening set - ending Federer's 32-set streak - the Swiss ace raised his game to win 4-6, 6-4, 6-2.\n\n\"I actually feel really happy because I know I can play a lot better. David can play a lot better, too,\" Federer said. \"We battled, both tried to find a way to win. You know, he had a good start; I had a better finish.\"\n\nA strangely error-prone Federer was unable to generate his usual fluency early on, and quickly found himself giving away early breaks to trail 4-1 in the first set.\n\nNowhere was Federer's wayward performance better illustrated than in the 7th game, when he squandered 3 break points at 0-40 to allow Ferrer to take a 5-2 lead.\n\nFederer held for 5-3 and looked to have clawed his way back into the set with a break of Ferrer's serve in the next game to make it 5-4.\n\nBut Federer was struggling again as he served to level the set, finding himself set point down. He saved the first with an ace but Ferrer made no mistake with his second set point, converting to take the opener 6-4.\n\nFederer responded quickly in the second set, going a break up to lead 3-2 before holding for a 4-2 lead.\n\nWith Federer slowly improving his first serve, Ferrer was unable to carve out the break opportunities he had found in the first set.\n\nThe set went with serve as Federer levelled.\n\nAn early break in the decider put him in control as a weary Ferrer began to tire.\n\nSome vintage play at the net helped put Federer 4-2 up with Ferrer seemingly unable to summon a response.\n\nThe decisive break came in the 7th game, with Ferrer netting a forehand return to leave Federer 5-2 up and serving for the match.\n\nFederer promptly went in for the kill, attacking the net and opening up the court to clinch victory with a deft volley.\n\nFederer will now play another Spaniard, Roberto Bautista Agut, in the quarterfinals. Bautista Agut defeated France's Gael Monfils in a gruelling slugfest, winning 4-6, 7-6 (7/5), 7-6 (7/2).\n\n\"I hope that this match gives me some better rhythm and confidence against Bautista Agut, who plays actually very similar to David,\" Federer said. - Rappler.com", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-10", "textEnd": 280, "textStart": 271}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-11", "textEnd": 299, "textStart": 290}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T00:46:00Z", "sim": 0.7647058963775635, "source": {"uri": "rappler.com", "title": "Rappler", "id": "7948"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "00:46:00", "url": "http://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/other-sports/178384-federer-montreal-ferrer-downed-again", "storyUri": "eng-3353129", "id": "8726081", "image": "https://assets.rappler.com/612F469A6EA84F6BAE882D2B94A4B421/img/F08F4B20E9CB454A8DEABE269FD4395A/000_qn35d.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "00:46:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

You have to welcome being on centre court, to play against the best players and prove yourself. You can't be scared of those moments.\"\n\nIt was clear right from the start of Thursday's match that Shapovalov was anything but overwhelmed by the situation. He wasn't just there to participate against one of his childhood idols. He was there to win.\n\nShapovalov stood toe-to-toe with one of tennis' biggest sluggers, absorbed every blow, and he kept moving forward.\n\nWhen he was asked how he felt after the match, he smiled and said, \"I feel tired. I want to go to sleep.\"\n\nConsider it rest well-earned.\n\nShapovalov established himself early on in the match, opening up the court with his crossing backhand, finishing off points with forehands down the line. There was no sign of intimidation; no doubt he could handle this situation.\n\nBut his serve, which zinged in regularly at over 200 km/h, was broken in the fifth game of the match, and his spirit could've easily followed when the first set went to Nadal.\n\nBut in the 38th minute of play, Shapovalov stepped to the baseline and started the comeback that could very well change the trajectory of his career. He held serve easily and wound up a windmill fist pump after breaking Nadal to go up 2-0, en route to taking the second set in roughly 40 minutes.\n\nWhat followed in the third-and-deciding set was one of the greatest displays of will a Canadian has ever shown at this event.\n\nServing at 1-1, Shapovalov fought through 10 deuce points, saved four consecutive break points, and prevailed in a 26-point, 14-and-a-half-minute marathon of a game.\n\nAt 2-2 he saved another three break points and held on to take the lead.\n\nService holds were exchanged until Shapovalov kicked off the first point of the tiebreak.\n\nNadal took the first three points. A nervous hush filled the stadium.\n\nBut Shapovalov battled back to 3-3, and at 4-4 the blond-haired, blue-eyed wonder smashed a serve 216 km/h down the centre line and picked up his ninth ace of the match.\n\nTwo points later he became the lowest-ranked player to beat the Spaniard since Nick Kyrgios (ranked 144th at the time) took him at Wimbledon in 2014.\n\n\"I'm not happy to be part of this story,\" said Nadal, just minutes after leaving the court. \"Probably the worst loss of the year, without a doubt, for me.\"\n\nThe 31-year-old was two wins away from recapturing No. 1 in the world -- a ranking he's owned on three separate occasions, but one he hasn't had since 2014. It was unimaginable he'd be stopped in his tracks by a player who had just 10 matches of experience on the ATP World Tour prior to this tournament.\n\n\"It's what I dreamed of all my life growing up, playing guys like Rafa, Roger, Andy [Murray],\" said Shapovalov. \"My dream came true today.\"\n\nA new pursuit begins Friday, when Shapovalov faces France's Andrian Mannarino in the quarter-final.\n\nRegardless of how he fares, his arrival on tennis' biggest stage has been noted.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T05:15:00Z", "sim": 0.7607843279838562, "source": {"uri": "sportsnet.ca", "title": "Sportsnet", "id": "1184"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "05:15:00", "url": "http://www.sportsnet.ca/tennis/atp/shapovalov-shoots-star-status-win-time-great-nadal/", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8541382", "image": "http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Denis_Shapovalov3.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "05:15:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

the Rogers Cup semifinals with a 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory over France's Adrian Mannarino on Friday night.\n\nThe 18-year-old from Richmond Hill, Ont., was coming off a second-round win over 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro and a thrilling three-set upset of top-seeded tennis legend Rafael Nadal in the Round of 16.\n\nShapovalov will next meet the winner of a match later Friday between fourth-seeded Alexander Zverev of Germany and Kevin Anderson of South Africa.\n\nThe 29-year-old Mannarino had knocked out Canada's top player, Milos Raonic, in the second round, although the big-server from Thornhill, Ont., played with a swollen wrist.\n\nShapovalov started out looking low on energy despite the encouragement of the packed centre court crowd.\n\nHe double-faulted on break point in the opening game en route to a quick first-set loss.\n\nThe two lefthanders were on serve in the second when play halted 20 minutes for a light rain but the crowd sprang to life, chanting 'let's go Denis' on the changeovers as he broke serve and then served out the set.\n\nAs it was against Nadal, Shapovalov spent much of the match alternating between errors and impressive winners, consistently fighting off break points on his serve. He had nine aces and seven double faults.\n\nHe broke service for a 2-1 lead in the third only to hand it back in the next game, but a roar went up when Mannarino wasted a chance to put away a game point and Shapovalov jumped on the chance to break for a 5-4 lead. He leapt in the air as he closed out the match.\n\nSecond-seeded Roger Federer continued his mastery over 12th-seeded Roberto Bautista Agut of Spain with a 6-4, 6-4 victory. The 36-year-old Swiss will next face unseeded Dutchman Robin Haase, a 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 winner over Diego Schwartzman of Argentina.\n\nFederer has won all seven career matches and taken all 16 sets against the 29-year-old Bautista Agut.\n\nHe is 1-0 against Haase -- a straight-sets win in Davis Cup play in 2012.\n\nFederer said he knows Haase well from serving with him on the ATP player council and from practising together.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to a tough match because he can serve very well and he mixes up his tactics a lot,\" said Federer. \"Sometimes he tends to just roll the ball in and use the big serve, or he uses a slice a lot and comes in.\n\n\"So I don't quite know with Robin what I'm going to get. But, as I have practised with him quite a bit, maybe I am better prepared than if I would have never hit with him before.\"\n\nFederer broke serve for a 5-4 lead in the first set and broke again for 2-1 in the second en route to a one hour eight minute win over Bautista Agut. Federer was coming off a three-set win over another Spaniard, David Ferrer, against whom he is 17-0.\n\n\"My game plan worked better against Bautista Agut than against Ferrer,\" he said. \"I believe it's because I was more aggressive coming to the net.\"\n\nHaase, who upset seventh-seeded Grigor Dimitrov in the third round, reached his first career Masters Series semifinal. The 30-year-old Haase, back to 52nd in the world after battling injuries for much of his career, improved to 5-0 against 36th-ranked Schwartzman.\n\n\"I played a lot of good matches, especially against Dimitrov,\" said Haase. \"It's tough to come back and play that same level.\n\n\"I didn't, but I managed to win because I kept fighting.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T21:05:00Z", "sim": 0.7529411911964417, "source": {"uri": "nationalpost.com", "title": "National Post", "id": "973"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "01:30:00", "url": "http://nationalpost.com/pmn/sports-pmn/dutchman-haase-tops-schwartzman-to-reach-rogers-cup-semifinals/wcm/df3f3c6b-3f4f-4097-acae-bf948dd8ac93", "storyUri": "eng-3353129", "id": "8729826", "image": "http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/bf69214e83fdd5520e4b5d91ba3b7d64?s=200&ts=1502501447", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "21:05:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

6-3, 6-4 victory over France's Adrian Mannarino on Friday night.\n\nThe 18-year-old from Richmond Hill, Ont., was coming off a second-round win over 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro and a thrilling three-set upset of top-seeded tennis legend Rafael Nadal in the Round of 16.\n\nShapovalov will next meet the winner of a match later Friday between fourth-seeded Alexander Zverev of Germany and Kevin Anderson of South Africa.\n\nThe 29-year-old Mannarino had knocked out Canada's top player, Milos Raonic, in the second round, although the big-server from Thornhill, Ont., played with a swollen wrist.\n\nShapovalov started out looking low on energy despite the encouragement of the packed centre court crowd.\n\nHe double-faulted on break point in the opening game en route to a quick first-set loss.\n\nThe two lefthanders were on serve in the second when play halted 20 minutes for a light rain but the crowd sprang to life, chanting 'let's go Denis' on the changeovers as he broke serve and then served out the set.\n\nAs it was against Nadal, Shapovalov spent much of the match alternating between errors and impressive winners, consistently fighting off break points on his serve. He had nine aces and seven double faults.\n\nHe broke service for a 2-1 lead in the third only to hand it back in the next game, but a roar went up when Mannarino wasted a chance to put away a game point and Shapovalov jumped on the chance to break for a 5-4 lead. He leapt in the air as he closed out the match.\n\nSecond-seeded Roger Federer continued his mastery over 12th-seeded Roberto Bautista Agut of Spain with a 6-4, 6-4 victory. The 36-year-old Swiss will next face unseeded Dutchman Robin Haase, a 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 winner over Diego Schwartzman of Argentina.\n\nFederer has won all seven career matches and taken all 16 sets against the 29-year-old Bautista Agut.\n\nHe is 1-0 against Haase - a straight-sets win in Davis Cup play in 2012.\n\nFederer said he knows Haase well from serving with him on the ATP player council and from practising together.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to a tough match because he can serve very well and he mixes up his tactics a lot,\" said Federer. \"Sometimes he tends to just roll the ball in and use the big serve, or he uses a slice a lot and comes in.\n\n\"So I don't quite know with Robin what I'm going to get. But, as I have practised with him quite a bit, maybe I am better prepared than if I would have never hit with him before.\"\n\nFederer broke serve for a 5-4 lead in the first set and broke again for 2-1 in the second en route to a one hour eight minute win over Bautista Agut. Federer was coming off a three-set win over another Spaniard, David Ferrer, against whom he is 17-0.\n\n\"My game plan worked better against Bautista Agut than against Ferrer,\" he said. \"I believe it's because I was more aggressive coming to the net.\"\n\nHaase, who upset seventh-seeded Grigor Dimitrov in the third round, reached his first career Masters Series semifinal. The 30-year-old Haase, back to 52nd in the world after battling injuries for much of his career, improved to 5-0 against 36th-ranked Schwartzman.\n\n\"I played a lot of good matches, especially against Dimitrov,\" said Haase. \"It's tough to come back and play that same level.\n\n\"I didn't, but I managed to win because I kept fighting.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {"liCnt": 5}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T01:46:00Z", "sim": 0.7529411911964417, "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "title": "The Globe and Mail", "id": "1409"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "01:46:00", "url": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/tennis/shapovalovs-magic-run-continues-as-canadian-teen-reaches-rogers-cup-semifinals/article35976057/", "storyUri": "eng-3353129", "id": "8730865", "image": "https://static.theglobeandmail.ca/41e/sports/tennis/article35976056.ece/ALTERNATES/w620/web-sp-te-men-0811.JPG", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "01:46:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

It's going to take time - and much more experience - for the youngest player ranked in the top 150 in the world to climb his way up to the pinnacle of the sport.\n\nBut the will the 18-year-old displayed - saving four match points in the second set before earning a service break at 3-3 in the third and putting his foot on the gas pedal to close out the match - is a sign he has what it takes to one day become a champion.\n\nWayne Gretzky is a believer.\n\nOne of the greatest hockey players of all time brought his family to Montreal to spend some time with Shapovalov, and he stuck around to cheer him on in Tuesday's match.\n\n\"I think he has ice in his veins,\" Gretzky told the Sportsnet on-site panel. \"I think he's one of those guys who's going to love the pressure and take on that responsibility.\"\n\nOn centre court, in front of family, friends, the Gretzkys and a stadium full of Canadian tennis fans, Shapovalov showed it.\n\n\"It's great to have guys like this around my matches watching me, keeping an eye out for me\" he said.\n\nShapovalov took to the surface wearing a red shirt, blue shorts and white sneakers with blue laces, and it wasn't long before he was striping the lines yellow with serves north of 200 km/h, top-spinning forehands and thunderous one-handed backhands.\n\nIf there was one thing the lefty made clear with his performance, it's that he oozes talent. His 12 aces and 38 winners in Tuesday's two-hour, 26-minute session were a testament to the fact.\n\nHowever there were moments when Shapovalov's inexperience got the better of him. For example, he broke Dutra Silva early in the first set but then he gifted the break right back in the very next game - at love, no less - with some curiously aggressive shots that found their way outside the lines.\n\nLater on he had the advantage of serving to open the second-set tiebreak and blew the first point with a loose shot that landed beyond the opposing baseline. It was one of 47 unforced errors he made.\n\nHe then deepened the hole by netting two forehands to give Dutra Silva his first two match points.\n\nBut he contrasted those undisciplined moments with a confidence that bordered on arrogance, stepping into the court on nearly every shot and upping the pace on his groundstrokes in moments that might have summoned conservatism from someone else.\n\n\"I play as aggressive as possible,\" Shapovalov said.\n\nGretzky outlined what's behind that style of play.\n\n\"I think the biggest thing of all is, first of all, you have to have the confidence in yourself and I think you have to believe in yourself that you can be successful,\" said the NHL's all-time leading goal-scorer and point-getter.\n\nNone of that was lacking on Shapovalov's side of the court, in spite of the fact that he served at 50 per cent for the match and admittedly struggled to find his best game throughout.\n\n\"I thought I could win the whole time,\" he said. \"I mean, I never lost faith.\"\n\nThe Richmond Hill, Ont., native knows he'll have to bring that confidence to the court on Wednesday, with a 2:30pm start scheduled against the world's No. 31 player in Argentina's Juan Martin Del Potro.\n\n\"I have to play really well,\" said Shapovalov. \"It's going to be an extremely tough match. But I live for these moments. I live to be in these matches.\"\n\nThere's reason to believe it won't be long before this kid is on the winning side of most of those matches.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-09T00:37:00Z", "sim": 0.7529411911964417, "source": {"uri": "sportsnet.ca", "title": "Sportsnet", "id": "1184"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "00:37:00", "url": "http://www.sportsnet.ca/tennis/canadian-denis-shapovalovs-potential-front-centre-rogers-cup/", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8087566", "image": "http://assets3.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shapovalov_denis1280.jpg", "date": "2017-08-09", "time": "00:37:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-09"}

I knew that was a very big turning point,\" Shapovalov said. \"When I broke him I got that little bit of confidence, and I started believing in my shots again.\"\n\nHaase rallied after losing the opening set to improve to 5-0 all-time against Schwartzman.\n\nHaase has had to overcome several injuries in his career but says he is finally in a good place.\n\n\"I wasn't the player I was before my injury,\" Haase said. \"I was not as fast. I was insecure. I had a lot of problems with other injuries after. Then this kind of eats you up inside mentally.

record a stunning upset victory over top seed Rafael Nadal in the third round of the Rogers Cup on Thursday.\n\nThe lanky wild card kissed the Montreal court after completing a rousing 3-6 6-4 7-6(4) triumph as the 18-year-old became the youngest player to ever reach the quarter-finals of an ATP Masters 1000 event.\n\nThe early exit also denied world number two Nadal a chance to take over from the absent Andy Murray at the top of the rankings, a position the Spaniard would have regained for the first time since 2014 had he advanced to the semi-finals.\n\nShapovalov showed no sign of nerves in their first ever meeting, the left-hander playing the more aggressive tennis by utilising his huge forehand on roundhouse swings and frequently attacking the net.\n\nThe teenager's quixotic bid looked doomed in the third set tiebreaker when he fell 3-0 behind but the world number 143 refused to buckle and only coughed up one more point in the decider.\n\nAs a reward for his unlikely victory, the 2016 Wimbledon junior champion will next face 29-year-old Frenchman Adrian Mannarino in the quarter-finals on Friday.\n\nREAD: Nadal, Federer win opening matches at Rogers Cup\n\nElsewhere, world number three Roger Federer dropped his first set since June but the Swiss recovered to dispatch Spaniard David Ferrer 4-6 6-4 6-2 in their last 16 meeting.\n\nFederer was sloppy from the outset on centre court, sending routine forehands wide and providing the underdog Ferrer with early break opportunities in the Montreal encounter.\n\nFerrer capitalised by winning the opener to end Federer's streak of 32 consecutive sets won, a record that dates back to his defeat to Tommy Haas at the Stuttgart Open on June 14.\n\n\"He had a good start, I had a better finish,\" Federer told reporters after the match.\n\nFrustration boiled over for the Australian Open and Wimbledon champion in the second set after he misfired with an overhead smash.\n\nFederer, who turned 36 this week, responded by hitting a ball into the stands, earning a reprimand but no official ball abuse call from the umpire.\n\nThe outburst appeared to steady the Swiss, whose serve and overall accuracy improved as the two-hour match progressed.\n\nFerrer has now lost all of his 17 contests against Federer, who is also vying to take the world number one spot from the injured Murray.\n\nNext up for Federer is a quarter-final against 12th-seeded Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut, who defeated Frenchman Gael Monfils 4-6 7-6(5) 7-6(2) in a marathon tussle.\n\nIn other tournament action, American Jared Donaldson lost to Diego Schwartzman 0-6 7-5 7-5, while his countryman Sam Querrey was thrashed 6-4 6-1 by Kevin Anderson of South Africa.\n\nAustralian Nick Kyrgios fell 6-4 6-3 to fourth seed Alexander Zverev as the German finally claimed victory over his opponent in their third meeting of the season.\n\n(Reporting by Rory Carroll in Los Angeles; Editing by John O'Brien)\n\nFor more sports coverage, visit

But Nadal struggled to get the ball to Shapovalov's backhand and didn't have an answer for the Canadian's blistering forehand winners. Nadal described it as the worst loss of the season for him for a number of reasons.\n\nShapovalov, who is ranked 143rd in the world, quickly got on a roll in Montreal, beating Brazil's Rogerio Dutra Silva in the opening round 4-6, 7-6 (10/8), 6-4. He then defeated former US Open winner Juan Martin Del Potro in the second round in straight sets 6-3 7-6 (7/4) to set up the showdown with Nadal.\n\n\"It is incredible. I can't even talk right now. I grew up watching Rafa so just to be able to compete with him is one thing but to come out winning is a dream come true for me.\"\n\nNadal won 77 percent of his first serve points, but had just two aces and six double faults in the two hour, 45 minute center court match. This is a setback for Nadal in the buildup to the US Open starting Aug.t 28 but he still has a chance to regain No. 1.\n\n\"The worst thing is playing bad in matches that really matter,\" Nadal said. \"You have to win these matches. I didn't today. I have another week in Cincinnati and then I have the Grand Slam coming.\"\n\nElsewhere on Thursday, Roger Federer maintained his career-long winning streak over David Ferrer with a 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 victory to reach the quarterfinals after a three-set battle with the veteran Spaniard.\n\nIn other matches Thursday, Germany's Alexander Zverev defeated Nick Kyrgios 6-4, 6-3, Roberto Bautista outlasted Gael Monfils 4-6, 7-6 (7/5), 7-6 (7/2) and Kevin Anderson of South Africa cruised past Sam Querrey 6-4, 6-1. -- AFP", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T03:17:00Z", "sim": 0.7450980544090271, "source": {"uri": "saudigazette.com.sa", "title": "Saudi Gazette", "id": "5204"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "03:17:00", "url": "http://saudigazette.com.sa/article/514939/Sports/Rafael-Nadal", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8737440", "image": "http://saudigazette.com.sa/uploads/images/2017/08/11/461464.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "03:17:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Not only did he win, but all of the accomplished players in his section of the draw went out to less-accomplished ones. On Thursday something like that happened on the other half of the draw. The result is that #Roger Federer has now picked up what should be a routine draw to the 2017 Rogers Cup final in Montreal.\n\nFirstly, Federer did his part on Thursday as he defeated David Ferrer. The line score in that match was 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 with the Spaniard at least getting Federer's attention in the match. Ferrer had won Bastad on clay a little while ago so there may be something in his game right now that has been absent for a couple of years.\n\nBut Federer improved to 17-0 against the Spaniard in booking a quarter-final spot in Montreal with ambitions of winning the title this weekend.\n\n\"I already beat other players 17 times,\" said Federer after the match. \"Sometimes I played them maybe 30 or 40 times. They ended up beating me at a certain stage, like Roddick, Gonzalez, and Soderling. Sometimes I beat them ten times in a row. In the end, they always ended up beating me. That's why I have a lot of respect for this match today. I know it can't continue that way. 17 is a lot\" (qtd. at the ATP's website).\n\nGael Monfils went out in Federer's half, meaning that the Swiss Maestro will next face Roberto Bautista-Agut. That's another Spaniard that just hasn't been able to solve Federer in the past. In six previous matches not only is Bautista-Agut 0-6, but he is winless in all sets played (14 sets to love).\n\nBautista-Agut's last match against Federer was not one sided as he took Federer to two tiebreakers back in Miami. He'll be looking to make things competitive again as he looks like the last player that might keep Federer from the final.\n\nShould Federer advance to the semifinals, then he would face either Diego Schwartzman or Robin Haase. The former took out third-seeded Dominic Thiem earlier this week. Meanwhile the latter upset Grigor Dimitrov on Thursday. Neither Schwartzman nor Haase has ever beaten Federer in four compiled matches. That means that the players remaining in Federer's path to the final are 0-10 against the Swiss.\n\nThey are also 1-24 in sets played against him, an egregious compiled record between them. The three of them combined have played 25 sets against Federer with just Schwartzman managing to win a set against the current World No. 3. The two tiebreakers that Bautista-Agut forced earlier this year, both won by Federer, are the only ones to be played in the 25 sets. Not only has Federer dominated the players that are in his path to the final, but he has in fact utterly dominated them. #Roberto Bautista Agut", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-10T23:37:00Z", "sim": 0.7411764860153198, "source": {"uri": "us.blastingnews.com", "title": "Blasting News", "id": "6890"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "08:48:00", "url": "http://us.blastingnews.com/sports/2017/08/roger-federer-picks-up-a-dream-draw-to-2017-rogers-cup-final-001923179.html", "storyUri": "eng-3353129", "id": "8571865", "image": "http://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2017/8/11/660x290/b_1433x630/roger-federer-of-switzerland-wikimedia-commons-wikimediaorg_1502041.jpg", "date": "2017-08-10", "time": "23:37:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Roberto Bautista Agut. -- Reuters picMONTREAL, Aug 11 -- World number three Roger Federer dropped his first set since June yesterday but recovered to dispatch Spaniard David Ferrer 4-6 6-4 6-2 at their last 16 meeting in the Rogers Cup.\n\nFederer was sloppy from the start on centre court, sending routine forehands wide and providing the underdog Ferrer with early break opportunities in the ATP 1000 event in Montreal.\n\nFerrer capitalised by winning the first set to end Federer's streak of 32 consecutive sets won, a record that dates back to his defeat by Tommy Haas at the Stuttgart Open on June 14.\n\nFrustration boiled over for the Swiss in the second set after he misfired with an overhead smash.\n\nFederer, who turned 36 this week, responded by hitting a ball into the stands, earning a scolding but no official ball abuse call from the umpire.\n\nThe outburst appeared to steady the Swiss, whose serve and overall accuracy improved as the two-hour match progressed.\n\nFerrer has now lost all of his 17 contests against Federer, who is vying to take the world number one spot from injured Briton Andy Murray.\n\nNext up for Federer is a quarter-final against 12th-seeded

"MONTREAL - Canada's Denis Shapovalov advanced to the Rogers Cup semifinals with a 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory over France's Adrian Mannarino on Friday night.\n\nThe 18-year-old from Richmond Hill, Ont., was coming off a second-round win over 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro and a thrilling three-set upset of top-seeded tennis legend Rafael Nadal in the Round of 16.\n\nShapovalov will next meet the winner of a match later Friday between fourth-seeded Alexander Zverev of Germany and Kevin Anderson of South Africa.\n\nStory continues below\n\nThe 29-year-old Mannarino had knocked out Canada's top player, Milos Raonic, in the second round, although the big-server from Thornhill, Ont., played with a swollen wrist.\n\nREAD MORE: Canadian teenager Denis Shapovalov upsets Rafael Nadal at Rogers Cup\n\nShapovalov started out looking low on energy despite the encouragement of the packed centre court crowd.\n\nHe double-faulted on break point in the opening game en route to a quick first-set loss.\n\nThe two lefthanders were on serve in the second when play halted 20 minutes for a light rain but the crowd sprang to life, chanting 'let's go Denis' on the changeovers as he broke serve and then served out the set.\n\nAs it was against Nadal, Shapovalov spent much of the match alternating between errors and impressive winners, consistently fighting off break points on his serve. He had nine aces and seven double faults.\n\nHe broke service for a 2-1 lead in the third only to hand it back in the next game, but a roar went up when Mannarino wasted a chance to put away a game point and Shapovalov jumped on the chance to break for a 5-4 lead. He leapt in the air as he closed out the match.\n\nWATCH ABOVE: Canadian teen Denis Shapovalov stuns Rafael Nadal at Rogers Cup\n\nSecond-seeded Roger Federer continued his mastery over 12th-seeded Roberto Bautista Agut of Spain with a 6-4, 6-4 victory. The 36-year-old Swiss will next face unseeded Dutchman Robin Haase, a 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 winner over Diego Schwartzman of Argentina.\n\nFederer has won all seven career matches and taken all 16 sets against the 29-year-old Bautista Agut.\n\nHe is 1-0 against Haase -- a straight-sets win in Davis Cup play in 2012.\n\nFederer said he knows Haase well from serving with him on the ATP player council and from practising together.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to a tough match because he can serve very well and he mixes up his tactics a lot,\" said Federer. \"Sometimes he tends to just roll the ball in and use the big serve, or he uses a slice a lot and comes in.\n\n\"So I don't quite know with Robin what I'm going to get. But, as I have practiced with him quite a bit, maybe I am better prepared than if I would have never hit with him before.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Shapovalov downs Del Potro at Rogers Cup\n\nFederer broke serve for a 5-4 lead in the first set and broke again for 2-1 in the second en route to a one hour eight minute win over Bautista Agut. Federer was coming off a three-set win over another Spaniard, David Ferrer, against whom he is 17-0.\n\n\"My game plan worked better against Bautista Agut than against Ferrer,\" he said. \"I believe it's because I was more aggressive coming to the net.\"\n\nHaase, who upset seventh-seeded Grigor Dimitrov in the third round, reached his first career Masters Series semifinal. The 30-year-old Haase, back to 52nd in the world after battling injuries for much of his career, improved to 5-0 against 36th-ranked Schwartzman.\n\n\"I played a lot of good matches, especially against Dimitrov,\" said Haase. \"It's tough to come back and play that same level.\n\n\"I didn't, but I managed to win because I kept fighting.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T01:50:00Z", "sim": 0.7372549176216125, "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "title": "Global News", "id": "501"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "01:50:00", "url": "http://globalnews.ca/news/3664934/canadas-denis-shapovalov-advances-to-semifinals-after-downing-mannarino/", "storyUri": "eng-3353129", "id": "8731183", "image": "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/pch138420042_high.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=650&h=414&crop=1", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "01:50:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

He broke many of the cardinal rules of execution against No. 2 seed Rafael Nadal, including hitting off his back foot and unloading while falling backward. Nevertheless, the rockets he fired kept flying true and landing for glowing winners. Individual beads of perspiration dripped from strands of long white-blond hair streaming from the back of his cap, which of course was worn backward.\n\nAn homage to Lleyton Hewitt, whom he resembles in so many ways? Not really. Shapovalov is 18 years old, and the unwritten rule is that you have to wear the hat that way until at least 21.\n\nThe Canadian pulled off an upset for the ages on a sultry Thursday night at the Rogers Cup in Montreal. He knocked out Nadal in every sense of the term, halting the reconstructed Spaniard's drive to reclaim the No. 1 ranking. It was an utterly unexpected result, and Shapovalov reacted exactly the same way all kids his age do after accomplishing something of that magnitude. He said he grew up dreaming of playing the likes of Nadal and Roger Federer, and announced, \"You know, my dream came true today.\"\n\nWas this a preview of Shapovalov's future, or a one-off event that will make good fodder for the grandchildren?\n\nTrue, the Russian-born teenager (he was a one when his family moved to Canada) was lucky to escape four match points in his first-round contest against Rogerio Dutra Silva. But he backed up that escape with an upset of former Grand Slam champion Juan Martin del Potro. The way he mastered Nadal suggests that Shapovalov isn't likely to pinch himself on Friday and discover that he really had been dreaming all along.\n\nShapovalov cracked 49 winners in the see-sawing, two-hour and 45 minute match that ended in a tiebreaker (3-6, 6-4, 7-6 [4]). His lefty serve was effective against his fellow southpaw, brutally so at times. He kept Nadal off balance with his serve selection and hit nine aces to Nadal's two.\n\nShapovalov's shot selection and execution was bold and unrestrained throughout. He knew he needed to take big cuts at every ball that afforded the opportunity. That's an easy task to set, but a difficult one to execute. But Shapovalov trusted his game (including his sizzling one-handed backhand), even on those occasions when he found himself dangling precariously on the brink of the abyss. Instead of waiting to be rescued, he pulled himself out hand-over-hand.\n\n\"It's so tough [to play Nadal],\" Shapovalov told reporters after the match. \"A lot of the times he just hits a shot that's way too good. I was managing to get a lot back when I could. But you could tell why he has won so many Grand Slams. His ball was just so heavy. He's such a warrior out there.\"\n\nBut Nadal was no more a warrior than his Canadian opponent, who was down 0-3 in the decisive tiebreaker. Shapovalov reeled off seven of the next eight points and fittingly ended the match with a forehand blast that Nadal couldn't even lunge for.\n\n\"I wish him the best,\" Nadal told reporters after the match. \"He has everything to become a great player. He played with the right determination in the important moments.\"\n\nAt 18 and three months, Shapovalov became the youngest-ever quarterfinalist in a top-tier ATP Masters 1000 event. Ranked No. 143 at the start of the event, he is projected to crack the top 100 and could jump into the mid 60s if he wins his next match against No. 42 ranked Frenchman Adrian Mannarino. It's an easily conceivable scenario.\n\nShapovalov's win adds to the proliferating number of signs that suggest a fleet of young players (collectively known as the #NextgenATP) is ready to push out the old guard.\n\nEverywhere you turn these days, a 21-and-under player seems to be counting coup on a respected veteran. At this tournament alone, seeds David Goffin, Richard Gasquet, and Lucas Pouille were taken out by Shapovalov's peers.\n\nThe current transition might even be over before Shapovalov tries wearing his ball cap bill forward.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T16:26:00Z", "sim": 0.7372549176216125, "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "title": "ESPN.com", "id": "4"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "16:26:00", "url": "http://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/20312787", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8660099", "image": "http://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0811%2Fr242725_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "16:26:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

record a stunning upset victory over top seed Rafael Nadal in the third round of the Rogers Cup on Thursday.\n\nThe lanky wild card kissed the Montreal court after completing a rousing 3-6 6-4 7-6(4) triumph as the 18-year-old became the youngest player to ever reach the quarter-finals of an ATP Masters 1000 event.\n\nThe early exit also denied world number two Nadal a chance to take over from the absent Andy Murray at the top of the rankings, a position the Spaniard would have regained for the first time since 2014 had he advanced to the semi-finals.\n\nShapovalov showed no sign of nerves in their first ever meeting, the left-hander playing the more aggressive tennis by utilising his huge forehand on roundhouse swings and frequently attacking the net.\n\nThe teenager's quixotic bid looked doomed in the third set tiebreaker when he fell 3-0 behind but the world number 143 refused to buckle and only coughed up one more point in the decider.\n\nAs a reward for his unlikely victory, the 2016 Wimbledon junior champion will next face 29-year-old Frenchman Adrian Mannarino in the quarter-finals on Friday.\n\nElsewhere, world number three Roger Federer dropped his first set since June but the Swiss recovered to dispatch Spaniard David Ferrer 4-6 6-4 6-2 in their last 16 meeting.\n\nFederer was sloppy from the outset on centre court, sending routine forehands wide and providing the underdog Ferrer with early break opportunities in the Montreal encounter.\n\nFerrer capitalised by winning the opener to end Federer's streak of 32 consecutive sets won, a record that dates back to his defeat to Tommy Haas at the Stuttgart Open on June 14.\n\n\"He had a good start, I had a better finish,\" Federer told reporters after the match.\n\nFrustration boiled over for the Australian Open and Wimbledon champion in the second set after he misfired with an overhead smash.\n\nFederer, who turned 36 this week, responded by hitting a ball into the stands, earning a reprimand but no official ball abuse call from the umpire.\n\nThe outburst appeared to steady the Swiss, whose serve and overall accuracy improved as the two-hour match progressed.\n\nFerrer has now lost all of his 17 contests against Federer, who is also vying to take the world number one spot from the injured Murray.\n\nNext up for Federer is a quarter-final against 12th-seeded Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut, who defeated Frenchman Gael Monfils 4-6 7-6(5) 7-6(2) in a marathon tussle.\n\nIn other tournament action, American Jared Donaldson lost to Diego Schwartzman 0-6 7-5 7-5, while his countryman Sam Querrey was thrashed 6-4 6-1 by Kevin Anderson of South Africa.\n\nAustralian Nick Kyrgios fell 6-4 6-3 to fourth seed Alexander Zverev as the German finally claimed victory over his opponent in their third meeting of the season.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-06-14", "textEnd": 1730, "textStart": 1723}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {},

crowd after the match.\n\nTop-seeded Rafael Nadal and No. 2 Roger Federer cruised to easy victories Wednesday in their opening matches at the Rogers Cup. \"Like I said yesterday, [Del Potro's] my idol\". \"Just to play against him is a huge honour for me\". To beat a player of this category, of this talent, it's very inspiring to me.\n\nThe win lifted Shapovalov into some rarefied company. He's the youngest player to reach the third round of this event since Mats Wilander in 1982.\n\nSwiss tennis maestro Roger Federer in action at the Rogers Cup in Montreal. When del Potro broke his serve to take a 2-0 lead in the second set, Shapovalov broke right back. He then fell behind 3-1 in the tiebreaker, but reeled off five consecutive points for a 6-3 lead. He upset No. 75 Vasek Pospisil of Vancouver in the first round on Monday. The 29-year-old double faulted twice in his first service game and had difficulty handling Federer's pinpoint serves. \"I have to adjust my game a little bit just because the bounce of the ball is so much higher here than at Wimbledon, and there's wind, which in Wimbledon we didn't have much of\". It's going to be very interesting for me to go up against him, just to see how my game style matches him.\n\nHe used the short return to push del Potro deep into the court and the Argentine was forced to throw up a defensive lob, which Shapovalov put way.\n\nDutra Silva had two match points at 6-4, but an unforced error erased one point and Shapovalov pulled even with a half-volley drop shot for a victor.\n\nThey were a boisterous bunch, having been revved up earlier in the day by two-time Rogers Cup champion Roger Federer, who played his first match in Montreal since 2011 and dismantled Canadian Peter Polansky 6-2, 6-1 in just under 53 minutes. He played his first match of the hardcourt season that leads to the U.S. Open. It was 4-4 in the second set when he served his only ace.\n\n\"Every time I look at him, I think what a ridiculous athlete and what a ridiculous player he is. But it didn't really come together as well as I would have hoped\". That will be followed by Canadian Milos Raonic, the No. 6 seed, facing France's Adrian Mannarino.\n\nThis wasn't a vintage serving game for the left-handed Shapovalov.\n\nSouth Korean 21-year-old Chung Hyeon withstood 16 aces to beat 2014 semi-finalist Feliciano Lopez 6-1, 4-6, 7-6 (7/3).\n\nCoric has won two of three prior encounters with the Spanish great, who won a 10th French Open title this year and can regain the world number one ranking with a run to the semi-finals this week.\n\nIn other results, third-seed Dominic Thiem of Austria was upset 6-4, 6-7 (7), 7-5 by Argentina's Diego Schwartzman and Fifth-seeded Kei Nishikori of Japan, a finalist a year ago, was ousted 6-7 (4), 7-6 (7), 7-5 by Gael Monfils.\n\nDenis Shapovalov showed why he's regarded as the future of Canadian tennis as he fought off four match points in a second-set tiebreaker and defeated Rogerio Dutra Silva of Brazil 4-6, 7-6 (8), 6-4 in the first round of the Rogers Cup Canadian Open tennis championships on Tuesday.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-10T10:14:00Z", "sim": 0.7333333492279053, "source": {"uri": "newburghgazette.com", "title": "newburghgazette.com", "id": "18849"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "06:19:00", "url": "http://newburghgazette.com/2017/08/10/shapovalov-beats-idol-del-potro-to-advance-at-rogers-cup/", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8548913", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-10", "time": "10:14:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Federer, who turned 36 this week, responded by hitting a ball into the stands, earning a reprimand, but no official ball abuse call from the umpire.\n\nThe outburst appeared to steady the Swiss, whose serve and overall accuracy improved as the two-hour match progressed.\n\nFerrer has now lost all of his 17 contests against Federer, who is also vying to take the world number one spot from the injured Murray.\n\nNext up for Federer is a quarter-final against 12th-seeded Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut, who defeated Frenchman Gael Monfils 4-6 7-6(5) 7-6(2) in a marathon tussle.\n\nIn other tournament action, American Jared Donaldson lost to Diego Schwartzman 0-6 7-5 7-5, while his countryman Sam Querrey was thrashed 6-4 6-1 by Kevin Anderson of South Africa.\n\nAustralian Nick Kyrgios fell 6-4 6-3 to fourth seed Alexander Zverev as the German finally claimed victory over his opponent in their third meeting of the season.\n\nAnderson will now face Zverev in the quarter-finals.\n\nReuters", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-06-14", "textEnd": 1921, "textStart": 1914}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T13:07:00Z", "sim": 0.7333333492279053, "source": {"uri": "iol.co.za", "title": "IOL", "id": "1546"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "13:07:00", "url": "https://www.iol.co.za/sport/tennis/canadian-teen-stuns-nadal-sas-anderson-marches-on-10743973", "storyUri": "eng-3353129", "id": "8619989", "image": "https://image.iol.co.za/image/1/process/620x349?source=http://ana-baobab-prod-eu-west-2.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ana/media/media/2017/08/11/1502415387792.jpg&operation=CROP&offset=0x0&resize=4429x2480", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "13:07:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

He dominated at the net, winning 21 of 25 points.\n\n\"It pays off playing aggressively here in Montreal, plus I feel comfortable at net, so why not spend some time there instead of slugging it out from the baseline,\" Federer said.\n\n\"I think I did a good job again, even though it was tough to control the ball.

He has a ATP Tour high five titles in 2017.\n\nHe will face Dutchman Haas in just the second career meeting between the two.\n\nThe pair met in a Davis Cup World Group play-off in 2012 with Federer winning 6-1, 6-4, 6-4.\n\nDenis Shapovalov of Canada celebrates after scoring a point against Adrian Mannarino of France during their ATP Rogers Cup quarter-final match, at Uniprix Stadium in Montreal, on August 11, 2017 \u00a9 GETTY/AFP / Minas Panagiotakis\n\nFederer's chances of winning another title this season were given a boost when top seed Rafael Nadal was upset by world No. 143 Denis Shapovalov of Canada on Thursday night.\n\nShapovalov, who needed a wild card to gain entry into the tournament, continued his cinderella run Friday by rallying to beat Frenchman Adrian Mannarino 2-6, 6-3, 6-4.\n\nMannarino became the fourth established ATP player this week to fall at the hands of the 18-year-old lefthanded Canadian.\n\nShapovalov's win over Mannarino came just 24 hours after he defeated 10-time French Open champion Nadal to get into the quarters. Shapovalov also upset former US Open winner Juan Martin Del Potro in the second round.\n\nShapovalov started slowly by dropping the first set before settling into the match in the second. After a rain delay, Shapovalov broke Mannarino to take a 4-2 lead in the second set. Her served out the set in the ninth game.\n\n- Shapovalov rolls on -\n\n\"It's tough to come out and serve after a 12-minute rain delay.

I was insecure. I had a lot of problems with other injuries after. Then this kind of eats you up inside mentally. It drains you because you know you can do better.\n\n\"I've been working on it a lot in the past few years. I started to believe more and more again. My game is better.\"\n\nFourth seeded Alexander Zverev defeated South Africa's Kevin Anderson in straight sets 7-5, 6-4 to set up a clash of rising stars with Shapovalov.\n\nZverev, 20, is the youngest player ranked in the top 20 in the world and Shapovalov became the youngest since 1990 when he reached the quarter-finals of the Masters 1000 event.\n\nShares", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-11", "textEnd": 184, "textStart": 169, "freq": 4}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T08:13:00Z", "sim": 0.7254902124404907, "source": {"uri": "capitalfm.co.ke", "title": "Capital News", "id": "333"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "08:59:00", "url": "http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/sports/2017/08/12/federer-punches-ticket-atp-montreal-masters-semis/", "storyUri": "eng-3353129", "id": "8768266", "image": "http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/sports/files/2017/08/e04d9d2728dcda8734f2f7ac250e0aa55a3be5cb.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "08:13:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

record a stunning upset victory over top seed Rafael Nadal in the third round of the Rogers Cup on Thursday.\n\nThe lanky wild card kissed the Montreal court after completing a rousing 3-6 6-4 7-6(4) triumph as the 18-year-old became the youngest player to ever reach the quarterfinals of an ATP Masters 1000 event.\n\nThe early exit also denied world number two Nadal a chance to take over from the absent Andy Murray at the top of the rankings, a position the Spaniard would have regained for the first time since 2014 had he advanced to the semifinals.\n\nShapovalov showed no sign of nerves in their first ever meeting, the left-hander playing the more aggressive tennis by utilising his huge forehand on roundhouse swings and frequently attacking the net.\n\nThe teenager's quixotic bid looked doomed in the third set tiebreaker when he fell 3-0 behind but the world number 143 refused to buckle and only coughed up one more point in the decider.\n\nAs a reward for his unlikely victory, the 2016 Wimbledon junior champion will next face 29-year-old Frenchman Adrian Mannarino in the quarterfinals on Friday.\n\nElsewhere, world number three Roger Federer dropped his first set since June but the Swiss recovered to dispatch Spaniard David Ferrer 4-6 6-4 6-2 in their last 16 meeting.\n\nFederer was sloppy from the outset on centre court, sending routine forehands wide and providing the underdog Ferrer with early break opportunities in the Montreal encounter.\n\nFerrer capitalised by winning the opener to end Federer's streak of 32 consecutive sets won, a record that dates back to his defeat to Tommy Haas at the Stuttgart Open on June 14.\n\n\"He had a good start, I had a better finish,\" Federer told reporters after the match.\n\nFrustration boiled over for the Australian Open and Wimbledon champion in the second set after he misfired with an overhead smash.\n\nFederer, who turned 36 this week, responded by hitting a ball into the stands, earning a reprimand but no official ball abuse call from the umpire.\n\nThe outburst appeared to steady the Swiss, whose serve and overall accuracy improved as the two-hour match progressed.\n\nFerrer has now lost all of his 17 contests against Federer, who is also vying to take the world number one spot from the injured Murray.\n\nNext up for Federer is a quarterfinal against 12th-seeded Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut, who defeated Frenchman Gael Monfils 4-6 7-6(5) 7-6(2) in a marathon tussle.\n\nIn other tournament action, American Jared Donaldson lost to Diego Schwartzman 0-6 7-5 7-5, while his countryman Sam Querrey was thrashed 6-4 6-1 by Kevin Anderson of South Africa.\n\nAustralian Nick Kyrgios fell 6-4 6-3 to fourth seed Alexander Zverev as the German finally claimed victory over his opponent in their third meeting of the season.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-06-14", "textEnd": 1727, "textStart": 1720}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {},

Nadal would have returned to No. 1 in the world if he had defeated Shapovalov Thursday, and then Chung Hyeon or Adrian Mannarino on Friday.\n\nShapovalov's stunning upset against the reigning French Open champion came as a result of some inspired tennis in front of a boisterous home crowd who cheered his every shot.\n\nShapovalov had just three wins this season coming into the tournament. He quickly got on a roll in Montreal beating Brazil's Rogerio Dutra Silva in the opening round 4-6, 7-6 (10/8), 6-4. He defeated former US Open winner Juan Martin Del Potro in the second round in straight sets 6-3 7-6 (7/4) to set up the showdown with Nadal.\n\nShapovalov won seven of the final eight points of the third set tiebreaker before closing out the match with a forehand winner down the line. He celebrated by falling onto his back then covering his face with his hands.\n\nShapovalov blasted a total of nine aces, including ones on his second serve that handcuffed Nadal. He also had seven double faults and won 67 percent of his first serve points.\n\nNadal won 77 percent of his first serve points but had just two aces and six double faults in the two hour, 45 minute center court match.\n\nElsewhere on Thursday, Roger Federer maintained his career-long winning streak over David Ferrer to advance to the quarter-finals after a three-set battle with the veteran Spaniard.\n\nFederer, 36, had never lost in 16 previous meetings with the 35-year-old Ferrer, whom he first defeated 14 years ago at the Vienna Indoor tournament.\n\nBut while Ferrer managed to take the opening set - ending Federer's 32-set streak - the Swiss ace raised his game to win 4-6, 6-4, 6-2.\n\n\"I actually feel really happy because I know I can play a lot better. David can play a lot better, too,\" Federer said. \"We battled, both tried to find a way to win.

Bautista Agut defeated France's Gael Monfils in a gruelling slugfest, winning 4-6, 7-6 (7/5), 7-6 (7/2).\n\n\"I hope that this match gives me some better rhythm and confidence against Bautista Agut, who plays actually very similar to David,\" Federer said.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T03:20:00Z", "sim": 0.7176470756530762, "source": {"uri": "sports.ndtv.com", "title": "NDTVSports.com", "id": "3506"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "06:19:00", "url": "https://sports.ndtv.com/tennis/top-seed-rafael-nadal-shocked-by-canadian-teen-denis-shapovalov-in-montreal-1736311", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8548891", "image": "https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2017-08/rafael-nadal-montreal-masters-afp_806x605_41502428666.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "03:20:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

a chance to take over from the absent Andy Murray at the top of the rankings, a position the Spaniard would have regained for the first time since 2014 had he advanced to the semi-finals.\n\nShapovalov showed no sign of nerves in their first ever meeting, the left-hander playing the more aggressive tennis by utilising his huge forehand on roundhouse swings and frequently attacking the net.\n\nThe teenager's quixotic bid looked doomed in the third set tiebreaker when he fell 3-0 behind but the world number 143 refused to buckle and only coughed up one more point in the decider.\n\nAs a reward for his unlikely victory, the 2016 Wimbledon junior champion will next face 29-year-old Frenchman Adrian Mannarino in the quarter-finals on Friday.\n\nElsewhere, world number three Roger Federer dropped his first set since June but the Swiss recovered to dispatch Spaniard David Ferrer 4-6 6-4 6-2 in their last 16 meeting.\n\nFederer was sloppy from the outset on centre court, sending routine forehands wide and providing the underdog Ferrer with early break opportunities in the Montreal encounter.\n\nFerrer capitalised by winning the opener to end Federer's streak of 32 consecutive sets won, a record that dates back to his defeat to Tommy Haas at the Stuttgart Open on June 14.\n\n\"He had a good start, I had a better finish,\" Federer told reporters after the match.\n\nFrustration boiled over for the Australian Open and Wimbledon champion in the second set after he misfired with an overhead smash.\n\nFederer, who turned 36 this week, responded by hitting a ball into the stands, earning a reprimand but no official ball abuse call from the umpire.\n\nThe outburst appeared to steady the Swiss, whose serve and overall accuracy improved as the two-hour match progressed.\n\nFerrer has now lost all of his 17 contests against Federer, who is also vying to take the world number one spot from the injured Murray.\n\nNext up for Federer is a quarter-final against 12th-seeded Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut, who defeated Frenchman Gael Monfils 4-6 7-6(5) 7-6(2) in a marathon tussle.\n\nIn other tournament action, American Jared Donaldson lost to Diego

I was insecure. I had a lot of problems with other injuries after. Then this kind of eats you up inside mentally. It drains you because you know you can do better, but actually your own body is not letting you. That took me, honestly, a couple of years to get more calm in my head, that I have to deal with it.\n\n\"I've been working on it a lot in the past few years. I started to believe more and more again. My game is better. Then I started this year winning back-to-back matches against really good players. Then you're thinking, 'OK, it might happen again.' That it happens, it's just awesome.\"\n\nSchwartzman was dejected after being outplayed in the final two sets.\n\n\"The week for me was very good, but I am now disappointed as I don't think I played well in the second and third sets,\" Schwartzman said afterward. \"I didn't play too well from the baseline, but Haase served better to get back into the match.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T01:51:00Z", "sim": 0.7058823704719543, "source": {"uri": "upi.com", "title": "UPI", "id": "149"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "01:51:00", "url": "https://www.upi.com/Sports_News/Tennis/2017/08/11/Rogers-Cup-Roger-Federer-cruises-into-semifinals/4871502502331/", "storyUri": "eng-3353129", "id": "8731272", "image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/4871502502331/2017/upi/0396268fedc81dcbc49280f517a1b68f/v2.1/Rogers-Cup-Roger-Federer-cruises-into-semifinals.jpg?lg=4", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "01:51:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

It's all about the matches at some stage.\n\n\"I'm happy I'm playing as well as I am this year on the match courts. At the end that's what matters because I spent hours and hours on the practice courts in the last year.\"\n\nNext up for the Swiss right-hander, who is seeking his third Rogers Cup title after triumphs in Toronto in 2004 and 2006, is Zverev after the fourth seed advanced with a 6-4 7-5 win over Canada's Denis Shapovalov.\n\nFederer owns a 2-1 edge against Zverev in head-to-head meetings, most recently a 6-1 6-3 win at Halle in June.\n\nZverev ended Shapovalov's magical week on his third match point when the 18-year-old, who had been the story of the tournament after a stunning run that included an upset win over world number two Rafael Nadal, sent a backhand wide.\n\nShapovalov, who was born in Israel and moved to Canada before his first birthday, had a great chance at 4-3 in the second set but failed to convert on his three break points.\n\n\"I wasn't too sharp on the big points,\" said Shapovalov, who made headlines in February for inadvertently blasting a ball into an umpire's face in a fit of rage during a Davis Cup quarter-final.\n\n\"I had a couple looks at some second serves and I missed some returns.

over unseeded Robin Haase of the Netherlands yesterday to reach his sixth final of the year and win his 16th consecutive match.\n\nHe had considering skipping the event, which would have been disastrous for the promoters with world No. 1 Andy Murray as well as Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka already out with injuries. But Federer decided to play and now has a chance to add to a tally that includes Australian Open and Wimbledon titles this year.\n\n\"I'm very happy that I've made it here,\" he said. \"It was a good decision for me. If I would have known I would have gone to the finals, I would have said 'yes' right away.\n\nSometimes you've just got to wait and see how you feel. I'm most happy that I'm actually really healthy going into the finals. I haven't wasted too much energy. I've been able to keep points short. I've been really clean at net. I think my concentration and just my playing has gone up a notch. I'm just playing better.\"\n\nFederer is looking for a third Rogers Cup title, but his first in Montreal, having won in 2004 and 2006 in Toronto. A victory would give Federer, currently ranked third in the world, one of the top two seeds at the U.S. Open beginning Aug. 28 in New York.\n\nThe 36-year-old Federer has his longest winning streak since 2012. Next up is 20-year-old Alexander Zverev, who stopped Denis Shapovalov's impressive run with a 6-4, 7-5 victory in the second semifinal.\n\nFederer has won of their three meetings, including a victory over the German on grass in June.\n\nShapovalov's tournament included consecutive wins over 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro and top-seeded Spanish star Rafael Nadal. The victories, and the shaggy- haired youngster's style and skill on the court, announced his presence not only to Canadian fans but to the tennis world.\n\n\"My whole life has changed in the past five days,\" he said. \"It's crazy how it is.\n\n\"I mean, I go from being not known to being so known in the tennis world, in Canada in general. It's going to be a little bit of a change to me. I'm going to have to adapt. But that doesn't change things. I still have to work really hard every day.\"\n\nFlag-waving fans in the packed grandstands at Uniprix Stadium were hoping for more magic, but Zverev was too strong, winning 81 percent of the points off his serve compared to 64 percent for Shapovalov.\n\nHaase, who upset seventh-seeded Grigor Dimitrov in the third round, was in his first career semifinal of a Masters Series tournament.\n\n\"I hope it gives me a lot of confidence,\" Haase said of his performance for the week. \"Next week (in Cincinnati), different conditions, different courts, so it's tournament by tournament. But, in general, to make an achievement like this is good because it shows you can do it.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-28", "textEnd": 1341, "textStart": 1334}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T07:02:00Z", "sim": 0.686274528503418, "source": {"uri": "business-standard.com", "title": "Business Standard", "id": "405"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "07:02:00", "url": "http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/federer-reaches-rogers-cup-final-117081300172_1.html", "storyUri": "eng-3353129", "id": "8882624", "image": "http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/common/no_preview.jpg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "07:02:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

on the teenage tennis phenom from Richmond Hill\n\nThe \"burden of Canada\" that Eugenie Bouchard spoke of earlier in the week at the Rogers Cup has been placed squarely on the shoulders of Denis Shapovalov. The teenage tennis phenom seems to be handling the load just fine.\n\nWhile Bouchard was speaking of up-and-comers on the women's side of the draw, there is no question Shapovalov is this week carrying the torch for all Canadian tennis players - male and female - after his upset of world No. 2 Rafael Nadal in Thursday's round of 16 in Montreal. With Bouchard and leading Canadian men's player, Milos Raonic, both eliminated, it is safe to say all eyes are on Shapovalov.\n\nThe win Thursday makes the teenager from Richmond Hill, Ont., the youngest Masters series quarter-finalist of all time, and the youngest Rogers Cup quarter-finalist since Bjorn Borg in 1974.\n\nAfter dropping the opening set to Nadal, who, with Andy Murray's withdrawal from the W&S Open next week could soon become world. No. 1, Shapovalov stormed back to win the second and third sets 6-4, 7-6 (4).\n\nIt was his second upset in as many days. On Wednesday, the 18-year-old knocked off former top-5 and 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro. He'll face the Frenchman Adrian Mannarino, world No. 42, in Friday evening's contest. Mannarino defeated Raonic earlier in the tournament.\n\nAmong Shapovalov's supporters this week has been hockey great Wayne Gretzky and Canadian Olympic swimmer Penny Oleksiak. Gretzky has been courtside for all of Shapovalov's matches, and said he believes the Canadian left-hander has what it takes to be a superstar athlete.\n\n\"The great athletes want to be at centre stage. They want to play out here and be under that microscope,\" Gretzky said during a television broadcast. \"I think he has ice in his veins and I think he's one of those guys who's going to love the pressure and take on that responsibility.\"\n\nWho is Denis Shapovalov?Who is Denis Shapovalov?\n\nFor a thorough explanation, read Rachel Brady's profile from last summer. In a nutshell, he's Canada's next big thing. Last year he won the junior Wimbledon title before making a name for himself by offing the 11th-ranked, Australian Nick Kyrgios, in the round of 64 at last year's Rogers Cup.\n\nHe is the son of Tessa and Viktor Shapovalov, who moved to Canada from Tel Aviv the same year Denis was born.\n\nTessa runs an academy in Richmond Hill, which opened in 2012. It's where Shapovalov refined his skills after he making his way onto the Tennis Canada radar at age 9. By 13, it was clear he'd need a team around him to make it to the next level.\n\nIn 2015, he was Canada's U18 national outdoor champion, and by this time last year, he'd won three Futures titles.\n\nHe popped up on the radar again in for less desirable reasons in February, when he was fined $7, 000 for smashing a ball into the eye of umpire Arnaud Gabas during a decisive Davis Cup match, ultimately costing Canada a shot at victory over Great Britain.\n\nICYMI, Denis Shapovalov hits a ball out of anger that accidentally hits the chair umpire in the eye during @daviscup pic.twitter.com/ZBadhJmnww -- Tennis Channel (@TennisChannel)\n\nFebruary 7, 2017\n\nWhat are his chances?\n\nConsidering the kind of season Nadal is having (which, going by total points, is better than anyone's, even Roger Federer), then anything is possible.\n\nIn Mannarino, Shapovalov is facing a 29-year-old left-hander whose 2017 record is 17-18. Mannarino plays his best tennis on a grass surface, where he boasts a .567 win percentage. On hard courts, he's 7-9 on the season and 75-99 for his career.\n\nShapolvalov's ATP sample size is too small to be a barometer, he has posted a 27-5 record on hard surfaces between his appearances on the Futures and Challenge tours.\n\nPrior to Nadal, he had never faced another lefty at the ATP level.

And when you consider how that came to be, you have to think some higher power is in his corner.\n\nOn Tuesday, the youngest player in the draw at the Rogers Cup staved off four match points and pushed himself into the second round with a resilient win over Brazil's Rogerio Dutra Silva. On Wednesday, he was on the court asking to be pinched by TVA's Frederique Guay after beating one of his childhood idols, Juan Martin Del Potro, in straight sets. On Thursday, he was the author of one of the most iconic moments in Canadian tennis history, beating one of the best players of all time and world No. 2 Rafael Nadal.\n\nBut what Shapovalov did on Friday night, under the lights at Stade Uniprix, beating France's Andrian Mannarino 2-6, 6-3, 6-4, was enough to make you believe in fate.\n\nIt looked like a train wreck out of the gate for the Richmond Hill, Ont., native. He was broken in both of his first two service games, he flubbed seven of eight volleys, and he airmailed more than his share of forehands into the crowd, en route to dropping the first set.\n\nMomentum was firmly on Mannarino's side when the skies opened up and light rain fell at centre court, causing a near 13-minute delay.\n\nCall it luck, or divine intervention, but that pause, at 2-2 in the second set, changed the complexion of the match entirely.\n\n\"I kind of told myself, 'This could be a really good turning point. It's giving him a little bit of time to think about his game.' He got a little bit cold. It's always tough to come out and serve after having 11, 12 minutes off,\" Shapovalov said afterwards.\n\nThe blustery wind that had, at least in part, caused Shapovalov to commit 16 unforced errors in the first set had all but died out when play resumed. His nerves calmed, his timing came together, and his opponent -- who had appeared unflappable to that point of the match -- booted his service game to give Shapovalov the lead and the momentum he wouldn't surrender until his hands were in the air in celebration of the win.\n\nIn reality -- though Shapovalov had shown his resilience in each of the previous rounds leading up to Friday's quarter-final -- the odds were stacked against him from the start.\n\nHe was the one who began the tournament as the 143rd-ranked player in the world, and beating anyone here -- including Mannarino (ranked 42) -- was going to be a crapshoot.\n\nAnd yet Shapovalov had come into the end-of-week session with external expectations heaped upon him for the first time all week. Within the span of 15 minutes, as Shapovalov fell down 4-0, the free-swinging, nothing-to-lose approach that had propelled him to orchestrate the two biggest upsets of his career had seemingly abandoned him upon the pre-match realization that this was his to win.\n\nShapovalov's coach, Martin Laurendeau, could see it coming. He attempted to ease the pressure on his player when he met with the media on Friday morning.\n\n\"Mannarino has been at this level for a number of years now, so it's going to be difficult for Denis,\" he said. \"You have to be aware that he's only 18 years old, and it's difficult mentally and physically to stay at that level.\"\n\nAnd it proved to be particularly difficult for Shapovalov against Mannarino, who tossed him a changeup after he had smashed fastballs from Del Potro and Nadal out of the ballpark.\n\nThe kid struggled against the Frenchman's counterpunching style. Seemingly every ball he striped found its way back to him, forcing him to push the envelope to win points. Impatience -- and his imprecision -- got the best of him. It looked like it was going to put his run in Montreal to an end.\n\nBut once again Shapovalov summoned something magical to dig his way out of the hole.\n\nIn the third and deciding set, after Mannarino held easily to start things off, Shapovalov had to stave off three break points to tie things up.\n\nMore adversity came when he surrendered a break directly after breaking Mannarino for a 3-2 lead.\n\nBut at 4-4, with Mannarino serving, Shapovalov returned to the well, won some gruellingly long rallies with the groundstrokes that have carried him to this point, earned two break points, and never looked back.\n\nHe served out the match with ease.\n\nNo matter what Shapovalov does on Saturday, this has already been the most successful week of his professional tennis career.\n\nBut if destiny has something to say about it, the kid who's moved up to No. 66 in the ATP rankings will have his crack at becoming the first Canadian champion at this event since 1958.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T04:02:00Z", "sim": 0.6784313917160034, "source": {"uri": "sportsnet.ca", "title": "Sportsnet", "id": "1184"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "04:02:00", "url": "http://www.sportsnet.ca/tennis/victory-mannarino-latest-example-shapovalovs-destiny/", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8740816", "image": "http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Denis_ShapovalovQF.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "04:02:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

I don't know if you can teach that, but he has that and he's making the most of it.\"\n\nShapovalov, of Richmond Hill, Ont., posted one of the biggest wins in Canadian tennis history when he battled Nadal for two hours 45 minutes on Thursday night and pulled out the victory in a third-set tiebreaker. It was a back-and-forth match, with several break points saved on both sides. Shapovalov fell behind 3-0 in the tiebreaker, but a Nadal double fault and two aces gave the youngster the match.\n\nAt no time did the left-hander show any sign of cracking under the pressure. Instead, he fed off the deafening sound from the sellout crowd of 11,000 that cheered every point he won.\n\n\"It's a bit surreal to be able to, start to finish, last that long, produce quality tennis and go toe-to-toe with a legend like that,\" said Laurendeau. \"It's just remarkable.\n\n\"I'm glad I was there to witness it. I'll remember it for a long time. It will certainly be a reference for him because he still has a lot of steps to go through. That's always going to be there for him, what he's able to do. Just continue to work towards his goal, which is being top 100, top 50, top 10 and, one day, contend for a Grand Slam.\"\n\nEven 19-time grand slam winner Roger Federer of Switzerland was impressed watching Shapovalov on television at his hotel.\n\n\"I thought it was a fantastic match,\" said Federer. \"It was exhilarating for the crowd, for the fans watching on TV, for Canadian tennis.\n\n\"I didn't expect it to be this way. I thought that Rafa was going to win in straights. Denis did a great job. I'm really happy for him. Rafa was all class. He was great. It was a good night for tennis in some ways.\"\n\nIt helped that Shapovalov had nothing to lose and could try risky shots, but so far, that seems to be part of the youngster's success. Federer first noticed it while watching the Canadian win the junior Wimbledon title in 2016.\n\n\"He was in all sorts of trouble,\" said Federer. \"He kept going for the biggest shots: forehands, backhands and serves.\n\n\"I couldn't believe what he was doing. I guess for him it's somewhat normal to do that. Obviously it's risky and doesn't always play off. Doing that on Court 4 against a journeyman is a different story than doing it on center court, but not everybody can go up to that level. It seems that Denis has an extra gear.\n\n\"I think he's going to be a wonderful player.\"\n\nLaurendeau said Shapovalov is still developing the physical and mental sides of the game. A major test came in February at a Davis Cup World Group series against Britain in Ottawa.\n\nIn a fit of anger, Shapovalov tried to smash a ball into the crowd, but instead struck chair umpire Arnaud Gabas in the face. Gabas needed surgery to repair a broken bone under his left eye. Shapovalov defaulted the match, which cost Canada the series, and was fined US$7,000 by the International Tennis Federation.\n\n\"How he's handled the February incident from the beginning was very impressive from anybody, even a veteran and a mature man, to face the consequences of what happened,\" said Laurendeau. \"I think even more so for a teenager.\n\n\"He's never shied away. The first thing on his mind was to apologize to everybody. He understood the consequences. He manned up. The biggest progress to me is that aspect -- the mental, psychological aspect of his game. I mean, tactically, technically, physically he's improved. His biggest improvement to me has been how he's competing, how he's channelling and managing his emotions.\"\n\nOnly three weeks ago, Shapovalov was winning a Challenger event -- one step below the ATP Tour -- in Gatineau, Que.\n\nHe started the week ranked 143rd in the world, but the first three wins alone put him into the top 100.\n\nShapovalov will not be an ATP regular quite yet.

over unseeded Robin Haase of the Netherlands yesterday to reach his sixth final of the year and win his 16th consecutive match.\n\nHe had considering skipping the event, which would have been disastrous for the promoters with world No. 1 Andy Murray as well as Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka already out with injuries. But Federer decided to play and now has a chance to add to a tally that includes Australian Open and Wimbledon titles this year.\n\n\"I'm very happy that I've made it here,\" he said. \"It was a good decision for me. If I would have known I would have gone to the finals, I would have said 'yes' right away.\n\nSometimes you've just got to wait and see how you feel.\n\nI'm most happy that I'm actually really healthy going into the finals. I haven't wasted too much energy. I've been able to keep points short. I've been really clean at net. I think my concentration and just my playing has gone up a notch. I'm just playing better.\"\n\nFederer is looking for a third Rogers Cup title, but his first in Montreal, having won in 2004 and 2006 in Toronto. A victory would give Federer, currently ranked third in the world, one of the top two seeds at the U.S. Open beginning Aug. 28 in New York.\n\nThe 36-year-old Federer has his longest winning streak since 2012. Next up is 20-year-old Alexander Zverev, who stopped Denis Shapovalov's impressive run with a 6-4, 7-5 victory in the second semifinal.\n\nFederer has won of their three meetings, including a victory over the German on grass in June.\n\nShapovalov's tournament included consecutive wins over 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro and top-seeded Spanish star Rafael Nadal. The victories, and the shaggy- haired youngster's style and skill on the court, announced his presence not only to Canadian fans but to the tennis world.\n\n\"My whole life has changed in the past five days,\" he said. \"It's crazy how it is.\n\n\"I mean, I go from being not known to being so known in the tennis world, in Canada in general. It's going to be a little bit of a change to me. I'm going to have to adapt. But that doesn't change things.

(Getty Images) Roger Federer used a dominant service game to beat Dutchman Robin Haase 6-3 7-6(5) in Montreal on Saturday, setting up a Rogers Cup final against German Alexander Zverev.\n\nHaase, playing in his first ATP World Tour Masters 1000 semi-final, did well to force a second-set tiebreak but Federer proved too much to handle as the Swiss fired down nine aces and dropped only nine points on serve.\n\nFederer, whose five titles this year include the Australian Open and Wimbledon, credited a positive mindset for helping him extend his winning streak to 16 matches.\n\n\"Confidence can get you a long way, and if you're feeling fine physically and you are ready to fight mentally you have a lot of things in the bag,\" said the 19-times grand slam champion.\n\n\"And then the only thing that maybe is missing is practice, but sometimes practice is overrated. It's all about the matches at some stage.\n\n\"I'm happy I'm playing as well as I am this year on the match courts. At the end that's what matters because I spent hours and hours on the practice courts in the last year.\"\n\nNext up for the Swiss right-hander, who is seeking his third Rogers Cup title after triumphs in Toronto in 2004 and 2006, is Zverev after the fourth seed advanced with a 6-4 7-5 win over Canada's Denis Shapovalov.\n\nFederer owns a 2-1 edge against Zverev in head-to-head meetings, most recently a 6-1 6-3 win at Halle in June.\n\nZverev ended Shapovalov's magical week on his third match point when the 18-year-old, who had been the story of the tournament after a stunning run that included an upset win over world number two Rafael Nadal, sent a backhand wide.\n\nShapovalov, who was born in Israel and moved to Canada before his first birthday, had a great chance at 4-3 in the second set but failed to convert on his three break points.\n\n\"I wasn't too sharp on the big points,\" said Shapovalov, who made headlines in February for inadvertently blasting a ball into an umpire's face in a fit of rage during a Davis Cup quarter-final.\n\n\"I had a couple looks at some second serves and I missed some returns. But at the end of the day he did a good job to make me play those points.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T05:22:00Z", "sim": 0.6705882549285889, "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "title": "News18", "id": "2489"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "05:22:00", "url": "http://www.news18.com/news/sports/montreal-masters-roger-federer-beats-robin-haase-to-enter-final-1490155.html", "storyUri": "eng-3353129", "id": "8875355", "image": "http://img01.ibnlive.in/ibnlive/uploads/2017/08/Roger-Federer-getty.jpg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "05:22:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

disastrous for the promoters with world No. 1 Andy Murray as well as Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka already out with injuries. But Federer decided to play and now has a chance to add to a tally that includes Australian Open and Wimbledon titles this year.\n\n\"I'm very happy that I've made it here,\" he said. \"It was a good decision for me. If I would have known I would have gone to the finals, I would have said 'yes' right away. Sometimes you've just got to wait and see how you feel. I'm most happy that I'm actually really healthy going into the finals. I haven't wasted too much energy. I've been able to keep points short. I've been really clean at net.

The victories, and the shaggy-haired youngster's style and skill on the court, announced his presence not only to Canadian fans but to the tennis world.\n\n\"My whole life has changed in the past five days,\" he said. \"It's crazy how it is.\n\n\"I mean, I go from being not known to being so known in the tennis world, in Canada in general.

final preview: Roger Federer v Alexander Zverev George BellshawSunday 13 Aug 2017 10:56 am Share this article with Facebook Share this article with Twitter Share this article with Google Plus Share this article with Whatsapp Share this article through email Share this article through sms\n\nRoger Federer will go toe-to-toe with 20-year-old hotshot Alexander Zverev in the 2017 final of the Rogers Cup in Montreal, with the Swiss looking to add a sixth title to his collection in a stunning comeback year.\n\nRafael Nadal bemoans 'worst defeat of year' as wildcard stuns world No 2\n\nAfter spending six months on the sidelines in the second half of last season, the world No. 3 has returned to his very best to take the tennis world by storm once more.\n\nHis opponent is enjoying a fine year of his own, with four titles already to his name, and he will be looking to match Federer's haul of five successes to become the joint-most trophy-laden star on the ATP Tour thus far in 2017.\n\nHere we take a look at the contest and offer a prediction as to who will come out on top...\n\nWhat's on the line?\n\nFederer is defending a simply stunning record in Masters 1000 and Grand Slam events in 2017, having played 29 matches and won them all.\n\nHowever, he has never won the Rogers Cup when it's based in Montreal, although he has won the event twice in Toronto.\n\nThe Swiss is also on a 16-match winning streak and should he extend that to 17 he will be in control of his own destiny to replace Andy Murray as world No. 1 at the Cincinnati Masters.\n\nFederer & Zverev in 2017 Current ranking\n\nFederer - 3\n\nZverev - 8\n\nTitles\n\nFederer - 5\n\nZverev - 4\n\nWin/loss ratio\n\nFederer - 35/2\n\nZverev - 45/13\n\nFourth seed Zverev is on a nine-match win streak of his own, having won the Citi Open in Washington last week and has secured qualification for the Next Gen Finals in Milan.\n\nThe German is up to third in the Race to London and looking to defend his 100% record in Masters 1000 finals, having beaten Novak Djokovic in Rome earlier this year.\n\nHow have they reached this stage?\n\nThings haven't all gone Federer's way during his time in Canada, with David Ferrer taking a set off him and Robin Haase causing him problems in the semi-finals, but the 36-year-old has still looked relatively assured in reaching the final.\n\nZverev, meanwhile, has taken out a host of well-known stars on his route to the brink of glory, beating Richard Gasquet in a tight opening match, in which he saved a match point after a 49-shot rally.\n\nSince then, he's not dropped a set during a run that saw him beat Nick Kyrgios, Kevin Anderson and 18-year-old Canadian sensation Denis Shapovalov.\n\nRoutes to Rogers Cup final\n\nFederer\n\nR1: Bye\n\nR2: 6-2 6-1 Polansky\n\nR3: 4-6 6-4 6-2 Ferrer\n\nQF: 6-4 6-4 Bautista Agut\n\nSF: 6-3 7-6 Haase\n\nZverev\n\nR1: Bye\n\nR2: 6-3 4-6 7-6 (7-3) Gasquet\n\nR3: 6-4 6-3 Kyrgios\n\nQF: 7-5 6-4 Anderson\n\nSF: 6-4 7-5 Shapovalov\n\nWhat's their head-to-head like?\n\nThe second seed leads the head-to-head 2-1 in official ATP Tour matches, although Zverev did enjoy a win in the Hopman Cup at the start of the year.\n\nFederer won their only previous meeting in a Masters 1000 match (Rome, 2016), while he also beat the German in the only time they've met in a Tour-level final (Halle, 2017).\n\nHowever, this is the first time the pair will meet on a hard court.\n\nFederer v Zverev head-to-head\n\nHead-to-head\n\nFederer 2-1 Zverev\n\nMasters 1000 head-to-head\n\nFederer 1-0 Zverev\n\nLast meeting\n\nFederer 6-1 6-3 Zverev, Halle final (2017)\n\nWho is the favourite?\n\nZverev is the youngest Coupe Rogers finalist since Djokovic lifted the title in 2007 but he is not fancied to deny Federer a 94th career ATP crown.\n\nThe Swiss will match Ivan Lendl's total in second place of trophies won in the Open Era - ranking just behind Jimmy Connors (109) - with a victory in what is his 45th Masters 1000 final.\n\nFederer is the clear favourite to win the title at 1/3, while Zverev's price is out at 5/2.\n\nRogers Cup final odds 1/3 - Federer to win\n\n5/2 - Zverev to win\n\n5/6 - Federer in 2\n\n5/1 - Zverev in 2\n\n11/4 - Federer in 3\n\n11/2 - Zverev in 3 What have they said?\n\nZverev: 'I think he's definitely the favourite. He's been playing amazing tennis. He pretty much won every single big tournament he played this year. But, you know, I played in five finals this year. I won four. The one that I lost was against Roger. There's a reason for it. I'm happy to be in the final. I'll try to enjoy as much as I can.'\n\nFederer: 'I'm happy - most happy that I'm actually really healthy going into the finals. I haven't wasted too much energy. I've been able to keep points short. I've been really clean at net. I think my concentration and just my playing has gone up a notch. I'm just playing better.'\n\nPrediction?\n\nZverev has enjoyed a great year so far but no man has looked more comfortable at the top of tennis than Federer.\n\nThe fear factor surrounding the Swiss is close to an all-time high and it's virtually impossible to back against right now.\n\nHopefully the German can put in a better showing than his one-sided defeat to the 19-time Grand Slam champion in Halle earlier this season but it remains likely he'll end up on the losing side here.\n\nPrediction: Federer in 2\n\nMORE: Roger Federer has named his eighth Wimbledon trophy Arthur - and the reason is perfect", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-13", "textEnd": 97, "textStart": 86}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T09:58:00Z", "sim": 0.6666666865348816, "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "title": "Metro.co.uk", "id": "218"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "09:58:00", "url": "http://metro.co.uk/2017/08/13/rogers-cup-2017-final-preview-roger-federer-v-alexander-zverev-6848877/", "storyUri": "eng-3353129", "id": "8898968", "image": "https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/800797464.jpg?quality=80&strip=all", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "09:58:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

semi-finals of the Rogers Cup in Montreal with a 6-4, 6-4 victory over Spain's Roberto Bautista-Agut here.\n\nAlthough the 12th-seeded Spaniard managed to make the score of both sets respectable, Federer was much sharper than in his Thursday round-of-16 match against Spain's David Ferrer and never appeared threatened throughout the one-hour, eight-minute contest on Friday, reports Efe.\n\nThe 36-year-old, whose titles at the Australian Open and Wimbledon -- the 18th and 19th of his legendary career -- have made him the story of the 2017 tennis season, squandered a service-break lead early in the second set when he was broken for the lone time in the match.\n\nBut he broke Bautista-Agut's serve in the ensuing game and never looked back.\n\n\"I struggled against Ferrer early on, so today was better.

Here's what went on....\n\nRoger Federer v Roberto Bautista Agut\n\nRoger Federer booked his place in the semi-finals of the Montreal Masters with a dominant and routine 6-4 6-4 victory over Spain's Bautista Agut on Friday.\n\nFederer had beaten another Spaniard, David Ferrer, 4-6 6-4 6-2 to book his place in the quarter-finals, while Bautista Agut had got past Frenchman Gael Monfils 4-6 7-6 7-6.\n\nA tight start to the match went to serve for the first eight games leaving it 4-4, but Federer picked up the first break in the ninth game, repeatedly attacking Bautista Agut's second serves to the point at which the Spaniard double faulted to hand the Swiss the break.\n\nFederer took the opening with both hands as he ruthlessly served out the set in the next game with ease, clinching it 6-4.\n\nThe 36-year-old began the second set in confident form, with Bautista Agut struggling to handle Federer's returns and giving away far too many unforced errors.\n\nFederer duly went a break up in the very first game, clinching it by lashing a trademark backhand across the court which Bautista Agut couldn't deal with.\n\nBautista Agut showed great character to break straight back as Federer made just one first serve in the second game, but that was as good as it got for the Spaniard for the rest of the set.\n\nFederer proceeded to force the third break of serve in a row, stepping up and into Bautista Agut's shots and finishing them with lethal power to move 2-1 ahead.\n\nThe next game saw Federer serve out four straight points, with Bautista Agut on the backfoot on each occasion, but the 29-year-old recovered to hold in the next game to leave the scores 3-2.\n\nAfter two key unforced errors, Federer survived two break points to recover to deuce, and then served out two more points to go 4-2 ahead.\n\nBautista Agut twice held serve but crucially could not fire a shot on Federer's service game, who calmly dispatched the Spaniard on each occasion to seal the victory.\n\nRobin Haase v Diego Schwartzman\n\nEarlier in the night, Haase booked his passage through to the first Masters 1000 event semi-final in his career after defeating Argentine Diego Schwartzman 4-6 6-3 6-2.\n\nThe 30-year-old Dutchman had seen off seventh seed Grigor Dimitrov 7-6 4-6 6-1 in the last round, while Schwartzman had also won in three sets against 20-year-old American Jared Donaldson 0-6 7-5 7-5.\n\nThe tension was palpable as both players sought to make a bit of history in their careers, and it looked as if Schwartzman would make a slow start again as he did against Donaldson.\n\nThe 24-year-old saved a couple of break points to eventually serve out the opening game, however, before the pair traded breaks over the next couple of games.\n\nWith little to choose between the payers, it was to be Hasse who would blink first in the opening set, and in the most crucial of games at 5-4 down.\n\nHaving adopted a distinctly defensive approach, the Dutchman appeared to panic when Schwartzman applied pressure to get on top of him in the 10th game.\n\nHaase saved one set point with an ace, but had no reply to Schwartzman's lethal and aggressive service return thereafter, clinching the first set 6-4.\n\nIn the second set, Schwartzman was the first to drop a game, and it was one he never should have.\n\nAt 1-1 and cruising 40-15 in the third game, the diminutive Argentine made four inexplicable unforced errors which gifted Haase the break of serve.\n\nAfter Haase held his next serve, it was a similar story in the fifth game as Schwartzman allowed the Dutchman to take command of the second set at 4-1 through his mistakes.\n\nThe spirited Argentine broke back immediately though, with Haase complaining about a disturbance in the stands, and then came the game which would decide the second set.\n\nIt last over 13 minutes long as both players passed up numerous points to win the game, which kept reverting to deuce. Haase passed up five break points, while Schwartzman missed six points to win the game before finally clinching it.\n\nAt 4-3, Schwartzman passed up a break point, allowing Haase to go 5-3 ahead, and the Dutchman closed the set out in the very next game to win it 6-3, and take the clash to a decider.\n\nHaase began the third set powerfully, racing into a 2-0 lead, after a terrific top spin lob shot clinched the break of serve in the second game.\n\nThe pair held serve in the next two games, before Schwartzmann broke Haase to get the match back to 3-2.\n\nHaase won the next two games to go 5-2 ahead however, and the next time he was serving he confirmed the set 6-2 and clinched the victory.\n\nDenis Shapovalov v Adrian Mannarino (11.30pm start)\n\nReport to follow...\n\nAlso See: Murray prospers as Nadal exits Konta slips up in Toronto ATP schedule Tennis on Sky", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T21:43:00Z", "sim": 0.6666666865348816, "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "title": "Sky Sports", "id": "709"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "21:43:00", "url": "http://www.skysports.com/tennis/news/12110/10983974/montreal-masters-round-up-roger-federer-to-face-robin-haase-in-semi-final", "storyUri": "eng-3353129", "id": "8706625", "image": "http://e1.365dm.com/17/08/150x150/skysports-roger-federer-tennis_4071490.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "21:43:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Rogers Cup in Montreal came with a possible special bonus for the 31-year-old Spaniard. But, as it turned out, in the end, not everyone in the room agreed with the fact, and it was #Denis Shapovalov, an 18-year-old Canadian, who went on recovering from a set down to stun Nadal at the end of nearly three hours of heart-stopping tennis on the center court. The outcome itself puts Federer on a favorable path, and the Swiss tennis star can even close the gap between him and Nadal thus making the upcoming event in Cincinnati a possible all-in battle of giants.\n\nEarlier this year, the young player Denis Shapovalov put himself accidentally in the spotlight due to an unfortunate event that took place in a Davis Cup rubber between Canada and Great Britain. During his encounter against Kyle Edmund, being tormented by the loss of a point, driven by an angry behavior Shapovalov hit an umpire with a full-speed ball. He was immediately disqualified, and that episode may have been a maturing experience. That time, he made it into the spotlights due to a negative background. This time, it's all about cheering and praising.\n\nAgainst Nadal, he did the match of his life, at least for now. He went on losing the opening set, and it seemed that Nadal would march his way into the quarterfinals.\n\nShapovalov had a different scenario that he applied in the next two sets. Winning the second act by 6-4, he pushed the match into a decisive third act. For the drama to be complete, it all went to a tie-break where the 18-year-old was the better man in the field. It's a stunning result, and the young Canadian will face Adrian Mannarino for a place in the semis of a Masters 1000 event.\n\nRafael Nadal lost probably the second most important match of the season after losing the Australian Open final. On the other side, Roger Federer had his own share of drama and frustration too as he barely navigated his way against David Ferrer. It was one of his worst matches of the season as he went on making a lot of unforced errors while struggling with his serve too. David Ferrer won the opening set, and Federer had to push himself to the limit to recover from that deficit. Eventually, he sealed the deal in three sets booking a clash with Roberto Bautista-Agut in the quarterfinals. #world no 1", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T08:13:00Z", "sim": 0.6627451181411743, "source": {"uri": "us.blastingnews.com", "title": "Blasting News", "id": "6890"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "10:03:00", "url": "http://us.blastingnews.com/sports/2017/08/rafael-nadal-stunned-by-new-sensation-denis-shapovalov-001921969.html", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8775129", "image": "http://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2017/8/10/660x290/b_1433x630/rafael-nadal-photo-screenshot-via-tennis-hd-channel-on-youtube_1502541.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "08:13:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

I don't know if you can teach that, but he has that and he's making the most of it.\"\n\nShapovalov, of Richmond Hill, Ont., posted one of the biggest wins in Canadian tennis history when he battled Nadal for two hours 45 minutes on Thursday night and pulled out the victory in a third-set tiebreaker. It was a back-and-forth match, with several break points saved on both sides. Shapovalov fell behind 3-0 in the tiebreaker, but a Nadal double fault and two aces gave the youngster the match.\n\nAt no time did the left-hander show any sign of cracking under the pressure. Instead, he fed off the deafening sound from the sellout crowd of 11,000 that cheered every point he won.\n\n\"It's a bit surreal to be able to, start to finish, last that long, produce quality tennis and go toe-to-toe with a legend like that,\" said Laurendeau. \"It's just remarkable.\n\n\"I'm glad I was there to witness it. I'll remember it for a long time. It will certainly be a reference for him because he still has a lot of steps to go through. That's always going to be there for him, what he's able to do. Just continue to work towards his goal, which is being top 100, top 50, top 10 and, one day, contend for a Grand Slam.\"\n\nHe said Shapovalov is still developing the physical and mental sides of the game. A major test came in February at a Davis Cup World Group series against Britain in Ottawa.\n\nIn a fit of anger, Shapovalov tried to smash a ball into the crowd, but instead struck chair umpire Arnaud Gabas in the face. Gabas needed surgery to repair a broken bone under his left eye. Shapovalov defaulted the match, which cost Canada the series, and was fined US$7,000 by the International Tennis Federation.\n\n\"How he's handled the February incident from the beginning was very impressive from anybody, even a veteran and a mature man, to face the consequences of what happened,\" said Laurendeau. \"I think even more so for a teenager.\n\n\"He's never shied away. The first thing on his mind was to apologize to everybody. He understood the consequences. He manned up. The biggest progress to me is that aspect -- the mental, psychological aspect of his game. I mean, tactically, technically, physically he's improved. His biggest improvement to me has been how he's competing, how he's channelling and managing his emotions.\"\n\nOnly three weeks ago, Shapovalov was winning a Challenger event -- one step below the ATP Tour -- in Gatineau, Que.\n\nHe started the week ranked 143rd in the world, but the first three wins alone put him into the top 100.\n\nBut he will not be an ATP regular quite yet. He is not eligible to enter next week's event in Cincinnati and will instead play a Challenger tournament in Vancouver.\n\nAfter that, he will try to qualify for the U.S. Open in New York.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T20:17:00Z", "sim": 0.6627451181411743, "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "title": "CBC News", "id": "668"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "20:33:00", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/sports/tennis/denis-shapovalov-coach-laurendeau-not-surprised-success-big-stage-1.4244264", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8696966", "image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4244289.1502481965!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/97006690.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "20:17:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Rafael Nadal, who would have regained the top ranking if he had reached the semifinals, lost to Denis Shapovalov 3-6, 6-4, 7-6(4) during third-round action on Thursday night. In front of a home Canadian crowd, Shapovalov pulled off the biggest win of his career after two hours and 45 minutes.\n\nAfter the 18-year-old broke Nadal's serve to end the second set, a wild third ensued. Shapovalov saved six break points to stay on level terms early before a stretch of routine holds led to a tiebreaker. Nadal led 3-0 but won only a single point the rest of the way and watched Shapovalov blast a forehand winner at 6-4 to wrap it up in style.\n\nShapovalov admitted afterward that he woke up in the morning in Felix Auger Aliassime's basement and the first thing he saw was a poster of Rafael Nadal on the wall. He told his friend to take it down. A little more than 12 hours later, Shapovalov took down the real Nadal.\n\nThe second-ranked Spaniard called it his worst loss of the year.\n\nIf Nadal hasn't done much losing this year, Roger Federer has done next to none. In fact, the 36-year-old Swiss has fallen only twice. Federer actually lost a set on Thursday, but he refused to go down to David Ferrer and instead prevailed 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 in one hour and 56 minutes.\n\n\"For me it was more of a struggle,\" Montreal's No. 2 seed commented. \"As you know, you don't always feel the same and each opponent is a different problem. He started very well, especially on the return on my second serve. I was not able to serve my first serve where I wanted to, and he hurt me on the second serve.\"\n\nWith the win, Federer improved to 17-0 lifetime against Ferrer.\n\n\"I already beat other players 17 times,\" Federer noted. \"Sometimes I played them maybe 30 or 40 times. They ended up beating me at a certain stages, like (Andy) Roddick, (Fernando) Gonzalez, and (Robin) Soderling. Sometimes I beat them 10 times in a row. At the end they always ended up beating me. That's why I have a lot of respect for this match today. I know it can't continue that way. Seventeen is a lot.\n\n\"The last match we played were three tight sets in Toronto, then three sets Cincinnati, and again today.

(Paul Chiasson/CP)\n\nCanadian teen tennis sensation Denis Shapovalov had the biggest win of his young career on Thursday night when he upset top-seeded Spaniard Rafael Nadal in the round of 16 at the Rogers Cup.\n\nWhile the 18-year-old Richmond Hill, Ont., native's profile -- not to mention his world ranking of 143 -- is sure to climb thanks to his success in Montreal, he's still a relatively new face on the ATP Tour.\n\nHere are five things to help Canadian tennis fans get to know the budding star:\n\nHE'S MADE HISTORY ... A FEW TIMES: The win over Nadal put Shapovalov into the quarter-finals of the Rogers Cup, making him the youngest player to advance to the tournament's final eight since Bjorn Borg in 1974. He's also the youngest quarter-finalist ever at an ATP Masters event, the highest level on the pro tour. In 2016, he became just the second Canadian to win the Wimbledon boys singles title. Filip Peliwo in 2012 was the first.\n\n--\n\nHE'S A LEFTY: Like tennis greats John McEnroe, Martina Navratilova, Jimmy Connors and Nadal, Shapovalov is left-handed. But being a southpaw may not give him the same advantage it gave some of his predecessors. Technical advances in rackets and court surfaces as well as a changes in game strategy and the rise of the two-handed backhand have levelled the playing field in recent years.\n\n--\n\nHE'S BEEN COMPARED TO ROGER FEDERER: Tennis analyst Craig O'Shannessy once described the young Canadian as \"a left-handed version of Federer, with that one-handed backhand,\" according to the Telegraph in Britain. O'Shannessy also said there is \"no ceiling\" for Shapovalov, and praised his \"great energy and rapport with the crowd.\" He's certainly made an impression this week in Montreal, with Wayne Gretzky and star swimmer Penny Oleksiak among his boosters in the stands.\n\n--\n\nHE RECENTLY CHANGED COACHES: Before the start of the season, his first full campaign as a pro, Shapovalov split with his coach Adriano Fuorivia, who he had worked with for more than four years. Canadian Davis Cup captain Martin Laurendeau was hired as his replacement. Shapovalov said earlier this year that he and Fuorivia are on good terms despite parting ways. \"Adriano thought that someone with more experience like Marty would be a good benefit to my team,\" he said. \"It was nothing that happened between us, it was just more of a decision that we made together.\"\n\n--\n\nHE'S STILL A KID: Shapovalov showed a flash of immaturity when a ball he carelessly hit in frustration during a Davis Cup match in February struck a chair umpire in the eye. He dealt with the fallout like a man however, making no excuses for the incident, saying he lost control of his emotions and behaved unprofessionally. While he apologized to the umpire, his teammates and tennis fans, the International Tennis Federation didn't let him off the hook. He was fined US$7,000.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T16:39:00Z", "sim": 0.658823549747467, "source": {"uri": "sportsnet.ca", "title": "Sportsnet", "id": "1184"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "16:39:00", "url": "http://www.sportsnet.ca/tennis/rise-get-know-rising-tennis-star-denis-shapovalov/", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8662261", "image": "http://assets3.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shapovalov_denis_win.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "16:39:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Denis Shapovalov ripped his final forehand winner past a helpless Rafael Nadal to defeat the Spaniard on Thursday night at Uniprix Stadium in one of Canada's most significant tennis achievements ever, it altered many of the important discussion points on the sport in this country.\n\nWith the constantly-injured Milos Raonic seemingly stalled (albeit in the ATP's top 10) and Eugenie Bouchard both plummeting in world rankings even further and complaining about the responsibilities of representing the Great White North, it was just about the perfect time for a new Canadian star to, in the immortal words of Ebby Calvin (Nuke) LaLoosh, announce his presence with authority.\n\nShapovalov did that at the Rogers Cup, blocking Nadal from returning to No. 1 in the world in a match that the Toronto native admitted he felt he had no chance of winning before it started.\n\nHe clinched the unthinkable come-from-behind victory by dramatically winning seven of the final eight points in the third set tiebreak, making himself the new focus of Canadian tennis at the tender age of 18. Raonic, now entering his prime at age 26, was never able to register a victory quite like that while a teenager. His biggest win so far probably came last year in the Wimbledon semifinals over Roger Federer.\n\nBut Raonic just can't stay healthy for more than a few months at a time, and bombed out of this Rogers Cup early with a wrist problem. His health has been a significant part of the reason he's so far not been able to win one of the big tournaments in his sport, either a Grand Slam event or a Masters-level tournament.\n\nHe's still Canada's best player, and still miles ahead of Shapovalov in the world rankings.\n\nBut the teenager is about to enter the top 100 with a bullet, and looks to be the next great thing in Canadian tennis. Vasek Pospisil has done great things at Davis Cup, won a Wimbledon doubles crown, at one point worked himself inside the top 30 and even played Raonic in the Rogers Cup semis four years ago, but he is no longer viewed as a anything but an occasional threat to the best singles players in the world.\n\nRead more:\n\nDenis Shapovalov upsets top seed Rafael Nadal at Rogers Cup\n\nEugenie Bouchard one and done at Wimbledon: DiManno\n\nMilos Raonic eliminated in opening match at Rogers Cup after playing through wrist injury\n\nFilip Peliwo, who won junior Wimbledon the same year Bouchard did, has been unable to get his career off the ground at all so far.\n\nBut Shapovalov, also a Wimbledon junior champ, surely has, beating Nick Kyrgios last year at the Rogers Cup and both Juan Martin del Potro and Nadal this year. He handled a disgraceful moment earlier this year in Ottawa fairly well -- he struck a chair umpire in the eye with a ball while throwing a tantrum during a Davis Cup match and was disqualified -- and showed up in Montreal with high profile supporters Wayne Gretzky and Penny Oleksiak in his box.\n\nSo Raonic is still our best. But Shapovalov, regardless of the conclusion to his Rogers Cup, is now the one everyone's talking about.\n\nBouchard, meanwhile, really put a dark cloud over the proceedings earlier in the week when, after losing in the first round again, she whined about the \"burden\" of carrying the Canadian flag into competition. It did make you wonder for a moment. Do we put too much pressure on our few tennis stars? Has it really dragged her down, inhibited her selfie-taking?\n\nThen Shapovalov arrived to utterly dismiss that kind of talk. Burden? That kid looked like he could have floated out of the stadium, and other star Canadian athletes surely noticed.\n\nWithout mentioning Bouchard by name, former Canadian national hockey team superstar Hayley Wickenheiser tweeted, \"Great match @denis_shapo!! See, it's not a burden it's a wave of Canadian energy pushing you from behind! Go for it! #rogerscup #Shapovalov\"\n\nSounds like something Gretzky would say. Or tweet, if he was a tweeter.\n\nShapovalov clearly has the fire Bouchard once did back in the days she would put temporary tattoos of Canadian flags on her face when she competed in Fed Cup. To be fair to her, we'll see how he feels about things in another five years. Tennis can be a lonely sport, and she clearly feels very alone these days.\n\nNot Shapovalov. Indeed, while he tries to catch up to Raonic, he's staying in the basement of buddy Felix Auger-Aliassime, a 17-year-old Montrealer who won the junior boys title at the U.S. Open last fall and the doubles, too, with Shapovalov as his partner. Both have come through the Tennis Canada development system, evidence that it is working to produce top talent.\n\nIndeed, there are more than a few who believe Auger-Aliassime might be even better than Shapovalov has already proven to be. We'll see about that.\n\nWhat we do know is Shapovalov looks to have a more complete game than Raonic did at the same age, with a fearsome serve, a massive forehand, a flamboyant one-handed backhand and lots of nimbleness around the court. The volleying needs work, and he's in the process of adding a slice backhand. Being a lefty, meanwhile, still comes with its advantages on tour. Just ask Nadal.\n\nRaonic has been able to rise into the top 10 with his monster serve and by working as hard as anybody in the sport to address his vulnerabilities, both through tireless effort and by assembling a top-notch team around him. And still, the top titles have proven elusive.\n\nSo Shapovalov still has lots and lots of miles to go. But he's flashy and exciting, perhaps the most exciting and outwardly passionate player Canadian tennis has produced. That personality ignited that fiasco in Ottawa earlier this year. The umpire suffered a fractured eye socket, but Shapovalov apologized publicly for his conduct and privately to the umpire, paid his $7,000 fine and has moved on. He needs to make sure that temper stays in check.\n\nThe tennis world in general was watching his win over Nadal, and so was Canada. All eyes are now squarely on Shapovalov as the one to watch.\n\nRaonic still has the ranking and that incredible serve.\n\nBut Shapovalov clearly has our undivided attention.\n\nDamien Cox is the co-host of Prime Time Sports on Sportsnet 590 The FAN.

If I would have known I would have gone to the finals, I would have said 'yes' right away. Sometimes you've just got to wait and see how you feel. I'm most happy that I'm actually really healthy going into the finals. I haven't wasted too much energy. I've been able to keep points short. I've been really clean at net. I think my concentration and just my playing has gone up a notch. I'm just playing better.\"\n\nFederer is looking for a third Rogers Cup title, but his first in Montreal, having won in 2004 and 2006 in Toronto. A victory would give Federer, currently ranked third in the world, one of the top two seeds at the U.S. Open beginning Aug. 28 in New York.\n\nThe 36-year-old Federer has his longest winning streak since 2012. Next up is 20-year-old Alexander Zverev, who stopped Denis Shapovalov's impressive run with a 6-4, 7-5 victory in the second semifinal.\n\nFederer has won of their three meetings, including a victory over the German on grass in June.\n\nShapovalov's tournament included consecutive wins over 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro and top -- seeded Spanish star Rafael Nadal. The victories, and the shaggy -- haired youngster's style and skill on the court, announced his presence not only to Canadian fans but to the tennis world.\n\n\"My whole life has changed in the past five days,\" he said. \"It's crazy how it is.\n\n\"I mean, I go from being not known to being so known in the tennis world, in Canada in general. It's going to be a little bit of a change to me. I'm going to have to adapt. But that doesn't change things. I still have to work really hard every day.\"\n\nFlag-waving fans in the packed grandstands at Uniprix Stadium were hoping for more magic, but Zverev was too strong, winning 81 percent of the points off his serve compared to 64 percent for Shapovalov.\n\n\"I hope it gives me a lot of confidence,\" Haase said of his performance for the week. \"Next week (in Cincinnati), different conditions, different courts, so it's tournament by tournament. But, in general, to make an achievement like this is good because it shows you can do it.\"", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-28", "textEnd": 1022, "textStart": 1015}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T06:18:00Z", "sim": 0.6549019813537598, "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "title": "The Hindu", "id": "241"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "06:18:00", "url": "http://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/federer-reaches-rogers-cup-final/article19485171.ece", "storyUri": "eng-3353129", "id": "8878886", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/article19485170.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ROGERSCUPTENNIS", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "06:18:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

I think it's going to be a great battle. Hopefully I can play really well.\"\n\nThere's no doubt Shapovalov delivered, breaking the 2009 U.S. Open champion early in the first set and fighting his way into a tiebreak in the second before smashing his final shot of the match to bring the crowd to its feet.\n\nThey were a boisterous bunch, having been revved up earlier in the day by two-time Rogers Cup champion Roger Federer, who played his first match in Montreal since 2011 and dismantled Canadian Peter Polansky 6-2, 6-1 in just under 53 minutes.\n\n\"Shapo-valov\" [clap, clap, clap clap clap], the fans cheered throughout the match, inspiring him to achieve his best result yet at a Rogers Cup. He reached the second round at last year's tournament in Toronto.\n\n\"Thanks so much,\" Shapovalov said to the crowd after the match. \"You guys are amazing. Honestly, I love you guys so much.\"\n\nConsider this his best experience of the year. He had won two Challenger events and an IT Futures event earlier in the season. A wild card berth at Wimbledon was certainly a highlight. But after dropping four of his first five matches on the ATP World Tour this season before arriving in Montreal, winning two matches on home soil -- one of them against one of the sport's most prolific players -- is a dream come true.\n\n\"It's got to be one of my best wins. Has to be,\" said Shapovalov. \"Like I said yesterday, [Del Potro's] my idol. First of all, just to play against him, it's a huge honour for me.

They have had contrasting seasons, with Federer winning five titles, including two Slams, whilst Ferrer has fallen down the rankings. But they have had some terrific clashes down the years, and this could be another one.\n\nRoger Federer and David Ferrer have met 16 times, and Federer has won 16 times. It's a testament to both men's longevity that their first meeting came back in 2003 in Vienna, which was a comfortable victory for Federer 6-2 6-2. In fact, it took until their seventh meeting, in the quarterfinals in Hamburg for Ferrer to win his first set, which he did in a 3-6 6-4 3-6 loss. He has pushed Federer on a couple of occasions, including in their last meeting in the final in Cincinnati in 2014. However, just as in the fifteen meetings prior to that one, Federer ultimately came away with the victory.\n\nNeither man is short of experience. Ferrer has recorded 711 wins so far in his career, and won 27 titles, including one Masters 1000 in Paris in 2012. However, even those hugely impressive numbers pale when compared with Federer's. The great Swiss has notched 1112 wins and won a staggering 93 titles. That includes a record 19 Slams and 26 Masters 1000 titles.\n\nAs the second seed Roger Federer received a bye into the second round. There he faced off against one-time hitting partner Peter Polansky, who had knocked out fellow Canadian Vasek Pospisil in the previous round. However, Polansky could offer little resistance to Federer. In their previous match in 2014, he had suffered a 6-2 6-0 hammering. It went little better for the Canadian in the rematch. Federer swiftly took the first set 6-2 and came within a point of repeating the score line from their 2014 meeting. Polansky managed to avoid that fate, holding serve down 5-0. But it did nothing but delay the inevitable as Federer comfortably served out the match in the next game to record a 6-2 6-1 win.\n\nDavid Ferrer, in contrast, has had to battle hard to reach the third round. Beginning against Kyle Edmund of Great Britain, Ferrer had to rebound from dropping the first set in a tight tiebreak. He managed to do so, pressurising the Yorkshireman's backhand and second serve. Edmund couldn't cope and surrendered the next two sets 6-3 6-4 to send Ferrer into the second round. There he clashed with American number 1 Jack Sock. Again the first set was decided by a tight tiebreak, but this time it was Ferrer who won it, coming through 9-7. Jack Sock took the second set six games to one with a flurry of forehand winners but Ferrer didn't give up the fight. He broke decisively and served out the match for a 7-6 1-6 6-3 to set up the meeting with Federer.\n\nIf there is a shot that can be hit with a tennis racquet, Federer probably can, and has, played it. His variety is rightly legendary, but his game is built around two core strengths all the same. Those are his forehand and serve, which are amongst the best in the world. His serve, though not amongst the most powerful, but its accuracy is unparalleled. Ferrer is blessed with neither Federer's weapons nor his variety. But what he does have is a dogged resilience that is perhaps unmatched by any other, and an ability to stay in rallies few others could.\n\nHis defence will have to be at its legendary best if he is to have a chance against Federer. Furthermore, he will have to keep Federer pinned back at the baseline, or he will have little chance. The one comfort Ferrer can bring into the match is his excellent return, which will allow him to neutralise more of Federer's serves than most players. It is a tactic Novak Djokovic has used with great success against Federer in the past. Unfortunately for Ferrer, he lacks Djokovic's power of the ground.\n\nConsidering Federer has won 16 times in a row against Ferrer, it's hard to go against him in this one. He is playing some of the best tennis of his life, with time seemingly having had no effect on his game. Ferrer, unfortunately, is not the player he once was. Though his will is undiminished, his legs are weaker and slower than they were during the glory years of his career when he reached as high as world number 3. If Federer could beat that Ferrer, he can surely beat this one.

After the match, Raonic said he is suffering from a left wrist injury.\n\nShapovalov will be a decided underdog when he meets top-seeded Rafael Nadal, who cruised past Croatian Borna Coric 6-1, 6-2. Even if he loses Thursday evening, Shapovalov will come out of this week with a career-high ranking in the 125 range.\n\n\"Like I said yesterday, he's my idol,\" Shapovalov said after he became the youngest Canadian to reach the third round in this tournament. \"First of all, just to play against him, it's a huge honour for me.

He's the youngest player to reach the third round of this event since Mats Wilander in 1982. And he's the youngest player to reach the final 16 of an ATP Masters 1000 event since Rafael Nadal in Miami in 2004.\n\nShapovalov showed poise beyond his years.

(Getty Images)\n\nThere's the big, bending lefty serve; \"swing it like Shapovalov,\" kids may say someday. There's the forehand that he can hit for winners crosscourt, down the line, inside out and inside in, and which never ever looks rushed. There's the one-handed backhand that he rarely gives in and slices, and which he rarely misses when he sees a crosscourt opening. There's the too-large backwards hat and the leaping energy that lets you know that, yes, while his game may look 25, he's still just 18.\n\nBut what has really set Denis Shapavolov apart this week in Montreal is what happens when he gets done leaping and comes back to earth. He slows down, collects himself and finds his best, calmest, most forceful tennis when he needs it. In Shapovalov's matches with Juan Martin del Potro on Wednesday and Rafael Nadal on Thursday, I kept waiting for the veteran Grand Slam champion to assert his authority and run away with the match. Instead, it was Shapovalov, the teenage wild card ranked outside the Top 150, who ran them off the court.\n\nShapovalov, the 2016 Wimbledon boys' champ, followed up the biggest win of his young career, over Del Potro, with a much bigger one, over Nadal, by the suitably dramatic score of 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (4). Over the last two sets, Shapovalov controlled the rallies and pushed Nadal back with his hooking serve and heavy forehand, while at the same time forcing Rafa to scramble far beyond the sidelines with both shots. Shapovalov hit nine aces and 49 winners to just 18 for Nadal; that included a 33 to 14 edge from the forehand side.\n\nBut it wasn't the number of aces or winners he hit; it was when he hit them. Up 4-1 in the second set, Shapovalov let Nadal come back to 4-4 and take a 0-30 lead in that game. The crowd that had been so noisy was quiet now; the end looked near. That is, until Shapovalov uncorked two aces down the T (something he hadn't done much of, if at all, until then), smoothly sent a forehand winner into the corner and finished the game with a nasty, slicing body serve. From there, he broke to win the second set.\n\nAgain, early in the third, it looked as if Nadal would reassert himself. Through a long, multi-deuce third game, Nadal kept forcing break points, only to watch as Shapovalov wiped them away with line-painting serves and forehands. In the stat of the night, Shapovalov saved nine of 11 break points. By the time the match reached its climactic and well-earned third-set tiebreaker, the outcome seemed inevitable -- and not in Nadal's favor.\n\nEven when Rafa went up 3-0 in the breaker, you felt like Shapovalov hadn't fired his last shot just yet. Nadal berated himself when he missed an easy backhand with a chance to go up 4-0; he knew he needed to build his lead while he still had the chance. He was right. Shapovalov, as he had all night, played his best, most settled tennis with the match on the line, hitting two aces and three forehand winners in the last seven points.\n\nFor Nadal, this was another in a long string of close losses and missed opportunities on surfaces other than clay. He spent much of the match 10 feet behind the baseline; from there, he struggled to get the ball to Shapovalov's backhand. And while the 18-year-old rookie was firing aces and winners in the breaker, the 15-time Slam champion double-faulted and smothered a hanging forehand into the net. Nadal can still reach No. 1 next week, but he could use a victory in one of these tightrope-walk matches before he gets to the U.S. Open.\n\n\"No. 1 With a Bullet\" is an old phrase that seemed appropriate again on Thursday: Nadal was going for No. 1, but it was Shapovalov, the youngest of the ATP's young guns, who was carrying the bullets.\n\n-- Citi Open Women's Semis/Final: Catch up on all the action from Citi Open on Tennis Channel Plus.\n\n-- Citi Open Men's Semis/Final: Take a look back at the best matches from the Citi Open with on demand match coverage on Tennis Channel Plus.\n\n-- Azarenka Channel: Enjoy the best moments from Victoria Azarenka on the Azarenka Channel exclusively on Tennis Channel Plus.\n\n-- Sharapova Channel: Gear up for Maria's return to next week's Cincinnati Open with the Sharapova Channel only on Tennis Channel Plus.\n\n-- Get Tennis Channel Plus for 650+ live events all year long.\n\n-- Tennis Channel Plus is available on any streaming device, on mobile, always on the GO (desktop, iOS, Android, Apple TV, Roku and Amazon Fire).

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Paul Chiasson\n\nCanadian teen tennis sensation Denis Shapovalov had the biggest win of his young career on Thursday night when he upset top-seeded Spaniard Rafael Nadal in the round of 16 at the Rogers Cup.\n\nWhile the 18-year-old Richmond Hill, Ont., native's profile -- not to mention his world ranking of 143 -- is sure to climb thanks to his success in Montreal, he's still a relatively new face on the ATP Tour.\n\nHere are five things to help Canadian tennis fans get to know the budding star:\n\nHE'S MADE HISTORY ... A FEW TIMES: The win over Nadal put Shapovalov into the quarter-finals of the Rogers Cup, making him the youngest player to advance to the tournament's final eight since Bjorn Borg in 1974. He's also the youngest quarter-finalist ever at an ATP Masters event, the highest level on the pro tour. In 2016, he became just the second Canadian to win the Wimbledon boys singles title. Filip Peliwo in 2012 was the first.\n\n--\n\nHE'S A LEFTY: Like tennis greats John McEnroe, Martina Navratilova, Jimmy Connors and Nadal, Shapovalov is left-handed. But being a southpaw may not give him the same advantage it gave some of his predecessors. Technical advances in rackets and court surfaces as well as a changes in game strategy and the rise of the two-handed backhand have levelled the playing field in recent years.\n\n--\n\nHE'S BEEN COMPARED TO ROGER FEDERER: Tennis analyst Craig O'Shannessy once described the young Canadian as \"a left-handed version of Federer, with that one-handed backhand,\" according to the Telegraph in Britain. O'Shannessy also said there is \"no ceiling\" for Shapovalov, and praised his \"great energy and rapport with the crowd.\" He's certainly made an impression this week in Montreal, with Wayne Gretzky and star swimmer Penny Oleksiak among his boosters in the stands.\n\n--\n\nHE RECENTLY CHANGED COACHES: Before the start of the season, his first full campaign as a pro, Shapovalov split with his coach Adriano Fuorivia, who he had worked with for more than four years. Canadian Davis Cup captain Martin Laurendeau was hired as his replacement. Shapovalov said earlier this year that he and Fuorivia are on good terms despite parting ways. \"Adriano thought that someone with more experience like Marty would be a good benefit to my team,\" he said. \"It was nothing that happened between us, it was just more of a decision that we made together.\"\n\n--\n\nHE'S STILL A KID: Shapovalov showed a flash of immaturity when a ball he carelessly hit in frustration during a Davis Cup match in February struck a chair umpire in the eye. He dealt with the fallout like a man however, making no excuses for the incident, saying he lost control of his emotions and behaved unprofessionally. While he apologized to the umpire, his teammates and tennis fans, the International Tennis Federation didn't let him off the hook. He was fined US$7,000.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-10", "textEnd": 170, "textStart": 155}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T16:28:00Z", "sim": 0.6509804129600525, "source": {"uri": "citynews.ca", "title": "CityNews", "id": "2068"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "16:28:00", "url": "http://www.citynews.ca/2017/08/11/on-the-rise-get-to-know-budding-tennis-rising-star-denis-shapovalov/", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8660336", "image": "http://www.citynews.ca/wp-content/blogs.dir/sites/10/2017/08/11/pch151419875_hd.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "16:28:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

He's having a great run,\" said Colin Morrell, who had traveled from Shapovalov's home province of Ontario for the event.\n\nAt just 18 years old, Shapovalov already has many other young players looking up to him following his historic upset of tennis legend Rafael Nadal.\n\n\"It's very inspiring,\" said Dalhousie University tennis player Aaron Yip. \"It shows that if he can do it, we can do it, too. We just have to work hard.\"\n\nShapovalov mania has even had an effect on ticket sales.\n\n\"Ticket sales were not so bad at the start, [but] now it's even better,\" Lapierre told Global News.\n\nHe added he's certain attendance this year will break the tournament's previous record of 213,000.\n\nREAD MORE: Canadian teenager Denis Shapovalov upsets Rafael Nadal at Rogers Cup\n\nFor many tennis fans, the icing on the cake would be a Shapovalov-Federer final.\n\n\"I don't even want to think about it -- that would be so great. It would be fantastic,\" Lapierre said. \"But let's see.

Rogers Cup on Saturday night.\n\nThe fourth-seeded Zverev, seeking a second tournament title in as many weeks, advanced to the final on Sunday against second-seeded Roger Federer, a 6-3, 7-6(5) winner over unseeded Robin Haase of the Netherlands. Federer holds a 2-1 edge in career meetings with the German, including a victory on grass in June.\n\nZverev stretched his match winning run to nine.\n\nShapovalov, who was playing Challenger-level tournaments only two weeks ago, became the youngest player to reach a Masters 1000 Series tournament with a winning run this week that included knocking off top seed Rafael Nadal and 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro.\n\nIt will raise his world ranking from 143rd to about 66th. He earned US$220,760 -- more than doubling his career prize money.\n\nFlag-waving fans in the packed grandstands at Uniprix Stadium were hoping for more magic in the battle of youngsters against the 20-year-old Zverev. But the German was too sharp, winning 81 per cent of the points off his serve compared to 64 per cent for Shapovalov.\n\nShapovalov, of Richmond Hill, Ont., held his serve through a more than 14-minute game early on, but lost it to go down 4-5 in the opening set, double faulting on break point. It was the fourth time in five matches he lost the first set, but this time there was no coming back.\n\nHe wasted two break points at 4-3 in the second, and Zverev was able to get the break for 6-5 after two Shapovalov double faults. It set up a wild final game, with Shapovalov saving two match points and Zverev erasing three break points before it ended with a misfired backhand by the Canadian.\n\nFederer reached his sixth final of the year, and will be seeking a sixth win.\n\nHe had considering skipping the event, which would have been disastrous for the promoters with world No. 1 Andy Murray as well as Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka already out with injuries. But Federer decided to play and now has a chance to add to a tally that includes Australian Open and Wimbledon titles this year.\n\n\"I'm very happy that I've made it here,\" he said. \"It was a good decision for me.\n\n\"If I would have known I would have gone to the finals, I would have said 'yes' right away. Sometimes you've just got to wait and see how you feel. I'm most happy that I'm actually really healthy going into the finals. I haven't wasted too much energy. I've been able to keep points short. I've been really clean at net. I think my concentration and just my playing has gone up a notch. I'm just playing better.\"\n\nThe second-seeded Federer is seeking a third Rogers Cup title, but his first in Montreal, having won in 2004 and 2006 in Toronto. A victory would give Federer, currently ranked third in the world, one of the top two seeds at the U.S. Open that begins Aug. 28 in New York.\n\nThe 36-year-old, coming off victories in Germany and at Wimbledon, is on a 16-match winning streak, his longest since 2012.\n\nWhoever won the other semifinal, Federer knew he would be facing a much younger opponent.\n\n\"I think those young players don't quite know what to expect, and (neither) do I, because nobody quite knows,\" said Federer. \"Even though, Zverev is a more experienced player than Shapovalov at this stage.\n\n\"It's a huge opportunity for them. It's exciting. To have a player at 18 or 20 years old in the finals of a Masters 1000 is not something we've seen very often. Very rarely, except maybe when Andy, Novak and Rafa (Nadal) were coming up. They were such great teenagers that we maybe saw it more often. Not even I probably achieved finals of a Masters 1000 at that age. It's very exciting for tennis.\n\n\"But even Zverev, same thing. I haven't played him that much yet. Never really on a hard court, except at the Hopman Cup. It will also be a good match to watch, I think.\"\n\nHaase, who upset seventh-seeded Grigor Dimitrov in the third round, was in his first career semifinal of a Masters Series tournament.\n\n\"I hope it gives me a lot of confidence,\" Haase said of his performance for the week. \"Next week (in Cincinnati), different conditions, different courts, so it's tournament by tournament. But, in general, to make an achievement like this is good because it shows you can do it.\"\n\nIn a semifinals, seventh-seeded Rohan Bopanna of India and Ivan Dodig of Croatia defeated sixth-seeded Raven Klaasen of the Netherlands and Rajeev Ram of the United States 4-6, 7-6 (8), 11-9; and fifth-seeded Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut of France downed eighth-seeded Oliver Marach of Austria and Mate Pavic of Croatia 7-5, 6-3.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-28", "textEnd": 2931, "textStart": 2924}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T02:52:00Z", "sim": 0.6509804129600525, "source": {"uri": "torontosun.com", "title": "Toronto Sun", "id": "2657"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "02:52:00", "url": "http://www.torontosun.com/2017/08/12/canadas-denis-shapovalov-falls-to-alexander-zverev-in-semifinals?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=recommend-button&utm_campaign=Canada's Denis Shapovalov falls to Alexander Zverev in semifinals", "storyUri": "eng-3353129", "id": "8864876", "image": "http://storage.torontosun.com/v1/suns-prod-images/1297982038593_LARGE_BOX.jpg?quality=80&stmp=1502592770692", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "02:52:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

The former world number one has reached the quarterfinals of the competition and will be facing Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut on Friday.\n\nFederer might have been sensational in 2017, but the Swiss was not at his impressive best when he took on David Ferrer in round three. Federer received a rude awakening as he was outplayed and beaten in the first set, but he clawed back to win the second and third to progress into the quarters.\n\nThis match might have been a perfect wake up call for Federer, who has a 33-2 record this season. With the competition expected to get tougher, Federer needs to maintain his consistency to add yet another trophy to his cabinet.\n\nFederer, even when he is not playing well, as per his standards managed to beat Ferrer, which reflects his class and confidence. He will be upbeat about this match against Agut as the former world number one has not lost a single match in his career against the Spaniard. In fact, Federer has been so dominating over Agut, who has just won two sets in his six outings against the Swiss king.\n\nRoger Federer.Minas Panagiotakis/Getty Images\n\nThere is no way Federer can take Agut lightly in the Rogers Cup, as the Spaniard has played some wonderful tennis in Montreal this week. He did not have much trouble in getting past his opponents in the first two rounds, Tim Smyczek, Ryan Harrison.\n\nAgut, when pitted against Gael Monfils, showed his true class and character as the former emerged victorious after a gritty comeback (6-4, 5-7, 6-7) to set up a date with all-time great Federer. Agut is a strong reader of the game, and he should bring all his top characteristics into play to stun Federer, and only become the third person this season to get past the star.\n\nWe will have an intriguing match in our hands if Agut can show similar character, backed with some high-quality tennis in the quarterfinals.\n\nWhere to watch live\n\nFederer vs Agut Rogers Cup match is scheduled for 2:30 pm local time, 12 am IST.\n\nIndia: TV: TEN 2.

star Alexander Zverev.\n\nThe stirring comebacks that 18-year-old Shapovalov used to become the youngest player to reach the semifinals of a Masters 1000 Series tournament died out when 20-year-old Zverev proved a little sharper and downed the Richmond Hill, Ont., lefthander 6-4, 7-5 on Saturday night.\n\nOn Saturday night, 20-year-old Alexander Zverev proved a little sharper and downed Shapovalov 6-4, 7-5.\n\nFourth-seeded Zverev, coming off a win last week in Washington, D.C., and seeking a fifth tournament win this year, will face Swiss legend Roger Federer in the final on Sunday. Federer dispatched unseeded Dutchman Robin Haase 6-3, 7-6 (5).\n\n\"Like the media was putting it, it was a dream week for me,\" said Shapovalov. \"Obviously I didn't expect it.\n\n\"I saved four match points the first round (against Rogerio Dutra Silva). I just played loose after that, just went with it. I mean, I beat one of my idols.\"\n\nIndeed, Shapovalov's run included consecutive wins over 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro and top-seeded Spanish star Rafael Nadal. The victories, and the shaggy-haired youngster's style and skill on the court, announced his presence not only to Canadian fans but to the tennis world.\n\nWith the win, his world ranking will rise from 143rd to about 67th. The US$220,760 he earned by reaching the semifinals more than doubled his career prize money.\n\n\"My whole life has changed in the past five days,\" he said. \"It's crazy how it is.\n\n\"I mean, I go from being not known to being so known in the tennis world, in Canada in general. It's going to be a little bit of a change to me. I'm going to have to adapt. But that doesn't change things. I still have to work really hard every day.\"\n\nWhen match point landed wide, Zverev told Shapovalov during handshakes at the net that the two are sure to meet again and will likely be rivals for many years. Shapovalov, the 2016 Wimbledon boys champion, hopes that is the case.\n\nZverev told Shapovalov during handshakes at the net that the two are sure to meet again and will likely be rivals for many years.\n\n\"Sascha is an unbelievable player, he's going to be a champion,\" said Shapovalov. \"Hopefully I can get there one day.\n\n\"Hopefully I can get to his level. I mean, he's still better than me. But I'll keep working hard and hopefully we could start a little bit of a rivalry.\"\n\nFederer holds a 2-1 edge in career meetings with the Zverev, including a victory over the German on grass in June.\n\nFlag-waving fans in the packed grandstands at Uniprix Stadium were hoping for more magic, but the German was too strong, winning 81 per cent of the points off his serve compared to 64 per cent for Shapovalov.\n\nShapovalov held his serve through a more than 14-minute game early on, but lost it to go down 4-5 in the opening set, double faulting on break point. It was the fourth time in five matches he lost the first set, but this time there was no coming back.\n\nHe wasted two break points at 4-3 in the second, and Zverev was able to get the break for 6-5 after two Shapovalov double faults. It set up a wild final game, with Shapovalov saving two match points and Zverev erasing three break points before it ended with a misfired backhand by the Canadian.\n\nFederer reached his sixth final of the year, and will be seeking a sixth win.\n\nFederer reached his sixth final of the year, and will be seeking a sixth win.\n\nHe had considering skipping the event, which would have been disastrous for the promoters with world No. 1 Andy Murray as well as Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka already out with injuries. But Federer decided to play and now has a chance to add to a tally that includes Australian Open and Wimbledon titles this year.\n\n\"I'm very happy that I've made it here,\" he said. \"It was a good decision for me.\n\n\"If I would have known I would have gone to the finals, I would have said 'yes' right away. Sometimes you've just got to wait and see how you feel. I'm most happy that I'm actually really healthy going into the finals. I haven't wasted too much energy. I've been able to keep points short. I've been really clean at net. I think my concentration and just my playing has gone up a notch. I'm just playing better.\"\n\nThe second-seeded Federer is seeking a third Rogers Cup title, but his first in Montreal, having won in 2004 and 2006 in Toronto. A victory would give Federer, currently ranked third in the world, one of the top two seeds at the U.S. Open that begins Aug. 28 in New York.\n\nThe 36-year-old, coming off victories in Germany and at Wimbledon, is on a 16-match winning streak, his longest since 2012.\n\nHaase, who upset seventh-seeded Grigor Dimitrov in the third round, was in his first career semifinal of a Masters Series tournament.\n\n\"I hope it gives me a lot of confidence,\" Haase said of his performance for the week. \"Next week (in Cincinnati), different conditions, different courts, so it's tournament by tournament. But, in general, to make an achievement like this is good because it shows you can do it.\"\n\nIn doubles semifinals, seventh-seeded Rohan Bopanna of India and Ivan Dodig of Croatia defeated sixth-seeded Raven Klaasen of the Netherlands and Rajeev Ram of the United States 4-6, 7-6 (8), 11-9; and fifth-seeded Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut of France downed eighth-seeded Oliver Marach of Austria and Mate Pavic of Croatia 7-5, 6-3.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-28", "textEnd": 4552, "textStart": 4545}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T12:09:00Z", "sim": 0.6470588445663452, "source": {"uri": "huffingtonpost.ca", "title": "The Huffington Post Canada", "id": "355"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "12:30:00", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/08/13/denis-shapovalov-rogers-cup-semifinals_a_23075991/", "storyUri": "eng-3353129", "id": "8914582", "image": "https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/2239x1177+0+34/resize/1200x630!/format/jpg/quality/85/http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F1b9088d468c2451c25d3fbe889124f27%2F205562814%2FRTS1BKCR.jpeg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "12:09:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

knobby-kneed Canadian boy who barely makes it up to the Spaniard's chest. It was 2008. The boy was a star-struck 9-year-old from Ontario named Denis Shapovalov.\n\nBy Friday, that boy had vaulted above his idol's shoulders.\n\nSeemingly overnight, Shapovalov secured a spot in Canadian sports history as the teen from Richmond Hill who went up against a tennis titan and didn't flinch. The world No. 143 beat the world No. 2. Denis \"the Tennis Menace\" was born. The 18-year-old's victory at the Rogers Cup in the Round of 16 wowed the tennis world (sample international headline: \"Nadal upset by Canadian teenager\"). Even Shapovalov's coach seemed a little stunned when the nearly three-hour battle on Centre Court was over.\n\n\"It's a bit surreal to be able to - start to finish - last that long, and produce quality tennis, go toe-to-toe with a legend like that,\" his coach, Martin Laurendeau, said at a news conference at Montreal's Uniprix Stadium. \"It's just remarkable.\"\n\nShapovalov's magic continued on Friday as he overcame a lacklustre opening set to defeat France's Adrian Mannarino 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 to advance to Saturday's semi-final against either Alexander Zverev or Kevin Anderson, who were facing off in the late game.\n\nShapovalov's historic run in Montreal makes him the youngest Masters series quarter- and semi-finalist in tennis history, and has earned him a spot in the constellation of the sport's rising Canadian stars.\n\nTo admirers, he offers a form of fearlessness that kept his nerves steady on Thursday after a first-set loss to Nadal, and again on Friday when facing Mannarino. His all-or-nothing approach, highlighted by nine aces and seven double faults, paid off against the conservative Mannarino, whose consistent, but light-hitting, game was in the end no match for Shapovalov's riskier ways. Tied 4-4 in the third set, Shapovalov converted a crucial break point, allowing him to serve for the match.\n\n\"He revels in that kind of an atmosphere,\" Laurendeau said. \"He's like a fish in water when you put him on a big court against a big player. I don't know if you can teach that. But he has that, and he's making the most of it.\"\n\nShapovalov served notice last summer when he won Junior Wimbledon - something Roger Federer had also done as a teen. Since then, he's had some notable wins earned as a wild-card at ATP events, beating No. 19 Nick Kyrgios at the 2016 Rogers Cup in Toronto and No. 47 Kyle Edmond at Queen's Club.\n\nHe also had a brush with infamy, and for a while was known as the kid who whacked a ball in frustration during a Davis Cup match in February and hit a chair umpire in the eye. The umpire, Arnaud Gabas, required surgery to repair a fractured bone. That outburst earned Shapovalov a $7,000 fine, and it cost Canada the match and a shot at beating Britain.\n\n\"I did a very stupid thing and I'm really embarrassed and ashamed,\" a contrite Shapovalov said at the time.\n\n\"I went into complete shock after I hit it. The worst part was I had no idea how badly I may have hurt him. I've never hurt a single person in my whole life - never even wanted to hurt someone. That was so unprofessional of me. It was such a fluke accident. I promise I am going to mature from it and learn from it.\"\n\nThat display of hot-hotheadedness appears to be behind him. This week at the Rogers Cup, he'd won over not just Wayne Gretzky and Penny Oleksiak, who watched him in the stands in Montreal, but regular fans who gave him a standing ovation.\n\nGretzky, the hockey great, gave Shapovalov his stamp of approval.\n\n\"The great athletes want to be at centre stage. They want to play out here and be under that microscope,\" Gretzky said during a TV interview earlier in the week. \"I think he has ice in his veins and I think he's one of those guys who's going to love the pressure and take on that responsibility.\"\n\nAnother \"Great One\" also endorsed the lefty's skills and potential. Federer, widely considered the greatest tennis player in history, had praise for the teen's game, observing that the Canadian seemed to have \"an extra gear,\" while predicting a bright future for Shapovalov.\n\n\"I like his game. I think he's going to be a wonderful player. Seems to have a good attitude, too,\" Federer said on Friday, after he downed the 12th-ranked Roberto Bautista-Agut in straight sets to advance to the semi-final. \"It was a joy to watch.\"\n\nThe Canadian \"kept moving forward, hitting the ball hard.\" Nadal, Federer added, \"will never give away a match.\"\n\n\"You have to go and earn it. He did it. It's good for him,\" Federer said. \"It's good for tennis too.\"\n\nIt's too soon to say whether the country is witnessing the start of Shapo-mania. Canada has been here before with its tennis darlings. Milos Raonic, currently No. 6 in the world, didn't make his first Grand Slam appearance until he was 20, and didn't crack the top 100 until he was 21. Raonic, who peaked at No. 3 at the end of last season, bowed out in the second round this week.\n\nPerhaps a more cautionary tale is that of Eugenie Bouchard. Bouchard, who climbed as high as the No. 5 ranking on the WTA Tour, has tumbled all the way to No. 70. Though she's still only 23 years old, it serves as a reminder that fast success is not always sustained.\n\nStill, when the teen rolled up in a golf cart for a late-afternoon practice in Montreal on Friday, a sizable crowd gathered to watch him and hope for a chance at an autograph. Shapovalov seemed relaxed as he stepped onto the court under a blazing sun, gave his mother, Tessa, a hug and started hitting. His mother, a former professional player in the Soviet Union who runs a tennis academy in Vaughan, Ont., helped develop her son's talent.\n\nShapovalov may be living his moment in the sun in Montreal, but what's next? Last year, he was crowned Junior Wimbledon champion. This week, he began his run in Montreal with a breakthrough victory over 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro, before ending up the youngest player to advance to the tournament's final eight since Bjorn Borg in 1974.\n\nNow he is expected to break into the top 100 after the Montreal tournament.\n\nHis coach is looking at the long term.\n\n\"He's got his identity. He's got his game style. I mean, he's got the strokes to hurt, and he's got the game that's taking shape,\" Laurendeau says. \"But he's got a lot of weapons.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T02:18:00Z", "sim": 0.6470588445663452, "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "title": "The Globe and Mail", "id": "1409"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "02:18:00", "url": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/how-denis-shapovalov-vaulted-over-his-idol-and-carved-a-spot-in-canadian-sports-history/article35976832/", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8732867", "image": "https://static.theglobeandmail.ca/e93/sports/article35976831.ece/ALTERNATES/w620/shapovalov11sp1.JPG", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "02:18:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Roger Federer may have had about playing in the Rogers Cup are behind him now that the Swiss master has reached the final.\n\nThe second-seeded Federer used a 6-3, 7-6 (5) victory over unseeded Robin Haase of the Netherlands on Saturday afternoon to reach his sixth final of the year, where he will be seeking a sixth win.\n\nHe had considering skipping the event, which would have been disastrous for the promoters with world No. 1 Andy Murray as well as Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka already out with injuries. But Federer decided to play and now has a chance to add to a tally that includes Australian Open and Wimbledon titles this year.\n\n\"I'm very happy that I've made it here,\" he said. \"It was a good decision for me.\n\n\"If I would have known I would have gone to the finals, I would have said 'yes' right away. Sometimes you've just got to wait and see how you feel. I'm most happy that I'm actually really healthy going into the finals. I haven't wasted too much energy. I've been able to keep points short. I've been really clean at net. I think my concentration and just my playing has gone up a notch. I'm just playing better.\"\n\nThe second-seeded Federer is seeking a third Rogers Cup title but his first in Montreal, having won in 2004 and 2006 in Toronto. A victory would give Federer, currently ranked third in the world, one of the top two seeds at the U.S. Open that begins Aug. 28 in New York.\n\nThe 36-year-old, coming off victories in Germany and at Wimbledon, is on a 16-match winning streak, his longest since 2012.\n\nIn Sunday's final, he will face the winner of the second semi-final between 18-year-old Denis Shapovalov of Richmond Hill, Ont., and 20-year-old Alexander Zverev of Germany.\n\n\"I think those young players don't quite know what to expect, and [neither)] do I, because nobody quite knows,\" said Federer. \"Even though, Zverev is a more experienced player than Shapovalov at this stage.\n\n\"It's a huge opportunity for them. It's exciting. To have a player at 18 or 20 years old in the finals of a Masters 1000 is not something we've seen very often. Very rarely, except maybe when Andy, Novak and Rafa (Nadal) were coming up. They were such great teenagers that we maybe saw it more often. Not even I probably achieved finals of a Masters 1000 at that age. It's very exciting for tennis.\"\n\nEspecially for Shapovalov, who has been on fire all week with wins over Nadal and Juan Martin Del Potro, among others. And the packed Uniprix Stadium grandstands have been aroar when the teenager plays.\n\n\"I guess this is where my experience kicks in,\" said Federer. \"I've seen some great atmospheres over the years.\n\n\"Almost everywhere I've gone, I've been in such close battles, where the crowd goes wild. You just expect that in a finals like this. I know that's not going to be the problem for me. It will be 'what are his serving patterns? What are his shot-making decisions? How much can I focus on my own game? How much does he allow me to play my own game?' The rest happens by itself really at this stage of my career.\n\n\"But even Zverev, same thing. I haven't played him that much yet. Never really on a hard court, except at the Hopman Cup.

Photograph: Minas Panagiotakis/Getty Images\n\nRoger Federer used a dominant service game to beat Dutchman Robin Haase 6-3, 7-6(5) in Montreal on Saturday, setting up a Rogers Cup final against German Alexander Zverev.\n\nHaase, playing in his first ATP World Tour Masters 1000 semi-final, did well to force a second-set tiebreak but Federer proved too much to handle as the Swiss fired down nine aces and dropped only nine points on serve.\n\nFederer, whose five titles this year include the Australian Open and Wimbledon, credited a positive mindset for helping him extend his winning streak to 16 matches.\n\n\"Confidence can get you a long way, and if you're feeling fine physically and you are ready to fight mentally you have a lot of things in the bag,\" said the 19-times Grand Slam champion.\n\n\"And then the only thing that maybe is missing is practice, but sometimes practice is overrated.

Rogers Cup on Saturday night.\n\nThe fourth-seeded Zverev, seeking a second tournament title in as many weeks, advanced to the final on Sunday against second-seeded Roger Federer, a 6-3, 7-6(5) winner over unseeded Robin Haase of the Netherlands. Federer holds a 2-1 edge in career meetings with the German, including a victory on grass in June.\n\nZverev stretched his match winning run to nine.\n\nShapovalov, who was playing Challenger-level tournaments only two weeks ago, became the youngest player to reach a Masters 1000 Series tournament with a winning run this week that included knocking off top seed Rafael Nadal and 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro.\n\nIt will raise his world ranking from 143rd to about 66th. He earned US$220,760 -- more than doubling his career prize money.\n\nFlag-waving fans in the packed grandstands at Uniprix Stadium were hoping for more magic in the battle of youngsters against the 20-year-old Zverev. But the German was too sharp, winning 81 per cent of the points off his serve compared to 64 per cent for Shapovalov.\n\nShapovalov, of Richmond Hill, Ont., held his serve through a more than 14-minute game early on, but lost it to go down 4-5 in the opening set, double faulting on break point. It was the fourth time in five matches he lost the first set, but this time there was no coming back.\n\nHe wasted two break points at 4-3 in the second, and Zverev was able to get the break for 6-5 after two Shapovalov double faults. It set up a wild final game, with Shapovalov saving two match points and Zverev erasing three break points before it ended with a misfired backhand by the Canadian.\n\nFederer reached his sixth final of the year, and will be seeking a sixth win.\n\nHe had considering skipping the event, which would have been disastrous for the promoters with world No. 1 Andy Murray as well as Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka already out with injuries. But Federer decided to play and now has a chance to add to a tally that includes Australian Open and Wimbledon titles this year.\n\n\"I'm very happy that I've made it here,\" he said. \"It was a good decision for me.\n\n\"If I would have known I would have gone to the finals, I would have said 'yes' right away. Sometimes you've just got to wait and see how you feel. I'm most happy that I'm actually really healthy going into the finals. I haven't wasted too much energy. I've been able to keep points short. I've been really clean at net. I think my concentration and just my playing has gone up a notch. I'm just playing better.\"\n\nThe second-seeded Federer is seeking a third Rogers Cup title, but his first in Montreal, having won in 2004 and 2006 in Toronto. A victory would give Federer, currently ranked third in the world, one of the top two seeds at the U.S. Open that begins Aug. 28 in New York.\n\nThe 36-year-old, coming off victories in Germany and at Wimbledon, is on a 16-match winning streak, his longest since 2012.\n\nWhoever won the other semifinal, Federer knew he would be facing a much younger opponent.\n\n\"I think those young players don't quite know what to expect, and (neither) do I, because nobody quite knows,\" said Federer. \"Even though, Zverev is a more experienced player than Shapovalov at this stage.\n\n\"It's a huge opportunity for them. It's exciting. To have a player at 18 or 20 years old in the finals of a Masters 1000 is not something we've seen very often. Very rarely, except maybe when Andy, Novak and Rafa (Nadal) were coming up. They were such great teenagers that we maybe saw it more often. Not even I probably achieved finals of a Masters 1000 at that age. It's very exciting for tennis.\n\n\"But even Zverev, same thing. I haven't played him that much yet. Never really on a hard court, except at the Hopman Cup. It will also be a good match to watch, I think.\"\n\nHaase, who upset seventh-seeded Grigor Dimitrov in the third round, was in his first career semifinal of a Masters Series tournament.\n\n\"I hope it gives me a lot of confidence,\" Haase said of his performance for the week. \"Next week (in Cincinnati), different conditions, different courts, so it's tournament by tournament.

Federer lost his serve three times before winning in three sets.\n\nRoger Federer overcame a third-round blip to beat Spain's David Ferrer in three sets and reach the quarter-finals of the Rogers Cup in Montreal.\n\nThe Australian Open and Wimbledon champion trailed for over an hour against his dogged opponent before clawing his way back to record a 4-6 6-4 6-2 victory in an hour and 56 minutes.\n\nFor large spells of the match, the Swiss appeared unusually frustrated, as his first serve dwindled and his much-improved backhand regularly misfired.\n\nHowever, as great champions usually do, the Swiss improved as the match went on and found a way to win.\n\nHe'll now meet another Spaniard, Roberto Bautista Agut, in the last eight.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nFerrer dominates from the baseline\n\nFederer had dominated the pair's previous meetings, winning all 16 of them while dropping just six sets to the Spaniard.\n\nGoing by that stat, Ferrer's chances were extremely slim, however the Spaniard - who dropped out of the world's top 30 for the first time since 2005 earlier this year - has appeared rejuvenated in recent weeks after winning an ATP 250 title in Bastad last month.\n\nFerrer had also come through two tough matches at this event, beating Britain's Kyle Edmund and world number 17 Jack Sock, and he applied immediate pressure on Federer from the off.\n\nFederer served two double faults in his opening service game but still managed to save three break points to fend off his bullish opponent.\n\nTwo games later, though, Ferrer took his chance, converting his seventh break point in the fourth game before racing into a 5-2 lead.\n\nFerrer's timing from the back of the court was like clockwork in the opening set, as he stepped up onto the baseline and took the match to Federer.\n\nThe Spaniard couldn't serve out the set at the first attempt, however he quickly reapplied the pressure to break Federer again and win the opener in 49 minutes.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nFederer struggles on serve but finds a way through\n\nFederer took an early lead at the start of the second set, but a loose game - which finished with a missed smash and a double fault- allowed Ferrer to draw level.\n\nThings started to come together for the Swiss midway through the second set, however he was still forced to save two break points when serving at 5-4, before drawing level at a set apiece.\n\nAfter a loose service game at the start of the decider, Ferrer's challenge began to fade.\n\nFederer finally began to hit his spots on serve, while tightening up his game from the back of the court.\n\nPerhaps it was understandable that the Swiss maestro was a little rusty on this occasion, for this was only his second competitive match since winning an unprecedented eighth Wimbledon.\n\nEven so, he will need to improve if he is to win a third title at this event and continue his supremely impressive year.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-10T21:14:00Z", "sim": 0.6392157077789307, "source": {"uri": "vavel.com", "title": "VAVEL", "id": "2824"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "06:19:00", "url": "https://www.vavel.com/en/tennis/815991-federer-comes-through-ferrer-test-to-reach-the-last-eight-at-the-rogers-cup.html", "storyUri": "eng-3353129", "id": "8548758", "image": "https://img.vavel.com/federer-montrael-183722022.jpg", "date": "2017-08-10", "time": "21:14:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Shapovalov broke Mannarino to take a 5-4 lead in the deciding set and then served out the match.\n\nIn Saturday's semifinal, Shapovalov will meet the winner of Friday's late match between fourth-seeded German Alexander Zverev and Kevin Anderson of South Africa.\n\nThe left-handers exchanged service breaks early in the third set. Shapovalov fought off two break points to stay even at 1-1. In the next game, he earned two break points. He put a service return in the net on the first opportunity, but got the break when Mannarino sent a backhand over the baseline. But Mannarino got that one back in the next game. Shapovalov put Mannarino in trouble with a big serve at 30-30, but he rushed an overhead to give the Frenchman the break point.\n\nThe momentum changed in the second set after a brief rain delay halted play for about 10 minutes with Shapovalov holding a 3-2 lead on serve. Because the delay wasn't more than 10 minutes, there was no warm-up for Mannarino and he was broken at 15-40. Shapovalov held his serve the rest of the way to knot the match at a set apiece.\n\nThe first set was a disaster for Shapovalov. He double-faulted twice to give Mannarino a break in the opening game and Mannarino broke him again for a 3-0 lead.\n\nThe first signs of the player who beat Rafael Nadal less than 24 hours earlier came in the fifth game when Shapovalov fought off five break points to win his first game, but Mannarino served out the set.\n\nMeanwhile, Roger Federer continued his pursuit of a third Rogers Cup title, but his first in Montreal.\n\nFederer eased into the semifinals with a workmanlike 6-4, 6-4 win over 12th-seeded Roberto Bautista-Agut of Spain.\n\nNext up is unseeded Robin Haase of the Netherlands, who said he was lucky to come back for a 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 win over Diego Schwartzman of Argentina.\n\nFederer, who is playing his first tournament since winning his eighth Wimbledon title, struggled a bit at the beginning of his Thursday match against Spanish veteran David Ferrer and was forced to play three sets. But he seemed more composed Friday.\n\n\"I believe I served better earlier in the match, but I don't think Bautista-Agut returned as well as Ferrer,\" Federer said. \"Both things combined, two major factors in a beginning of a match, I was able to get into the match better. Of course, it was tough until 4-all. But my game plan worked better against Bautista-Agut than against Ferrer. I believe it's because today I was more aggressive coming to the net.\n\nHaase and Schwartzman were both looking to reach their first semifinal in an ATP Masters 1000 event. Haase said it was difficult for both players after playing tough three-set matches against seeded players earlier in the week.\n\n\"I played a lot of good matches, especially yesterday against (seventh-seeded Grigor) Dimitrov,\" Haase said. \"It's tough to come back and play that same level. I didn't, but I managed to win because I kept fighting. You could see that we were both mentally (tired). It took a lot of us. We beat good guys. We've been playing really well. Then to do it on this stage again for your first semis, it's not easy.\"\n\nThe 30-year-old Haase said he always believed he could be competitive at this level, but he had to overcome a serious knee injury early in his career.\n\n\"I didn't even know if I could ever play tennis again,\" Haase said. \"After one-and-a-half years, I got back. I came back really fast, from zero to 60 in eight months. However, from that moment, I wasn't the player I was before my injury. I was not as fast. I was insecure. I had a lot of problems with other injuries after.\n\n\"Then this kind of eats you up inside mentally,\" he said. \"It drains you because you know you can do better, but actually your own body is not letting you. That took me, honestly, a couple of years to get more calm in my head, that I have to deal with it. \"\n\nphickey@postmedia.com\n\nRelated", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T01:47:00Z", "sim": 0.6352941393852234, "source": {"uri": "montrealgazette.com", "title": "Montreal Gazette", "id": "2649"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "01:47:00", "url": "http://montrealgazette.com/sports/tennis/wunderkind-denis-shapovalov-blasts-into-rogers-cup-semifinals", "storyUri": "eng-3353129", "id": "8730647", "image": "http://wpmedia.montrealgazette.com/2017/08/830576580.jpg?w=640", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "01:47:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

He's also the youngest quarter-finalist ever at an ATP Masters event, the highest level on the pro tour. In 2016, he became just the second Canadian to win the Wimbledon boys singles title. Filip Peliwo in 2012 was the first.\n\nLike tennis greats John McEnroe, Martina Navratilova, Jimmy Connors and Nadal, Shapovalov is left-handed. But being a southpaw may not give him the same advantage it gave some of his predecessors. Technical advances in rackets and court surfaces as well as a changes in game strategy and the rise of the two-handed backhand have levelled the playing field in recent years.\n\nTennis analyst Craig O'Shannessy once described the young Canadian as \"a left-handed version of Federer, with that one-handed backhand,\" according to the Telegraph in Britain. O'Shannessy also said there is \"no ceiling\" for Shapovalov, and praised his \"great energy and rapport with the crowd.\" He's certainly made an impression this week in Montreal, with Wayne Gretzky and star swimmer Penny Oleksiak among his boosters in the stands.\n\nBefore the start of the season, his first full campaign as a pro, Shapovalov split with his coach Adriano Fuorivia, who he had worked with for more than four years. Canadian Davis Cup captain Martin Laurendeau was hired as his replacement. Shapovalov said earlier this year that he and Fuorivia are on good terms despite parting ways. \"Adriano thought that someone with more experience like Marty would be a good benefit to my team,\" he said. \"It was nothing that happened between us, it was just more of a decision that we made together.\"\n\nShapovalov showed a flash of immaturity when a ball he carelessly hit in frustration during a Davis Cup match in February struck a chair umpire in the eye. He dealt with the fallout like a man however, making no excuses for the incident, saying he lost control of his emotions and behaved unprofessionally. While he apologized to the umpire, his teammates and tennis fans, the International Tennis Federation didn't let him off the hook. He was fined $7,000 US.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T16:21:00Z", "sim": 0.6313725709915161, "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "title": "CBC News", "id": "668"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "16:21:00", "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/sports/tennis/denis-shapovalov-5-things-to-know-about-rising-star-1.4243654", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8658919", "image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4243684.1502467607!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/ten-rogers-cup-men-20170810.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "16:21:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

with his victory (Getty)\n\nThe pair continued to trade games up until a tie-break, where Nadal saw a 3-0 lead evaporate by the first change of ends.\n\nHe edged ahead again but Shapovalov won the

After breakout scintillating wins over Juan Martin del Potro, Rafael Nadal and Adrian Mannarino, in addition to having saved match points in his first round match, the young 18-year-old fell just short in a spirited contest with 20-year-old Alexander Zverev who outclassed and overpowered the Canadian 6-4, 7-5 in the quarterfinals.\n\nShapovalov was done in by his wicked lefty serve which helped him so much against Nadal, but tonight he gave up six double faults and three of them came on break points.\n\n\"It's a little bit disappointing, this loss today, because I felt like I had a chance, but Sascha played too good in the big moments,\" said Shapovalov. \"I don't think I played that well in those moments. I gave away a lot of breaks with double faults. I wasn't even letting him play those points.\n\n\"But credit to him, he's playing with so much confidence. He really put the pressure on me. I don't think it's going to affect my week. I mean, I've had the week of my life. Sascha is an unbelievable player. Actually it's pretty nice to see how my game matches up against him, to see that I can compete with a great player like him.\"\n\nZverev was hit by the double fault bug as well tossing in six of his own, but the World No. 8 saved three break points serving for the match at 6-5 and eventually closed it out.\n\nRanked No. 143 Shapovalov, will up to No. 66 and soon could be a real threat in bigger events.\n\n\"I told him he had a great run, well done to him, to not worry too much that he lost today,\" said Zverev. \"I also told him that this is just the first match of very, very many that we will play against him. Hopefully a lot of other big matches, maybe in Grand Slams, maybe in finals of tournaments. I just told him that this is the beginning for him.\"\n\nZverev has now won his last 9 matches after winning Washington last week, and 10 straight in Masters events following that Rome title.\n\nNext up is Roger Federer who served his way into his 6th final of the season besting Robin Haase 6-3, 7-6(5). Federer was broken once in the first set but in the second won 28 of 31 points on his service.\n\n\"I'm happy, most happy that I'm actually really healthy going into the finals,\" said Federer. \"I haven't wasted too much energy. I've been able to keep points short. I've been really clean at net. I think my concentration and just my playing has gone up a notch. I'm just playing better.\"\n\nFederer leads Zverev 2-1 with the German winning in Halle last year while Federer gained revenge this past June.\n\n\"I think he's definitely the favourite,\" said Zverev of Federer. \"He's been playing amazing tennis. He pretty much won every single big tournament he played this year. I feel like I'm playing well, so I know that I have to serve a lot better tomorrow than I did today. That was I think the thing that I struggled the most with today.\n\n\"But, you know, I played in five finals this year. I won four. The one that I lost was against Roger. There's a reason for it. I'm happy to be in the final. I'll try to enjoy as much as I can.\"\n\nFederer is a sparkling 5-0 in finals and 35-2 overall this season, holding match points in all 37 of his matches.

The teenage tennis pheromone seems to be handling the load just fine.\n\nWhile Bouchard was speaking of up and comers on the women's side of the draw, there is no question Shapovalov is this week carrying the torch for all of Canadian tennis - male or female - after his upset of world No. 2 Rafael Nadal in Thursday's round of 16 at the Rogers Cup in Montreal. With Bouchard and leading Canadian men's player Milos Raonic both eliminated, it is safe to say all eyes are on Shapovalov.\n\nThe win Thursday makes the teenager from Richmond Hill, Ont., the youngest Masters series quarter-finalist of all time, and the youngest Rogers Cup quarter finalist since Bjorn Borg in 1974.\n\nAfter dropping the opening set to Nadal, who, with Andy Murray's withdrawal from the W&S Open next week could soon become world. No. 1, Shapovalov stormed back to win the second and third set's 6-4, 7-6 (4).\n\nIt was his second upset in as many days. On Wednesday, the 18-year-old knocked off former top-5 and 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro. He'll face the frenchman Adrian Mannarino, world No. 42, in Friday evening's contest. Mannarino knocked off Raonic earlier in the tournament.\n\nAmong Shapovalov's supporters this week has been hockey great Wayne Gretzsky and Canadian olympic swimmer Penny Oleksiak. Gretzky has been court-side for Shapovalov's matches this week, and said he believes the Richmond Hill left-hander has what it takes to be a superstar athlete.\n\n\"The great athletes want to be at center stage. They want to play out here and be under that microscope,\" Gretzky said during a television broadcast. \"I think he has ice in his veins and I think he's one of those guys who's going to love the pressure and take on that responsibility.\"\n\nWho is Denis Shapovalov?\n\nFor a thorough explanation, read Rachel Brady's profile from last summer. In a nutshell, he could be Canada's next-big-thing. Last year he on the junior Wimbledon title before making a name for himself by offing Nick Kyrgios in the round of 64 at last year's Rogers Cup.\n\nHe is the son of Tessa Viktor Shapovalov, who moved to Canada from Tel Avivthe same year Denis was born.\n\nTessa runs an academy in Richmond Hill, which opened in 2012. It's where Shapovalov refined his skills after he making his way onto the Tennis Canada radar at age 9. By 13, it was clear he'd need a team around him to make it to the next level.\n\nBy 2015, he was Canada's U18 national outdoor champion, and by this time last year, he'd won three Futures titles.\n\nHe popped up on the radar again in for less desirable reasons in February, when he was fined $7, 000 for smashing a ball into the eye of umpire Arnaud Gabas during a decisive Davis Cup match, ultimately costing Canada a shot at victory over Great Brittain.\n\nICYMI, Denis Shapovalov hits a ball out of anger that accidentally hits the chair umpire in the eye during @daviscup pic.twitter.com/ZBadhJmnww -- Tennis Channel (@TennisChannel)\n\nFebruary 7, 2017\n\nWhat are his chances?\n\nConsidering the kind of season Nadal is having (which, going by total points is the better than anyone, even Roger Federer) then anything is possible.\n\nIn Mannarino, he he facing a 29-year-old left-handed whose 2017 record is 17-18. Mannarino plays his best tennis on a grass surface, where he boasts a .567 win percentage. On hard courts, he's 7-9 on the season and 75-99 for his career.\n\nShapolvalov's ATP sample size is too small to be a barometer, he has posted a 27-5 record on hard surfaces between his appearances on the Futures and Challenge tours.\n\nPrior to Nadal, he had never faced another lefty at the ATP level.

I don't know if you can teach that, but he has that and he's making the most of it.\"\n\nShapovalov, of Richmond Hill, Ont., posted one of the biggest wins in Canadian tennis history when he battled Nadal for two hours 45 minutes on Thursday night and pulled out the victory in a third-set tiebreaker. It was a back-and-forth match, with several break points saved on both sides. Shapovalov fell behind 3-0 in the tiebreaker, but a Nadal double fault and two aces gave the youngster the match.\n\nAt no time did the left-hander show any sign of cracking under the pressure. Instead, he fed off the deafening sound from the sellout crowd of 11,000 that cheered every point he won.\n\n\"It's a bit surreal to be able to, start to finish, last that long, produce quality tennis and go toe-to-toe with a legend like that,\" said Laurendeau. \"It's just remarkable.\n\n\"I'm glad I was there to witness it. I'll remember it for a long time. It will certainly be a reference for him because he still has a lot of steps to go through. That's always going to be there for him, what he's able to do. Just continue to work towards his goal, which is being top 100, top 50, top 10 and, one day, contend for a Grand Slam.\"\n\nHe said Shapovalov is still developing the physical and mental sides of the game. A major test came in February at a Davis Cup World Group series against Britain in Ottawa.\n\nIn a fit of anger, Shapovalov tried to smash a ball into the crowd, but instead struck chair umpire Arnaud Gabas in the face. Gabas needed surgery to repair a broken bone under his left eye. Shapovalov defaulted the match, which cost Canada the series, and was fined US$7,000 by the International Tennis Federation.\n\n\"How he's handled the February incident from the beginning was very impressive from anybody, even a veteran and a mature man, to face the consequences of what happened,\" said Laurendeau. \"I think even more so for a teenager.\n\n\"He's never shied away. The first thing on his mind was to apologize to everybody. He understood the consequences. He manned up. The biggest progress to me is that aspect -- the mental, psychological aspect of his game. I mean, tactically, technically, physically he's improved. His biggest improvement to me has been how he's competing, how he's channelling and managing his emotions.\"\n\nOnly three weeks ago, Shapovalov was winning a Challenger event -- one step below the ATP Tour -- in Gatineau, Que.\n\nHe started the week ranked 143rd in the world, but the first three wins alone put him into the top 100.\n\nBut he will not be an ATP regular quite yet. He is not eligible to enter next week's event in Cincinnati and will instead play a Challenger tournament in Vancouver.\n\nAfter that, he will try to qualify for the U.S. Open in New York.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T19:45:00Z", "sim": 0.6274510025978088, "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "title": "The Globe and Mail", "id": "1409"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "19:45:00", "url": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/feeds/canadian-press/quebec/denis-shapovalovs-coach-not-surprised-by-teens-poise/article35964851/", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8690329", "image": "https://static.theglobeandmail.ca/857/feeds/canadian-press/quebec/article35964916.ece/ALTERNATES/w620/pch156419899.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "19:45:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Rogers Cup on Saturday night.\n\nThe fourth-seeded Zverev, seeking a second tournament title in as many weeks, advanced to the final on Sunday against second-seeded Roger Federer, a 6-3, 7-6(5) winner over unseeded Robin Haase of the Netherlands. Federer holds a 2-1 edge in career meetings with the German, including a victory on grass in June.\n\nZverev stretched his match winning run to nine.\n\nShapovalov, who was playing Challenger-level tournaments only two weeks ago, became the youngest player to reach a Masters 1000 Series tournament with a winning run this week that included knocking off top seed Rafael Nadal and 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro.\n\nIt will raise his world ranking from 143rd to about 66th. He earned US$220,760 -- more than doubling his career prize money.\n\nFlag-waving fans in the packed grandstands at Uniprix Stadium were hoping for more magic in the battle of youngsters against the 20-year-old Zverev. But the German was too sharp, winning 81 per cent of the points off his serve compared to 64 per cent for Shapovalov.\n\nShapovalov, of Richmond Hill, Ont., held his serve through a more than 14-minute game early on, but lost it to go down 4-5 in the opening set, double faulting on break point. It was the fourth time in five matches he lost the first set, but this time there was no coming back.\n\nHe wasted two break points at 4-3 in the second, and Zverev was able to get the break for 6-5 after two Shapovalov double faults. It set up a wild final game, with Shapovalov saving two match points and Zverev erasing three break points before it ended with a misfired backhand by the Canadian.\n\nFederer reached his sixth final of the year, and will be seeking a sixth win.\n\nHe had considering skipping the event, which would have been disastrous for the promoters with world No. 1 Andy Murray as well as Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka already out with injuries. But Federer decided to play and now has a chance to add to a tally that includes Australian Open and Wimbledon titles this year.\n\n\"I'm very happy that I've made it here,\" he said. \"It was a good decision for me.\n\n\"If I would have known I would have gone to the finals, I would have said 'yes' right away. Sometimes you've just got to wait and see how you feel. I'm most happy that I'm actually really healthy going into the finals. I haven't wasted too much energy. I've been able to keep points short. I've been really clean at net. I think my concentration and just my playing has gone up a notch. I'm just playing better.\"\n\nThe second-seeded Federer is seeking a third Rogers Cup title, but his first in Montreal, having won in 2004 and 2006 in Toronto. A victory would give Federer, currently ranked third in the world, one of the top two seeds at the U.S. Open that begins Aug. 28 in New York.\n\nThe 36-year-old, coming off victories in Germany and at Wimbledon, is on a 16-match winning streak, his longest since 2012.\n\nWhoever won the other semifinal, Federer knew he would be facing a much younger opponent.\n\n\"I think those young players don't quite know what to expect, and (neither) do I, because nobody quite knows,\" said Federer. \"Even though, Zverev is a more experienced player than Shapovalov at this stage.\n\n\"It's a huge opportunity for them. It's exciting. To have a player at 18 or 20 years old in the finals of a Masters 1000 is not something we've seen very often. Very rarely, except maybe when Andy, Novak and Rafa (Nadal) were coming up. They were such great teenagers that we maybe saw it more often. Not even I probably achieved finals of a Masters 1000 at that age. It's very exciting for tennis.\n\n\"But even Zverev, same thing. I haven't played him that much yet. Never really on a hard court, except at the Hopman Cup. It will also be a good match to watch, I think.\"\n\nHaase, who upset seventh-seeded Grigor Dimitrov in the third round, was in his first career semifinal of a Masters Series tournament.\n\n\"I hope it gives me a lot of confidence,\" Haase said of his performance for the week. \"Next week (in Cincinnati), different conditions, different courts, so it's tournament by tournament. But, in general, to make an achievement like this is good because it shows you can do it.\"\n\nIn a semifinals, seventh-seeded Rohan Bopanna of India and Ivan Dodig of Croatia defeated sixth-seeded Raven Klaasen of the Netherlands and Rajeev Ram of the United States 4-6, 7-6 (8), 11-9; and fifth-seeded Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut of France downed eighth-seeded Oliver Marach of Austria and Mate Pavic of Croatia 7-5, 6-3.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-28", "textEnd": 2931, "textStart": 2924}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T02:25:00Z", "sim": 0.6274510025978088, "source": {"uri": "toronto.ctvnews.ca", "title": "Toronto", "id": "3006"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "02:25:00", "url": "http://toronto.ctvnews.ca/shapovalov-loses-rogers-cup-semifinal-match-to-germany-s-zverev-1.3543704", "storyUri": "eng-3353129", "id": "8863356", "image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.3543698.1502589896!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "02:25:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

The Swiss ace is playing some good tennis in the ongoing Rogers Cup, and is set to face Spaniard David Ferrer in the third round of the competition on Thursday.\n\nCan Ferrer beat Federer? Let's be honest, if Federer plays anything close to what he has been doing so far in the last couple of months, it would be impossible for the Spaniard.

Federer understands that the competition is going to get much tougher as the Rogers Cup moves ahead with some wonderful stars in the competition.\n\nAs of now, he will just maintain his focus on Ferrer, who is one of the experienced players in the circuit. If one looks at their head-to-head record, Federer is leagues ahead, with 16 wins and no losses.\n\nFerrer is yet to find the winning formula to succeed against Federer. The Spaniard has the game to beat any top player of the world, but when he comes against Federer, call it the nerves, Ferrer fails to produce his best game.\n\nRoger FedererReuters\n\nHowever, they have not met in any competitive matches since their last game during the ATP World Tour Masters in 2014, where Ferrer took him to three sets. It would take something special to once again take Federer the full distance when the world number three is on top of his game at present.\n\nThough Ferrer's record might be below par, the Spaniard comes into the clash with some impressive performances under his belt. En route to the third round clash, Ferrer has defeated Kyle Edmund and even 15th seed Jack Sock in the last round, but Federer is a different breed altogether.\n\nWith Federer playing some of his best tennis ever, the Swiss ace has set his sights on the title, and anything that comes on his path will have to bear his brunt. Next victim - Ferrer? We will soon find it out.\n\nWhere to watch live\n\nFederer vs Ferrer Rogers Cup match is scheduled for 2:30 pm local time, 12 am IST.\n\nIndia: TV: TEN 2.

(THE CANADIAN PRESS/Paul Chiasson)\n\nCanadian teen tennis sensation Denis Shapovalov had the biggest win of his young career on Thursday night when he upset top-seeded Spaniard Rafael Nadal in the round of 16 at the Rogers Cup.\n\nWhile the 18-year-old Richmond Hill, Ont., native's profile -- not to mention his world ranking of 143 -- is sure to climb thanks to his success in Montreal, he's still a relatively new face on the ATP Tour.\n\nHere are five things to help Canadian tennis fans get to know the budding star:\n\nHE'S MADE HISTORY ... A FEW TIMES: The win over Nadal put Shapovalov into the quarter-finals of the Rogers Cup, making him the youngest player to advance to the tournament's final eight since Bjorn Borg in 1974. He's also the youngest quarter-finalist ever at an ATP Masters event, the highest level on the pro tour. In 2016, he became just the second Canadian to win the Wimbledon boys singles title. Filip Peliwo in 2012 was the first.\n\nHE'S A LEFTY: Like tennis greats John McEnroe, Martina Navratilova, Jimmy Connors and Nadal, Shapovalov is left-handed. But being a southpaw may not give him the same advantage it gave some of his predecessors. Technical advances in rackets and court surfaces as well as a changes in game strategy and the rise of the two-handed backhand have levelled the playing field in recent years.\n\nHE'S BEEN COMPARED TO ROGER FEDERER: Tennis analyst Craig O'Shannessy once described the young Canadian as \"a left-handed version of Federer, with that one-handed backhand,\" according to the Telegraph in Britain. O'Shannessy also said there is \"no ceiling\" for Shapovalov, and praised his \"great energy and rapport with the crowd.\" He's certainly made an impression this week in Montreal, with Wayne Gretzky and star swimmer Penny Oleksiak among his boosters in the stands.\n\nHE RECENTLY CHANGED COACHES: Before the start of the season, his first full campaign as a pro, Shapovalov split with his coach Adriano Fuorivia, who he had worked with for more than four years. Canadian Davis Cup captain Martin Laurendeau was hired as his replacement. Shapovalov said earlier this year that he and Fuorivia are on good terms despite parting ways. \"Adriano thought that someone with more experience like Marty would be a good benefit to my team,\" he said. \"It was nothing that happened between us, it was just more of a decision that we made together.\"\n\nHE'S STILL A KID: Shapovalov showed a flash of immaturity when a ball he carelessly hit in frustration during a Davis Cup match in February struck a chair umpire in the eye. He dealt with the fallout like a man however, making no excuses for the incident, saying he lost control of his emotions and behaved unprofessionally. While he apologized to the umpire, his teammates and tennis fans, the International Tennis Federation didn't let him off the hook. He was fined US$7,000.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-10", "textEnd": 171, "textStart": 156}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T16:09:00Z", "sim": 0.6235294342041016, "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "title": "CTV News", "id": "30"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "16:09:00", "url": "http://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/on-the-rise-get-to-know-canadian-rising-tennis-star-denis-shapovalov-1.3541841", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8656442", "image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.3541853.1502466725!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "16:09:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

It seems Nadal is comfortably on his way to dethrone Andy Murray from the top spot of ATP rankings. Notably, he needs to reach the semi-final in Montreal to do so.\n\nHowever, Nadal will face teenage sensation and local favourite Denis Shapovalov in the third round on Thursday, August 10. The Canadian, who was handed a wildcard for the tournament, has produced some impressive results to make the third round and set up his first meeting against a top-10 player.\n\nShapovalov, ranked 143, opened his campaign against higher-ranked Brazilian Dutra Silva and it was not going the Canadian's way as he lost the first set. However, the 18-year-old fought back and showed he is ready for tough tests when he saved five break points at 5-5 in the second set before winning the match 4-6, 7-6(8), 6-4.\n\nIn the second round, Shapovalov faced one of the biggest tests of his career against former US Open champions Juan Martin del Potro. He aced it by downing the Argentine star 6-4, 7-6(4), a win that gave him a lot of confidence ahead of Thursday's dream meeting with Nadal.\n\nRafael Nadal.Reuters\n\nShapovalov revealed he grew up watching Nadal. The former junior Wimbledon champion seems to be excited at the prospect of playing the Spanish great in front of his home crowd.\n\n\"Every time I look at him [Nadal], I think what a ridiculous athlete and what a ridiculous player he is. It's going to be very interesting for me to go up against him, just to see how my game style matches him. I'm going to try to make the most of it,\" Shapovalov said, as quoted by CBC Sports.\n\nThe Canadian teen is known as an aggressive baseliner and has a good service to trouble top players. However, Nadal, who has one of the best defences in the sport, is unlikely to be troubled. On the contrary, it will be interesting to see if Shapovalov can match the pace and court movement-abilities of his higher-ranked opponent.\n\nWhen is the match and how to watch it live\n\nRafael Nadal vs Denis Shapovalov is the fourth match on Court Central on Thursday. The tie is expected to begin not before 6:30 pm local time, 4 am IST.\n\nIndia: TV: TEN 2. Live streaming: Sony LIV\n\nUSA: Tennis Channel. Live streaming: Tennis Channel\n\nAustralia: TV: ESPN.

It will be interesting to see how Shapovalov approaches his next match. On the one hand, he did beat the World No. 2 on Thursday. But on the contrary, it was just in the round of sixteen of a Masters Series event. A lot of players that pull off big early-round upsets often go out in the next round ahead of getting big-time ranking points. Shapovalov will certainly have to stay focused on Friday if he is to advance to the semifinals.\n\n#The Canadian will face Adrian Mannarino, a name that not a lot of Canadian tennis fans will know.\n\nMannarino, at the age of 29, is a well-established veteran on tour. He has been a bit of a journeyman who has struggled to keep his ranking high at times. However, a couple of months ago he appeared to figure something out. He made the final of a grass-court event in Turkey ahead of making the Wimbledon fourth round.\n\nLast week he played well down in Los Cabos before falling in a well-contested match to Tomas Berdych. Now Mannarino is into the Montreal quarters with the distinguished form at the tournament. He has not dropped a set nor has anyone extended him to a tiebreaker so far this week. Mannarino was able to break Milos Raonic, and the French national will almost certainly defeat Shapovalov on Friday if the 18-year-old is too busy relishing in his Nadal victory instead of focusing on the match at hand.\n\nWith an appearance in the quarterfinals of the Rogers Cup, the Canadian is now threatening the top 100 on tour. But his draw is still active in Montreal, and that means that there is plenty of room to grow. With a win on Friday, he would threaten the top 70, and that would mean not needing a wild card or a qualifying draw for entry into the Grand Slams. Furthermore, it would also mean being a high seed in any challenger events that he participates in and getting a direct entry into scores of tour-level tournaments. In effect, there is a ton on the line for him on Friday.\n\nShapovalov's ceiling in the rankings to come on Monday is actually something close to a top-30 ranking. If he can beat Mannarino, then the Canadian will be looking at a semifinal against either Alexander Zverev or Kevin Anderson. Certainly the former is the beast on top of the draw now that Nadal has gone out. But Zverev and Anderson were the finalists last week in Washington. These are two players that might be running out of gas right now as they have logged a lot of matches and court mileage in recent days. Shapovalov can do more than just dream about a spot in the final against Roger Federer. If the Canadian stays composed and don't say \"good enough\" after beating Nadal, then there's a legitimate path to the championship match in Montreal.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T04:37:00Z", "sim": 0.615686297416687, "source": {"uri": "us.blastingnews.com", "title": "Blasting News", "id": "6890"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "08:48:00", "url": "http://us.blastingnews.com/sports/2017/08/denis-shapovalovs-projected-ranking-after-2017-rogers-cup-001923547.html", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8571697", "image": "http://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2017/8/11/660x290/b_1433x630/rogers-cup-from-montreal-wikimedia-commons-wikimediaorg_1502325.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "04:37:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

in the second round and then knocked off the top-seeded Nadal in a third-set tiebreaker on Thursday in the round of 16.\n\nHe broke service for a 2-1 lead in the third set Friday only to hand it back in the next game, but a roar went up when Mannarino wasted a chance to put away a game point and Shapovalov jumped on the chance to break for a 5-4 lead.

But, as I have practiced with him quite a bit, maybe I am better prepared than if I would have never hit with him before.\"\n\nFederer broke serve for a 5-4 lead in the first set and broke again for 2-1 in the second en route to the victory in a little more than an hour. Federer was coming off a three-set win over another Spaniard, David Ferrer, against whom he is 17-0.\n\n\"My game plan worked better against Bautista Agut than against Ferrer,\" he said. \"I believe it's because I was more aggressive coming to the net.\"\n\nHaase, who upset seventh-seeded Grigor Dimitrov in the third round, reached his first career Masters Series semifinal.

Meeting for the first time in three years, Federer extended his impressive FedEx ATP Head2Head advantage over Ferrer to 17-0.\n\n\"I already beat other players 17 times,\" said Federer. \"Sometimes I played them maybe 30 or 40 times. They ended up beating me at a certain stages, like Roddick, Gonzalez and Soderling. Sometimes I beat them 10 times in a row. At the end they always ended up beating me. That's why I have a lot of respect for this match today. I know it can't continue that way. 17 is a lot.\n\n\"The last match we played were three tight sets in Toronto, then three sets Cincinnati, and again today. So these statistics are a bit ridiculous, because I have a lot of respect for David. As a person, he's very nice. He's a great fighter on the court. So this type of head-to-head is a bit strange.\"\n\nFerrer was on the front foot throughout the opener and he would halt Federer's dominant sets-won streak at 32. The ruthless run began in the first round of the Gerry Weber Open in Halle and included his title at Wimbledon and straight-set win over Peter Polansky on Wednesday.\n\nStriking his forehand with great depth and relying on an efficient first serve, Ferrer was unflappable in closing out the 43-minute opener. The Spaniard, who is in top form after claiming his 27th ATP World Tour title two weeks ago in Bastad, struck a deep, penetrating return to snatch the initial break for 3-1. Serving for the first set at 5-4, he would fire a return at Federer's feet, which the Swiss hit into the net. The second seed struck an uncharacteristic 19 unforced errors in the first set, but the tide would take an abrupt turn in the second. After exchanging early breaks, Federer rediscovered his groove, surging ahead with another break in the fifth game.\n\nFederer's Most Dominant Rivalries\n\nComing forward more often and playing more aggressive, vintage Federer tennis, the Swiss would turn aside a set point at 5-3 and force a decider in the next game. He would pull away from then on, breaking twice in the third and closing out a spot in the quarter-finals with a volley winner on his first match point.\n\n\"For me it was more of a struggle,\" Federer said about the match. \"As you know, you don't always feel the same and each opponent is a different problem. He started very well, especially on the return on my second serve. I was not able to serve my first serve where I wanted to, and he hurt me on the second serve.\n\n\"From the baseline, I didn't have enough rhythm. The court is fast here. Of course, because of the surface, that it's fast, you can't just decide to put the ball in because physically David is very strong. You can't do that. You have to go into the battle. You have to accept you're going to make mistakes. But you have to keep moving forward.\n\n\"I tried with my intensity and focus to change the match, and this is what I was able to do. I was able also to change the angles, and that helped me win the match.\"\n\nA two-time champion at the Canadian ATP World Tour Masters 1000 event (2004 & '06 in Toronto), Federer advanced to the quarter-finals in Montreal for the first time since 2009. He will next face Roberto Bautista Agut, after the 12th seed edged Gael Monfils 4-6, 7-6(5), 7-6(2) earlier on Thursday. Federer owns a 6-0 edge in their FedEd ATP Head2Head, most recently prevailing at the Masters 1000 event in Miami earlier this year.\n\n\"We battled, both tried to find a way to win. He had a good start, I had a better finish. That was important. For me, take it how it is and hope that this match gives me some better rhythm and confidence against Bautista Agut, who plays actually very similar to David today.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-10T21:14:00Z", "sim": 0.6078431606292725, "source": {"uri": "atpworldtour.com", "title": "ATP World Tour", "id": "9695"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "06:19:00", "url": "http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/news/montreal-2017-thursday-federer-bautista-agut", "storyUri": "eng-3353129", "id": "8548733", "image": "www.atpworldtour.com/-/media/images/news/2017/08/10/22/20/montreal-2017-thursday-federer2.jpg", "date": "2017-08-10", "time": "21:14:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Zverev ended a dream week for 18-year-old Denis Shapovalov with a 6-4, 7-5 victory in the semifinals of the Rogers Cup on Saturday night.\n\nThe fourth-seeded Zverev, seeking a second tournament title in as many weeks, advanced to the final on Sunday against second-seeded Roger Federer, a 6-3, 7-6(5) winner over unseeded Robin Haase of the Netherlands. Federer holds a 2-1 edge in career meetings with the German, including a victory on grass in June.\n\nZverev stretched his match winning run to nine.\n\nShapovalov, who was playing Challenger-level tournaments only two weeks ago, became the youngest player to reach a Masters 1000 Series tournament with a winning run this week that included knocking off top seed Rafael Nadal and 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro.\n\nIt will raise his world ranking from 143rd to about 66th. He also earned $220,760 U.S., more than doubling his career prize money.\n\nFlag-waving fans in the packed grandstands at Uniprix Stadium had hoped for more magic in the battle of youngsters against the 20-year-old Zverev, but the German was too sharp, winning 81 per cent of the points off his serve compared to 64 per cent for Shapovalov.\n\nShapovalov, from Richmond Hill, Ont., held his serve through a more than 14-minute game early on, but lost it to go down 4-5 in the opening set, double faulting on break point. It was the fourth time in five matches he lost the first set, but this time there was no coming back.\n\nHe wasted two break points at 4-3 in the second, and Zverev was able to get the break for 6-5 after two Shapovalov double faults. It set up a wild final game, with Shapovalov saving two match points and Zverev erasing three break points before it ended with a misfired backhand by the Canadian.\n\nFederer reached his sixth final of the year, and will be seeking a sixth win.\n\nHe had considering skipping the event, which would have been disastrous for the promoters with world No. 1 Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka already out with injuries. However, Federer decided to play and now has a chance to add to a tally that includes Australian Open and Wimbledon titles this year.\n\n\"I'm very happy that I've made it here,\" he said. \"It was a good decision for me.\n\n\"If I would have known I would have gone to the finals, I would have said 'yes' right away. Sometimes you've just got to wait and see how you feel. I'm most happy that I'm actually really healthy going into the finals. I haven't wasted too much energy. I've been able to keep points short. I've been really clean at net. I think my concentration and just my playing has gone up a notch. I'm just playing better.\"\n\nThe second-seeded Federer is seeking a third Rogers Cup title, but his first in Montreal, having won in 2004 and 2006 in Toronto. A victory would give Federer, currently ranked third in the world, one of the top two seeds at the U.S. Open that begins Aug. 28 in New York.\n\nThe 36-year-old, coming off victories in Germany and at Wimbledon, is on a 16-match winning streak, his longest since 2012.\n\nHaase, who upset seventh-seeded Grigor Dimitrov in the third round, was in his first career semifinal of a Masters Series tournament.\n\n\"I hope it gives me a lot of confidence,\" Haase said of his performance for the week. \"Next week (in Cincinnati), different conditions, different courts, so it's tournament by tournament. But, in general, to make an achievement like this is good because it shows you can do it.\"\n\nIn a semifinals, seventh-seeded Rohan Bopanna of India and Ivan Dodig of Croatia defeated sixth-seeded Raven Klaasen of the Netherlands and Rajeev Ram of the United States 4-6, 7-6 (8), 11-9; and fifth-seeded Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut of France downed eighth-seeded Oliver Marach of Austria and Mate Pavic of Croatia 7-5, 6-3.\n\n-- Bill Beacon, The Canadian Press", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-28", "textEnd": 2923, "textStart": 2916}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T02:34:00Z", "sim": 0.6039215922355652, "source": {"uri": "ottawacitizen.com", "title": "Ottawa Citizen", "id": "1720"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "02:34:00", "url": "http://ottawacitizen.com/sports/tennis/canadian-denis-shapovalov-ousted-in-rogers-cup-tennis-semifinals", "storyUri": "eng-3353129", "id": "8863739", "image": "http://wpmedia.ottawacitizen.com/2017/08/ten-rogers-cup-men-20170812.jpg?w=640", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "02:34:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

We played twice on the Tour, once in Qatar, once in Basel in our home tournament, in the semis. Both times I won, I was like, ah, s-t. I wished he won as well because it would have done much more for his career than for me. \"Yeah, in the juniors, I just felt sometimes when I used to play guys, you know, somewhere in the world where I felt like technically maybe they were struggling. I just felt like, oh, he's trying so hard, he's such a fighter,\" Federer said. \"I don't know, I feel like probably he works harder than I do, so he probably deserves it more. Then he beat me and I'm like, I feel so bad. I'm such an idiot for falling into that trap.\n\n\"Ever since I came on Tour, I just feel like you go out there, try your best,\" he added. \"Afterward, if everything's relaxed, again after the match, you can go for coffee or whatever you want to do. In the moment itself, I don't think you want to feel sorry for the guy.\"\n\nThe 35-year-old Ferrer was a perennial top-10 player until he began to drop in the rankings last year and he's currently No. 33. He broke Federer in the second game of the match and held on to take the first set. But Federer got his act together and won the next two sets to take the match.\n\n\"I show up, and I actually feel really happy because I know I can play a lot better. David can play a lot better, too,\" Federer said. \"We battled, both tried to find a way to win. You know, he had a good start, I had a better finish. That was important, you know. So for me, take it how it is and hope that this match gives me some better rhythm and confidence, against (Roberto) Bautista Agut, who plays actually very similar to David today.\n\nWhat's in a name: Denis Shapovalov gives an English pronunciation to his first name and he was asked how he feels about fans this week using the French version. \"I have mixed feelings on that,\" he said. \"Actually I have a funny story. I did Create My Own Pro in NHL 2017. There's an option to give him the name with two Ns or one N. I was like, Obviously one N. Then the commentator started calling Denis (not pronouncing the S). I'm like, 'No, that's not right'). But I've gotten used to it now.

It was not long after he'd left the court, to the kind of thunderous roar that Jarry Park had reserved for a Bill Stoneman no-hitter or Gary Carter home runs. It was not quite 11:00 on Thursday evening, after he'd passed the throng of hundreds waiting for him along the outdoor concourse, through a dark tunnel into an indoor building and a plush, empty, carpeted locker room.\n\nIt was not quite 10 minutes after the greatest accomplishment of Denis Shapovalov's young life that this 18-year-old stood shirtless in the middle of that locker room with his physiotherapist, Nick Martichenko, his coach, Martin Laurendeau, and Canadian Olympic doctor, Nick Sauve, and breathlessly wondered aloud, \"What the hell just happened?\"\n\nAnd nobody in the room could really answer his question.\n\n\"You told me you like sushi,\" Laurendeau told him, holding two containers of rolls and sashimi.\n\nShapovalov grabbed one of the boxes and went into the back shower area for a 15-minute ice-bath session as part of his recovery. Martichenko followed him. The sounds of laughter and joy came from that adjacent room, while the coach and Sauve tried to put into context what they'd just witnessed.\n\nLaurendeau: \"Doc, he just took it to him and took his chances and pulled the triggers.

That game at one-all in the third set, I mean, how long did it go?\"\n\nOver 14 minutes.\n\n\"Unbelievable,\" Laurendeau said, shaking his head. \"That was Maddux versus Jeter at the plate. Thirty-two pitches. Unbelievable. I just don't know what to say.\"\n\nJust down the hall, Nick Kyrgios did. He'd watched the final match of the night in its entirety. After it was done he walked through the players' lounge, a beer lifted in the air and chanted \"SHA-POH-VAH-LOV.\" Then he got everyone's attention and yelled, \"Here's to Denis!\"\n\nMeanwhile, back beside the locker room, Shapovalov sat in that ice bath, trying to get his legs back, not touching the sushi, checking his phone, yelling at how damn cold the 11-degree pool was. \"Do I look like I'm enjoying this?\" he asked to anyone who would listen.\n\nThen he cramped up, and Sauve applied pressure to his quad, and all was okay for a minute, as Shapovalov sat in the inflated pool of cold water, his feet extended wide. Then his coach arrived to continue the match breakdown.\n\n\"You kept coming at him,\" Laurendeau said. \"You lost seven, eight points, but you kept hitting unbelievable shots and the last three you won - because you kept at it.\"\n\nShapovalov didn't seem to be paying attention. All was quiet for a while. And then he repeated three times: \"I don't know how I did it. I don't know what happened.\"\n\nThe poignant moment lasted a minute. Then his quad cramped again and Sauve went back to work on him, and when it calmed down, everyone but Denis started laughing. \"You love my pain!\" Shapovalov yelled at them.\n\nSports culture: deriving joy from the misery of those closest to you.\n\nOut of the ice bath and with his post-match recovery duties all but done, he went to say hello and goodbye to the friends and family he'd had in the crowd -- his friend Penny Oleksiak (see sidebar), and his mother, Tessa Shapovalov, among them.\n\nAs Oleksiak and others looked on, Levine also bombed southpaw serves at him, plenty of which went to the body to get Shapovalov used to the spin. At one point, a serve handcuffed the teenager and Levine yelled, \"That's Randy Johnson out there, baby,\" likely unaware a kid born in 1999 probably doesn't even know who the towering, former big league pitcher even is.\n\nBut the leftie prep paid off. And as he got a final wind-down massage that night, Shapovalov said the in-match moment he remembered most from the win over Nadal was his forehand approach shot on match point. \"I played it so loose, so clean,\" he said.\n\nSomeone talked about getting Shapovalov some real food to eat, and the sushi was pushed aside and a plate of noodles and chicken arrived. He began to stab away at it when his phone rang. His long-time junior coach, Adriano Fuorivia, was calling.\n\n\"We did it!\" Shapovalov yelled at Fuorivia on speakerphone. \"And I'm cramping and trying to eat some pasta!\"\n\nFuorivia told him how proud he was of him, and then mocked him about a moment or two in the match that had Shapovalov in hysterics.\n\n\"I'm not going to talk about your volleys,\" joked Fuorivia.\n\nLaurendeau retreated to the back of the room, away from the noise. The enormity of the moment was sinking in for the 53-year-old Canadian tennis lifer. This was Nadal, dammit, on Centre Court, at home, of the Rogers Cup. No player this young has ever reached a quarterfinal of a Masters 1000. Laurendeau is a former tour pro, now coaching and captaining the country's Davis Cup team. He was there when Daniel Nestor upset then-World No. 1 Stefan Edberg in 1992; he wore the maple leaf at the Olympics; he's a walking encyclopedia of Canadian tennis history.\n\n\"It's one of the greatest moments in Canadian sports,\" he said. \"There's been some great nights of tennis here, and this one was really unbelievable. To beat a legend like this.... It was just a magical night of tennis.\"\n\nShapovalov continued to eat pasta, but did so standing up, hoping his body wouldn't tighten up on him again. He guzzled water. His media session was a few minutes away now. He jammed more food down and a grin broke across his face.\n\n\"If I'm cramping, can I take the elevator?\" he asked.\n\nThere's a rule at Tennis Canada's high-performance complex: juniors, until the age of 19, must take the stairs. It's a seniority thing. And no, not even beating Nadal would allow him to skirt the laws of the land at the national tennis centre. Shapovalov can ride the elevator next year. For the next nine months, including Thursday night, the stairs it is.\n\nNow he's in the quarterfinal Friday against Adrian Mannarino, a winnable match that could propel him to No. 66 in the world. With No. 99 watching, Shapovalov could end up with Mario's number next to his name. Go figure.\n\nIf he gets past Mannarino, he's one win away from Sunday's final. Roger Federer is the top seed remaining and on the opposite side of the draw. Imagine that meeting. And just when you want to write off Shapovalov's chances of winning it all - even at the mere thought - you remember the Nadal match. The clutch shots he made and the lack of nerves he showed in big moments.\n\nSo, what did just happen Thursday night and what does it mean? Well, from here on in, that's anybody's guess.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T15:20:00Z", "sim": 0.6000000238418579, "source": {"uri": "sportsnet.ca", "title": "Sportsnet", "id": "1184"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "15:20:00", "url": "http://www.sportsnet.ca/tennis/inside-post-match-celebration-denis-shapovalov/", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8646993", "image": "http://assets1.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Denis-Shapovalov-Rogers-Cup.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "15:20:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

weeks.\n\nCanadian teenager Denis Shapovalov upset the odds to defeat top seed Rafael Nadal in their Rogers Cup third round match on Thursday night (10 August).\n\nThe 18-year-old needed a close tie-break as he defeated the world number two 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 to advance to the last eight.\n\nShapovalov, who earlier this year made headlines for striking an umpire, also made history as he is now the youngest Masters 1000 quarter-finalist ever while he also boasts the distinction of being the second youngest player to defeat Nadal after Borna Coric.\n\nThe world number 143 already beat Rogerio Dutra Silva and former US Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro and will now face France's Adrian Mannarino in the quarter-final on Friday (11 August).\n\nAs for Nadal, the performance was a big blow, not only as he failed to break Shapovalov six times in the third set but also missed the chance to regain his world number one ranking.\n\nIf the Spaniard had reached the semi-final stage in Montreal, he would have been guaranteed to return to the summit of tennis following world number one Andy Murray's withdrawal from the event due to injury. Instead, he will now have to win in Cincinnati to overtake the Briton.\n\nHowever, world number three Roger Federer could take top spot well. If the Swiss ace wins the Rogers Cup and goes on to win the Cincinnati Open, he will become the new world number one ahead of the US Open.\n\nFederer can also take confidence from the fact that he has already defeated Nadal three times, including two finals in the calendar year, if they are to face in Cincinnati.\n\nThe 19-time Grand Slam winner most recently extended his record against Spain's David Ferrer to 17-0 and will face another Spaniard in Roberto Bautista Agut on Friday in the Rogers Cup quarter-final.\n\nThe other quarter-final matches on Friday include a clash between Holland's Robin Haase and Argentina's Diego Schwartzman as well as the talented German Alexander Zverev taking on South Africa's Kevin Anderson.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-10", "textEnd": 229, "textStart": 220}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-11", "textEnd": 805, "textStart": 796}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T05:21:00Z", "sim": 0.5921568870544434, "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.co.uk", "title": "International Business Times UK", "id": "713"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "05:21:00", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/denis-shapovalov-upsets-rafael-nadals-world-no-1-bid-roger-federer-given-boost-1634559", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8541712", "image": "https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1630386/rafael-nadal-denis-shapovalov.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "05:21:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

A FEW TIMES: The win over Nadal put Shapovalov into the quarter-finals of the Rogers Cup, making him the youngest player to advance to the tournament's final eight since Bjorn Borg in 1974. He's also the youngest quarter-finalist ever at an ATP Masters event, the highest level on the pro tour. In 2016, he became just the second Canadian to win the Wimbledon boys singles title. Filip Peliwo in 2012 was the first.\n\n---\n\nHE'S A LEFTY: Like tennis greats John McEnroe, Martina Navratilova, Jimmy Connors and Nadal, Shapovalov is left-handed. But being a southpaw may not give him the same advantage it gave some of his predecessors. Technical advances in rackets and court surfaces as well as a changes in game strategy and the rise of the two-handed backhand have levelled the playing field in recent years.\n\n---\n\nHE'S BEEN COMPARED TO ROGER FEDERER: Tennis analyst Craig O'Shannessy once described the young Canadian as \"a left-handed version of Federer, with that one-handed backhand,\" according to the Telegraph in Britain. O'Shannessy also said there is \"no ceiling\" for Shapovalov, and praised his \"great energy and rapport with the crowd.\" He's certainly made an impression this week in Montreal, with Wayne Gretzky and star swimmer Penny Oleksiak among his boosters in the stands.\n\n---\n\nHE RECENTLY CHANGED COACHES: Before the start of the season, his first full campaign as a pro, Shapovalov split with his coach Adriano Fuorivia, who he had worked with for more than four years. Canadian Davis Cup captain Martin Laurendeau was hired as his replacement. Shapovalov said earlier this year that he and Fuorivia are on good terms despite parting ways. \"Adriano thought that someone with more experience like Marty would be a good benefit to my team,\" he said. \"It was nothing that happened between us, it was just more of a decision that we made together.\"\n\n---\n\nHE'S STILL A KID: Shapovalov showed a flash of immaturity when a ball he carelessly hit in frustration during a Davis Cup match in February struck a chair umpire in the eye. He dealt with the fallout like a man however, making no excuses for the incident, saying he lost control of his emotions and behaved unprofessionally. While he apologized to the umpire, his teammates and tennis fans, the International Tennis Federation didn't let him off the hook. He was fined US$7,000.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T16:06:00Z", "sim": 0.5843137502670288, "source": {"uri": "brandonsun.com", "title": "Brandon Sun", "id": "2087"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "16:06:00", "url": "https://www.brandonsun.com/sports/breaking-news/on-the-rise-get-to-know-budding-tennis-rising-star-denis-shapovalov-439867273.html", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8655898", "image": "https://media.brandonsun.com/images/644*432/pch162419904.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "16:06:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Nadal entered the Canadian Open, the last ATP Masters 1000 event before the US Open, as the No. 1 seed a month after his fourth-round loss at Wimbledon.\n\nNadal clinched the first set (6-3), before dropping the second set (6-4) and eventually losing a tie-breaker in the third set. The 18-year-old Shapovalov, one of the fastest rising stars in the #NextGenATP circuit, made a memorable debut during last year's Rogers Cup and has followed it up this year with victories over Juan Martin del Potro in the Round of 32 and a win over Nadal -- arguably the biggest victory of his young career.\n\n\"He played well.

With the victory, Federer set up Friday's quarter-final showdown against Roberto Bautista Agut.\n\nRoger Federer a big fan of Denis Shapovalov\n\nFederer, a big endorser of #NextGenATP talent, came away impressed with Shapovalov after watching the Canadian teenager play in the Wimbledon juniors a few years back. \"He came out, had these big shots, great sliding serve and a lot of different types of shots, and I like to see that. I'm a big fan of his, and I'm sure we're going to see a lot of Denis in the future,\" Federer said of the future star.\n\nEarlier in this year, Denis Shapovalov had set a goal of reaching the Top 150 of the Emirates ATP Rankings. But his success at the Canadian Open should catapult him into the Top-100 and he has set his sights on the inaugural Next Gen ATP Finals, which will feature the finest 21-and-under singles players on the Tour.\n\nThe 2017 US Open will get underway on Aug. 28. With Novak Djokvic and Andy Murray dealing with recurring injury woes, the tennis world is expecting either Federer or Nadal to continue their dominance of 2017 with another age-defying feat. The ongoing Montreal Masters is the last stop for the athletes before the final grand slam of the year at Flushing Meadows.\n\nDenis, Denis, Denis!!! ____ __ #CoupeRogers pic.twitter.com/1tRPKBHGrn\n\n-- Coupe Rogers (@CoupeRogers) August 11, 2017", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-11", "textEnd": 956, "textStart": 941, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-28", "textEnd": 1989, "textStart": 1982}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T02:14:00Z", "sim": 0.5843137502670288, "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com.au", "title": "International Business Times AU", "id": "5833"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "06:19:00", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com.au/rafael-nadal-upset-denis-shapovalov-montreal-masters-1558084", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8548777", "image": "http://cdnau.ibtimes.com/sites/au.ibtimes.com/files/styles/large/public/2017/08/11/rafael-nadal-denis-shapovalov.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "02:14:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

A FEW TIMES: The win over Nadal put Shapovalov into the quarter-finals of the Rogers Cup, making him the youngest player to advance to the tournament's final eight since Bjorn Borg in 1974. He's also the youngest quarter-finalist ever at an ATP Masters event, the highest level on the pro tour. In 2016, he became just the second Canadian to win the Wimbledon boys singles title. Filip Peliwo in 2012 was the first.\n\n---\n\nHE'S A LEFTY: Like tennis greats John McEnroe, Martina Navratilova, Jimmy Connors and Nadal, Shapovalov is left-handed. But being a southpaw may not give him the same advantage it gave some of his predecessors. Technical advances in rackets and court surfaces as well as a changes in game strategy and the rise of the two-handed backhand have levelled the playing field in recent years.\n\n---\n\nHE'S BEEN COMPARED TO ROGER FEDERER: Tennis analyst Craig O'Shannessy once described the young Canadian as \"a left-handed version of Federer, with that one-handed backhand,\" according to the Telegraph in Britain. O'Shannessy also said there is \"no ceiling\" for Shapovalov, and praised his \"great energy and rapport with the crowd.\" He's certainly made an impression this week in Montreal, with Wayne Gretzky and star swimmer Penny Oleksiak among his boosters in the stands.\n\n---\n\nHE RECENTLY CHANGED COACHES: Before the start of the season, his first full campaign as a pro, Shapovalov split with his coach Adriano Fuorivia, who he had worked with for more than four years. Canadian Davis Cup captain Martin Laurendeau was hired as his replacement. Shapovalov said earlier this year that he and Fuorivia are on good terms despite parting ways. \"Adriano thought that someone with more experience like Marty would be a good benefit to my team,\" he said. \"It was nothing that happened between us, it was just more of a decision that we made together.\"\n\n---\n\nHE'S STILL A KID: Shapovalov showed a flash of immaturity when a ball he carelessly hit in frustration during a Davis Cup match in February struck a chair umpire in the eye. He dealt with the fallout like a man however, making no excuses for the incident, saying he lost control of his emotions and behaved unprofessionally. While he apologized to the umpire, his teammates and tennis fans, the International Tennis Federation didn't let him off the hook. He was fined US$7,000.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T15:46:00Z", "sim": 0.5803921818733215, "source": {"uri": "metronews.ca", "title": "Metro Toronto", "id": "391"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "15:46:00", "url": "http://www.metronews.ca/news/canada/2017/08/11/on-the-rise-get-to-know-budding-tennis-rising-star-denis-shapovalov.html", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8652009", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "15:46:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

In doing so, it kept a clear road upto the numero uno spot on the rankings chart for Rafael Nadal. With just few hundred points behind the Brit, the 31-year-old had the opportunity to reclaim the No. 1 spot for the first time since June 2014, with the condition of a semi-final showing.\n\nHowever, after successfully edging past Coric in Round of 32, the 15-time Grand Slam winner succumbed to failure in the third round to Canadian teenager Shapovalov.\n\nShapovalov was the obvious crowd favourite, but Nadal's impressive first set win shut the packed Centre Court. This, however, didn't take a toll on the teenager as he bounced back to a sensational 6-4 win over the Spaniard, thereby pushing for a third set. In the decider, Nadal went up 3-0 to pile up pressure on the 2016 Wimbledon Junior champion, but Shapovalov fought back with two ravishing aces and then script an upset over Nadal, just putting his hope of becoming the Wolrd No. 1 on a hold.\n\nWith his victory on home turf, the 18-year-old became the youngest ATP Masters 1000 quarter-finalist and also the second youngest player to defeat Rafael Nadal.\n\nIt's my worst loss of the year because it's a loss to the opponent with the lowest ranking and because I had chance to be No. 1,\" he told reporters. \"He played well.

Notably, he had decimated Zverev in the final of Halle 6-1, 6-3 earlier this year.\n\nFederer has made sure he did not have to spend a lot of time on the court, edging past his opponents with ease.

Notably, Zverev has lost only one final and has clinched four titles in 2017.\n\nHaving won his maiden Masters 1000 tournament in Rome, beating Novak Djokovic in the final, Zverev will be confident heading into what will be one of the biggest tests of his nascent career.\n\nFederer will be wary of Zverev's serving abilityMinas Panagiotakis/Getty Images\n\nAlso, Zverev has also beaten the big man once -- in Halle semi-final last year.

Yeah, then he gave me a double [fault] to tie it up.\n\n\"I just tried to stay calm, tried to play every point, go for my shots. At the end of the day I really tried to keep playing my game and stick to my tactics.\"\n\nNadal, who needed only to beat the 143rd-ranked Shapovalov and then Adrian Mannarino to return to No. 1 on Monday, will have to win until after Cincinnati to get back to the top.\n\n\"It probably is the worst lose of the year, without a doubt, for me,\" Nadal said. \"He played well. I played really bad. When this kind of thing happens, the only thing you can do is wish the opponent the best.\n\n\"It is probably my worst loss of the year because I lost against a player with a lower ranking. At the same time, because of the opportunity I had here to come back to No. 1. Always tough, but the draw was not that impossible after all the matches that were happening. So it was an important mistake from me.\"\n\nAt 18 years, 3 months, Shapovalov is the youngest quarterfinalist in ATP Masters 1y (since 1990) and he's the youngest quarterfinalist at the Canadian Open since Bjorn Borg (18 years, 2 months) in 1974.\n\nFrom the youngest to the oldest, Roger Federer register his 17th straight win over David Ferrer, but had to work to do. Federer didn't play his best and struggled with his serve for much of the day, but prevailed in the end 4-6, 6-4, 6-2.\n\n\"From the baseline, I didn't have enough rhythm. The court is fast here. Of course, because of the surface, that it's fast, you can't just decide to put the ball in because physically David is very strong. You can't do that. You have to go into the battle. You have to accept you're going to make mistakes. But you have to keep moving forward.\n\n\"I tried with my intensity and focus to change the match, and this is what I was able to do. I was able also to change the angles, and that helped me win the match.\"\n\nNext for Federer is another Spaniard he has dominated in Roberto Bautista Agut. Agut outlasted Gael Monfils in a third set tiebreaker 4-6, 7-6(5), 7-6(2). The Swiss has won all six meetings with Agut, never having dropped a set.\n\n\"We battled, both tried to find a way to win. He had a good start, I had a better finish,\" Federer said. \"That was important. For me, take it how it is and hope that this match gives me some better rhythm and confidence against Bautista Agut, who plays actually very similar to David today.\"\n\nAlexander Zverev stayed hot rolling past Nick Kyrgios 6-4, 6-3. The German 20-year-old now meets Kevin Anderson who stopped Sam Querrey 6-4, 6-1.\n\n\"The momentum is definitely with me. But I'm playing Anderson tomorrow,\" said Zverev who has won his last seven matches. \"He's played a lot of matches. He's playing very, very well. It's going to be another interesting one.\"\n\nTomorrow opens with a surprise quarterfinal on Center as Diego Schwartzman meets Robin Haase for a spot in a first Masters semifinal for either. Schwartzman rallied from a 6-0, 2-0 hole against American 20-year-old to win 0-6, 7-5, 7-5.\n\nHaase reached his first Canadian quarterfinals by bouncing Grigor Dimitrov 7-6(3), 4-6, 6-1.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T06:38:00Z", "sim": 0.5686274766921997, "source": {"uri": "tennis-x.com", "title": "tennis-x.com", "id": "9533"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "06:38:00", "url": "http://www.tennis-x.com/xblog/2017-08-11/26684.php", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8551404", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "06:38:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Just a month ago he had clinched his record eight Wimbledon title at SW19 and now he his up for yet another, not a Grand Slam final though. Breezing past Dutchman Robin Haase 6-3 7-6(5) in the semi-final round of the Rogers Cup 2017, Roger Federer has eased into yet another ATP Tour final on Sunday.\n\nIt was almost a fortnight after his 19th Grand Slam victory at the All England Club, Roger Federer had announced his entry into the Canadian hardcourt tournament. He had last played the event back in 2011 where he had lost to Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the third round. After almost six years of gap, the Swiss maestro returned to tennis action at Montreal.\n\nIt wasn't much of a hassle for the recently turned 36-year-old at Rogers Cup 2017. It had all been straight set victories till his road to the semis. Up next was Netherlands tennis player Hasse, who was playing his first ATP World Tour Masters 1000 semi-final. Federer served nine cutting edge aces and lost just nine points on his serve as he stormed into his sixth final of the year.\n\n\"I'm happy I'm playing as well as I am this year on the match courts. At the end that's what matters because I spent hours and hours on the practice courts in the last year, he said.\n\nWith a yet another comfortable victory in the tournament, Roger Federer extended his winning streak to 16 matches, a record he had scripted back in 2012. The Swiss tennis ace will now be aiming for his third Rogers Cup title, having last won the trophy in 2004 and then in 2006. However, this will be his first trophy in Montreal, the other two were clinched in Toronto, owing to the format of the game.\n\nIn the final, he is up against fourth-seeded Alexander Zverev, who stopped Dennis Shapovalov's dream run in the campaign, early on Sunday. This will be Federer's 141st tennis final and he would be chasing his 94th ATP World Tour title, clinching which he could find his name alongside Ivan Lendl for second-most titles in Open Era. Jimmy Connors still leads the race with 109.\n\nNow the most important...will the win on Monday make him closer to the World No. 1 spot on the ATP rankings? Yes, it is.\n\nUp untill now, the discussion was about Rafael Nadal. With the announcement of Andy Murray's withdrawal from Rogers Cup 2017, it kept a clear road to numero uno spot on the rankings chart for Rafael Nadal. With just few hundred points behind the Brit, the 31-year-old had the opportunity to reclaim the No. 1 spot for the first time since June 2014, with the condition of a semi-final showing. But unfortunate for the Spaniard, he was shown the exit door by Shapovalov in the very third round of his tournament, putting his bid to World No. 1 spot on hold.\n\nSpeculations were also that Federer was in the race for the numero uno spot and now with Nadal's shock exit, the road seems clear for him. If he is able to win the Rogers Cup tomorrow, then he is bound to become the World No.1 yet again, on August 21 with an equal or a better finish than Nadal at the Cincinnati masters.\n\nWell, Federer does hold a 2-1 advantage over Zverev which includes his recent victory at Wimbledon. Ergo the first step seems all clear, just the Cincinnati masters to go.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-21", "textEnd": 2994, "textStart": 2985}, {"amb": false, "date": "2014-06-", "textEnd": 2534, "textStart": 2525}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T12:33:00Z", "sim": 0.5607843399047852, "source": {"uri": "zeenews.india.com", "title": "Zee News", "id": "1741"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "12:33:00", "url": "http://zeenews.india.com/tennis/with-rafael-nadals-exit-roger-federer-threat-looms-on-andy-murrays-world-no-1-spot-2032631.html", "storyUri": "eng-3353129", "id": "8914700", "image": "http://ste.india.com/sites/default/files/2017/08/13/616509-roger-federer-wimbledon-3-reuters.jpg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "12:33:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

record a stunning upset victory over top seed Rafael Nadal in the third round of the Rogers Cup on Thursday.\n\nThe lanky wild card kissed the Montreal court after completing a rousing 3-6 6-4 7-6(4) triumph as the 18-year-old became the youngest player to ever reach the quarter-finals of an ATP Masters 1000 event.\n\nThe early exit also denied world number two Nadal a chance to take over from the absent Andy Murray at the top of the rankings, a position the Spaniard would have regained for the first time since 2014 had he advanced to the semi-finals.\n\nShapovalov showed no sign of nerves in their first ever meeting, the left-hander playing the more aggressive tennis by utilising his huge forehand on roundhouse swings and frequently attacking the net.\n\nThe teenager's quixotic bid looked doomed in the third set tiebreaker when he fell 3-0 behind but the world number 143 refused to buckle and only coughed up one more point in the decider.\n\nAs a reward for his unlikely victory, the 2016 Wimbledon junior champion will next face 29-year-old Frenchman Adrian Mannarino in the quarter-finals on Friday.\n\nElsewhere, world number three Roger Federer dropped his first set since June but the Swiss recovered to dispatch Spaniard David Ferrer 4-6 6-4 6-2 in their last 16 meeting.\n\nFederer was sloppy from the outset on centre court, sending routine forehands wide and providing the underdog Ferrer with early break opportunities in the Montreal encounter.\n\nIn other tournament action, American Jared Donaldson lost to Diego Schwartzman 0-6 7-5 7-5, while his countryman Sam Querrey was thrashed 6-4 6-1 by Kevin Anderson of South Africa.\n\nAustralian Nick Kyrgios fell 6-4 6-3 to fourth seed Alexander Zverev as the German finally claimed victory over his opponent in their third meeting of the season.\n\nSEARCH", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T05:44:00Z", "sim": 0.529411792755127, "source":

The women's side features five seeded players, although big names Venus Williams, Angelique Kerber and Agnieszka Radwanska were sent home in Round 3.\n\nHere are the latest results from the Masters event in Canada.\n\nNo. 6 Caroline Wozniacki def. No. 10 Agnieszka Radwanska; 6-3, 6-1\n\nDenis Shapovalov Pulls Massive Upset over Rafael Nadal\n\nRafael Nadal had his eyes on becoming the new No. 1 player in the world, but instead, it was a magical night for 18-year-old Denis Shapovalov.\n\nAfter dropping the first set, Shapovalov showed no fear in the second, bringing fans to their feet as they cheered on the Canadian youngster. This exchange was arguably the best of the day:\n\nSupplementing these finishes with five aces (after zero in the first set), he was able to win the second set 6-4.\n\nHis grit was apparent once again in the third set with one game especially lasting a long time, via Ben Rothenberg of the New York Times:\n\nThe decisive set eventually went to a tiebreak, and while Nadal took a 3-0 lead, Shapovalov closed out the victory.\n\nHe entered the week ranked No. 143 in the world, but the biggest win of his career will ensure he doesn't get overlooked ever again.\n\nThe theme of the day in the men's draw was come-from-behind wins. Roberto Bautista Agut and Diego Schwartzman both overcame first-set losses to win, with Schwartzman even losing 0-6 in the opening frame.\n\nRoger Federer continued the trend, following up a 4-6 loss in the first set with a 6-4, 6-2 finish. Jose Morgado of Record Portugal reacted to the performance:\n\nFederer was sloppy throughout the first set, struggling to get his first serve in play and handing his opponent plenty of points through unforced errors. He cleaned things up in the last two sets, totaling eight aces with just one double fault in that stretch.\n\nHe was broken just once in nine service games after the first set.\n\nFerrer played well at times, but few men in the world can beat Federer once his serve is going.\n\nIf you were going to predict this match to end in less than one hour, you would probably expect the No. 3 seed to get the win over the opponent ranked No. 934 in the world. That was not the case Thursday.\n\nUnseeded Sloane Stephens dominated the third-seeded Angelique Kerber with a two-set win, dropping just four games in a dominant third-round showing.\n\nStephens has had to overcome injuries in recent years and didn't have a single win in 2017 coming into the Rogers Cup. However, she now has three in a row, including a victory over No. 14 seed Petra Kvitova.\n\nWTA Insider noted how long it has been since the American had this big of a win:\n\n\"Everything is good,\" Stephens said after the match, per Matt Cronin of TennisReporters.net. \"Body is good. Nothing is hurting. So I'm on the right track.\"\n\nAs long as she remains healthy, she can be a threat for the rest of the tournament and the rest of the year.\n\nThere were two matchups between top-10 seeds in the women's draw Thursday and neither ended up being particularly close.\n\nThe biggest disappointment of the day was No. 9 Venus Williams, who provided almost no resistance against No. 5 Elina Svitolina.\n\nSvitolina was outstanding defensively, winning 55 percent of return points on Williams' first serves. She was even more dominant against the second serve with a 70 percent success rate.\n\nThis second-set point showed her ability to pick up almost everything:\n\nWilliams is coming off a finals appearance at Wimbledon, but she didn't perform anywhere near this level in the third-round battle.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T02:14:00Z", "sim": 0.4980392158031464, "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "title": "Bleacher Report", "id": "3199"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "06:19:00", "url": "http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2726832-rogers-cup-2017-rafael-nadal-venus-williams-angelique-kerber-eliminated", "storyUri": "eng-3347316", "id": "8548766", "image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/688/551/hi-res-c485f1936e26d78a31254ee820b97514_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "02:14:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Shapovalov delighted his home fans when he battled from a set down to record a stunning upset victory over top seed Rafael Nadal in the third round of the Rogers Cup on Thursday.\n\nThe lanky wild card kissed the Montreal court after completing a rousing 3-6 6-4 7-6(4) triumph as the 18-year-old became the youngest player to ever reach the quarter-finals of an ATP Masters 1000 event.\n\nThe early exit also denied world number two Nadal a chance to take over from the absent Andy Murray at the top of the rankings, a position the Spaniard would have regained for the first time since 2014 had he advanced to the semi-finals.\n\nShapovalov showed no sign of nerves in their first ever meeting, the left-hander playing the more aggressive tennis by utilising his huge forehand on roundhouse swings and frequently attacking the net.\n\nThe teenager's quixotic bid looked doomed in the third set tiebreaker when he fell 3-0 behind but the world number 143 refused to buckle and only coughed up one more point in the decider.\n\nAs a reward for his unlikely victory, the 2016 Wimbledon junior champion will next face 29-year-old Frenchman Adrian Mannarino in the quarter-finals on Friday.\n\nAdrian Mannarino (France) beat Chung Hyeon (South Korea) 6-3 6-3\n\n4-Alexander Zverev (Germany) beat 16-Nick Kyrgios (Australia) 6-4 6-3\n\n2-Roger Federer (Switzerland) beat David Ferrer

Shapovalov threw a ball in a fit of anger and injured an umpire.

top-seeded Rafael Nadal 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4) in the third round.\n\nThe 18-year-old Shapovalov from Richmond Hill, Ontario, advanced to a quarter-final with France's Adrian Mannarino, who defeated Hyeon Chung of South Korea 6-3, 6-3.\n\n\"It's what I dreamed of all my life growing up, playing guys like Rafa, Roger [Federer], Andy [Murray],\" Shapovalov said. \"You know, my dream came true today.\"\n\nShapovalov has taken major strides this week to reach his goal of cracking the world's top 100 with wins over Rogerio Dutra Silva and 2009 US Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro.\n\nHe also halted Nadal's bid to regain the No. 1 ranking, which the Spaniard could have achieved by reaching the semi-finals.\n\nShapovalov battled back after Nadal cruised through the first set, then erased a 3-0 deficit in the tiebreaker for the biggest victory of his career.\n\nShapovalov became the youngest player to reach the tournament's quarter-finals since Bjorn Borg in 1974.\n\nWith hockey great Wayne Gretzky and Olympic swimming star Penny Oleksiak cheering for him from the seats, he also became the youngest quarter-finalist at a Masters Series tournament ever and is the youngest to beat a player ranked in the top two in the world since Nadal beat Federer in 2004 in Miami.\n\n\"He has a great potential. I wish him the best. He has everything to become a great player. He played with the right determination in the important moments,\" Nadal said.\n\nMeanwhile, Federer overcame a weak first set to post a 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 victory over Spaniard David Ferrer in an earlier third-round match.\n\nIn the quarter-finals, the second-seeded Federer is to face 12th-seeded Roberto Bautista Agut of Spain, who outlasted Frenchman Gael Monfils 4-6, 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-2) on center court.\n\nUnseeded Argentine Diego Schwartzman posted a strange win over American Jared Donaldson 0-6, 7-5, 7-5 to advance to a quarter-final meeting with 52nd-ranked Dutchman Robin Haase.\n\nKevin Anderson of South Africa downed American Sam Querrey 6-4, 6-1 and is to next play fourth-seeded Alexander Zverev, who ousted 16th-seeded Nick Kyrgios 6-4, 6-3.\n\nIn the women's contest, Karolina Pliskova advanced to the quarter-finals when Japanese qualifier Naomi Osaka was forced to retire because of an injury.\n\nThe world's top-ranked player moved on with a 6-2, 6-7 (7-4), 1-0 victory when Osaka had to retire because of an abdominal injury.\n\nIt was not immediately clear when Osaka suffered the injury. She was in form during the tiebreaker, firing a service winner to convert her second set point under the warm sun.\n\nThe world's No. 50 player received treatment after the match and did not speak to reporters.\n\nPliskova is to move on to play sixth-seeded Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark, who defeated 10th-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland 6-3, 6-1.\n\nSecond-seeded Simona Halep of Romania needed only 59 minutes to breeze by Barbora Strycova of the Czech Republic 6-1, 6-0, while American Sloane Stephens upset third-seeded German Angelique Kerber 6-2, 6-2.\n\nLater on Thursday, fifth-seeded Ukrainian Elina Svitolina defeated American Venus Williams 6-2, 6-1, and Spain's Garbine Muguruza beat Australian qualifier Ashleigh Barty 6-0, 3-6, 6-2.\n\nIn doubles, Taiwan's Chuang Chia-jung and Renata Voracova of the Czech Republic fell to American Nicole Melichar and Ukraine's Lyudmyla Kichenok 6-4, 6-3.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T16:38:00Z", "sim": 0.4901960790157318, "source": {"uri": "taipeitimes.com", "title": "Taipei Times", "id": "3289"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "16:38:00", "url": "http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/sport/archives/2017/08/12/2003676369", "storyUri": "eng-3353129", "id": "8661902", "image": "http://www.taipeitimes.com/images/2017/08/12/thumbs/P16-170812-321.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "16:38:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Sin embargo, Shapovalov se mostr\u00f3 contento tras una gran actuaci\u00f3n en el torneo, donde elimin\u00f3 a Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro y al espa\u00f1ol Rafael Nadal, primera cabeza de serie.\n\n\"En la primera ronda, me salv\u00e9 de cuatro match points (ante el brasile\u00f1o Rogerio Dutra), y luego de eso me relaj\u00e9\", coment\u00f3 el canadiense. \"Dej\u00e9 que las cosas fluyeran y venc\u00ed a uno de mis \u00eddolos\".\n\nEn esta nota:Roger FedererAlexander ZverevTenisLA NACIONDeportesEl circuito ATP", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "dateEnd": "-06-07", "date": "-03-06", "textEnd": 767, "textStart": 758}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3353129", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T14:26:00Z", "sim": 0.5411764979362488, "source": {"uri": "lanacion.com.ar", "title": "La Nacion", "id": "1012"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "14:26:00", "url": "http://www.lanacion.com.ar/2052714-roger-federer-alexander-zverev-masters-1000-de-montreal", "storyUri": "spa-1072399", "id": "8926782", "image": "http://bucket.glanacion.com/anexos/fotos/14/2511814.jpg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "14:26:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}], "page": 1, "totalResults": 444, "count": 1}}}

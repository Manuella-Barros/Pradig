Scales, large bags that are commonly used for drug trafficking as well as the guns that are commonly used in drug trafficking operations,\" Mellott said.\n\nMellott said what ultimately led to the charges of abuse of a minor was finding a plastic bag that field tested positive for meth that was within a child's reach.\n\n\"The bag of meth was in a room with a bassinet, a child's bed, and it was literally laying on the floor, in plain view next to Narcan,\" Mellott said.\n\nSmith's attorneys said he did not live in the home where the meth was found, but according to Kentucky State Police's investigation, Smith did live in a camper on the property.\n\n\"Drugs, drug residue was found in the baby's room along with deplorable living conditions. That is definitely sufficient for criminal abuse and just because the man was sitting in the trailer and not inside the other two buildings which were within spitting distance, doesn't get him out of the other stuff,\" Judge Gregory Vincent said. \"Probable cause is found on all three individuals, matters referred to the Ohio County Grand Jury.\"\n\nA charge of abandonment of a minor was dismissed.\n\nTucker, Rudd and Smith pleaded not guilty to all of the new charges.\n\nOn June 5, authorities found Tucker, Rudd and Smith at a hotel, which prompted a welfare check of their home in Reynolds Station, Kentucky. They did not find Miya.\n\nOn June 6, Kentucky State Police opened the missing child investigation for Miya.\n\nOn June 9, her grandmother Billie Smith was arrested on an active warrant.\n\nOn June 11, authorities searched the area around the home with cadaver dogs but did not find Miya.\n\nOn June 12, Kentucky State Police searched the home of Miya's maternal grandparents Taletha and David Tucker, who were taking care of Miya's three siblings.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, authorities said they found the remains of Miya inside the home in Reynolds Station, Kentucky.\n\nMiya's body was sent to Louisville, Kentucky, for an autopsy, according to authorities.", "source": {"uri": "wsaw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://www.wsaw.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

KSP said that the body was \"hidden in a concealed manner.\" Police began searching for the baby over a week ago after relatives said that they had not seen Miya since late April.\n\nInvestigators found her parents, 29-year-old Tesla Tucker and 30-year-old Cage Rudd, at a hotel without the child. Tucker and Rudd, along with Miya's paternal grandparents, were arrested and charged earlier in the month with child abuse, abandonment, and several drug offenses. The child's maternal grandparents were arrested on Wednesday, June 12th, on outstanding warrants.\n\nKSP said that another man who previously lived at the Rudd home, was also charged with several drug offenses. During the search for baby Miya, KSP expressed their frustration with the lack of cooperation coming from the baby girl's family. Trooper Corey King, a KSP spokesperson, said that investigators were shocked by the lack of assistance and information from Miya's family, saying, \"the ones who should love and care the most.\"\n\nWhen searching for Miya, police had used cadaver dogs to search a church, cemetery, and a wooded area behind the family's home and later brought in sonar equipment and a forensic examiner team. The body will be taken to the Kentucky Medical Examiner's Office in Louisville for an autopsy.\n\nAccording to WLWT, Miya had siblings who were living with the mother's grandparents and have since been removed from the home. King told reporters during an on-camera interview that state child welfare authorities had removed the three siblings due to drug allegations and were planning to do the same with Miya before she went missing.\n\nKing also said that Miya's umbilical cord tested positive for methamphetamine shortly after birth. When Miya was first reported missing, investigators asked Tucker and Rudd about her whereabouts and they said that she had already been removed by the state Cabinet for Health and Family Services. The investigators immediately checked on that and determined it was not true.\n\nInvestigators looking for Miya spotted drugs, including pills containing fentanyl \"in plain sight\" at a Motel 6 where Tucker and Rudd were initially contacted. Since their arrest, both Tucker and Rudd have been charged with additional crimes including abuse of a corpse, tampering with physical evidence, and failure to report a death. Rudd's parents, who were also arrested, have been charged with the same offenses. For corrections or revisions, click here.

(WEHT) -- The Ohio County Coroner is still working to identify the child's remains found in a duffle bag at a Reynolds Station home on Friday. It's believed to be the body of 8-month-old Miya Rudd. Authorities say they gathered DNA from the baby's parents, Tesla Tucker and Cage Rudd, to compare to the remains.\n\nTucker, Rudd and baby Miya's grandfather are facing several charges, including drug trafficking and abuse of a corpse.\n\nOhio County District Court has ruled that they have enough probable cause to send Tucker, Rudd, and Smith before a grand jury for the drug-related charges.\n\nOfficials say several rooms inside of the home contained drug residue and large amounts of trash.\n\n\"...specifically the bag of meth was in a room with a basinet, a child's bed, and it was literally laying on the floor in plain view next to Narcan,\" said Kentucky State Police Detective Dalton Mellot.\n\nMellot said more evidence was discovered in a bunker behind the house. \"...large scales, a gigantic box of syringes that were used, needles. We found some sort of chemistry equipment and it had white residue,\" said Mellot.\n\nTucker, the mother of Miya Rudd, was brought to tears as the hearing unfolded.\n\nAttorney at Law Zanda Myers says there's not enough evidence to prove they were selling drugs. Myers is working as the defense attorney for Tucker.\n\n\"Your honor I would submit to the court that residue does not rise to the level of trafficking in the controlled substance. Furthermore, part of that is enhanced trafficking you can't just make the assumption,\" says Myers.\n\nAccording to court documents, on June 14, KSP said they discovered a child's remains inside a black Adidas duffle bag.\n\nA preliminary hearing has been set for June 24 at 9 a.m. The preliminary hearing is in regard to the trio's latest charges that were added after the discovery of those remains. Those charges include abuse of a corpse, failure to report a dead person and tampering with evidence.\n\nThe judge argued drugs in the home, paired with the living conditions were enough to investigate abuse charges.\n\nBrodie Payne, who was also living on the property during the time when baby Miya was living in the household, will face the same charges in that hearing.", "source": {"uri": "wate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WATE 6 On Your Side"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_County,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ohio County, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio County, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Court_of_Appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Court of Appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miya's", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miya's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coroner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_drug_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illegal drug trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable_cause", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Probable cause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartford,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hartford, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hartford, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_State_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky State Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naloxone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naloxone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Methamphetamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syringe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Syringe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chemistry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalton,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dalton, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dalton, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampering_with_evidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampering with evidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal defense lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preliminary_hearing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Preliminary hearing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Controlled substance"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Baby", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Baby", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children,_Youth_and_Family", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children, Youth and Family", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.wate.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2024/06/Tucker.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659869", "eventUri": "eng-9659869", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hartford, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 1616, "textEnd": 1623}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-24", "textStart": 1742, "textEnd": 1749}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

A third man charged was already in jail on other drug charges.\n\nCage C. Rudd, 30, of Reynolds Station, is facing numerous charges in connection in the disappearance of Miya Rudd, 8 months old. Miya Rudd was reported missing in late April by relatives who hadn't seen since earlier in the year.\n\nOn Friday, Kentucky State Police investigators recovered a body \"consistent\" with Miya Rudd buried under debris inside the Deanfield Church Road home the child shared with Cage Rudd, her mother, Tesla N. Tucker, 29, and two other men, Ricky J. Smith, 56, and Brodie C. Payne II, 28.\n\nAll four were charged with abuse of a corpse, tampering with evidence and failure to report the death of a person. Those charges are on top of charges of first-degree drug trafficking, engaging in organized crime being levied against all four.\n\nRudd, Tucker, and Smith also face charges of first-degree criminal abuse (child under age 12) and Rudd and Tucker are facing charges of abandonment of a minor.\n\nCage Rudd was charged on Feb. 23 with first-degree possession of a controlled substance (meth), a felony, after an incident on Kentucky 54 in Whitesville. Kentucky State Police reports say a trooper attempting to make a traffic stop saw the vehicle he was following turn on Franklin Street. Reports say the trooper saw the vehicle stopped with its engine and lights off in a parking lot and was told the driver was hiding behind a truck.\n\nThe driver, Rudd, attempted to hide and was apprehended, and a search of the truck's rear hitch uncovered a baggie of suspected crystal methamphetamine, reports say. Rudd was charged with first-degree possession of a controlled substance (meth), possession of drug paraphernalia and traffic-related violations.\n\nRudd was in jail until March 3 and was indicted on the meth charge March 8. On March 20, Rudd pleaded guilty to the charge. He received one year in prison and had the charge diverted for one year, meaning the charge against him would be dismissed if he complied with the conditions of his diversion. The paraphernalia and traffic charges were dismissed.\n\nRudd was required to undergo a substance abuse assessment and comply with any of the assessor's recommendations. Rudd's file does not say if that occurred.\n\nThe office of probation and parole filed a motion to revoke Rudd's diversion on June 12, seven days after his arrest in connection to KSP's search for Miya Rudd. The motion says, at the time of his arrest, Rudd told detectives he did not know Miya Rudd's whereabouts.\n\nRudd was arrested with \"a large amount of drugs\" at the Super 8 Motel where he and Tucker were staying, the report says, and that Rudd was found with a tube of marijuana on him by jail staff during booking, after being warned about trying to take contraband into the jail, the report says.\n\nRudd is scheduled to appear in court Tuesday, where the judge is anticipated to schedule a hearing to revoke Rudd's diversion.\n\nRicky Smith was also on probation at the time he was charged in the investigation into Miya's disappearance. Smith was charged in November 2022 with first-degree trafficking in a controlled substance (meth). He was sentenced to three years in prison, and was placed on supervision under the office of probation and parole on March 22 of this year.\n\nSmith has a hearing scheduled to revoke is parole Tuesday.\n\nTesla Tucker has no record with the Department of Corrections, and only one prior arrest, for not paying court fines in 2022.\n\nBrodie Payne was in the Daviess detention center at the time he was charged with abuse of a corpse, tampering and not reporting a death in connection with Miya Rudd's disappearance. On May 21, Payne was charged with first-degree drug trafficking for both meth and fentanyl, after he tried to retrieve a mailed package containing suspected meth. A sheriff's office press release says other packages meant for Payne contained suspected fentanyl pills made to resemble Xanax.\n\nRudd, Payne and Smith are in the Daviess County Detention Center.

(WEHT) -- The Ohio County Coroner is still working to identify the child's remains found in a duffle bag at a Reynolds Station home on Friday. It's believed to be the body of eight-month-old Miya Rudd. Authorities say they gathered DNA from the baby's parents, Tesla Tucker and Cage Rudd, to compare to the remains.\n\nTucker, Rudd and baby Miya's grandfather are facing several charges, including drug trafficking and abuse of a corpse.\n\nOhio County District Court has ruled that they have enough probable cause to send Tucker, Rudd, and Smith before a grand jury for the drug-related charges.\\\n\nOfficials say several rooms inside of the home contained drug residue and large amounts of trash.\n\n\"...specifically the bag of meth was in a room with a bassinet, a child's bed, and it was literally laying on the floor in plain view next to Narcan,\" says Kentucky State Police Detective Dalton Mellot.\n\nDetective Mellot says more evidence was discovered in a bunker behind the house. \"...large scales, a gigantic box of syringes that were used, needles. We found some sort of chemistry equipment and it had white residue,\" says Detective Mellot.\n\nTucker, the mother of Miya Rudd, was brought to tears as the hearing unfolded.\n\nAttorney at Law Zanda Myers says there's not enough evidence to prove they were selling drugs. Myers is working as the defense attorney for Tucker.\n\n\"Your honor I would submit to the court that residue does not rise to the level of trafficking in the controlled substance.

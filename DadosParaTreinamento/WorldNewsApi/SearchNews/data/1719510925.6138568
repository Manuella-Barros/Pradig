The couple made a rare public appearance with their two children Wyatt, 9, and Dimitri, 7, as they watched Indiana Fever defeat the Los Angeles Sparks during their game in Los Angeles on Friday, May 24. Kutcher, 45, and Kunis, 40, were photographed with their daughter and son beaming as they sat courtside to watch the match and post-game as they met Fever rookie Caitlin Clark after her team\u2019s win of 78-73 in L.A.\u2019s Crypto Arena. Kutcher \u2014 who has been an avid public supporter of Clark \u2014 backed the 22-year-old player at the game as he wore a University of Iowa baseball cap, where both he and Clark went to college. Dimitri also wore an Iowa Hawkeyes hoodie, representing Clark\u2019s college team. Kutcher was also pictured giving a high-five to Clark as she ran past him during the match. The family also met Clark after the game, as seen in a video posted on X (formerly Twitter) by Indiana Fever. The sweet moment saw the WNBA star approach Kutcher, Kunis and their kids at the edge of the court. As the That '70s Show actor walked toward Clark for a hug, Wyatt held her hand over her mouth in surprise and Dmitiri clapped. The basketball star then shook hands with the children and embraced them in a hug, before posing with them for photos. \"Caitlin Clark met up with Ashton Kutcher after our win in Los Angeles ?,\" Fever captioned the clip. In another cute video posted on X from the game, which appeared to be from shortly after Wyatt had met Clark, the young girl was spotted shedding tears of joy as Kunis comforted her while they stood together on the court. \u201cIt\u2019s very cool!\u201d Kunis appeared to say to Wyatt while wiping her tears away, as the 9-year-old smiled. Kutcher and Kunis have been married since 2015. While the couple is typically private about their family life, they made a special exception as they cheered on their favorite player on Friday. Kutcher has continued to support fellow Iowan Clark at matches and on social media during her WNBA rise. The 22-year-old has already had a soaring career after being named the NCAA National Player of the Year and this year\u2019s WNBA's overall No.1 draft pick. On Saturday, May 25, Kutcher posted a photo on Instagram of him and Clark locking hands on the court after her team\u2019s victory as he celebrated her win. \u201cProps @caitlinclark22 on W 1. Even Bigger props on being someone to look up to! Take your shot! #hawkeyes,\u201d the actor wrote in the caption.

Clark said of Kutcher\u2019s support in a video of her post-match interview posted on X, \u201cThat\u2019s a fellow Hawkeye, somebody that\u2019s been very supportive of me over the course of my college career.\u201d \u201cHe was encouraging me the whole game. It was fun to have him courtside. He\u2019s the man,\u201d she added.", "summary": "The couple and their kids Wyatt, 9, and Dimitri, 7, also caught up with the sports star after her team&#39;s win on May 25", "url": "https://people.com/ashton-kutcher-and-mila-kunis-makes-rare-appearance-with-kids-at-wnba-8654098", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/wx6cqtJ4tSQ5qn0ra0Xzx8hwv60=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(725x368:727x370)/caitlin-clark-ashton-kutcher-mila-kunis-052624-2-510af3994bd44d45aaee8c8c38bbdb7f.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:45:46", "author": "Escher Walcott", "authors": ["Escher Walcott"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.581}

The TikToker in question, Abby (@_abbypurdy_), posted a video showing an insect squirming in a full container of cheese. \u201cY\u2019all make this blow up because I noticed this bug in the cheese at Chipotle and when I pointed it out the employee gave me an attitude like I put it in there or something,\u201d the TikToker wrote in a text overlay of the video. The clip shows a Chipotle food assembly line, with the camera focused on a bin of shredded cheese. Beside it is a tub of guacamole. As the video progresses, it becomes evident that there\u2019s something inside of the cheese bin that\u2019s wiggling around. Abby zooms further into the bin\u2014and it looks like the bug in question is an earwig. If you\u2019re worried about these little suckers crawling on your face and digging themselves inside of your head, don\u2019t worry, they don\u2019t do that. According to 4NJPest, earwigs don\u2019t feast on the brain matter of humans and animals, or even flesh or blood but rather rotting food: \u201cDespite the myth, earwigs don\u2019t seek out ears. They also don\u2019t directly attack and have no venom. They use their pincers in defense and will react if picked up or stepped on in the night. Their diet of rotting things means their presence is usually after other damage. However, if you are starting a composting project, be careful to avoid placing it too near the house.\u201d If the bug in question very well is an earwig then it could mean that there\u2019s some grub in or around the area that is attracting the bugs. @_abbypurdy_ #chipotle #cinnaminsonnj #bug \u266c original sound \u2013 _abbypurdy_ Viewers are disgusted Numerous other folks who Abby\u2019s video thought that the bug was an earwig too. \u201cIS THAT AN EARWIG,\u201d one person asked. Another wrote, \u201cEARWIG NOOOOOO.\u201d Someone else thought that the Chipotle looked pretty messy, writing, \u201cWhy is the chipotle so dirty mine is spotless.\u201d Others speculated that it was this very lack of cleanliness in a specific area of the restaurant that\u2019s ultimately attracting bugs. \u201cWhats actually probably attracting the bugs is Their drains,\u201d one wrote. \u201cWhen I worked there every night we were supposed to clean out the drains to prevent this.\u201d How to get rid of earwigs According to this pest control company, this could very well be the case, as they write moist environments like dirty drains filled with bits of rotting food provide the perfect environment for earwigs to invade and feast: \u201cEarwigs like to invade moist areas. You can prevent this by removing the temptation. If you notice any dripping pipes or leaky drains, repair them to avoid attracting earwigs.\u201d And if you\u2019ve got these bugs in your own kitchen, before you fork over a ton of money to have a professional come in and assess the situation, then you could try this natural solution: \u201cEarwigs can overtake drains when there\u2019s standing water left in sinks or when drains are clogged. It\u2019s not possible to keep drains dry, but attending to clogged sinks in a timely matter is doable. When the water isn\u2019t draining quickly, combine two parts white vinegar with one part each salt and baking soda. Pour it down the sink and let it sit for 24 hours. The mixture will eat away at the gunk and afterward, it can be flushed with boiling water.\u201d Some folks say that these little pests are a seasonal annoyance. \u201cBro these bugs are in my house and i find them way too much now that it\u2019s summer,\u201d one wrote. This isn\u2019t the first time bugs and Chipotle have gone viral together on social media. A number of other TikTok users have uploaded videos of insects crawling around in various locations of the Mexican fast-casual chain. The big fear is that these bugs might somehow end up in a customer\u2019s food, like this person who had a less-than-stellar burrito eating experience.

He was interested in creating ballets and Broadway musicals. He started by doing commercials, then branched into small films and, his goal, television.\n\nThere he scored on \"The Jimmy Dean Show\" before making his mark with \"Sesame Street.\"\n\nThe PBS series was in keeping with his hit-and-run philosophy. Commercial-length storytelling had its place on the children's series.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Eventually, Oz says, they didn't need to script segments; they worked \"spontaneously.\"\n\nWatching the two create the magic is among the documentary's biggest pleasures. Oz, Henson and other regulars look happy. Equality was key to that.\n\nWhen Rita Moreno guested on \"The Muppet Show,\" she took a little more time with a scene and Henson pointed out, \"We don't do overtime here.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nAs much a worker as the boss, Henson didn't let success stifle his vision. When \"The Muppet Show\" was at its peak, he thought it was time to try something else and moved into movies. While that world wasn't as forgiving, it did show Muppets didn't need to be confined to homes.\n\nTo provide perspective (and explain Jane Henson's role in the family business), Howard includes plenty of interviews with the idea man's five children. They're cautious about the family secrets and gloss over the partnership Disney created with the Muppets. Coming after Henson's death, it was wildly unpopular among fans. Insiders worried, too, but the company continued to produce work for all mediums.\n\nAt Henson's funeral, Caroll Spinney, dressed as Big Bird, sang Kermit's song, \"It's Not Easy Being Green.\" The moment captures the loss and, when the other Muppets turn up, demonstrates how difficult moving on would be.\n\nGlimpses of Henson's experiments are among \"Idea Man's\" greatest contributions. A ballet might have worked; a theme park clearly could have given The Muppets more real estate than the attraction Disney afforded.\n\nMoments from \"Labyrinth\" and \"The Dark Crystal\" show how Henson might have delayed the onslaught of special effects in fantasy films. (Jennifer Connelly talks about the strange world she inhabited in \"Labyrinth\" and what it was like to be part of the Muppet world.)\n\nThose moments override the odd interview Orson Welles conducted with Henson. Howard uses it as a frame of sorts but, certainly, there were other interviews that could have provided more insight.\n\nBecause Henson was such a seminal figure on television, Howard should have provided some comparisons. How did he play in the puppet world? Was he a teacher like Fred Rogers? A comfort like Shari Lewis? Or was he a Disney-level innovator who deserves a place on the entertainment world's Mount Rushmore?\n\n\"Idea Man\" doesn't oversell but it also doesn't give Henson the special place he deserves. Broadway canonizes Stephen Sondheim every other year. Television could do the same for Henson. All it would take is interviews with those who tried to carry on after he was gone.\n\n\"Jim Henson Idea Man\" airs on Disney Plus.\n\nMovies in a minute with film critic Bruce Miller Movies in a Minute: \"Abigail\" Movies in a Minute: \"Civil War\" Movies in a Minute: \"Monkey Man\" Movies in a Minute: \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" Movies in a Minute: \"Late Night With the Devil\" Movies in a Minute: \"Snack Shack\" Movies in a Minute: \"Cabrini\" Movies in a Minute \"Dune: Part Two\" Movies in a Minute: \"Drive-Away Dolls\" Movies in a Minute \"Bob Marley: One Love\" Movies in a Minute: \"Lisa Frankenstein\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Greatest Night in Pop\" Movies in a Minute: \"Poor Things\" Movies in a Minute: Best Actress nominee Sandra Huller Movies in a Minute: \"Mean Girls\" Movies in a Minute: \"Anyone But You\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Color Purple\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Iron Claw\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wonka\" Movies in a Minute: \"May December\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wish\" Movies in a Minute: \"Next Goal Wins\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Marvels\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Holdovers\" Movies in a Minute: \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" Movies in a Minute \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" Movies in a Minute: \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Exorcist: Believer\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fair Play\" Movies in a Minute: \"Expend4bles\" Movies in a Minute: \"A Haunting in Venice\" Movies in a Minute: \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Equalizer 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Blue Beetle\" Movies in a Minute: \"Gran Turismo\" Movies in a Minute: Mid-year wrap-up Movies in a Minute: \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\" Fans in Mumbai celebrate new Rajinikanth movie Movies in a Minute: \"Haunted Mansion\" Movies in a Minute: \"Barbie\" Movies in a Minute: \"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One\" Movies in a Minute: \"Joy Ride\" Movies in a Minute: \"Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny\" Movies in a Minute: \"No Hard Feelings\" Movies in a Minute: \"Elemental\" Movies in a Minute: \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts\" Movies in a Minute: \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Little Mermaid\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fast X\" Movies in a Minute: \"Book Club: The Next Chapter\" Movies in a Minute: \"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Are You There God?

(Jennifer Connelly talks about the strange world she inhabited in \"Labyrinth\" and what it was like to be part of the Muppet world.)\n\nThose moments override the odd interview Orson Welles conducted with Henson. Howard uses it as a frame of sorts but, certainly, there were other interviews that could have provided more insight.\n\nBecause Henson was such a seminal figure on television, Howard should have provided some comparisons. How did he play in the puppet world? Was he a teacher like Fred Rogers? A comfort like Shari Lewis? Or was he a Disney-level innovator who deserves a place on the entertainment world's Mount Rushmore?\n\n\"Idea Man\" doesn't oversell but it also doesn't give Henson the special place he deserves. Broadway canonizes Stephen Sondheim every other year. Television could do the same for Henson. All it would take is interviews with those who tried to carry on after he was gone.\n\n\"Jim Henson Idea Man\" airs on Disney Plus.\n\nMovies in a minute with film critic Bruce Miller Movies in a Minute: \"Abigail\" Movies in a Minute: \"Civil War\" Movies in a Minute: \"Monkey Man\" Movies in a Minute: \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" Movies in a Minute: \"Late Night With the Devil\" Movies in a Minute: \"Snack Shack\" Movies in a Minute: \"Cabrini\" Movies in a Minute \"Dune: Part Two\" Movies in a Minute: \"Drive-Away Dolls\" Movies in a Minute \"Bob Marley: One Love\" Movies in a Minute: \"Lisa Frankenstein\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Greatest Night in Pop\" Movies in a Minute: \"Poor Things\" Movies in a Minute: Best Actress nominee Sandra Huller Movies in a Minute: \"Mean Girls\" Movies in a Minute: \"Anyone But You\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Color Purple\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Iron Claw\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wonka\" Movies in a Minute: \"May December\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wish\" Movies in a Minute: \"Next Goal Wins\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Marvels\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Holdovers\" Movies in a Minute: \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" Movies in a Minute \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" Movies in a Minute: \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Exorcist: Believer\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fair Play\" Movies in a Minute: \"Expend4bles\" Movies in a Minute: \"A Haunting in Venice\" Movies in a Minute: \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Equalizer 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Blue Beetle\" Movies in a Minute: \"Gran Turismo\" Movies in a Minute: Mid-year wrap-up Movies in a Minute: \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\" Fans in Mumbai celebrate new Rajinikanth movie Movies in a Minute: \"Haunted Mansion\" Movies in a Minute: \"Barbie\" Movies in a Minute: \"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One\" Movies in a Minute: \"Joy Ride\" Movies in a Minute: \"Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny\" Movies in a Minute: \"No Hard Feelings\" Movies in a Minute: \"Elemental\" Movies in a Minute: \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts\" Movies in a Minute: \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Little Mermaid\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fast X\" Movies in a Minute: \"Book Club: The Next Chapter\" Movies in a Minute: \"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Are You There God?

Jim Henson #IdeaMan, a #DisneyPlus Original Documentary from Academy Award-winning filmmaker Ron Howard, is streaming May 31.\n\n\"Jim Henson Idea Man\" should have been titled: \"Jim Henson Workaholic.\"\n\nIn the Ron Howard documentary, Henson is rarely pictured without a pile of felt or a herd of Muppets more than an arm's reach away.\n\nThat split ping-pong ball and woman's coat (which turned into Kermit the Frog) was only the start.\n\nHenson, in fact, didn't just want puppet shows. He was interested in creating ballets and Broadway musicals. He started by doing commercials, then branched into small films and, his goal, television.\n\nThere he scored on \"The Jimmy Dean Show\" before making his mark with \"Sesame Street.\"\n\nThe PBS series was in keeping with his hit-and-run philosophy. Commercial-length storytelling had its place on the children's series.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Eventually, Oz says, they didn't need to script segments; they worked \"spontaneously.\"\n\nWatching the two create the magic is among the documentary's biggest pleasures. Oz, Henson and other regulars look happy. Equality was key to that.\n\nWhen Rita Moreno guested on \"The Muppet Show,\" she took a little more time with a scene and Henson pointed out, \"We don't do overtime here.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nAs much a worker as the boss, Henson didn't let success stifle his vision. When \"The Muppet Show\" was at its peak, he thought it was time to try something else and moved into movies. While that world wasn't as forgiving, it did show Muppets didn't need to be confined to homes.\n\nTo provide perspective (and explain Jane Henson's role in the family business), Howard includes plenty of interviews with the idea man's five children. They're cautious about the family secrets and gloss over the partnership Disney created with the Muppets. Coming after Henson's death, it was wildly unpopular among fans. Insiders worried, too, but the company continued to produce work for all mediums.\n\nAt Henson's funeral, Caroll Spinney, dressed as Big Bird, sang Kermit's song, \"It's Not Easy Being Green.\" The moment captures the loss and, when the other Muppets turn up, demonstrates how difficult moving on would be.\n\nGlimpses of Henson's experiments are among \"Idea Man's\" greatest contributions. A ballet might have worked; a theme park clearly could have given The Muppets more real estate than the attraction Disney afforded.\n\nMoments from \"Labyrinth\" and \"The Dark Crystal\" show how Henson might have delayed the onslaught of special effects in fantasy films. (Jennifer Connelly talks about the strange world she inhabited in \"Labyrinth\" and what it was like to be part of the Muppet world.)\n\nThose moments override the odd interview Orson Welles conducted with Henson. Howard uses it as a frame of sorts but, certainly, there were other interviews that could have provided more insight.\n\nBecause Henson was such a seminal figure on television, Howard should have provided some comparisons. How did he play in the puppet world? Was he a teacher like Fred Rogers? A comfort like Shari Lewis? Or was he a Disney-level innovator who deserves a place on the entertainment world's Mount Rushmore?\n\n\"Idea Man\" doesn't oversell but it also doesn't give Henson the special place he deserves.

He was interested in creating ballets and Broadway musicals. He started by doing commercials, then branched into small films and, his goal, television.\n\nThere he scored on \"The Jimmy Dean Show\" before making his mark with \"Sesame Street.\"\n\nThe PBS series was in keeping with his hit-and-run philosophy.

Eventually, Oz says, they didn't need to script segments; they worked \"spontaneously.\"\n\nWatching the two create the magic is among the documentary's biggest pleasures.

When \"The Muppet Show\" was at its peak, he thought it was time to try something else and moved into movies. While that world wasn't as forgiving, it did show Muppets didn't need to be confined to homes.\n\nTo provide perspective (and explain Jane Henson's role in the family business), Howard includes plenty of interviews with the idea man's five children. They're cautious about the family secrets and gloss over the partnership Disney created with the Muppets. Coming after Henson's death, it was wildly unpopular among fans. Insiders worried, too, but the company continued to produce work for all mediums.\n\nAt Henson's funeral, Caroll Spinney, dressed as Big Bird, sang Kermit's song, \"It's Not Easy Being Green.\" The moment captures the loss and, when the other Muppets turn up, demonstrates how difficult moving on would be.\n\nGlimpses of Henson's experiments are among \"Idea Man's\" greatest contributions. A ballet might have worked; a theme park clearly could have given The Muppets more real estate than the attraction Disney afforded.\n\nMoments from \"Labyrinth\" and \"The Dark Crystal\" show how Henson might have delayed the onslaught of special effects in fantasy films. (Jennifer Connelly talks about the strange world she inhabited in \"Labyrinth\" and what it was like to be part of the Muppet world.)\n\nThose moments override the odd interview Orson Welles conducted with Henson. Howard uses it as a frame of sorts but, certainly, there were other interviews that could have provided more insight.\n\nBecause Henson was such a seminal figure on television, Howard should have provided some comparisons. How did he play in the puppet world? Was he a teacher like Fred Rogers? A comfort like Shari Lewis? Or was he a Disney-level innovator who deserves a place on the entertainment world's Mount Rushmore?\n\n\"Idea Man\" doesn't oversell but it also doesn't give Henson the special place he deserves. Broadway canonizes Stephen Sondheim every other year. Television could do the same for Henson. All it would take is interviews with those who tried to carry on after he was gone.\n\n\"Jim Henson Idea Man\" airs on Disney Plus.\n\nMovies in a minute with film critic Bruce Miller Movies in a Minute: \"Abigail\" Movies in a Minute: \"Civil War\" Movies in a Minute: \"Monkey Man\" Movies in a Minute: \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" Movies in a Minute: \"Late Night With the Devil\" Movies in a Minute: \"Snack Shack\" Movies in a Minute: \"Cabrini\" Movies in a Minute \"Dune: Part Two\" Movies in a Minute: \"Drive-Away Dolls\" Movies in a Minute \"Bob Marley: One Love\" Movies in a Minute: \"Lisa Frankenstein\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Greatest Night in Pop\" Movies in a Minute: \"Poor Things\" Movies in a Minute: Best Actress nominee Sandra Huller Movies in a Minute: \"Mean Girls\" Movies in a Minute: \"Anyone But You\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Color Purple\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Iron Claw\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wonka\" Movies in a Minute: \"May December\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wish\" Movies in a Minute: \"Next Goal Wins\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Marvels\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Holdovers\" Movies in a Minute: \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" Movies in a Minute \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" Movies in a Minute: \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Exorcist: Believer\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fair Play\" Movies in a Minute: \"Expend4bles\" Movies in a Minute: \"A Haunting in Venice\" Movies in a Minute: \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Equalizer 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Blue Beetle\" Movies in a Minute: \"Gran Turismo\" Movies in a Minute: Mid-year wrap-up Movies in a Minute: \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\" Fans in Mumbai celebrate new Rajinikanth movie Movies in a Minute: \"Haunted Mansion\" Movies in a Minute: \"Barbie\" Movies in a Minute: \"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One\" Movies in a Minute: \"Joy Ride\" Movies in a Minute: \"Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny\" Movies in a Minute: \"No Hard Feelings\" Movies in a Minute: \"Elemental\" Movies in a Minute: \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts\" Movies in a Minute: \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Little Mermaid\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fast X\" Movies in a Minute: \"Book Club: The Next Chapter\" Movies in a Minute: \"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Are You There God?

Jim Henson #IdeaMan, a #DisneyPlus Original Documentary from Academy Award-winning filmmaker Ron Howard, is streaming May 31.\n\n\"Jim Henson Idea Man\" should have been titled: \"Jim Henson Workaholic.\"\n\nIn the Ron Howard documentary, Henson is rarely pictured without a pile of felt or a herd of Muppets more than an arm's reach away.\n\nThat split ping-pong ball and woman's coat (which turned into Kermit the Frog) was only the start.\n\nHenson, in fact, didn't just want puppet shows. He was interested in creating ballets and Broadway musicals. He started by doing commercials, then branched into small films and, his goal, television.\n\nThere he scored on \"The Jimmy Dean Show\" before making his mark with \"Sesame Street.\"\n\nThe PBS series was in keeping with his hit-and-run philosophy. Commercial-length storytelling had its place on the children's series.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Eventually, Oz says, they didn't need to script segments; they worked \"spontaneously.\"\n\nWatching the two create the magic is among the documentary's biggest pleasures. Oz, Henson and other regulars look happy. Equality was key to that.\n\nWhen Rita Moreno guested on \"The Muppet Show,\" she took a little more time with a scene and Henson pointed out, \"We don't do overtime here.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nAs much a worker as the boss, Henson didn't let success stifle his vision. When \"The Muppet Show\" was at its peak, he thought it was time to try something else and moved into movies. While that world wasn't as forgiving, it did show Muppets didn't need to be confined to homes.\n\nTo provide perspective (and explain Jane Henson's role in the family business), Howard includes plenty of interviews with the idea man's five children. They're cautious about the family secrets and gloss over the partnership Disney created with the Muppets. Coming after Henson's death, it was wildly unpopular among fans. Insiders worried, too, but the company continued to produce work for all mediums.\n\nAt Henson's funeral, Caroll Spinney, dressed as Big Bird, sang Kermit's song, \"It's Not Easy Being Green.\" The moment captures the loss and, when the other Muppets turn up, demonstrates how difficult moving on would be.\n\nGlimpses of Henson's experiments are among \"Idea Man's\" greatest contributions. A ballet might have worked; a theme park clearly could have given The Muppets more real estate than the attraction Disney afforded.\n\nMoments from \"Labyrinth\" and \"The Dark Crystal\" show how Henson might have delayed the onslaught of special effects in fantasy films. (Jennifer Connelly talks about the strange world she inhabited in \"Labyrinth\" and what it was like to be part of the Muppet world.)\n\nThose moments override the odd interview Orson Welles conducted with Henson. Howard uses it as a frame of sorts but, certainly, there were other interviews that could have provided more insight.\n\nBecause Henson was such a seminal figure on television, Howard should have provided some comparisons. How did he play in the puppet world? Was he a teacher like Fred Rogers? A comfort like Shari Lewis? Or was he a Disney-level innovator who deserves a place on the entertainment world's Mount Rushmore?\n\n\"Idea Man\" doesn't oversell but it also doesn't give Henson the special place he deserves. Broadway canonizes Stephen Sondheim every other year. Television could do the same for Henson. All it would take is interviews with those who tried to carry on after he was gone.\n\n\"Jim Henson Idea Man\" airs on Disney Plus.\n\nMovies in a minute with film critic Bruce Miller Movies in a Minute: \"Abigail\" Movies in a Minute: \"Civil War\" Movies in a Minute: \"Monkey Man\" Movies in a Minute: \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" Movies in a Minute: \"Late Night With the Devil\" Movies in a Minute: \"Snack Shack\" Movies in a Minute: \"Cabrini\" Movies in a Minute \"Dune: Part Two\" Movies in a Minute: \"Drive-Away Dolls\" Movies in a Minute \"Bob Marley: One Love\" Movies in a Minute: \"Lisa Frankenstein\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Greatest Night in Pop\" Movies in a Minute: \"Poor Things\" Movies in a Minute: Best Actress nominee Sandra Huller Movies in a Minute: \"Mean Girls\" Movies in a Minute: \"Anyone But You\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Color Purple\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Iron Claw\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wonka\" Movies in a Minute: \"May December\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wish\" Movies in a Minute: \"Next Goal Wins\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Marvels\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Holdovers\" Movies in a Minute: \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" Movies in a Minute \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" Movies in a Minute: \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Exorcist: Believer\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fair Play\" Movies in a Minute: \"Expend4bles\" Movies in a Minute: \"A Haunting in Venice\" Movies in a Minute: \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Equalizer 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Blue Beetle\" Movies in a Minute: \"Gran Turismo\" Movies in a Minute: Mid-year wrap-up Movies in a Minute: \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\" Fans in Mumbai celebrate new Rajinikanth movie Movies in a Minute: \"Haunted Mansion\" Movies in a Minute: \"Barbie\" Movies in a Minute: \"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One\" Movies in a Minute: \"Joy Ride\" Movies in a Minute: \"Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny\" Movies in a Minute: \"No Hard Feelings\" Movies in a Minute: \"Elemental\" Movies in a Minute: \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts\" Movies in a Minute: \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Little Mermaid\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fast X\" Movies in a Minute: \"Book Club: The Next Chapter\" Movies in a Minute: \"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Are You There God?

When \"The Muppet Show\" was at its peak, he thought it was time to try something else and moved into movies. While that world wasn't as forgiving, it did show Muppets didn't need to be confined to homes.\n\nTo provide perspective (and explain Jane Henson's role in the family business), Howard includes plenty of interviews with the idea man's five children.

Howard uses it as a frame of sorts but, certainly, there were other interviews that could have provided more insight.\n\nBecause Henson was such a seminal figure on television, Howard should have provided some comparisons.

Jim Henson #IdeaMan, a #DisneyPlus Original Documentary from Academy Award-winning filmmaker Ron Howard, is streaming May 31.\n\n\"Jim Henson Idea Man\" should have been titled: \"Jim Henson Workaholic.\"\n\nIn the Ron Howard documentary, Henson is rarely pictured without a pile of felt or a herd of Muppets more than an arm's reach away.\n\nThat split ping-pong ball and woman's coat (which turned into Kermit the Frog) was only the start.\n\nHenson, in fact, didn't just want puppet shows. He was interested in creating ballets and Broadway musicals. He started by doing commercials, then branched into small films and, his goal, television.\n\nThere he scored on \"The Jimmy Dean Show\" before making his mark with \"Sesame Street.\"\n\nThe PBS series was in keeping with his hit-and-run philosophy. Commercial-length storytelling had its place on the children's series.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Eventually, Oz says, they didn't need to script segments; they worked \"spontaneously.\"\n\nWatching the two create the magic is among the documentary's biggest pleasures. Oz, Henson and other regulars look happy. Equality was key to that.\n\nWhen Rita Moreno guested on \"The Muppet Show,\" she took a little more time with a scene and Henson pointed out, \"We don't do overtime here.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nAs much a worker as the boss, Henson didn't let success stifle his vision. When \"The Muppet Show\" was at its peak, he thought it was time to try something else and moved into movies. While that world wasn't as forgiving, it did show Muppets didn't need to be confined to homes.\n\nTo provide perspective (and explain Jane Henson's role in the family business), Howard includes plenty of interviews with the idea man's five children. They're cautious about the family secrets and gloss over the partnership Disney created with the Muppets. Coming after Henson's death, it was wildly unpopular among fans. Insiders worried, too, but the company continued to produce work for all mediums.\n\nAt Henson's funeral, Caroll Spinney, dressed as Big Bird, sang Kermit's song, \"It's Not Easy Being Green.\" The moment captures the loss and, when the other Muppets turn up, demonstrates how difficult moving on would be.\n\nGlimpses of Henson's experiments are among \"Idea Man's\" greatest contributions. A ballet might have worked; a theme park clearly could have given The Muppets more real estate than the attraction Disney afforded.\n\nMoments from \"Labyrinth\" and \"The Dark Crystal\" show how Henson might have delayed the onslaught of special effects in fantasy films. (Jennifer Connelly talks about the strange world she inhabited in \"Labyrinth\" and what it was like to be part of the Muppet world.)\n\nThose moments override the odd interview Orson Welles conducted with Henson. Howard uses it as a frame of sorts but, certainly, there were other interviews that could have provided more insight.\n\nBecause Henson was such a seminal figure on television, Howard should have provided some comparisons. How did he play in the puppet world? Was he a teacher like Fred Rogers? A comfort like Shari Lewis? Or was he a Disney-level innovator who deserves a place on the entertainment world's Mount Rushmore?\n\n\"Idea Man\" doesn't oversell but it also doesn't give Henson the special place he deserves. Broadway canonizes Stephen Sondheim every other year. Television could do the same for Henson. All it would take is interviews with those who tried to carry on after he was gone.\n\n\"Jim Henson Idea Man\" airs on Disney Plus.\n\nMovies in a minute with film critic Bruce Miller Movies in a Minute: \"Abigail\" Movies in a Minute: \"Civil War\" Movies in a Minute: \"Monkey Man\" Movies in a Minute: \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" Movies in a Minute: \"Late Night With the Devil\" Movies in a Minute: \"Snack Shack\" Movies in a Minute: \"Cabrini\" Movies in a Minute \"Dune: Part Two\" Movies in a Minute: \"Drive-Away Dolls\" Movies in a Minute \"Bob Marley: One Love\" Movies in a Minute: \"Lisa Frankenstein\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Greatest Night in Pop\" Movies in a Minute: \"Poor Things\" Movies in a Minute: Best Actress nominee Sandra Huller Movies in a Minute: \"Mean Girls\" Movies in a Minute: \"Anyone But You\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Color Purple\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Iron Claw\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wonka\" Movies in a Minute: \"May December\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wish\" Movies in a Minute: \"Next Goal Wins\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Marvels\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Holdovers\" Movies in a Minute: \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" Movies in a Minute \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" Movies in a Minute: \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Exorcist: Believer\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fair Play\" Movies in a Minute: \"Expend4bles\" Movies in a Minute: \"A Haunting in Venice\" Movies in a Minute: \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Equalizer 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Blue Beetle\" Movies in a Minute: \"Gran Turismo\" Movies in a Minute: Mid-year wrap-up Movies in a Minute: \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\" Fans in Mumbai celebrate new Rajinikanth movie Movies in a Minute: \"Haunted Mansion\" Movies in a Minute: \"Barbie\" Movies in a Minute: \"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One\" Movies in a Minute: \"Joy Ride\" Movies in a Minute: \"Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny\" Movies in a Minute: \"No Hard Feelings\" Movies in a Minute: \"Elemental\" Movies in a Minute: \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts\" Movies in a Minute: \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Little Mermaid\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fast X\" Movies in a Minute: \"Book Club: The Next Chapter\" Movies in a Minute: \"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Are You There God?

He started by doing commercials, then branched into small films and, his goal, television.\n\nThere he scored on \"The Jimmy Dean Show\" before making his mark with \"Sesame Street.\"\n\nThe PBS series was in keeping with his hit-and-run philosophy. Commercial-length storytelling had its place on the children's series.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Eventually, Oz says, they didn't need to script segments; they worked \"spontaneously.\"\n\nWatching the two create the magic is among the documentary's biggest pleasures. Oz, Henson and other regulars look happy. Equality was key to that.\n\nWhen Rita Moreno guested on \"The Muppet Show,\" she took a little more time with a scene and Henson pointed out, \"We don't do overtime here.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nAs much a worker as the boss, Henson didn't let success stifle his vision. When \"The Muppet Show\" was at its peak, he thought it was time to try something else and moved into movies. While that world wasn't as forgiving, it did show Muppets didn't need to be confined to homes.\n\nTo provide perspective (and explain Jane Henson's role in the family business), Howard includes plenty of interviews with the idea man's five children. They're cautious about the family secrets and gloss over the partnership Disney created with the Muppets. Coming after Henson's death, it was wildly unpopular among fans. Insiders worried, too, but the company continued to produce work for all mediums.\n\nAt Henson's funeral, Caroll Spinney, dressed as Big Bird, sang Kermit's song, \"It's Not Easy Being Green.\" The moment captures the loss and, when the other Muppets turn up, demonstrates how difficult moving on would be.\n\nGlimpses of Henson's experiments are among \"Idea Man's\" greatest contributions. A ballet might have worked; a theme park clearly could have given The Muppets more real estate than the attraction Disney afforded.\n\nMoments from \"Labyrinth\" and \"The Dark Crystal\" show how Henson might have delayed the onslaught of special effects in fantasy films. (Jennifer Connelly talks about the strange world she inhabited in \"Labyrinth\" and what it was like to be part of the Muppet world.)\n\nThose moments override the odd interview Orson Welles conducted with Henson. Howard uses it as a frame of sorts but, certainly, there were other interviews that could have provided more insight.\n\nBecause Henson was such a seminal figure on television, Howard should have provided some comparisons. How did he play in the puppet world? Was he a teacher like Fred Rogers? A comfort like Shari Lewis? Or was he a Disney-level innovator who deserves a place on the entertainment world's Mount Rushmore?\n\n\"Idea Man\" doesn't oversell but it also doesn't give Henson the special place he deserves. Broadway canonizes Stephen Sondheim every other year. Television could do the same for Henson. All it would take is interviews with those who tried to carry on after he was gone.\n\n\"Jim Henson Idea Man\" airs on Disney Plus.\n\nMovies in a minute with film critic Bruce Miller Movies in a Minute: \"Abigail\" Movies in a Minute: \"Civil War\" Movies in a Minute: \"Monkey Man\" Movies in a Minute: \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" Movies in a Minute: \"Late Night With the Devil\" Movies in a Minute: \"Snack Shack\" Movies in a Minute: \"Cabrini\" Movies in a Minute \"Dune: Part Two\" Movies in a Minute: \"Drive-Away Dolls\" Movies in a Minute \"Bob Marley: One Love\" Movies in a Minute: \"Lisa Frankenstein\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Greatest Night in Pop\" Movies in a Minute: \"Poor Things\" Movies in a Minute: Best Actress nominee Sandra Huller Movies in a Minute: \"Mean Girls\" Movies in a Minute: \"Anyone But You\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Color Purple\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Iron Claw\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wonka\" Movies in a Minute: \"May December\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wish\" Movies in a Minute: \"Next Goal Wins\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Marvels\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Holdovers\" Movies in a Minute: \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" Movies in a Minute \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" Movies in a Minute: \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Exorcist: Believer\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fair Play\" Movies in a Minute: \"Expend4bles\" Movies in a Minute: \"A Haunting in Venice\" Movies in a Minute: \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Equalizer 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Blue Beetle\" Movies in a Minute: \"Gran Turismo\" Movies in a Minute: Mid-year wrap-up Movies in a Minute: \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\" Fans in Mumbai celebrate new Rajinikanth movie Movies in a Minute: \"Haunted Mansion\" Movies in a Minute: \"Barbie\" Movies in a Minute: \"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One\" Movies in a Minute: \"Joy Ride\" Movies in a Minute: \"Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny\" Movies in a Minute: \"No Hard Feelings\" Movies in a Minute: \"Elemental\" Movies in a Minute: \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts\" Movies in a Minute: \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Little Mermaid\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fast X\" Movies in a Minute: \"Book Club: The Next Chapter\" Movies in a Minute: \"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Are You There God?

Jim Henson #IdeaMan, a #DisneyPlus Original Documentary from Academy Award-winning filmmaker Ron Howard, is streaming May 31.\n\n\"Jim Henson Idea Man\" should have been titled: \"Jim Henson Workaholic.\"\n\nIn the Ron Howard documentary, Henson is rarely pictured without a pile of felt or a herd of Muppets more than an arm's reach away.\n\nThat split ping-pong ball and woman's coat (which turned into Kermit the Frog) was only the start.\n\nHenson, in fact, didn't just want puppet shows. He was interested in creating ballets and Broadway musicals. He started by doing commercials, then branched into small films and, his goal, television.\n\nThere he scored on \"The Jimmy Dean Show\" before making his mark with \"Sesame Street.\"\n\nThe PBS series was in keeping with his hit-and-run philosophy. Commercial-length storytelling had its place on the children's series.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Eventually, Oz says, they didn't need to script segments; they worked \"spontaneously.\"\n\nWatching the two create the magic is among the documentary's biggest pleasures. Oz, Henson and other regulars look happy. Equality was key to that.\n\nWhen Rita Moreno guested on \"The Muppet Show,\" she took a little more time with a scene and Henson pointed out, \"We don't do overtime here.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nAs much a worker as the boss, Henson didn't let success stifle his vision. When \"The Muppet Show\" was at its peak, he thought it was time to try something else and moved into movies. While that world wasn't as forgiving, it did show Muppets didn't need to be confined to homes.\n\nTo provide perspective (and explain Jane Henson's role in the family business), Howard includes plenty of interviews with the idea man's five children. They're cautious about the family secrets and gloss over the partnership Disney created with the Muppets. Coming after Henson's death, it was wildly unpopular among fans. Insiders worried, too, but the company continued to produce work for all mediums.\n\nAt Henson's funeral, Caroll Spinney, dressed as Big Bird, sang Kermit's song, \"It's Not Easy Being Green.\" The moment captures the loss and, when the other Muppets turn up, demonstrates how difficult moving on would be.\n\nGlimpses of Henson's experiments are among \"Idea Man's\" greatest contributions. A ballet might have worked; a theme park clearly could have given The Muppets more real estate than the attraction Disney afforded.\n\nMoments from \"Labyrinth\" and \"The Dark Crystal\" show how Henson might have delayed the onslaught of special effects in fantasy films. (Jennifer Connelly talks about the strange world she inhabited in \"Labyrinth\" and what it was like to be part of the Muppet world.)\n\nThose moments override the odd interview Orson Welles conducted with Henson. Howard uses it as a frame of sorts but, certainly, there were other interviews that could have provided more insight.\n\nBecause Henson was such a seminal figure on television, Howard should have provided some comparisons. How did he play in the puppet world? Was he a teacher like Fred Rogers? A comfort like Shari Lewis? Or was he a Disney-level innovator who deserves a place on the entertainment world's Mount Rushmore?\n\n\"Idea Man\" doesn't oversell but it also doesn't give Henson the special place he deserves. Broadway canonizes Stephen Sondheim every other year. Television could do the same for Henson. All it would take is interviews with those who tried to carry on after he was gone.\n\n\"Jim Henson Idea Man\" airs on Disney Plus.\n\nMovies in a minute with film critic Bruce Miller Movies in a Minute: \"Summer Camp\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Blue Angels\" Movies in a Minute: \"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Fall Guy\" Movies in a Minute: \"Challengers\" Movies in a Minute: \"Abigail\" Movies in a Minute: \"Civil War\" Movies in a Minute: \"Monkey Man\" Movies in a Minute: \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" Movies in a Minute: \"Late Night With the Devil\" Movies in a Minute: \"Snack Shack\" Movies in a Minute: \"Cabrini\" Movies in a Minute \"Dune: Part Two\" Movies in a Minute: \"Drive-Away Dolls\" Movies in a Minute \"Bob Marley: One Love\" Movies in a Minute: \"Lisa Frankenstein\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Greatest Night in Pop\" Movies in a Minute: \"Poor Things\" Movies in a Minute: Best Actress nominee Sandra Huller Movies in a Minute: \"Mean Girls\" Movies in a Minute: \"Anyone But You\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Color Purple\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Iron Claw\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wonka\" Movies in a Minute: \"May December\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wish\" Movies in a Minute: \"Next Goal Wins\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Marvels\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Holdovers\" Movies in a Minute: \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" Movies in a Minute \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" Movies in a Minute: \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Exorcist: Believer\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fair Play\" Movies in a Minute: \"Expend4bles\" Movies in a Minute: \"A Haunting in Venice\" Movies in a Minute: \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Equalizer 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Blue Beetle\" Movies in a Minute: \"Gran Turismo\" Movies in a Minute: Mid-year wrap-up Movies in a Minute: \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\" Fans in Mumbai celebrate new Rajinikanth movie Movies in a Minute: \"Haunted Mansion\" Movies in a Minute: \"Barbie\" Movies in a Minute: \"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One\" Movies in a Minute: \"Joy Ride\" Movies in a Minute: \"Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny\" Movies in a Minute: \"No Hard Feelings\" Movies in a Minute: \"Elemental\" Movies in a Minute: \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts\" Movies in a Minute: \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Little Mermaid\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fast X\" Movies in a Minute: \"Book Club: The Next Chapter\" Movies in a Minute: \"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Are You There God?

Jim Henson #IdeaMan, a #DisneyPlus Original Documentary from Academy Award-winning filmmaker Ron Howard, is streaming May 31.\n\n\"Jim Henson Idea Man\" should have been titled: \"Jim Henson Workaholic.\"\n\nIn the Ron Howard documentary, Henson is rarely pictured without a pile of felt or a herd of Muppets more than an arm's reach away.\n\nThat split ping-pong ball and woman's coat (which turned into Kermit the Frog) was only the start.\n\nHenson, in fact, didn't just want puppet shows. He was interested in creating ballets and Broadway musicals. He started by doing commercials, then branched into small films and, his goal, television.\n\nThere he scored on \"The Jimmy Dean Show\" before making his mark with \"Sesame Street.\"\n\nThe PBS series was in keeping with his hit-and-run philosophy. Commercial-length storytelling had its place on the children's series.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Eventually, Oz says, they didn't need to script segments; they worked \"spontaneously.\"\n\nWatching the two create the magic is among the documentary's biggest pleasures. Oz, Henson and other regulars look happy. Equality was key to that.\n\nWhen Rita Moreno guested on \"The Muppet Show,\" she took a little more time with a scene and Henson pointed out, \"We don't do overtime here.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nAs much a worker as the boss, Henson didn't let success stifle his vision. When \"The Muppet Show\" was at its peak, he thought it was time to try something else and moved into movies. While that world wasn't as forgiving, it did show Muppets didn't need to be confined to homes.\n\nTo provide perspective (and explain Jane Henson's role in the family business), Howard includes plenty of interviews with the idea man's five children. They're cautious about the family secrets and gloss over the partnership Disney created with the Muppets. Coming after Henson's death, it was wildly unpopular among fans. Insiders worried, too, but the company continued to produce work for all mediums.\n\nAt Henson's funeral, Caroll Spinney, dressed as Big Bird, sang Kermit's song, \"It's Not Easy Being Green.\" The moment captures the loss and, when the other Muppets turn up, demonstrates how difficult moving on would be.\n\nGlimpses of Henson's experiments are among \"Idea Man's\" greatest contributions. A ballet might have worked; a theme park clearly could have given The Muppets more real estate than the attraction Disney afforded.\n\nMoments from \"Labyrinth\" and \"The Dark Crystal\" show how Henson might have delayed the onslaught of special effects in fantasy films. (Jennifer Connelly talks about the strange world she inhabited in \"Labyrinth\" and what it was like to be part of the Muppet world.)\n\nThose moments override the odd interview Orson Welles conducted with Henson. Howard uses it as a frame of sorts but, certainly, there were other interviews that could have provided more insight.\n\nBecause Henson was such a seminal figure on television, Howard should have provided some comparisons. How did he play in the puppet world? Was he a teacher like Fred Rogers? A comfort like Shari Lewis? Or was he a Disney-level innovator who deserves a place on the entertainment world's Mount Rushmore?\n\n\"Idea Man\" doesn't oversell but it also doesn't give Henson the special place he deserves. Broadway canonizes Stephen Sondheim every other year. Television could do the same for Henson. All it would take is interviews with those who tried to carry on after he was gone.\n\n\"Jim Henson Idea Man\" airs on Disney Plus.\n\nMovies in a minute with film critic Bruce Miller Movies in a Minute: \"Abigail\" Movies in a Minute: \"Civil War\" Movies in a Minute: \"Monkey Man\" Movies in a Minute: \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" Movies in a Minute: \"Late Night With the Devil\" Movies in a Minute: \"Snack Shack\" Movies in a Minute: \"Cabrini\" Movies in a Minute \"Dune: Part Two\" Movies in a Minute: \"Drive-Away Dolls\" Movies in a Minute \"Bob Marley: One Love\" Movies in a Minute: \"Lisa Frankenstein\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Greatest Night in Pop\" Movies in a Minute: \"Poor Things\" Movies in a Minute: Best Actress nominee Sandra Huller Movies in a Minute: \"Mean Girls\" Movies in a Minute: \"Anyone But You\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Color Purple\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Iron Claw\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wonka\" Movies in a Minute: \"May December\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wish\" Movies in a Minute: \"Next Goal Wins\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Marvels\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Holdovers\" Movies in a Minute: \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" Movies in a Minute \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" Movies in a Minute: \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Exorcist: Believer\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fair Play\" Movies in a Minute: \"Expend4bles\" Movies in a Minute: \"A Haunting in Venice\" Movies in a Minute: \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Equalizer 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Blue Beetle\" Movies in a Minute: \"Gran Turismo\" Movies in a Minute: Mid-year wrap-up Movies in a Minute: \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\" Fans in Mumbai celebrate new Rajinikanth movie Movies in a Minute: \"Haunted Mansion\" Movies in a Minute: \"Barbie\" Movies in a Minute: \"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One\" Movies in a Minute: \"Joy Ride\" Movies in a Minute: \"Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny\" Movies in a Minute: \"No Hard Feelings\" Movies in a Minute: \"Elemental\" Movies in a Minute: \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts\" Movies in a Minute: \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Little Mermaid\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fast X\" Movies in a Minute: \"Book Club: The Next Chapter\" Movies in a Minute: \"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Are You There God?

They're cautious about the family secrets and gloss over the partnership Disney created with the Muppets. Coming after Henson's death, it was wildly unpopular among fans. Insiders worried, too, but the company continued to produce work for all mediums.\n\nAt Henson's funeral, Caroll Spinney, dressed as Big Bird, sang Kermit's song, \"It's Not Easy Being Green.\" The moment captures the loss and, when the other Muppets turn up, demonstrates how difficult moving on would be.\n\nGlimpses of Henson's experiments are among \"Idea Man's\" greatest contributions. A ballet might have worked; a theme park clearly could have given The Muppets more real estate than the attraction Disney afforded.\n\nMoments from \"Labyrinth\" and \"The Dark Crystal\" show how Henson might have delayed the onslaught of special effects in fantasy films. (Jennifer Connelly talks about the strange world she inhabited in \"Labyrinth\" and what it was like to be part of the Muppet world.)\n\nThose moments override the odd interview Orson Welles conducted with Henson. Howard uses it as a frame of sorts but, certainly, there were other interviews that could have provided more insight.\n\nBecause Henson was such a seminal figure on television, Howard should have provided some comparisons. How did he play in the puppet world? Was he a teacher like Fred Rogers? A comfort like Shari Lewis? Or was he a Disney-level innovator who deserves a place on the entertainment world's Mount Rushmore?\n\n\"Idea Man\" doesn't oversell but it also doesn't give Henson the special place he deserves. Broadway canonizes Stephen Sondheim every other year. Television could do the same for Henson. All it would take is interviews with those who tried to carry on after he was gone.\n\n\"Jim Henson Idea Man\" airs on Disney Plus.\n\nMovies in a minute with film critic Bruce Miller Movies in a Minute: \"Abigail\" Movies in a Minute: \"Civil War\" Movies in a Minute: \"Monkey Man\" Movies in a Minute: \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" Movies in a Minute: \"Late Night With the Devil\" Movies in a Minute: \"Snack Shack\" Movies in a Minute: \"Cabrini\" Movies in a Minute \"Dune: Part Two\" Movies in a Minute: \"Drive-Away Dolls\" Movies in a Minute \"Bob Marley: One Love\" Movies in a Minute: \"Lisa Frankenstein\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Greatest Night in Pop\" Movies in a Minute: \"Poor Things\" Movies in a Minute: Best Actress nominee Sandra Huller Movies in a Minute: \"Mean Girls\" Movies in a Minute: \"Anyone But You\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Color Purple\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Iron Claw\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wonka\" Movies in a Minute: \"May December\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wish\" Movies in a Minute: \"Next Goal Wins\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Marvels\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Holdovers\" Movies in a Minute: \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" Movies in a Minute \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" Movies in a Minute: \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Exorcist: Believer\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fair Play\" Movies in a Minute: \"Expend4bles\" Movies in a Minute: \"A Haunting in Venice\" Movies in a Minute: \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Equalizer 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Blue Beetle\" Movies in a Minute: \"Gran Turismo\" Movies in a Minute: Mid-year wrap-up Movies in a Minute: \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\" Fans in Mumbai celebrate new Rajinikanth movie Movies in a Minute: \"Haunted Mansion\" Movies in a Minute: \"Barbie\" Movies in a Minute: \"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One\" Movies in a Minute: \"Joy Ride\" Movies in a Minute: \"Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny\" Movies in a Minute: \"No Hard Feelings\" Movies in a Minute: \"Elemental\" Movies in a Minute: \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts\" Movies in a Minute: \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Little Mermaid\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fast X\" Movies in a Minute: \"Book Club: The Next Chapter\" Movies in a Minute: \"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Are You There God?

Jim Henson #IdeaMan, a #DisneyPlus Original Documentary from Academy Award-winning filmmaker Ron Howard, is streaming May 31.\n\n\"Jim Henson Idea Man\" should have been titled: \"Jim Henson Workaholic.\"\n\nIn the Ron Howard documentary, Henson is rarely pictured without a pile of felt or a herd of Muppets more than an arm's reach away.\n\nThat split ping-pong ball and woman's coat (which turned into Kermit the Frog) was only the start.\n\nHenson, in fact, didn't just want puppet shows. He was interested in creating ballets and Broadway musicals. He started by doing commercials, then branched into small films and, his goal, television.\n\nThere he scored on \"The Jimmy Dean Show\" before making his mark with \"Sesame Street.\"\n\nThe PBS series was in keeping with his hit-and-run philosophy. Commercial-length storytelling had its place on the children's series.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Eventually, Oz says, they didn't need to script segments; they worked \"spontaneously.\"\n\nWatching the two create the magic is among the documentary's biggest pleasures. Oz, Henson and other regulars look happy. Equality was key to that.\n\nWhen Rita Moreno guested on \"The Muppet Show,\" she took a little more time with a scene and Henson pointed out, \"We don't do overtime here.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nAs much a worker as the boss, Henson didn't let success stifle his vision. When \"The Muppet Show\" was at its peak, he thought it was time to try something else and moved into movies. While that world wasn't as forgiving, it did show Muppets didn't need to be confined to homes.\n\nTo provide perspective (and explain Jane Henson's role in the family business), Howard includes plenty of interviews with the idea man's five children.

Jim Henson #IdeaMan, a #DisneyPlus Original Documentary from Academy Award-winning filmmaker Ron Howard, is streaming May 31.\n\n\"Jim Henson Idea Man\" should have been titled: \"Jim Henson Workaholic.\"\n\nIn the Ron Howard documentary, Henson is rarely pictured without a pile of felt or a herd of Muppets more than an arm's reach away.\n\nThat split ping-pong ball and woman's coat (which turned into Kermit the Frog) was only the start.\n\nHenson, in fact, didn't just want puppet shows. He was interested in creating ballets and Broadway musicals. He started by doing commercials, then branched into small films and, his goal, television.\n\nThere he scored on \"The Jimmy Dean Show\" before making his mark with \"Sesame Street.\"\n\nThe PBS series was in keeping with his hit-and-run philosophy. Commercial-length storytelling had its place on the children's series.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Eventually, Oz says, they didn't need to script segments; they worked \"spontaneously.\"\n\nWatching the two create the magic is among the documentary's biggest pleasures. Oz, Henson and other regulars look happy. Equality was key to that.\n\nWhen Rita Moreno guested on \"The Muppet Show,\" she took a little more time with a scene and Henson pointed out, \"We don't do overtime here.\"\n\nAs much a worker as the boss, Henson didn't let success stifle his vision. When \"The Muppet Show\" was at its peak, he thought it was time to try something else and moved into movies. While that world wasn't as forgiving, it did show Muppets didn't need to be confined to homes.\n\nTo provide perspective (and explain Jane Henson's role in the family business), Howard includes plenty of interviews with the idea man's five children. They're cautious about the family secrets and gloss over the partnership Disney created with the Muppets. Coming after Henson's death, it was wildly unpopular among fans. Insiders worried, too, but the company continued to produce work for all mediums.\n\nAt Henson's funeral, Caroll Spinney, dressed as Big Bird, sang Kermit's song, \"It's Not Easy Being Green.\" The moment captures the loss and, when the other Muppets turn up, demonstrates how difficult moving on would be.\n\nGlimpses of Henson's experiments are among \"Idea Man's\" greatest contributions. A ballet might have worked; a theme park clearly could have given The Muppets more real estate than the attraction Disney afforded.\n\nMoments from \"Labyrinth\" and \"The Dark Crystal\" show how Henson might have delayed the onslaught of special effects in fantasy films. (Jennifer Connelly talks about the strange world she inhabited in \"Labyrinth\" and what it was like to be part of the Muppet world.)\n\nThose moments override the odd interview Orson Welles conducted with Henson. Howard uses it as a frame of sorts but, certainly, there were other interviews that could have provided more insight.\n\nBecause Henson was such a seminal figure on television, Howard should have provided some comparisons. How did he play in the puppet world? Was he a teacher like Fred Rogers? A comfort like Shari Lewis? Or was he a Disney-level innovator who deserves a place on the entertainment world's Mount Rushmore?\n\n\"Idea Man\" doesn't oversell but it also doesn't give Henson the special place he deserves. Broadway canonizes Stephen Sondheim every other year. Television could do the same for Henson. All it would take is interviews with those who tried to carry on after he was gone.\n\n\"Jim Henson Idea Man\" airs on Disney Plus.\n\nMovies in a minute with film critic Bruce Miller Movies in a Minute: \"Summer Camp\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Blue Angels\" Movies in a Minute: \"Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Fall Guy\" Movies in a Minute: \"Challengers\" Movies in a Minute: \"Abigail\" Movies in a Minute: \"Civil War\" Movies in a Minute: \"Monkey Man\" Movies in a Minute: \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" Movies in a Minute: \"Late Night With the Devil\" Movies in a Minute: \"Snack Shack\" Movies in a Minute: \"Cabrini\" Movies in a Minute \"Dune: Part Two\" Movies in a Minute: \"Drive-Away Dolls\" Movies in a Minute \"Bob Marley: One Love\" Movies in a Minute: \"Lisa Frankenstein\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Greatest Night in Pop\" Movies in a Minute: \"Poor Things\" Movies in a Minute: Best Actress nominee Sandra Huller Movies in a Minute: \"Mean Girls\" Movies in a Minute: \"Anyone But You\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Color Purple\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Iron Claw\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wonka\" Movies in a Minute: \"May December\" Movies in a Minute: \"Wish\" Movies in a Minute: \"Next Goal Wins\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Marvels\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Holdovers\" Movies in a Minute: \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" Movies in a Minute \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" Movies in a Minute: \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Exorcist: Believer\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fair Play\" Movies in a Minute: \"Expend4bles\" Movies in a Minute: \"A Haunting in Venice\" Movies in a Minute: \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Equalizer 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Blue Beetle\" Movies in a Minute: \"Gran Turismo\" Movies in a Minute: Mid-year wrap-up Movies in a Minute: \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\" Fans in Mumbai celebrate new Rajinikanth movie Movies in a Minute: \"Haunted Mansion\" Movies in a Minute: \"Barbie\" Movies in a Minute: \"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One\" Movies in a Minute: \"Joy Ride\" Movies in a Minute: \"Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny\" Movies in a Minute: \"No Hard Feelings\" Movies in a Minute: \"Elemental\" Movies in a Minute: \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts\" Movies in a Minute: \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" Movies in a Minute: \"The Little Mermaid\" Movies in a Minute: \"Fast X\" Movies in a Minute: \"Book Club: The Next Chapter\" Movies in a Minute: \"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3\" Movies in a Minute: \"Are You There God?

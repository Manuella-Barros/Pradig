I believe that monetary policy instruments have been practically overstretched in this quest to tame inflation.\"\n\nInflation\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics, the headline inflation rate increased to 34.19 per cent relative to the May 2024 headline inflation rate, which was 33.95 per cent.\n\nIn June 2024, the inflation rate showed an increase of 0.24 per cent points when compared to the May 2024 headline inflation rate. On a year-on-year basis, the headline inflation rate was 11.40 per cent points higher than that of June 2023 (22.79 per cent).\n\nAlso, on a month-on-month basis, the headline inflation rate in June 2024 was 2.31 per cent, which was 0.17 per cent higher than the rate recorded in May 2024 (2.14 per cent) meaning that the rate of increase in the average price level was higher in June than in May.\n\nAs the MPC holds its meeting, Cowry Asset Management, in its weekly report, stated that while the slow acceleration in the headline inflation over the last four months indicated that the CBN's tightening measures were permeating the economy, there might be side effects.\n\n\"Even as we expect to see a moderation in Nigeria's inflation in the second half of the year, largely due to high base effects, some downside risks to this expectation exist, as consumer prices may face further pressure from higher minimum wage negotiations, significant depreciation of the naira, and high PMS prices due to ongoing fuel scarcity, which could negatively affect transportation costs.\n\n\"Looking ahead to the monetary policy committee of the CBN meeting to decide on various economic indicators while considering the current domestic and international economic outlook, we think the current inflationary pressure leaves the committee with little or no room for a rate tweak in favour of a loosening stance. Thus, a 25 basis points to 50bps hike in interest rates is anticipated,\" the analysts projected.\n\nNACCIMA reacts\n\nThe National President of the Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture, Dele Oye, said a hike in the benchmark interest rate (Monetary Policy Rate) by the CBN can have several potential consequences for businesses.\n\nHe said, \"Higher interest rates mean that loans and lines of credit become more expensive. This can increase the cost of financing for businesses, leading to higher operational costs.\n\n\"As borrowing becomes more expensive, businesses may delay or scale back on investments in expansion, new projects, or capital improvements. This can slow down business growth and innovation.\n\n\"In addition, higher interest rates can lead to increased borrowing costs for consumers as well, which can reduce their disposable income. This typically results in lower consumer spending, which can negatively impact businesses, particularly those in the retail and service sectors.\"\n\nOye said businesses that rely heavily on debt to manage cash flow may find it more challenging to service their debt, leading to potential liquidity issues.\n\nHe added, \"Higher interest rates can make bonds and other fixed-income investments more attractive compared to stocks. This may lead to a decline in stock prices, affecting businesses' market valuations and their ability to raise capital through equity financing.\n\n\"An increase in the benchmark interest rate can strengthen the national currency. While this might reduce the cost of imports, it can make exports less competitive, potentially harming businesses that rely on international markets.\n\n\"While the primary goal of raising interest rates is often to control inflation, it can have a mixed impact on businesses. On one hand, controlling inflation helps maintain purchasing power and economic stability; on the other hand, the immediate effects of higher rates can strain business operations.\"\n\nSpeaking on the impact on consumers' confidence, the NACCIMA boss noted that if consumers perceive rate hikes as a sign of an overheating economy or a response to high inflation, their confidence may be shaken, leading to reduced spending and investment.\n\nHe warned, \"Tighter monetary policy can lead to stricter lending standards, making it harder for businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, to obtain credit.\n\n\"Uncertainty about future interest rate movements can make long-term planning more difficult for businesses. Companies may become more cautious in their strategic decisions, potentially slowing down growth and innovation.\n\n\"In summary, while an increase in the benchmark interest rate can help control inflation, it often introduces higher costs and increased uncertainty for businesses, which can have a range of negative impacts on their operations and growth prospects.\"\n\nOn his part, the National President of the Association of Small Business Owners of Nigeria, Dr Femi Egbesola, said in advanced economies, a hike in interest rate is always a veritable tool to arrest inflation, adding that unfortunately, Nigeria's economy defies that.\n\nHe said, \"The consistent hike in MPR since the beginning of this year has not achieved any significant positive impact. Rather, it's been wholesale negative.\n\n\"Yes, there was disinflation at some point, but it doesn't correlate with the attendant damage done but the hike in interest rate. The OPS community strongly oppose any form of increase in interest rate in totality.\n\n\"We have not recovered from the colossal economic damage the recent past hikes have done on businesses, and it will be economically unwise to proceed on another.\"\n\nEgbesola called on policymakers and regulators to come to the reality that some policies and measures that work perfectly in some climes most often do not work in Nigeria.\n\nThe National Vice President of the Nigerian Association of Small-Scale Industrialists, Segun Kuti-George, said If there is an increase in the MPR, it means the cost of funds would increase and that would adversely affect those in the manufacturing sector.\n\n\"With the situation of things, I do not think they have much, I mean any alternative than to increase it. But any increase will spell greater doom for borrowing, for users of funds,\" he stated.\n\nAlso reacting, a consultant with the Nigerian Economic Summit Group, Dr Ikenna Nwosu, urged the MPC to look for other ways of addressing inflation instead of increasing the interest rate.\n\n\"The essence of their increase is to control inflation according to what they said. But the question is, is that the only inflation control tool? It is not. You have to look for other ways to mop up liquidity.\n\n\"The CBN should go to the rural traders and do a public sensitisation for people to put their monies in the bank. The former CBN boss said that the amount of money in circulation outside the banking sector is big and that is what is leading to the inflation,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "punchng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Punch Newspapers"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Nigeria", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Bank of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privately_held_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Privately held company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_(Abu_Dhabi)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The National (Abu Dhabi)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_level", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price level"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Line of credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_and_discretionary_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disposable and discretionary income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_indicator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic indicator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depreciation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Depreciation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_naira", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nigerian naira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_of_commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chamber of commerce"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/11102501/Inflation.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9755234", "eventUri": "eng-9755234", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

So, the MPC will still be concerned about the need to narrow the negative interest rate as well as curtail the pressure in the forex market.\"\n\nHe added, \"Only recently, the CBN was compelled to resume interventions in the forex market in defence of the international value of the domestic currency.\n\n\"Nevertheless, if I were a member of the MPC, I would vote for a hold position, as the aggressive policy rate hike is taking a toll on output.\n\n\"Production is stifled because of very high cost of funds. Moreover, the seeming over reliance on the MPR as a tool to tame inflation does not appear to be making any meaningful impact due to the significant non-monetary factors driving inflation in Nigeria, such as high cost of energy, transport, as well as insecurity in the food-belt regions of the country.\n\n\"The high cost of credit is also a factor contributing to cost-push inflation. This is due in part to a very high CRR of 45 per cent, representing sterilised bank deposits with the CBN.\n\n\"This liquidity squeeze is now driving undue pressure by banks on the CBN's Standing Lending Facility.\"\n\nManaging Director/Chief Executive, Dignity Finance and Investment Limited, Dr. Chijioke Ekechukwu, said the existing high MPR was already stifling the economy.\n\nEkechukwu stated, \"Any further tightening will worsen the economic hardship faced by Nigerians. The higher the MPR, the more the inflation rate in Nigeria's situation.\n\n\"This is so because there are other factors influencing the inflation rate other than money in circulation, which tightening tries to address.\"\n\nManaging Director/Chief Executive, SD&D Capital Management Limited, Mr. Idakolo Gbolade, said, \"CBN MPC will likely hike interest rate based on the body language of the CBN governor who has in several fora stated that the way to curb inflation is continuous hike in interest rates.\n\n\"However, I think the committee should take stock of its decisions in the past four MPC meetings and see the continuous increase in interest rate has not brought down inflationary trend but has further pushed inflation to record levels.\"\n\nHe also said, \"I have always advocated that interest rate hike alone cannot reduce inflation on the long run while others factors affecting inflation, like weak Naira, high energy cost and high cost of production are not tackled

The black market's high price behaviour suggests that the naira will continue to face resistance near the 1,600/$ resistance line.\n\nThe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the CBN increased the monetary policy rate (MPR) from 24.75% to 26.25%, a 150-basis point increase, during its most recent meeting on May 21, 2024. The previous MPC sessions in 2024 resulted in three rate hikes, which helped the country's foreign portfolio investments (FPI) increase but fell short of the inflation reduction aim.\n\nThe market has already priced in the possibility that the elevated inflation rate will lead to a fourth rate increase this year in the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR).\n\nThe MPC members' choice to take a conventional approach to reducing inflationary pressure by utilizing the interest rate instrument has greatly influenced their decision to stick with their hawkish posture, yet Nigeria's inflation hasn't been contained. Since the last MPC MPR decision in May 2024, inflation has increased by 0.24% to 34.19% in June 2024.\n\nNigeria's yearly inflation rate has remained high despite some steps taken by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to lower the consumer price index, which has been high for 28 years. As a result of the June inflation rate rising from 33.95% in May 2024 to 34.19%, the CBN's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is anticipated to hike interest rates on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to economist Andrew Matheny of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., \"developments since the last meeting have been hawkish; inflation has not slowed at all. Above all, the value of the naira has declined once more. And it is undoubtedly inflationary. All of it suggests that the CBN will continue to lean hawkish.\"\n\nNumerous households are now below the poverty line due to the naira's continued drop in value, the 18th consecutive month of price hikes, and a decline in purchasing power. World Bank data revealed the oil-rich West African nation has the second-highest poverty rate after India, with an estimated 87 million people living below the poverty line.\n\nTo stop inflation and alter the perception of foreign investors, Goldman is urging the central bank to do \"something much bigger, much bolder, much more decisive.\" According to Matheny, \"an additional 50 or 100 basis points is not going to move the needle in the eyes of an investor.\"\n\nSince February, the Cardoso-led CBN has increased lending rates by a total of 750 basis points, to 26.25%.

The liquidity ratio was pegged at 30 per cent.\n\nThe apex bank also adjusted the asymmetric corridor around the MPR from +100 to -300 basis points around the MPR to +500 and -100 basis points around the MPR.\n\nThe recent hike totals a cumulative 800 basis points hike in MPR since Mr Cardoso took over the reins of the apex bank. This has seen the benchmark interest rate rise from 18.75 per cent to 26.75 per cent.\n\nThe apex bank, in February, increased the MPR by 400 basis points. This was followed by another 200 basis points and then 150 basis points before the latest increase.\n\nCardoso, who is the Chairman of the MPC, explained that recent events in the economy such as inflation and the need to stabilise the foreign exchange market were the reasons for the increase.\n\nHe further referenced recent policies of the federal government to import-specific staple foods such as rice, maize and wheat to help stem the rising food inflation, but warned that the timeline should be followed in order not to stifle the gains made in local food production.\n\nCardoso praised the convergence between the official exchange rate and that of the parallel market as part of efforts to reduce arbitrage in that sector.\n\nDormant accounts are more susceptible to fraud, CBN wants to safe-keep the funds - Cardoso\n\nWhile clarifying the new guidelines to banks on dormant accounts, Cardoso stated that dormant accounts in Nigeria were more susceptible to fraudsters and that the reason for the CBN's latest policy was for safe keeping of the funds.\n\nHe said, \"The policy and the directive is meant to ensure that all those monies come to the central bank for safe keeping and it is at zero cost to the beneficiaries. All that will happen is that the central bank will manage the money within our possession and when the rightful owner surfaces, the money is returned plus whatever income is accrued to you.\"\n\n...Says middlemen contributing to Nigeria's food inflation\n\nThe governor also accused middlemen who finance farmers of contributing to Nigeria's food inflation.\n\nHe said, \"The increasing activities of middlemen, who often finance smallholder farmers, obligate, hoard and move farm produce across the border to neighbouring countries.\n\n\"The committee suggested they need to put in check such activities in order to address the food supply deficit in the Nigerian market to moderate food prices. The MPC, therefore, resolved to sustain collaboration with the fiscal authority to ensure that inflationary pressure is subdued.\"\n\n...Nigeria suffering from consequence of not diversifying economy\n\nReacting to the concerns that the monetary policies have failed to curtail inflation, the CBN governor said, \"A monolithic economy has its own risks. And part of those risks, of course, is that if anything happens to your dependency, then the whole system gets shaken. And I guess in many respects; that is part of what we are going through. Part of it is, not all, certainly part of it because let's not forget that there are global headwinds as well. And that going forward, we must ensure that we are able to craft policies that are sustainable and will bring a sustainable method of development for our people.\"\n\nHe added, \"No matter the policies crafted, if the institutions are not there to support those policies, then you sub-optimise and again from the CBN's perspective, that is very important. Now, these things have to go hand in hand.\"\n\nMove will further squeeze liquidity from the banking system - Experts\n\nA Professor of Finance and Capital Market at the Nasarawa State University, Keffi, Uche Uwaleke, said, \"Having done 750 basis points between February and May, this year, I had predicted they would do a minimum of 50bps or a max of 100bps in July.\n\n\"I am glad to note that they chose the floor which is a sign that a complete halt is most likely in their next scheduled meeting in September.\n\n\"But the adjustment to the asymmetric corridor around the MPR is a major source of concern for me.\"\n\nHe said the MPC communique did not provide any explanation for increasing the SLR (Statutory Liquidity Ratio) from +100 to +500 and the SDR (Special Drawing Right) from -300 to -100.\n\nHe argued that by implication, with an MPR of 26.75 per cent, banks would now get loans from the CBN at 31.75 per cent while they would be remunerated for their excess deposits at 25.75 per cent.\n\nHe said this would further squeeze liquidity from the banking system and jerk up the cost of credit with adverse consequences on output and the equities market.\n\nHe further said, \"The MPC communique should have made it clear why it was better to mask the tightening in the asymmetric corridor than reveal it in the MPR.\n\n\"May I observe that unlike previous MPC communiques, recent ones are silent regarding how the members voted. This information is useful at this stage even before their personal statements are published.\n\n\"I submit that as far as taming the current elevated inflation in Nigeria is concerned in view of its major non-monetary drivers, the fiscal side holds the ace.\"\n\nAn economist and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise, Dr Muda Yusuf, said, \"Expectedly, the CBN hiked interest rate by 50 basis points. This appears to be a moderation in its aggressive tightening stance.

This represents a rise of fewer than 100 basis points from N1,580 on Friday.\n\nTo bolster the nation's collapsing foreign exchange market, the CBN sold about $106.5 million to authorized foreign exchange dealers over two days last week.\n\nThe top bank in Nigeria asserts that the heightened demand from corporate entities and the anticipated summer spike are the main causes of the latest volatility in the foreign exchange market.\n\nNigeria's strong inflation rate means that the MPC meeting would probably result in a little rate hike. The naira is likely to encounter resistance in the vicinity of the 1,600/$ resistance line, based on the high pricing behaviour observed on the illicit market.\n\nAt its most recent meeting on May 21, 2024, the CBN's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the monetary policy rate (MPR) by 150 basis points, from 24.75% to 26.25%. Three rate hikes during the previous MPC sessions in 2024 contributed to the growth of the nation's foreign portfolio investments (FPI) but fell short of the goal of reducing inflation.\n\nThe likelihood that the high rate of inflation will result in the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) increasing for the fourth time this year has already been priced in by the market.\n\nThe MPC members' decision to maintain their hawkish stance has been significantly impacted by their decision to adopt a traditional strategy of lowering inflationary pressure through the use of the interest rate instrument; nonetheless, Nigeria's inflation has not been controlled. In June 2024, the rate of inflation increased by 0.24% to 34.19% following the most recent MPC MPR decision in May 2024.\n\nDespite certain actions taken by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to lower the consumer price index, which has been high for 28 years, Nigeria's annual inflation rate has remained high. Interest rates are expected to be raised on Tuesday by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the CBN due to the June inflation rate increasing from 33.95% in May 2024 to 34.19%.\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Andrew Matheny stated that \"developments since the last meeting have been hawkish; inflation has not slowed at all. Above all, the value of the naira has fallen once more. And it is unquestionably inflationary. All of this suggests that the CBN will continue to be hawkish.\"\n\nBecause of the 18th straight month of price increases, the naira's declining value, and a loss in purchasing power, many households are now below the poverty line. According to World Bank data, the oil-rich West African country has an estimated 87 million people living below the poverty line, making it the country with the second-highest poverty rate behind India.\n\nTo reduce inflation and change foreign investors' perceptions, Goldman is encouraging the central bank to undertake \"something much bigger, much bolder, much more decisive.\" As Matheny notes, \"an additional 50 or 100 basis points is not going to move the needle in the eyes of an investor.\"", "source": {"uri": "thenews-chronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News Chronicle"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ken_ibenne@thenews-chronicle.com", "name": "Ken Ibenne", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "augustina_john@thenews-chronicle.com", "name": "Augustina John", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "hassan_haruna@thenews-chronicle.com", "name": "Hassan Haruna", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "pius_kadon@thenews-chronicle.com", "name": "Pius Kadon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "isaac_asabor@thenews-chronicle.com", "name": "Isaac Asabor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Nigeria", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Bank of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_naira", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigerian naira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_threshold", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poverty threshold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Purchasing power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/thenews-chronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/The-Naira-vs-the-Dollar-e1720861125848.png?fit=900%2C496&ssl=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9755234", "eventUri": "eng-9755234", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Pressures, CBN Further Raises MPR to 26.75%", "body": "*Cardoso: Addressing insecurity, transportation will bring down food prices\n\n*Diaspora remittances hit $2.34bn, FX inflows $38.8 billion, capital importation $5.92 billion\n\nThe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) yesterday resolved to raise the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR), the benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points to 26.75 per cent from 26.25 per cent.\n\nThe committee also adjusted the asymmetric corridor around the MPR to +500/-100 from +100/- 300 basis points.\n\nIt however, retained the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) of Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) at 45 per cent and Merchant Banks at 14 per cent, as well as retain the Liquidity Ratio (LR) at 30 per cent.\n\nThis is the fourth time in a row that the central had raised interest since February.\n\nAddressing journalists at the end of the two-day meeting of the MPC in Abuja, CBN Governor, Mr. Olayemi Cardoso, said the committee was mindful of the effect of rising prices on households and businesses and expressed its resolve to take necessary measures to bring inflation under control.\n\nThe committee further re-emphasised its commitment to CBN's price stability mandate, expressing optimism that despite the June 2024 uptick in headline inflation, prices are expected to moderate in the near-term.\n\nThis came as Director General,\n\nNigeria Employer's Consultative Association (NECA), Mr. Adewale-Smatt Oyerinde, said the hike in MPR was unlikely to douse inflation amid the Naira's continued depreciation at the FX market.\n\nAlso, Chief Executive, Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE), Dr. Muda Yusuf, the marginal increase in MPR marked a softening of the MPC's tightening stance.\n\nThe MPC further doubled down on its commitment to stay on course with its tightening cycle in view of the urgent need to address inflationary pressures to consolidate on the gains achieved so far.\n\nThe committee particularly hinged its optimism on monetary policy gaining further traction, in addition to recent measures by the fiscal authority to address food inflation.\n\nCardoso, who read the committee's communique, specifically noted the persistence of food inflation, which continues to undermine price stability.\n\nHe said while monetary policy has been moderating aggregate demand, rising food and energy costs continue to exert upward pressure on price development.\n\nNotably, the CBN governor pointed out that the prevailing insecurity in food producing areas and high cost of transportation of farm produce are also contributing to headline inflation.\n\nHe said the committee was therefore, not oblivious to the urgent benefit of addressing these challenges as it will offer a sustainable solution to the persistent pressure on food prices.\n\nThe CBN also considered the increasing activities of middlemen who often finance smallholder farmers, aggregate, hoard and move farm produce across the border to neighbouring countries.\n\nThe committee, thus, highlighted the need to put in check such activities in order to address the food supply deficit in the Nigerian market to moderate prices.\n\nThe MPC, therefore, resolved to sustain collaboration with the fiscal authority to ensure that inflationary pressure is subdued.\n\nAccording to Cardoso, the MPC further expressed optimism with the recent stop gap measures by the federal government to bridge the food supply deficit.\n\nIn particular, he noted that the 150-day duty free import window for food commodities including maize, husked brown rice, wheat and cowpeas, among others, will moderate domestic food prices.\n\nThe central bank stated that these measures will not lead to direct injection of liquidity into the economy as to cause further inflation.\n\nThe apex bank boss also noted that while the measure was a welcome development and may prove effective in the short run, \"it is expedient that it is implemented with a defined exit strategy to avert a possible rollback of the recent gains in domestic food production.\n\nHe stated that to support these initiatives, the CBN was already engaging Development Finance institutions (DFIs) including the Bank of Industry (BOI) to ensure adequate support to industries with a focus on Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs).\n\nOn the Foreign Exchange (FX) segment, Cardoso noted the narrowing spread between the various foreign exchange segments of the market, which he said was an indication of price discovery and improved market efficiency, thus reducing opportunities for arbitrage and speculation.\n\nThe MPC also noted that the increase in the level of external reserves would further build confidence for a more stable exchange rate and thus urged the bank to explore available avenues to improve inflows, especially through diaspora remittances.\n\nThe committee also acknowledged the sustained resilience of the banking system, reflected in improvements of key financial soundness indicators (FSIs), and further encouraged the continued need for close monitoring of the system, as the implementation of the recapitalisation exercise progresses.\n\nCardoso also explained that the various reform initiatives in the FX segment had been positive.\n\nHe said exchange rate has converged, limiting the opportunities for arbitrage.\n\nHe disclosed that that FX inflows had increased from 37.93 per cent between January and May 2024 to $38.8 billion while net inflows grew by 73.4 per cent May 2024 compared to May 2023.\n\nCardoso also stated that diaspora remittances had currently gone up to $2.34 billion in compared to $1.58 billion in the corresponding period last year.\n\nHe said capital importation also increased to $5.92 billion between January and June compared to $1.77 billion same period last year.\n\nHe said, \"So, that's all very positive for foreign exchange management. We've also seen that on the capital markets policies, the capital market has been responding positively and of course, the banking sector.\n\n\"We have been very aggressive in giving guidance to the banks with respect to how we want them to position themselves for the future of the $1 trillion economy.\n\n\"Inflation targeting is something that is an ongoing process, which we will be giving more and more guidance as we go along.\"\n\nThe CBN governor insisted that\n\nthe aim of monetary policy decisions were meant to impact the man on the street, pointing out that the current economy hardship were a result of policy choices by past administrations.\n\nHe said, \"It is important to cast our minds back and ask ourselves how did we get to where we are today. Let us not forget that over a period of time, we had an economy and have failed to diversify that economy. We would argue that the Nigerian economy has basically been a monolithic one, dependent on one source of revenue.\n\n\"Now, of course, a monolithic economy has its own risks. And part of those risks, of course, is that if anything happens to your dependency, then the whole system gets shaken.\n\n\"And I guess in many respects, that is part of what we're going through. Part of it is, not all, certainly part of it because let's not forget that there are global headwinds as well.\n\n\"And that going forward, we must ensure that we are able to craft policies that are sustainable and will bring a sustainable method of development for our people.\"\n\nCardoso said the CBN was currently engaging with the Organised Private Sector (OPS) which had been raising concerns over the continued monetary tightening regime of the bank.\n\nHe said, \"Inflation really and truly is having a major impact on our economy. Purchasing power is getting eroded. People are being pushed into different categories of poverty, and it is in their own interest that we are able to take the scourge of inflation.\n\n\"If not, the ramifications will also be for them. It's not on the average man alone. We understand the need for growth and we also understand that it is relatively challenging when you have high-interest rates.\n\n\"We also understand that, quite frankly, my belief is that it is so fundamental to the long-term future and stability of our economy that inflation should be brought under control that in the short term these are pains which ultimately will be able to help our economy and help the manufacturing businesses as well.\"\n\nOn CBN's recent policy on dormant accounts, Cardoso said the move was in the interest of account holders, adding that the apex bank should be commended for taking the steps to safeguard them from fraudsters.\n\nHe said, \"Over the years, in my experience what I found personally, is that if you leave the accounts dormant in banks...In fact, most times, they are more susceptible to fraudsters copying your identity and trying to game the system to grab all of your money.\n\n\"So, that is a problem that I think most DMBs face and I'm sure if you've been on the receiving end, I have been, then you know that anything that can protect you in the process from these kinds of predators will be welcomed.\"\n\nHe said the policy directive was meant to ensure that all those monies come to the central bank for safekeeping. You don't lose your money and it is at zero cost to the beneficiaries.\n\n\"All that will happen is that the central bank will manage the monies within our position and when the rightful owner surfaces, the money is returned, plus whatever income is accrued to them.\n\n\"I think this should be a welcome development, even from the naysayers because at a time like this, we recognise the fact that everybody needs every single penny that belongs to them, to accrue to them and not have a situation where you're putting money in a particular place and essentially end up losing it. Of course, it will create liquidity within the system as well.\"\n\nHowever, reacting to the policy rate adjustment, Oyerinde stated that the latest increase MPR in the second quarter to address the persisting inflationary growth in the economy might not be sufficient to tackle inflation \"as long as the Naira kept depreciating at the foreign exchange market\".\n\nHe observed that the upward adjustment in policy rate would lead to further increase in cost of credit, which is about 30 per cent at the moment.\n\nThe NECA boss said it has become more difficult for businesses to maintain existing investments and almost impossible for significant new investments to take place.\n\nAccording to him, \"The persistent use of MPR to moderate inflation may yield limited results so long as the huge depreciation in Naira's value that has shrunk business activities in the real sector remains unchecked.\"\n\nHe therefore, urged the CBN to prioritise an exchange rate management procedure that will address the huge erosion in Naira's value.\n\nHe also emphasised the need for a strong and deepened collaboration between monetary and fiscal authorities in the management of the economy.\n\nHe said, \"A collaboration of Federal Ministry of Finance, Federal Ministry of Budget and Economic Planning and CBN in economic policy development will be most efficacious in the current economic quagmire.\"\n\nAlso, the CPPE chief executive\n\nsaid the hike in interest rate appeared to be a moderation in the CBN's aggressive tightening stance.\n\nYusuf said it is perhaps a reflection of some responsiveness to the clamour by stakeholders in the real economy for the apex bank to effect a deceleration in its rate hikes.\n\nHe said: \"Although my preference was for a pause on the rate's increases because of the enormity of the headwinds that businesses are grappling with.\n\n\"But the marginal increase marks a softening of the tightening stance.\n\n\"It is tolerable and I believe we should now accelerate the implementation of the fiscal policy measures to tackle inflation.\n\n\"Already the Economic Stabilisation Plan contains a number of laudable fiscal policy measures that could reduce production costs in the economy.\"\n\nHe said it was also important and urgent for the government to adopt and quickly implement the recommendation of the Presidential Committee on Fiscal and Tax Reforms on the customs duty exchange rate, which proposed N800/dollar.\n\n\"The adoption of this recommendation would have a considerable impact on the cost of goods and services in the country,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "thisdaylive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "THISDAYLIVE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "deji_elumoye@thisdaylive.com", "name": "Deji Elumoye", "type": "author",

It re-emphasized its commitment to the Bank's price stability mandate and remained optimistic that despite the June 2024 uptick in headline inflation, prices are expected to moderate in the near term.\n\n\"This is hinged on monetary policy gaining further traction, in addition to recent measures by the fiscal authority to address food inflation.\n\nIn its consideration, the Committee noted the persistence of food inflation, which continues to undermine price stability. It was observed that while monetary policy has been moderating aggregate demand, rising food and energy costs continue to exert upward pressure on price development.\n\nInsecurity in farming communities\n\n\"The prevailing insecurity in food producing areas and high cost of transportation of farm produce are also contributing to this trend. Members were, therefore, not oblivious to the urgent benefit of addressing these challenges as it will offer a sustainable solution to the persistent pressure on food prices.\n\n\"Also noted in its consideration, is the increasing activities of middlemen who often finance smallholder farmers, aggregate, hoard and move farm produce across the border to neighbouring countries. The Committee suggested the need to put in check such activities in order to address the food supply deficit in the Nigerian market to moderate food prices.\"\n\nCollaboration with fiscal authorities\n\nHe said, \"The MPC, therefore, resolved to sustain collaboration with the fiscal authority to ensure that inflationary pressure is subdued.\n\n\"In addition, the Committee expressed optimism with the recent stop gap measures by the Federal Government to bridge the food supply deficit. In particular, the 150-day duty free import window for food commodities (maize, husked brown rice, wheat and cowpeas), amongst others, will moderate domestic food prices. It is noteworthy that these measures will not lead to direct injection of liquidity into the economy as to cause further inflation.\n\n\"While the measure is a welcome development and may prove effective in the short run, is expedient that it is implemented with a defined exit strategy to avert a possible rollback of the recent gains in domestic food production.\n\n\"To support these initiatives, the Bank is already engaging Development Finance institutions like the Bank of Industry (BOI) to ensure adequate support to industries with a focus on Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs).\"\n\nThe CBN boss said the MPC was optimistic that the increase in the level of external reserves put at $37. 05 billion as of July 18, (compared with $34.70 billion as at end June) would go a long way to bolster confidence in the foreign exchange market.\n\n$5.92b Capital Importation\n\nGovernor Cardoso disclosed that capital importation of over $5.92 billion was recorded as of June end compared with $1.77 as at the same period of last year. Diaspora remittances stood at $2.43 at the same period, as against $1.5 of last year.\n\nHe said that the bank would further explore available avenues to improve inflows, especially through Diaspora remittances and foreign investments.\n\nCardoso expressed optimism that government and private sector efforts toward improving domestic refining capacity would reduce foreign exchange currently being expended on the importation of refined petroleum products.\n\nMPR hike increases uncertainty for businesses - NACCIMA\n\nReacting, National President of Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines, and Agriculture, NACCIMA, Dele Oye, said that increase in the benchmark interest rate, though can control inflation, often leads to higher costs and increased uncertainty for businesses, which can have a range of negative impacts on their operations and growth prospects.\n\nHe said: \"A hike in the benchmark interest rate (MPR) by CBN can have several potential consequences for businesses, including: Increased Borrowing Costs - Higher interest rates mean that loans and lines of credit become more expensive, which can increase the cost of financing for businesses, leading to higher operational costs; Reduced Investment - As borrowing becomes more expensive, businesses may delay or scale back on investments in expansion, new projects, or capital improvements and this can slow down business growth and innovation; and Decreased Consumer Spending - Higher interest rates can lead to increased borrowing costs for consumers as well, which can reduce their disposable income, which typically results in lower consumer spending, which can negatively impact businesses, particularly those in the retail and service sectors.\"\n\nIt'll worsen businesses ability to maintain investments, forestall fresh ones -- NECA\n\nAlso reacting, the Nigeria Employers' Consultative Association, NECA, warned that the latest increase in the MPR, to 26.75 percent to address the persisting inflationary growth in the economy, will worsened the ability of businesses to maintain existing investments and forestall new investments..\n\nThe Director- General of NECA, Mr. Adewale-Smatt Oyerinde, said: \"The implication is that it becomes more difficult for businesses to maintain existing investments and almost impossible for significant new investments to take place. Of course, once investment declines, capacity utilization, volume of activity, employment and profit would be affected negatively.\n\n\"The persistent use of MPR to moderate inflation may yield limited result so long as the huge depreciation in Naira value that has shrunk business activities in the real sector remains unchecked. The CBN should prioritize an exchange rate management procedure that will address the huge erosion in the Naira.\"\n\nTightening further squeeze liquidity from banking system, jerk up cost of credit -- Prf Uwaleke\n\nReacting as well, Prof Uche Uwaleke, President, Association of Capital Market Academics of Nigeria, ACMAN, said: \"Having done 750 basis points between February and May this year, I had predicted they would do a minimum of 50bps or a max of 100bps in July.\n\nI am glad to note that they chose the floor which is a sign that a complete halt is most likely in their next scheduled meeting in September.\n\nBut the adjustment to the asymmetric corridor around the MPR is a major source of concern for me.\n\nThe MPC communiqu\u00e9 did not provide any explanation for increasing the SLR from +100 to +500 and the SDR from -300 to -100.\n\nBy implication, with an MPR of 26.75%, banks will now get loans from the CBN at 31.75% while they will be remunerated for their excess deposits at 25.75%. This will further squeeze liquidity from the banking system and jerk up cost of credit with adverse consequences on output and the equities market.\n\nThe MPC communiqu\u00e9 should have made it clear why it was better to mask the tightening in the asymmetric corridor than reveal it in the MPR.\"\n\nCBN is aggressively dissuading banks from tapping liquidity- Afrinvest\n\nIn their comment, analysts at Afrinvest Research stated: \"Firstly, the surprise tweak in the MPR suggests that the CBN is aggressively dissuading banks from tapping liquidity through the Standing Lending Facility (SLF) window.\n\n\"For context, the tweak in the asymmetric corridor to +500/-100bps around the MPR implies that banks seeking to tap funds through the SLF window would have to pay a cost of fund of 31.75% per annum from 27.25% previously.\n\n\"Meanwhile for banks with excess liquidity willing to play at the Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) window would only receive 25.75% interest per annum, thereby expanding the negative spread between SLF and SDF to 600bps from 400bps. Based on our assessment of industry data, banks tapped N73.6tn through the SLF window between January and July 2024, representing 8.5x the size of activities at the SDF window. We expect pressure to mount on banks' ability to balance risk-return going forward.\"", "source": {"uri": "vanguardngr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vanguard News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NACCIMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NACCIMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Nigeria", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Bank of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Food prices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Entertainment_Collectibles_Association", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Entertainment Collectibles Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diaspora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remittance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Remittance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_of_commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chamber of commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_stability", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Price stability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_and_medium-sized_enterprises", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Small and medium-sized enterprises"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medium (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowpea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cowpea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallholding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smallholding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oil refinery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Broadcasting_Network", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian Broadcasting Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Public_Radio", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Public Radio"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Banks", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Banks", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/CBN-building.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9755234", "eventUri": "eng-9755234", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 4511, "textEnd": 4518}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

This decision was announced by the CBN Governor, Mr. Olayemi Cardoso, at the conclusion of the apex bank's 296th MPC meeting held in Abuja.\n\nAlongside the interest rate hike, the MPC has set the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) for Deposit Money Banks at 45% and for merchant banks at 14%. The liquidity ratio has been pegged at 30%. Furthermore, the apex bank has adjusted the asymmetric corridor around the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) from +100 to -300 basis points to +500 and -100 basis points.\n\nExplaining the rationale behind the 50-basis point increase, Mr. Yemi Cardoso, Chairman of the MPC, cited recent economic events such as rising inflation and the need to stabilize the foreign exchange market. He noted the federal government's efforts to import specific staple foods like rice, maize, and wheat to curb the escalating food inflation but stressed the importance of adhering to the timeline to avoid undermining local food production gains.\n\nMr. Cardoso also praised the convergence between the official exchange rate and the parallel market rate, viewing it as a crucial step towards reducing arbitrage in the foreign exchange sector.\n\nThis latest increase marks the fourth consecutive interest rate hike by the CBN in 2024, continuing from similar hikes in 2023. Since Mr. Cardoso assumed leadership of the apex bank, the MPR has seen a cumulative rise of 800 basis points, escalating from 18.75% to 26.75%.\n\nThe CBN's aggressive stance on interest rate hikes began in February with a 400 basis point increase, followed by subsequent hikes of 200 and 150 basis points, culminating in the current 50 basis point rise.\n\nCriticism from Economists and Industry Experts\n\nDespite the CBN's justification, the business community has expressed concerns about the trend. The increased cost of accessing capital has notably impacted businesses, with prominent figures like Africa's richest man, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, asserting that high interest rates stifle economic growth and job creation. Dangote said early this month that economic growth would be unattainable if bank interest rates remained around 30%.\n\nEconomists and other industry experts have also raised alarms regarding the efficacy of the CBN's monetary policy tightening. The World Bank has warned that increasing interest rates, among other CBN policies, will not effectively curb inflation.\n\nSimilarly, the National Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industries, Mines, and Agriculture (NACCIMA) has noted that the CBN's policies contribute to inflation rather than mitigate it.\n\nEconomist Kalu Aja criticized the CBN's approach, likening it to addressing the symptoms rather than the root cause.\n\n\"What CBN is doing is addressing the headache of a patient who broke his leg. They have administered panadol, which is legal, correct, and helpful. But the leg is still broken,\" he said, pointing out that Nigeria's inflation is fundamentally a food problem. Aja said that until food becomes affordable, inflation will persist.\n\nInterest Rates Hikes Isn't Working\n\nFor years, the CBN has been raising interest rates as a measure to control inflation. However, these efforts have not yielded the desired results, as inflation rates have continued to climb. The persistent rise in inflation despite monetary tightening raises questions about the effectiveness of interest rate hikes as a standalone tool to combat inflation in Nigeria's unique economic context.\n\nThe CBN's strategy has been to increase the cost of borrowing, theoretically reducing the money supply and curbing demand-pull inflation. However, the inflationary pressures in Nigeria are largely driven by supply-side factors such as food scarcity, high import costs, and infrastructural deficits, which are less responsive to interest rate adjustments.\n\nThis disconnect between policy measures and economic realities has led to growing frustration among stakeholders.", "source": {"uri": "tekedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tekedia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "samuel_nwite@tekedia.com", "name": "Samuel Nwite", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Henrique_Cardoso", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fernando Henrique Cardoso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Nigeria", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Bank of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_exchange_rate_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fixed exchange rate system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merchant bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Game theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wheat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staple_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Staple food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliko_Dangote", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aliko Dangote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arbitrage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exchange rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand-pull_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Demand-pull inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply-side_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply-side economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://tkcdn.tekedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/12164720/CBN-yemi.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9755234", "eventUri": "eng-9755234", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

It can be considered the interest rate the CBN uses to lend to banks who then lend to customers at a higher rate.\n\nThe CBN has since February 2024, hiked MPR by 750 basis points, making the cost of borrowing increased to about 26.25 per cent.\n\nStakeholders had raised concerns and warned the CBN against further hikes in interest rates.\n\nEarlier, the Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines, and Agriculture (NACCIMA) warned against the potential consequences of another MPR. National President of NACCIMA, Dele Oye, pointed out that while an increase in interest rate might help control inflation, it often resulted in higher costs and increased uncertainty, which could have a range of negative impacts on businesses and growth prospects.\n\nOye said further rate hikes would increase borrowing costs, lead to reduced investment, decreased consumer spending, impact on stock prices, cash flow challenges, inflation control, and long-term planning, among others.\n\nAlso cautioning the CBN against further hikes in interest rates, Director, Institute of Capital Market Studies, Nasarawa State University, Keffi (NSUK), Professor Uche Uwaleke, noted that despite the aggressive hike in the MPR between February and May, \"headline inflation rose to 34.19 per cent year-on-year in June\".\n\nHe added, \"Production is stifled because of the very high cost of funds. Moreover, the seeming overreliance on the MPR as a tool to tame inflation does not appear to be making any meaningful impact due to the significant non-monetary factors driving inflation in Nigeria, such as the high cost of energy, transport, as well as insecurity in the food-belt regions of the country.\"\n\nSimilarly, Managing Director/Chief Executive, Dignity Finance and Investment Limited, Chijioke Ekechukwu, said the previous hike in MPR was already stifling the economy.\n\nHowever, Cardoso, on Tuesday, expressed optimism that the various tools deployed by the bank to tame inflation and create a stable foreign exchange market would yield the needed results in the coming months.\n\n\"The committee was mindful of the effect of rising prices on households and businesses and expressed its resolve to take necessary measures to bring inflation under control.\n\n\"It re-emphasised its commitment to the bank price stability mandate and remained optimistic that despite the June 2024 uptick in headline inflation, prices are expected to moderate in the near term,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Cardoso, these decisions hinged on the success of the monetary policy in addition to other measures by the fiscal authority to address food inflation.", "source": {"uri": "thewillnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "THEWILL NEWS MEDIA - Nigeria News, Nigeria Politics, Breaking News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "felix_ifijeh@thewillnews.com", "name": "Felix Ifijeh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Nigeria", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Bank of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasarawa_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nasarawa State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keffi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keffi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Keffi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_stability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price stability"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://thewillnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/TheWill-News-breaking-news.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9755234", "eventUri": "eng-9755234", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 7}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Previously, the rate was 27.25 per cent.\n\nAlso, banks would get higher interest from depositing excess liquidity at CBN through the standard deposit facility (SDF). Henceforth, banks would get 25.75 per cent from 'lending' to the apex bank.\n\nBoth scenarios would increase illiquidity and increase the cost of lending in the coming months. The Guardian had earlier reported that the transfer of dormant account proceeds would reduce the money supply by about N20 trillion, leaving the economy more starved of liquidity and raising the competition for funding.\n\nAt the end of the CBN's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting in Abuja, yesterday, the governor of the CBN, Olayemi Cardoso, said the MPC adjusted the asymmetric corridor around the MPR from +100/- 300 basis points (bps) to +500/-100bps.\n\nNo explanation was given for the adjustment of the parameter, which explains the lending relationship between the regulator and banks. The liquidity ratio was retained at 30 per cent. The cash reserve ratio (CRR) of deposit money banks (DMBs) at 45 per cent and merchant banks at 14 per cent were all retained.\n\nThe governor said while the monetary and fiscal authorities are collaborating to halt inflation, insecurity, energy costs and middlemen play major roles in the high cost of food prices.\n\nHe added: \"In its consideration, the Committee noted the persistence of food inflation, which continues to undermine price stability. It was observed that while monetary policy has been moderating aggregate demand, rising food and energy costs continue to exert upward pressure on price development.\n\n\"The prevailing insecurity in food-producing areas and the high cost of transportation of farm produce are also contributing to this trend. Members were, therefore, not oblivious to the urgent benefit of addressing these challenges as it would offer a sustainable solution to the persistent pressure on food prices.\n\nHe noted that there is an urgent need to put in check such activities to address the food supply deficit in the Nigerian market to moderate food prices. He added that the MPC resolved to sustain collaboration with the fiscal authority to ensure that inflationary pressure is subdued.\n\nThe committee expressed optimism that the 150-day duty-free import window for food commodities would moderate domestic food prices. \"However, we were quick to caution that the step measures will not lead to direct injection of liquidity into the economy as to cause further inflation,\" he said.\n\nThe MPC's decision, as reported by The Guardian, may have taken into consideration, the implementation of the new minimum wage, which was approved by the Senate yesterday.\n\nThe minimum wage has been reviewed upward by 133 per cent, from N30,000 to N70,000. There are fears that the increase could cause a demand shock that could worsen inflation concerns.\n\nThe 50-basis points hike did not come to the Chief Executive Officer, Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE), Muda Yusuf, as a surprise.\n\nHe observed that the step is a moderation in its aggressive tightening stance, adding that it is also a reflection of its responsiveness to the clamour by stakeholders in the real economy.\n\nYusuf stated that his preference was for a pause on the rate increases because of the enormity of the headwinds that businesses are grappling with, but the marginal increase marks a softening of the tightening stance. It is tolerable.\n\n\"I believe we should now accelerate the implementation of the fiscal policy measures to tackle inflation. Already the economic stabilisation plan contains some laudable fiscal policy measures that could reduce production costs in the economy.\n\nIt is also important and urgent for the government to adopt and quickly implement the recommendation of the Presidential Committee on Fiscal and Tax Reforms on the Customs duty exchange rate which proposed N800/dollar. The adoption of this recommendation would have a considerable impact on the cost of goods and services in the country,\" he explained.\n\nAn economist, Kelvin Emmanuel, said the real issues driving inflation are shortage of supply in the real sector and excessive money supply. While economists believe that the new wage is likely going to worsen inflation, recent data suggests otherwise.\n\nIn 2019 after the wage moved from N18,000 to N30,000, the inflation rate remained around the 11 to 12 per cent band. In July, two months after the bill was passed, inflation slowed to 11.08 per cent.\n\nHowever, it must be noted that the 2019 increment was around 66.7 per cent while a jump from N30,000 to 70,000 is over 130 per cent. Emmanuel argued that other than preventing the capital flight from naira to USD-denominated assets, the CBN also needs to make yield attractive in open market operation (OMO) instruments for mopping up excess liquidity, which is the reason the rate went further up.\n\n\"I don't think there is a quick or immediate silver bullet, especially considering that in terms of energy and food security, the government is unable to provide primary input for commercial refining as well as provide the framework that will catalyse an increase in the production of key inputs for food processing.\n\n\"I however believe that it's important for the MPC to adopt a model where CRR is determined by the performance of the LDR of banks,\" he said.\n\nA financial analyst, Abubakar Umar, said the slight rise in MPR is influenced by the marginal upward movement of inflation in June. He said: \"My sentiment is for CBN to retain the current MPR but with the inflation data released by NBS this month, it swayed the sentiment of the committee members to vote for a little increase in the MPR.\"\n\nHe lamented that businesses are already suffering under the yoke of high cost of borrowing and high energy costs. He refrained from blaming the CBN for taking the rate up by another 50 basis points, saying: \"Businesses are suffering, the economy is harsh, but this is a choice between the devil and the deep blue sea, CBN option is only to increase and retain to preserve the financial market and keep its activities afloat.\"\n\nHe agreed with Cardoso that the fiscal authority's support is needed to tame inflation.\n\n\"Of course, many people agreed that MPR alone cannot moderate or reduce inflation, but it's a necessary tool to preserve the value of the currency, reducing the MPR - popularly to what people want to hear - can destroy the financial market and reset all the reforms being done by the CBN,\" he said.\n\nHe insisted that while the apex bank is on the right track, the fiscal side seems not to be at their duty posts. Prof. Godwin Oyedokun of Lead City University said the government needs to address the fundamental issues causing inflation, adding that using only monetary policy instruments to check inflation will not work. He noted that the more they increase the interest rate, the more it is difficult for businesses to access funds to do business.\n\n\"If a businessman borrows at a high interest rate to produce, he will most definitely pass on the extra cost to the consumers, which invariably increases the price of the goods,\" he said.\n\nOn his part, Prof. Uche Uwaleke of Nasarawa State University said: \"Having done 750 basis points between February and May this year, I had predicted they would do a minimum of 50bps or a max of 100bps in July. I am glad to note that they chose the floor, which is a sign that a complete halt is most likely in their next scheduled meeting in September. But the adjustment to the asymmetric corridor around the MPR is a major source of concern for me.\" He noted that the MPC communique did not provide any explanation for increasing the SLR from +100 to +500 and the SDR from -300 to -100.\n\n\"By implication, with an MPR of 26.75 per cent, banks will now get loans from the CBN at 31.75 per cent while they will be remunerated for their excess deposits at 25.75 per cent. This will further squeeze liquidity from the banking system and jerk up the cost of credit with adverse consequences on output and the equities market.\n\n\"The MPC communique should have made it clear why it was better to mask the tightening in the asymmetric corridor than reveal it in the MPR. \"May I observe that, unlike previous MPC communiques, recent ones are silent regarding how the members voted? This information is useful at this stage even before their statements are published. I submit that as far as taming the current elevated inflation in Nigeria is concerned given its major non-monetary drivers, the fiscal side holds the ace.\"\n\nThe National President of the Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce Industry Mines and Agriculture (MACIMA), Dele Oye, had, in a statement, raised the alarm that further increases in the interest rates introduce higher costs and increase uncertainty for businesses which can have a range of negative impacts on their operations and growth prospects.\n\nHe said some consequences include increased cost of borrowing and reduced investment as well as decreased consumer spending, which impact cash flow. Similarly, the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria has expressed grave concern and called for caution from major actors, government agencies and regulators in the oil and gas sector of the economy over the recent debunked allegations of poor quality of diesel leveled against one of the largest private investments in Africa by NMDPRA, the Dangote Refinery.\n\nAccording to Director General of the Association, Segun Ajayi-Kadir, mni, it is expected that agencies of government, that provide regulatory oversight functions should promote an enabling business environment for local investments to thrive. No regulatory agency should be seen to be casting a shadow over a homegrown investment like the Dangote Refinery.\n\n\"The allegations of poor quality, monopolistic tendencies and non issuance of license have since been roundly debunked. There may then be the need to issue a clarification that absolves the Dangote Refinery of the negative perception generated by the news report,\" he said.\n\nAjayi-Kadir further stressed that local investors in Nigeria, particularly the Dangote Industries Limited (DIL), play a vital role in driving economic growth, they pay taxes, they create jobs and foster development within the country.\n\n\"As such, it is important that these investors are protected and given the necessary support to thrive in this business environment. He said a business colossus like Alhaji Aliko Dangote, with investments in diverse sectors of the economy and across the Continent of Africa, should be accorded all needed support to grow and invest in more sectors and positively impact the wellbeing of the people,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "guardian.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food prices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Nigeria", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Bank of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Money supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minimum wage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merchant bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Game theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_requirement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reserve requirement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregate_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aggregate demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_stability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Price stability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliko_Dangote", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aliko Dangote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasarawa_State", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasarawa State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nasarawa State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/24060917/CBN-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9755234", "eventUri": "eng-9755234", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

The MPR is the benchmark interest rate for the economy.\n\n\"Experience tells us that nothing stays the same, but today's inflation print, at 34.19% y/y for June (May: 33.95%) does not augur well for a CBN rate cut next week. So high rates are likely to persist for a while yet, in our view,\" the Coronation report stated.\n\nThe Cardoso-led MPC has raised the lending rate by a combined 750 basis points to 26.25 percent since February, but the monetary reform actions have not yet tapered the soaring inflation.\n\nSimon noted that raising interest rates might not have been effective in tackling high inflation thus far, cautioning that instead of aggressively hiking rates, the impact of previous increases should be observed.\n\nRead also: CBN to maintain hawkish stance as inflationary pressure persists\n\n\"As monetary policy has a long and variable lag, the CBN should not be too hawkish and for too long,\" the Abuja-based economist said.\n\nShuaib Idris, managing director, Time-Line Consults, said a further hike in the MPR will not have the desired effect in reducing inflation, noting that the government should find ways to mop up excess liquidity in the economy.\n\n\"If the CBN doesn't reduce the rates, they should leave it as it is. The quantum leap in the MPR is too high, and it is strangulating the business environment,\" Idris said.\n\n\"The actual value of a dollar in naira terms should be about N900. But because of this excess liquidity, we are now working with about N1560/$. What we need is a liquidity squeeze, to remove the excess liquidity in the system,\" he added.\n\nIn the short term, higher interest rates may rein in inflation. It however hurts businesses as borrowing costs rise with the burden passed on to the consumers, piling pressure on their spending.\n\n\"Although the rise in MPR may attract more investors to the fixed-income market due to higher yields, it has negatively impacted borrowing costs for businesses,\" PwC said in its Nigeria's economic outlook in June.\n\nFood inflation continues to be the major driver of Nigeria's inflation, accounting for more than 50 percent of the consumer price index, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n\nPrices of food ticked higher to 40.87 percent in June 2024, up from 40.66 in May 2024, with garri, yam, rice and tomatoes rising by over 100 percent over a year.\n\n\"The rise in food inflation was due to low agricultural productivity, poor logistics and insecurity in the food-producing regions of the country,\" PwC said.\n\nAnalysts have called for more fiscal measures to complement the reforms of the monetary authorities to stem the tide of accelerating inflation.\n\n\"Even though the CBN's main focus is tackling inflation, it cannot do that alone as the main driver of inflation is food inflation. And the production of food is not within the CBN's remit,\" Simon said.\n\nHe noted that to come out of the woods, there is a need to tackle insecurity for farmers to go back to their farms, which will in turn increase agricultural yield through affordable and improved farm inputs.", "source": {"uri": "businessday.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Businessday NG"}, "authors": [{"uri": "wasiu_alli@businessday.ng", "name": "Wasiu Alli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_threshold", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Poverty threshold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Nigeria", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Bank of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Bank Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sydney_Morning_Herald", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Sydney Morning Herald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Purchasing power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_naira", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigerian naira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food prices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_reform", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary reform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_level", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price level"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harvest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Bank_of_Serbia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Bank of Serbia"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdn.businessday.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Olayemi-Cardoso.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9755234", "eventUri": "eng-9755234", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

In the first quarter of 2024, foreign portfolio investment surged by 237% when compared to the corresponding quarter of 2023 at $2.07 billion.\n\nThe consistent hike in interest rates has been condemned by members of the business community claiming it increases the cost of accessing capital and compounds the general macroeconomic malaise in the country.\n\nFamous among the criticism is that of Africa's richest man, Aliko Dangote who stated that no economic growth will occur with bank interest rate at 30%.", "source": {"uri": "nairametrics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nairametrics"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aghogho_udi@nairametrics.com", "name": "Aghogho Udi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Nigeria", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Bank of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lagos"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lagos"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliko_Dangote", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aliko Dangote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Macroeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://nairametrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/\u202fDr.-Muda-Yusuf.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9755234", "eventUri": "eng-9755234", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

(NGX) market capitalisation, which opened at N56.945 trillion, shed N47 billion or 0.08 per cent to close at N56.898 trillion.\n\nThe All-Share Index also dropped 0.08 per cent or 83 points to settle at 100,486.12, against 100,568.60 recorded on Monday.\n\nAs a result, the Year-To-Date (YTD) return declined to 34.39 per cent.\n\nSell-offs in Tier-one banking stocks, namely: Zenith Bank, Access Corporation, FBN Holdings, United Bank for Africa (UBA), and United Capital, among other declined equities, dragged the market down.\n\nAlso, market breadth closed negative with 27 losers and 14 gainers on the floor of the Exchange.\n\nOn the losers' table, UPL led by 9.92 per cent to close at N2.27, and John Holt trailed by 9.87 per cent to close at N2.83 per share.\n\nOmatek lost 9.46 per cent to close at 67k per share, Deap Capital Management and Trust declined by 8.93 per cent to close at 51k and Secure Electronic Technology Plc shed 7.02 per cent to close at 53k per share.\n\nConversely, Ikeja Hotel led the gainers table by 6.60 per cent to close at N7.10, Linkage Assurance followed by 6.90 per cent to close at 93k per share.\n\nCaverton advanced by five per cent to close at N1.47, Sovereign Trust Insurance gained 4.17 per cent to close at 50k and Consolidated Hallmark Plc added 2.96 per cent to close at N1.39 per share.\n\nAnalysis of the market activities indicated that trade turnover settled lower relative to the previous session, with the value of transactions down by 2.46 per cent.\n\nA total of 280.92 million shares valued at N3.63 billion were exchanged in 8,403 deals,compared to 335.70 million shares valued at N3.72 billion exchanged in 8,760 deals posted previously.\n\nMeanwhile, Veritas Kapital led the activity table in volume with 22.51 million shares worth N23.03 million, followed by UCAP with 20.85 million shares worth N817.10 million to lead the table in value.\n\nJaiz Bank traded 20. 78 million shares valued at N45.11 million, Access Corporation transacted 20.40 million shares worth N394.32 million and Prestige Assurance sold 16.81 million shares worth N8.6 million.\n\nMeanwhile, the Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE) has commended CBN for a moderate interest rate hike.\n\nIt also called for urgent implementation of fiscal policies to stabilise the economy.\n\nDr Muda Yusuf, Chief Executive Officer of CPPE, made the call in a statement on Tuesday while responding to the outcome of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting of the CBN.\n\nThe meeting started Monday, July 22, and ended Tuesday, July 23, in Abuja.\n\nThe apex bank had increased the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) to 26.75 per cent from 26.25 per cent to address the surging inflation in the country.\n\nNigeria's inflation rate recently climbed to 34.19 per cent, driven by rising food prices.\n\nThe committee raised the rate by 50 basis points and adjusted the asymmetric corridor to +500 and -100 basis points around the MPR.\n\nYusuf said the moderate increase was tolerable and showed that the CBN was listening and responding to the suggestions of financial stakeholders to stop aggressive tightening measures.\n\nHe explained that, although he preferred a pause on rate increases because of the challenges businesses were facing.\n\n\"The marginal increase marks a softening of the tightening stance. It is tolerable,\" Yusuf said.\n\nThe CPPE boss, however, called for speedy implementation of fiscal policy measures to tackle inflation.\n\n\"Already, the economic stabilisation plan contains some laudable fiscal policy measures that could reduce production costs in the economy.\n\n\"It is also important and urgent for the government to adopt and quickly implement the recommendation of the Presidential Committee on Fiscal and Tax Reforms on the Customs duty exchange rate, which proposed N800 per dollar.\n\n\"The adoption of this recommendation would have a considerable impact on the cost of goods and services in the country,\" he said.\n\nProf. Uche Uwaleke, President of the Capital Market Academics of Nigeria says the Central Bank of Nigeria's (CBN) decision to hike interest rates was anticipated.\n\nUwaleke, in an interview on Tuesday in Abuja, reacted to the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decision to increase the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) by 50 basis points from 26.25 per cent to 26.75 per cent.\n\nThis decision was announced by CBN Governor, Dr Yemi Cardoso.\n\nThe committee also adjusted the asymmetric corridor around the MPR to +500/-100 from +100/-300 basis points, retained the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) for Deposit Money Banks at 45 per cent and Merchant Banks at 14 per cent, and maintained the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent.\n\nThis marks the fourth consecutive hike in the MPR in the year, raising the rate from 18.25 per cent to 26.75 per cent.\n\nUwaleke said, \"Having done 750 basis points between February and May, I had predicted they would do a minimum of 50 basis points or a maximum of 100 basis points in July.\n\n\"It is good that they chose the floor, which is a sign that a complete halt is most likely in their next scheduled meeting in September.\"\n\nUwaleke, also Director of the Institute of Capital Market at Nasarawa State University, Keffi, however, expressed concern over the adjustment of the asymmetric corridor.\n\n\"The adjustment to the asymmetric corridor around the MPR is a major source of concern.\n\n\"The MPC communique did not provide any explanation for increasing the Standing Lending Rate (SLR) from +100 to +500 and the Standing Deposit Rate (SDR) from -300 to -100.\n\n\"By implication, with an MPR of 26.75 per cent, banks will now get loans from the CBN at 31.75 per cent while they will be remunerated for their excess deposits at 25.75 per cent.\n\n\"This will further squeeze liquidity from the banking system and increase the cost of credit, with adverse consequences on output and the equities market,\" he noted.\n\nUwaleke also said that that the MPC communique should have explained why it preferred tightening the asymmetric corridor rather than adjusting the MPR.\n\nHe pointed out that recent MPC communiques have been silent on how members voted, a detail that is useful even before their personal statements are published.\n\n\"As far as taming the current elevated inflation in Nigeria is concerned, given its major non-monetary drivers, the fiscal side holds the ace,\" Uwaleke said.", "source": {"uri": "thenewsguru.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheNewsGuru"},

Nigeria's case has largely, non-monetary inflation.\n\n\"The National Bureau of Statistics, the real cause of inflation is food inflation. So, you have increased MPR from the former CBN governor to the present governor why has it not solved the problem?\"\n\nAlaje explained that the CBN is not getting it right because the country's inflation is mostly non-monetary.\n\nHe said, \"Those leading our monetary team need to upgrade their knowledge. N100tn last year is not the same as N100tn this year because of the kind of inflation. So, when you now raise the interest rate and banks tell people to pay more for loans, you end up energizing inflation and you will be forced to devalue. So, it becomes a roller-coaster because you are not separating issues and solving issues.\n\n\"CBN will need to call on authorities that are non-monetary to face the non-monetary components of inflation. If not the CBN will be using monetary tools to fight non-monetary related inflation which includes shortage of food, insecurity and seasonal-induced inflation.\n\n\"You can't rely on monetary tools such as adjusting MPR, increasing Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and increasing Liquidity Ratio to solve the problem. When you do, the economy will stagnate. It means that we will not go above 3.5 per cent.\n\nHe said the country has always used monetary tools to combat inflation that has over 60 per cent of non-monetary components.\n\nIn his comments, Uwaleke said the CBN may raise MPR by at least between 50 to100 basis point.\n\nThe University professor said the MPC will still be concerned about the need to narrow the negative interest rate as well as curtail the pressure in the forex market.\n\nRecall that THE WHISTLER reported the CBN resumed foreign exchange sales to authorised banks and Bureau de Change operators over pressure on the naira.\n\n\"Nevertheless, if I were a member of the MPC, I would vote for a hold position as the aggressive policy rate hike is taking a toll on output. Production is stiffled because of very high cost of funds.,\" Uwaleke said.\n\nJust like Alaje, the professor warned that the seeming over reliance on the MPR as a tool to tame inflation does not appear to be making any meaningful impact due to the significant non-monetary factors driving inflation in Nigeria.\n\nUwaleke said, \"The high cost of credit is also a factor contributing to cost-push inflation. This is due in part to a very high CRR of 45 per cent representing sterilised Bank deposits with the CBN.\n\n\"This liquidity squeeze is now driving undue pressure by banks on the CBN's Standing Lending Facility.\"\n\nHe said the CBN must recognise that the challenge currently facing the Nigerian economy is not just inflation but stagflation.\n\n\"To this end should equally have regard to growth concerns in future meetings of the MPC,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "thewhistler.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Whistler Nigeria"}, "authors": [{"uri": "philip_ukpe@thewhistler.ng", "name": "Philip Ukpe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaje", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alaje"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Nigeria", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Bank of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Whistler_(radio_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Whistler (radio series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partnership", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Partnership"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_(Abu_Dhabi)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The National (Abu Dhabi)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devaluation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Devaluation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-push_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cost-push inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stagflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_de_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bureau de change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_naira", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigerian naira"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper Money", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://thewhistler.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/CBN-Governor-Yemi-Cardoso-.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9755234", "eventUri": "eng-9755234", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

It was observed that while monetary policy has been moderated, aggregate demand and rising food and energy costs continue to exert upward pressure on price development.\n\n\"The prevailing insecurity in food-producing areas and the high cost of transportation of park countries are also contributing to this trend. Members were therefore not oblivious to the urgent benefit of addressing these challenges as it will offer a sustainable solution to the persistent pressure of food prices.\n\n\"Also noted in this consideration is the increasing activities of middle names who often finance small border farmers, aggregate hard and move farm produce across the border to live in countries,\" Cardoso stated.\n\nThe CBN boss pointed out that the country has been recording increased inflows, adding that diaspora returns and capital importation had improved.\n\n\"For example, if exchange rates have converged, limiting the arbitrage opportunities is very important. Inflows have increased from $37.93bn between January and May of 2024 to $38.8bn. And net inflows, more importantly actually, grew by 73.4 per cent in May 2024 compared to May 2023.\n\n\"So that's very good news. And something I speak about all the time on the issue of diaspora returns and I'm very pleased to say that at the end of June, this has gone up to $2.34bn in comparison to $1.58bn from the corresponding period last year. Capital importation began between January and June at $2.92bn relative to $1.77bn from the corresponding period last year.\"\n\nThe MPC also retained the cash reserve ratio of Deposit Money Banks at 45 per cent and merchant banks at 14 per cent, as well as the liquidity ratio at 30 per cent.\n\nNigeria's headline inflation rose marginally to 34.19 per cent in June 2024 from 33.95 per cent in May 2024, driven by the continued rise in food and core inflation.\n\nThe CBN forecast that the domestic economy will grow by 3.38 per cent in 2024, while the International Monetary Fund projected growth at 3.1 per cent in 2024.\n\nThe MPC therefore resolved to sustain collaboration with the fiscal authority to ensure that inflation pressure is subdued. In addition, the committee expressed optimism about the recent stop-gap measures by the Federal Government to bridge the food supply deficit.\n\nOPS kicks\n\nBut the Organised Private Sector expressed worry over the hike in interest rate by the apex bank.\n\nThe National Vice President of the Nigerian Association of Small-Scale Industrialists, Segun Kuti-George, said the increase would pose greater difficulties. He said this is because the cost of loans, on which many businesses depend, will go up.\n\nHe said, \"This will increase the cost of production, which will impact profit negatively if absorbed or lead to an increase in prices of the goods if passed on to the consumers.\n\n\"I think the CBN needs to be more innovative in their approach and stop depending on interest rate adjustments alone.\"\n\nReacting to the development, the National President of the Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture, Dele Oye, said the decision to tighten monetary policy, though driven by CBN's intent to curb inflation and stabilise the economy, the approach presents several significant ramifications for businesses, the broader economy, and social stability.\n\nHighlighting the implications of the increment, Oye listed them as increased borrowing costs, inflationary pressures and financial strain on businesses.\n\nSpeaking on the alternative approaches to inflation control the CBN and the Federal Government of Nigeria may consider, Oye advised that addressing inflation requires a nuanced approach that balances monetary policy with other economic strategies to encourage growth and stability.\n\nHe highlighted, \"Structural reforms aimed at improving supply chain efficiency can help mitigate inflationary pressures. Investments in infrastructure, transportation and logistics can reduce the cost of goods and services, thereby controlling inflation without the need to raise interest rates.\n\n\"Nigeria's economy is significantly influenced by its agricultural sector. Policies that support agricultural productivity through subsidies, improved access to financing and technological advancements can stabilize food prices, a major driver of inflation in Nigeria.\n\n\"Furthermore, the volatility of the naira has been a persistent issue. Implementing measures to stabilize the exchange rate, such as using part of the current foreign reserves to intervene in the currency market to bring the naira's exchange rate to under N1000/$ can help.\"\n\nOn his part, the Director-General of the Nigeria Employers' Consultative Association, Mr Adewale-Smatt Oyerinde, said, \"The upward adjustment of the policy rate will lead to further increase in business lending rate by the commercial banks, which is about 30 per cent at the moment.\"\n\nAccording to Oyerinde, the implication is that it becomes more difficult for businesses to maintain existing investments and almost impossible for significant new investments to take place.\n\nThe NECA DG emphasied that once investment declines, capacity utilisation, volume of activity, employment and profit would be affected negatively.\n\nOyerinde stated that the persistent use of MPR, which is standing 34.2 per cent to moderate inflation, might yield limited results so long as the huge depreciation in naira value that has shrunk business activities in the real sector remains unchecked.\n\nOyerinde, therefore urged the CBN to prioritise an exchange rate management procedure that would address the huge erosion in the naira.\n\nThe NECA boss also emphasised the need for a strong and deepened collaboration between monetary and fiscal policies in the management process of the economy.", "source": {"uri": "punchng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Punch Newspapers"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The prevailing insecurity in food producing areas and high cost of transportation of farm produce are also contributing to this trend. Members were therefore not oblivious to the urgent benefit of addressing these challenges as it will offer a sustainable solution to the persistent pressure on food prices.\n\n\"Also noted in its consideration is the increasing activities of middlemen who often finance smallholder farmers, aggregate, hoard and move farm produce across the border to neighboring countries. The committee suggested the need to put in check such activities in order to address the food supply deficit in the Nigerian market to moderate food prices.\n\nThe MPC therefore resolved to sustain collaboration with the fiscal authority to ensure that inflationary pressure is subdued.\n\nReacting, Nigeria's first professor of the capital markets Prof Uche Uwaleke said: \"Having done 750 basis points between February and May this year, I had predicted they would do a minimum of 50bps or a max of 100bps in July.\n\n\"I am glad to note that they chose the floor which is a sign that a complete halt is most likely in their next scheduled meeting in September.\n\nBut the adjustment to the asymmetric corridor around the MPR is a major source of concern for me.\n\n\"The MPC communique did not provide any explanation for increasing the SLR from +100 to +500 and the SDR from -300 to -100.\n\n\"By implication, with an MPR of 26.75 per cent, banks will now get loans from the CBN at 31.75 per cent while they will be remunerated for their excess deposits at 25.75 per cent. This will further squeeze liquidity from the banking system and jerk up cost of credit with adverse consequences on output and the equities market.\n\n\"The MPC communique should have made it clear why it was better to mask the tightening in the asymmetric corridor than reveal it in the MPR.\n\n\"May I observe that unlike previous MPC communiques, recent ones are silent regarding how the members voted.

It re-emphasized its commitment to the Bank's price stability mandate and remained optimistic that despite the June 2024 uptick in headline inflation, prices are expected to moderate in the near term.\n\n\"This is hinged on monetary policy gaining further traction, in addition to recent measures by the fiscal authority to address food inflation\n\nLast month, the MPC raised the rate by 100 percent with the expectation that inflation will be tamed. That has not happened, according to experts who said, the CBN has failed to attack the high cost of goods and services in the country with the right instrument.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics, NBS, the headline inflation now stands at over 36 percent, with no end in sight to the rising cost of basic essentials in the country.\n\nRather than hiking the interest rate, what should be done by the government, according to Johnson Chukwu, the Managing Director, Cowry Asset management is to grant more credit to Nigerians to enhance their purchasing power.\n\nChukwu said the current inflation is driven by shortage of supply, rather than demand, as being suggested by the CBN as reason for consistently hiking the interest rate.\n\nAlso, Muda Yusuf, a former president of the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce, said the continous hiking of interest rate is not preferable considering the current economic challenges.\n\nYusuf in a statement on Tuesday said the 50 points moderate increase for the month is tolerable, uring the CBN to stop any incrase forthwith.\n\nHe said the CBN listened to the fedback from the business community that any hike beyond the current threashhold will be unacceptable.\n\n\"The marginal increase marks a softening of the tightening stance. It is tolerable,\" Yusuf said.\n\nReacting, National President of Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines, and Agriculture, NACCIMA, Dele Oye, said the increase will put more pressure on businesses in the country, adding that accessing loan has become more difficult with the decision.\n\nHe said: \"A hike in the benchmark interest rate (MPR) by CBN can have several potential consequences for businesses, including: Increased Borrowing Costs - Higher interest rates mean that loans and lines of credit become more expensive, which can increase the cost of financing for businesses, leading to higher operational costs; Reduced Investment - As borrowing becomes more expensive, businesses may delay or scale back on investments in expansion, new projects, or capital improvements and this can slow down business growth and innovation; and Decreased Consumer Spending - Higher interest rates can lead to increased borrowing costs for consumers as well, which can reduce their disposable income, which typically results in lower consumer spending, which can negatively impact businesses, particularly those in the retail and service sectors.\n\nAfrica's Richest Man Aliko Dangote had following last month's hike in the rate by the CBN, slammed the Cardoso-led apex bank, arguing that the decision will hurt businesses in the country.\n\n\"Nobody can create jobs with an interest rate of 30 per cent.

I believe that monetary policy instruments have been practically over-stretched in this quest to tame inflation,\" he said.\n\nMr Johnson Chukwu, the Managing Director of Cowry Asset Management Ltd., predicted that the MPC might hike the rates by 50 or 75 basis points, given the CBN Governor's commitment to controlling inflationary pressures.\n\nChukwu highlighted current economic parameters, noting inflation at 34.19 per cent, food inflation at 40.66 per cent and recent pressures on the Naira.\n\n\"Inflation has not abated, even the month-on-month inflation spiked in June.\n\n\"Given the CBN Governor's avowed position that they will continue to increase rates as long as inflationary pressures persist, I think they are likely going to increase it by 50 to 75 basis points, which could take it to between 26.75 per cent to 27 per cent,\" Chukwu said.\n\nProposing solutions, Chukwu called for holistic fiscal measures to address the root causes of foreign exchange volatility.\n\nHe emphasised that inflationary pressures were not due to excess liquidity but rather insufficient food production, insecurity, and FX scarcity leading to Naira depreciation from low crude oil production.\n\n\"If you want to address the issue from the root cause, you have to deal with issues of insecurity in major food belts of the nation to improve food production.\n\n\"Additionally, addressing insecurity and pipeline breaches in oil-bearing localities will improve crude production,\" Chukwu explained.\n\nChukwu also stressed the need for upstream operators to increase investments in exploration and production, suggesting that a productivity-based approach, rather than monetary policy tightening, is essential for solving the problem.

However, central banks are beginning to pivot to monetary policy easing as global inflation approaches set targets.\n\nInflation\n\nOn the domestic front, precisely in June 2024, headline inflation increased further in June, rising by 24 basis points (bps) to 34.19% year-on-year (y/y) as against May's figure of 33.95% y/y) primarily due to the exchange rate pass-through on commodity prices, high energy prices and increased food shortages.\n\nSimilarly, the month-on-month (m/m) inflation print came in at 2.31% m/m (+2.14% y/y), owing to higher food prices following the increased consumer demand from the Eid-el-Kabir celebration. As a result, food inflation rose by 27bps to 2.55% m/m (May: +2.28% m/m), pushing the y/y rate higher to 40.87% (May: 40.66% y/y). Over the past year, food prices in Nigeria have soared, driven by factors such as supply chain disruptions, currency depreciation, and the impact of climate change on agriculture. This has led to basic staples like rice, beans, and vegetables becoming increasingly unaffordable for the average Nigerian, stretching household budgets to their limits\n\nSimilarly, core inflation rose, albeit moderately, by 5bps to 2.06% m/m (May: +2.01% m/m) following the slight naira depreciation amid a slower increase in energy prices. On a year-on-year basis, core inflation rose by 36bps to 27.40% y/y. In response to the ongoing inflationary pressures, the federal government unveiled a comprehensive plan for 2024, focusing on the six-month suspension of import duties, Value Added Tax (VAT), and other tariffs on staple food items, raw materials, and direct inputs for manufacturing. This ambitious agricultural reform programme aims to enhance domestic food production.\n\nNaira volatility\n\nThe naira has remained volatile in recent weeks mainly due to the tight liquidity in the FX market. Precisely, the CBN sustained its weak FX intervention, while foreign investors stayed on the sidelines mainly due to convertibility risk concerns, causing FX liquidity to dwindle. Indeed, total inflows into NAFEM in June fell significantly by 53.7% m/m to $1.45 billion when compared with$3.12 billion recorded in the previous month- the lowest since January 2024 ($1.03 billion).\n\nSo far in July, whilst liquidity improved mildly aligned with the CBN supplying $122.67 million, the naira remains under pressure and approaching the NGN1,600.00/$1 handle as demand for FX continues to outweigh supply.\n\nConversely, there has been sustained accretion to the FX reserves as the balance reached a 16-month high of $35.93 billion (as of 18 July), primarily supported by the disbursement of the first tranche ($750 million) of the Development for Financing (DPF) loan ($1.50 billion) from the World Bank, improved earnings from oil exports, FX purchases from FPIs and increased remittances.\n\nFG's proposed tax on FX gains\n\nThis is expected to generate discourse especially amongst analysts who will seek clarification as to how this tax works. Already, investors are selling off their investments in banks' stocks owing to uncertainty on how the recapitalization exercise would fare for these banks quoted on the floor of the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX). As at July 20, the banking index was in the negative territory, down by 5.93% year-to-date.\n\nFinancial analysts' projections\n\nAnalysts who spoke to Daily Sun via emailed notes, stated that the apex bank will need to balance the goal of controlling inflation with the need to support economic growth as a higher MPR could dampen economic activity, while a lower rate might boost growth but risk higher inflation.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer, Cowry Asset Management Limited, Johnson Chukwu, believes that these government measures, while ambitious, aim to provide much-needed relief from the current inflationary grip, potentially reviving hope among Nigerians and fostering a more prosperous and optimistic marketplace.\n\nHe, however, said that the effectiveness of these initiatives in delivering tangible benefits remains to be seen. Chukwu said, \"With the monetary policy committee meeting today, the CBN faces a dilemma: whether to continue tightening monetary policy or adopt a more cautious approach to monitor inflationary trends and key economic indicators.\n\nWe anticipate that a moderate increase in headline inflation will likely lead committee members to favour maintaining a tightening stance, potentially raising rates by 25 to 50 basis points\".\n\nCorroborating, analysts at Cordros Research, said that they expect the MPC to maintain their tight monetary policy stance at next week's meetingAccording to them, this will be hinged on the goal to ensure price stability, reduce the negative real rate of return, manage inflation expectations, and stabilize the naira.\n\nThey said, \"However, given the slower pace of the increase in the inflation rate and an anticipated disinflation trend for the remainder of the year, we foresee a moderate increase than in previous meetings. Therefore, we anticipate the MPC will raise the MPR by 100 basis points to 27.25% while keeping other parameters unchanged\".", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun Nigeria"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Nigeria", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Bank of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FX_(TV_channel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FX (TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_naira", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigerian naira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Food prices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021\u20132023_inflation_surge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2021\u20132023 inflation surge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Value-added tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exchange rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://d1jcea4y7xhp7l.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/38a93be6-a01d-4cb5-aedb-b962aff3e357.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9755234", "eventUri": "eng-9755234", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 3334, "textEnd": 3341}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 3961, "textEnd": 3968}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Cardoso spoke yesterdayz in Abuja during the question and answer session at the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting with 11 members in attendance.\n\nDisclosing some of the gains in recent times, he said: \"On the forex side, because we all accept that the foreign exchange part is very significant, I am happy to say that we have seen positive outcomes from the tools that we have been using over the recent past.\n\n\"The exchange rates have converged, limiting the opportunities for arbitrage, which is very important.

This is hinged on monetary policy gaining further traction, in addition to recent measures by the fiscal authority to address food inflation,\" Olayemi Cardoso, CBN governor, announced at the end of the two-day meeting on Tuesday.\n\nOther decisions of the MPC include the adjustment of the asymmetric corridor from +100/-300 basis points; retention of cash reserve ratio at 45 percent for deposit money banks, and 14 percent for merchant banks, just as the liquidity ratio was retained at 30 percent.\n\nThe cash reserve ratio is the proportion of commercial banks' total deposits that must be held in reserve while the liquidity ratio is also the proportion of deposit money banks' assets that must be held in liquid form that can easily be converted to cash for immediate or short-term obligations.\n\nThe hike in MPC was widely expected by many stakeholders in both the financial and real sectors, following an uptick in June inflation rates. Headline inflation for June rose to 34.19 percent while the corresponding food inflation surged to 40.87 percent.\n\n\"The further hike in the MPR (though arguably compelling) should exert a negative pass-through effect on real sector players, especially in terms of interest expenses on debt funding. Therefore, coupled with the other headwinds such as inflation squeeze and FX volatilities, we expect real output growth to be pressured for the rest of the year,\" analysts at Afrinvest, one of the leading investment houses in Nigeria, said, in a note to investors.\n\n\"The surprise tweak in the MPR suggests that the CBN is aggressively dissuading banks from tapping liquidity through the Standing Lending Facility (SLF) window. For context, the tweak in the asymmetric corridor to +500/-100bps around the MPR implies that banks seeking to tap funds through the SLF window would have to pay a cost of fund of 31.75% per annum from 27.25% previously.\n\n\"Meanwhile for banks with excess liquidity willing to play at the Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) window would only receive 25.75% interest per annum, thereby expanding the negative spread between SLF and SDF to 600bps from 400bps. Based on our assessment of industry data, banks tapped \u20a673.6tn through the SLF window between January and July 2024, representing 8.5x the size of activities at the SDF window. We expect pressure to mount on banks' ability to balance risk-return going forward,\" Afrinvest added.\n\nMeanwhile, the equity market reacted to the CBN announcement with the All-Share Index (ASI) of the Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX) closing in the negative territory yesterday. ASI closed at 100,487.12 points Tuesday as against 100,568.60 points on Monday. The market capitalisation closed at N56.898 trillion on Tuesday compared to N56.945 trillion on Monday amounting a loss of N46.7 billion in the value of listed equities or a decline by 0.08 percent in equity value.\n\nIn a similar development, the CBN will today auction three fixed income instruments at the Primary Market Auction. The first instrument is the 91-day treasury bills with an offer size worth N16.48 billion. Advised rates range from 16 percent to 16.90 percent. The second instrument is the 182-day treasury bills worth N6.44 billion with advised rates ranging from 17.20 percent to 17.80 percent. The third instrument is the 364-day treasury bills worth N255.04 billion with advised rates ranging from 19.50 percent to 21.90 percent.\n\n\"At the most recent Primary Market Auction (PMA), the CBN offered a total of NGN166.11bn across three instruments. This represents a 27.10% decrease from the NGN228.71bn offered at the previous auction but is still 3.75 times higher than the amount offered two auctions ago,\" Meristem Securities said in a note to investors.", "source": {"uri": "nigerianobservernews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "nigerianobservernews.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Nigeria", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Bank of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Commercial bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quick ratio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmarking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benchmarking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Regulatory agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Game theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_requirement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reserve requirement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_stability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Price stability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrinvest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Afrinvest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merchant bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Banks", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Banks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9755234", "eventUri": "eng-9755234", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

De facto, this was much more of a tightening than anyone expected,\" Khan added.\n\nSLF is a short-term loan that a Central Bank provides to commercial banks. It's a way for banks to get quick access to cash if they need it to meet customer withdrawals.\n\nSDF is a financial tool used by some Central Banks, which allows commercial banks to deposit their excess funds with the central bank for a short period and earn interest. This helps the central bank control inflation by mopping up excess liquidity in the economy.\n\nAccording to analysts at Afrinvest West Africa, the surprise tweak in the MPR suggests that the CBN is aggressively dissuading banks from tapping liquidity through the Standing Lending Facility window.\n\nFor context, the tweak in the asymmetric corridor to +500/-100bps around the MPR implies that banks seeking to tap funds through the SLF window would have to pay a cost of fund of 31.75 per cent per annum from 27.25 per cent previously. Meanwhile, banks with excess liquidity willing to play at the Standing Deposit Facility window would only receive 25.75 per cent interest per annum, thereby expanding the negative spread between SLF and SDF to 600bps from 400bps.\n\n\"Based on our assessment of industry data, banks tapped N73.6tn through the SLF window between January and July 2024, representing 8.5x the size of activities at the SDF window. We expect pressure to mount on banks' ability to balance risk-return going forward,\" the analysts said.\n\nThey admitted that the further hike in the MPR (though arguably compelling) should exert a negative pass-through effect on real sector players, especially in terms of interest expenses on debt funding. \"Therefore, coupled with the other headwinds such as inflation squeeze and FX volatilities, we expect real output growth to be pressured for the rest of the year.\"\n\nUche Uwaleke, special adviser to the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Insurance, and Other Financial Institutions, said \"The adjustment to the asymmetric corridor around the MPR is a major source of concern for me.\"\n\nHe said the MPC communique did not provide any explanation for increasing the SLR from +100 to +500 and the SDR from -300 to -100.\n\n\"By implication, with an MPR of 26.75 percent, banks will now get loans from the CBN at 31.75 percent while they will be remunerated for their excess deposits at 25.75 percent. This will further squeeze liquidity from the banking system and jerk up cost of credit with adverse consequences on output and the equities market. The MPC communique should have made it clear why it was better to mask the tightening in the asymmetric corridor than reveal it in the MPR,\" he said.\n\n\"Assuming all other factors remain constant, we expect today's hawkish stance to drive a modest increase in fixed-income yields,\" analysts at Cardinal Stone, said.\n\n\"In our view, today's decision will likely be the final rate hike this year, as we anticipate the CBN will hold interest rates steady, supported by an expected moderation in inflation due to the base effect starting in July 2024. Consequently, we maintain our recommendation that fund managers adopt a laddered approach with a greater emphasis on longer durations,\" the analysts added.\n\nThe analysts believe that the current interest rate level will help to retain Nigeria's carry (interest rate differential) as one of the most attractive in Africa, which will further incentivise foreign inflows. So far in 2024, Nigeria has attracted $4.69 billion from both cold and hot monies, a traction last observed before the advent of the pandemic.\n\nThis year, the MPC has aggressively implemented a cumulative rate hike of approximately 800 basis points since February 2024, alongside adjustments to other monetary tools, to combat rising inflation. In comparison, 2023 saw a total rate hike of 225 basis points.\n\nNigeria's headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) reached 34.19 per cent, up from 33.95 per cent in May, reflecting a 0.71 per cent increase. On a month-to-month basis, the headline inflation rate for June 2024 was a 2.31 per cent increase, which is 0.17 per cent higher than the 2.14 per cent recorded in May 2024.\n\nThe MPC re-emphasised

Thank you for reading this post, don't forget to subscribe!\n\nThis increase from $34.19 billion in June is anticipated to bolster investor confidence.\n\nThe Monetary Policy Committee noted that higher reserves could stabilize the exchange rate and emphasized enhancing inflows through diaspora remittances, which have grown to $2.34 billion in 2024 compared to $1.8 billion last year.\n\nAdditionally, FX inflows increased to $38.88 billion from $37.93 billion in May 2024.\n\nCardoso highlighted a convergence in exchange rates between the official and parallel markets.

The MPC widened the asymmetric corridor around the MPR from +100 to -300 basis points to +500 to -100 basis points. Additionally, the MPC maintained the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) for deposit money banks at 45 per cent and for merchant banks at 14 per cent and retained the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent.\n\nReacting to the new rate, Director General of MAN, Segun Ajayi-Kadir, in a statement made available to THE WHISTLER on Wednesday, expressed concern that, despite the continuous increase in MPR over the past two years resulting in a weighty 1,475 basis point hike from 11.5 per cent in May 2022 to 26.25 per cent in May 2024, inflation has remained persistently high, reaching a staggering 34.19 per cent in June, the highest since March 1996.\n\nHe noted that the manufacturing sector plays a critical role in the country's economy. But regretted that it is facing multitude of challenges that threaten its sustainability and contribution to economic growth.\n\nAccording to Ajayi-Kadir, the continued increase in the cost of borrowing, which is one of the major challenges confronting manufacturers, will \"escalate production costs and consequently the prices of finished goods, with consequential effect on unemployment and social instability. It will further compound the prevailing low consumer demand, capacity utilization and profitability.\"\n\nHe noted that it will stifle capacity to make new and further investments, innovation and curtail opportunities for growth; as well as constrained the capacity of the sector to compete effectively in regional and global markets, \"and if unchecked, may trigger critical distress of more manufacturing concerns.\"\n\nThe MAN DG also contended that it will \"Constrain reinvestment for expansion and introduction of new brands, as significant portion of revenue of manufacturing concerns is directed towards interest payments.\n\n\"Further restrain access to capital, judging from the fact that only 16 per cent of total commercial bank credit was disbursed to the manufacturing sector in the first quarter of the year.\n\n\"Reduce the flow of investments into the sector and funds required for retooling, upgrading facilities and procurement of new technologies.\"\n\nWhile pointing out that MAN recognizes the rationale behind the hike in interest rate, Ajayi-Kadir stressed the need to prioritize the survival of the country's manufacturing sector.\n\n\"It is noteworthy to state that the worrisome trend occasioned by increase in cost of borrowing is corroborated by the report of NBS, to the effect that manufacturing investment declined significantly in the second quarter of the year. This drop underscores the critical link between domestic investment confidence and foreign investor sentiment. In addition, the share of manufactured exports in non-oil exports also declined from 21.4 per cent in Q4 2023 to 15.1 per cent in Q1 2024,\" he said.\n\n\"The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) recognises the efforts made by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to stabilise price, as well as the rationale behind its decisions. However, it is expedient that the survival of manufacturing in Nigeria is prioritized when making monetary policy decisions. This will enable the sector to effectively play its role as the key driver of employment creation, productivity, stable foreign exchange earnings, and economic sustained growth.\"\n\nThe association recommended that the government considers the following policy measures:\n\n\"Direct CBN to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the impact of previous decisions of the MPC on inflation rate and the productive sector over the last 5 years. This will provide information that will guide future MPC decisions.\n\n\"Implore CBN to be domestic production centric by taking a detour from continuous hike in MPR and allow time for the real sector to recover from the impact of previous hikes.\n\n\"Direct the CBN to collaborate with the Ministry of Finance to facilitate stronger handshake and coherence between monetary and fiscal policies.\n\n\"Take deliberate actions to Insulate the productive sector from the impact of continuous hike in MPR by expediting action on the disbursement of special provisions earmarked by government for the manufacturing sector. The N75billion single digit loan approved by President Bola Tinubu, GCFR over a year ago and the recently announced N1trillion readily comes to mind.\n\n\"Offer fiscal support system that will enable the manufacturing sector import raw materials, spares and machines that are not available locally at concessionary duty rate.\n\n\"Minimize pressure on foreign exchange reserves by incentivize backward integration and local sourcing to decrease reliance on imported products and raw materials.\n\n\"Enforce Executive Order 003 to enhance support for local industries and ramp-up domestic production by restricting access to forex for the importation of products manufactured locally.\n\n\"Address the issue of low manufacturing productivity and food production occasioned by the high-level of insecurity across the country to curb the persistent rise in inflation\n\n\"Utilize subsidy savings to improve patronage of made in Nigeria products and upgrade electricity, road and rail networks within industrial hubs.\n\n\"Encourage nationwide investments in renewable energy sources to alleviate energy cost and enhance competitiveness.\"", "source": {"uri": "thewhistler.ng",

This measure has been criticized by some local experts who warned that the interest rate hike may \"create a stagnant or sluggish economy for the country.\"\n\nThe monetary policymakers retained the cash reserve ratio for commercial banks at 45 percent, and the cash reserve ratio for merchant banks at 14 percent.

However, it is facing multitude of challenges that threaten its sustainability and contribution to economic growth.\n\n\"Therefore, the continued increase in the cost of borrowing, which is one of our major challenges, will escalate production costs and consequently the prices of finished goods, with consequential effect on unemployment and social instability and further compound the prevailing low consumer demand, capacity utilisation and profitability,\" he said.\n\nAjayi-Kadir added that high MPR would stifle capacity of businesses to make new and further investments, innovation and curtail opportunities for the growth and constrain the capacity of the manufacturing sector to compete effectively in regional and global markets, and if unchecked, may trigger critical distress of more manufacturing concerns.\n\nHe added: \"It is noteworthy to state that the worrisome trend occasioned by increase in cost of borrowing is corroborated by the report of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), to the effect that manufacturing investment declined significantly in the second quarter of the year.\n\n\"This drop underscores the critical link between domestic investment confidence and foreign investor sentiment. In addition, the share of manufactured exports in non-oil exports also declined from 21.4 per cent in Q4 2023 to 15.1 per cent in Q1 2024.\"\n\nHe said that it was expedient that the survival of manufacturing in Nigeria was prioritised when making monetary policy decisions.\n\nHe added that this would enable the sector to effectively play its role as the key driver of employment creation, productivity, stable foreign exchange earnings, and economic sustained growth.\n\nThe MAN, therefore, recommended that the federal government should directs the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the impact of previous decisions of the MPC on inflation rate and the productive sector over the last five years to provide information that would guide future MPC's decisions.\n\nIt also implored the CBN to be domestic production-centric by taking a detour from continuous hike in MPR and allow time for the real sector to recover from the impact of previous hikes.\n\nThe MAN also urged that government to take deliberate actions to \"insulate the productive sector from the impact of continuous hike in MPR by expediting action on the disbursement of special provisions earmarked by government for the manufacturing sector.\"\n\nIt said that the N75 billion single digit loan approved by President Bola Tinubu over a year ago and the recently announced N1 trillion readily comes to mind, urging government to offer a fiscal support system that will enable the manufacturing sector to import raw materials, spares and machines that are not available locally at concessionary duty rate.\n\nIn addition it demanded the minimisation of pressure on foreign exchange reserves by incentivising backward integration and local sourcing to decrease reliance on imported products and raw materials.\n\nSpeaking in the same vein, the Director General of LCCI, Dr. Chinyere Almona, said that the chamber noted with concern the recent decision by the CBN to raise the MPR.\n\nAlmona said: \"The LCCI acknowledges the CBN's efforts to control inflation and stabilise the economy. However, we are deeply concerned about the broader implications of this rate hike on the business community and the overall economic landscape.\n\n\"The LCCI urges the government and the CBN to consider a more balanced approach to monetary policy. While controlling inflation is crucial, mitigating adverse effects on business operations and economic growth is imperative.\"\n\nShe proposed that CBN should diversify its approach to controlling inflation beyond interest rate hikes in favour of policies that directly address supply-side constraints, such as improving agricultural productivity and stabilising energy prices, can help reduce inflationary pressures more effectively.\n\nShe said: \"Increased investment in infrastructure can alleviate production bottlenecks and reduce business costs. This will enhance productivity and competitiveness, helping to tame inflation from the supply side.''\n\nThe LCCI said that it remained committed to working with the government and the CBN to ensure policies that foster conducive environment for business growth and economic stability.\n\n\"A holistic approach, balancing inflation control with support for businesses, will pave the way for sustainable economic development in Nigeria,\" it said.\n\nMeanwhile, Global ratings agency, Moody's, has disclosed that eight of the nine Nigerian banks under its ratings reported over N3.5 trillion in aggregate pre-tax profits in 2023 compared to N1.1 trillion in 2022.\n\nIt further estimated that over a third of the profits were from foreign-currency revaluation and trading gains.\n\nThe international ratings institution therefore, said the windfall levy on Nigerian banks' foreign exchange (FX) revaluation gains was credit negative for banks.\n\nIt said the tax will have a particularly negative effect on banks whose capital adequacy is close to regulatory thresholds.\n\nMoody's said: \"The tax follows record profits declared by banks in 2023, largely because of foreign-currency revaluation gains related to the naira's massive devaluation of 37 percent in June 2023.\"\n\nIt pointed out that the tax was in line with the CBN's September 2023 policy prohibiting banks from using foreign-currency-related profits for operational expenses and dividends.\n\nIn a report, it stated: \"Eight of the nine Nigerian banks we rate reported in excess of N3.5 trillion in aggregate pre-tax profits in 2023 versus N1.1 trillion in 2022, and we estimate that over a third of the profits were from foreign-currency revaluation and trading gains.\"\n\nThe ratings institution added: \"It is unclear, however, what proportion of the revaluation gains will be taxed, given the differences between trading and revaluation gains.\n\n\"Additionally, the 2023 revaluation gains include unrealised gains, which may affect how the tax is applied, particularly as the government has not been clear how the 50 percent windfall tax will be achieved.\"\n\nPresident Bola Tinubu had written to the Senate to amend the 2023 Finance Act, to introduce a 50 per cent payment of a one-time windfall tax on the foreign exchange revaluation profits of banks in the 2023 financial year. The amended Act has been passed by the upper chamber.\n\nThe Senate however, amended the bill, increasing the tax to 70 per cent, arguing the windfall was not a result of any effort of the banks or value addition, but as a result of government policy which must be redistributed.\n\nMoody's had previously pointed to the severity of the negative effect of the tax on banks' foreign-currency-related profits.\n\nIt said: \"Given banks have already been subject to the standard 30 per cent corporate income tax rate for 2023, in a less aggressive scenario a surplus tax of 20 per cent on the FX gains would equate to the total 50 per cent windfall tax.\"\n\nMoody's further noted that it was possible the government may pursue an additional 50 per cent windfall tax on banks' foreign-currency revaluation gains, which it estimated would equate to as much as 6 per cent of the aggregate equity (shareholders' funds) of banks rated by it.\n\n\"For the government, we estimate the windfall tax may yield revenue of as much as 0.3 per cent of 2024 Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Although this is not negligible given the government's small tax intake of around 9 per cent of GDP in 2023, it remains marginal and only a temporary revenue measure,\" it added.", "source": {"uri":

Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) yesterday reacted to the new Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) which benchmarks interest rates to 26.75 per cent from 26.25 per cent, saying it will further constrain the growth of the manufacturing sector.\n\nThe Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) announced the new rate at the end of its 296th meeting in Abuja.\n\nReacting in a statement on the increase on Wednesday, the Director General of MAN, Segun Ajayi-Kadir, said, \"The new rate will further constrain the growth of the manufacturing sector, as the purchasing power of consumers, production levels, competitiveness and sales will face further decline.\"\n\nThe body expressed concern that, \"Despite the continuous increase in MPR over the past two years resulting in a weighty 1,475 basis point hike from 11.5% in May 2022 to 26.25% in May 2024, inflation has remained persistently high, reaching a staggering 34.19% in June, the highest since March 1996.\"\n\nThe DG said the continued increase in the cost of borrowing, which is one of the major challenges, will escalate production costs and consequently the prices of finished goods.\n\nHe added that the development will constrain reinvestment for expansion and introduction of new brands, further restrain access to capital, judging from the fact that only 16% of total commercial bank credit was disbursed to the manufacturing sector in the first quarter of the year.\n\n\"It is noteworthy to state that the worrisome trend occasioned by increase in cost of borrowing is corroborated by the report of NBS, to the effect that manufacturing investment declined significantly in the second quarter of the year.\"\n\nThe body therefore called on the federal government to direct the CBN to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the impact of previous decisions of the MPC on inflation rate and the productive sector over the last 5 years.", "source": {"uri": "dailytrust.com", "dataType":

While controlling inflation is crucial, mitigating adverse effects on business operations and economic growth is imperative. The Chamber proposes the following:\n\n\"The government should release more capital expenditure to reflate business activities and support the contribution to economic growth. The capital expenditure released so far is too small in the face of the magnitude of the infrastructural deficit that businesses suffer from\".\n\nThe Chamber added that with the new capital expenditure component of N12.2 trillion and a release of only N1.84 trillion at mid-year, \"we definitely need to speed up the release of funds for capital projects in the next quarter to boost economic growth\".\n\nThe statement reads in part: \"We want to advise that the government be faithful to deploying the supplementary budget funds on business-boosting infrastructure as proposed to the National Assembly.\n\n\"We should diversify our approach to controlling inflation beyond interest rate hikes. Policies that directly address supply-side constraints, such as improving agricultural productivity and stabilising energy prices, can help reduce inflationary pressures more effectively.\n\n\"Increased investment in infrastructure can alleviate production bottlenecks and reduce business costs. This will enhance productivity and competitiveness, helping to tame inflation from the supply side\".\n\nAlmona assured that LCCI remains committed to working with the government and the CBN to ensure policies that foster conducive environment for business growth and economic stability, adding that a holistic approach, balancing inflation control with support for businesses, will pave the way for sustainable economic development in Nigeria.", "source": {"uri": "theeagleonline.com.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Th Eagle Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tajudeen_balogun@theeagleonline.com.ng", "name": "Tajudeen Balogun", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Chamber_of_Commerce_&_Industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London Chamber of Commerce & Industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Consultative_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "People's Consultative Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Nigeria", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Bank of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinyere_Almona", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chinyere Almona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food prices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos_Chamber_of_Commerce_and_Industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capital expenditure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_exemption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tax exemption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply-side_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply-side economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://theeagleonline.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/LCCILOGO-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9755234", "eventUri": "eng-9755234", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 107, "relevance": 1}

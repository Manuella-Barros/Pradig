The World No.2 will be one of the top contenders to win a gold medal in the upcoming quadrennial event. Back in 2019, Gauff, at the age of 15, grabbed eyeballs after she defeated Venus Williams in the first round of Wimbledon.\n\nHowever, the 2023 US Open-winner never locked horns with Serena, which remains her 'only regret'. However, Gauff said that she relishes her relationship with the American legend, who she deems as her 'friend and mentor'.\n\n\"You've been lucky enough that your on-court relationships have turned into off-court friendships. One of those notable friendships is with your idol, Serena Williams. Serena was once just a stranger printed on a poster hanging in your room, and now you still can't believe she's a friend and mentor,\" Gauff wrote in a letter on the NBC Olympics website.\n\nHaving won 23 Grand Slam singles titles, Serena is one of the greats of the game. Serena also has four Olympic medals to her name. Gauff was in awe of the way Serena conducted herself and made a reputation of a champion.\n\n\"Her profound impact on tennis, what it means to be a champion and to break barriers, is a legacy you hope to uphold and carry with you into your first Olympic Games,\" she wrote.\n\nGauff is one of the six members of USA's tennis team, along with Jessica Pegula, Danielle Collins, Emma Navarro, Desirae Krawczyk and Emma Navarro. Apart from taking part in singles, Gauff will also play doubles with Pegula.\n\n\"The excitement is overwhelming. You can't wait to travel with your teammates, to take on the Olympic tennis tournament and hopefully increase the United States' medal count that you continually check each Olympics,\" Gauff added.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Pegula", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Pegula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Venus Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Olympic_broadcasts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC Olympic broadcasts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Navarro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emma Navarro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desirae_Krawczyk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Desirae Krawczyk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danielle_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Danielle Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202407/coco-gauff-232016797-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=1RgJDqFs2d9pJpP6Sh7loKsEnm0mvJ94", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757281", "eventUri": "eng-9757281", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 227, "relevance": 1}

One of those notable friendships is with your idol, Serena Williams.\"\n\nGauff also expressed how surreal it was to now call Williams a \"friend.\"\n\n\"Serena was once just a stranger printed on a poster hanging in your room, and now you still can't believe she's a friend and mentor,\" she continued. \"Her profound impact on tennis, what it means to be a champion and to break barriers is a legacy you hope to uphold and carry with you into your first Olympic Games.\"\n\nGauff is set to compete in the Paris Olympics, which will kick off on Friday, July 26. Gauff, who at 19 was the youngest American player to win the U.S Open in singles after Serena Williams won in 1999 at the age of 17, had to previously opened up about having to drop out of the Tokyo Olympics in 2020 due to her testing positive for COVID-19.\n\nDespite that setback, Gauff is now back in action and her fans can't wait to see what she does next. In previous interviews, she talked about her admiration for Williams and her career. Throughout the years, Williams has also shared similar sentiments.\n\nRead on to see everything Coco Gauff and Serena Williams have said about each other.\n\nIn an August interview with People, Gauff talked about her experience meeting Venus and Serena Williams and Roger Federer at professional tournaments when she was just 15.\n\nIn the interview, she called the trio her \"idols.\" But despite all the comparisons that fans have made between her and Serena Williams, she said she's not trying to be like the athlete.\n\n\"(I'm) not trying to fulfill those footsteps whatsoever,\" she told People in another interview. \"But obviously I do want to be the best version of myself and be the best that I can be.\"\n\n\"I don't think anybody will [take Serena's mantle] because she's just one of a kind,\" Gauff added. \"But I will try my best to be the best Coco.\"\n\nAfter Serena Williams announced her retirement, Gauff told Tennis Majors in an August 2022 interview that she saw it coming.\n\n\"(It's) not really shocking, but almost shocking news because she's just been playing forever -- my whole life,\" she said. \"(I'm) a little bit sad because I have always wanted to play her. So I'm hoping that my draw in Cincinnati or (the) U.S. Open or even here can work out so we can play each other. Because that's just one of my goals.\"\n\nGauff noted that the Williams sisters have inspired her greatly. She said Serena Williams is part of \"the reason why I play tennis,\" and since the sport is largely white, she looked to Venus and Serena Williams.\n\n\"It made me believe that I could dominate, too,\" she said.\n\nGauff added that she doesn't believe the legacy Serena Williams left behind is something that \"any other player can probably touch.\"\n\n\"I think that the legacy that she will continue to leave throughout her life is something that can inspire many more generations,\" she noted.\n\nIn September 2023, Gauff made history when she became the first American teenager to win the U.S. Open in singles since Serena Williams. While advancing to her final match, she spoke to ESPN about Williams and said the tennis star will always be the greatest of all time, aka the \"GOAT.\"\n\n\"Serena is Serena. She's the GOAT,\" she said. \"I'd hope to do half of what she did. But I'm not going to compare myself to her. She's someone that I look up to.\"\n\nWhile Gauff pushed back against the notion of \"taking the torch,\" she also revealed that she regrets never having competed against Williams, who gave the final bow of her solo career at the 2022 U.S. Open after losing in the 3rd round.\n\n\"Being in the same stat line as her means a lot to me,\" Gauff said. \"She's my idol and I think the only regret I'll have for the rest of my life is not being able to play her. There were so many tournaments where if we won an extra round or didn't lose, I would've played her.

She and James were chosen by Team USA athletes.\n\nThe 20-year-old Gauff made the American team for the Tokyo Games three years ago as a teenager but had to sit out those Olympics because she tested positive for COVID-19 right before she was supposed to fly to Japan.\n\nNow Gauff, who is based in Florida, is a Grand Slam title winner in singles and doubles. She won her first major championship in New York in September, defeating Aryna Sabalenka in the singles final of the U.S. Open, then added her first Grand Slam doubles trophy at the French Open this June alongside Katerina Siniakova of the Czech Republic.\n\nThe same clay courts at Roland Garros used for the French Open will be where matches are going to be held for the Paris Olympics. The draw to set the brackets is Thursday, and play begins on Friday.\n\nGauff is seeded No. 2 in singles, matching her current WTA ranking behind No. 1 Iga Swiatek of Poland, and will be among the medal favorites.\n\nFILE - Coco Gauff of the U.S. plays a shot against Poland's Iga Swiatek during their semifinal match of the French Open tennis tournament at the Roland Garros stadium in Paris, Thursday, June 6, 2024.

The next one you take will be positive too, as will the third. It's official - you have COVID, and it's ruining all your big plans,\" the letter on the NBC Olympics website states.\n\n\"You have your bags packed, a plane ticket purchased and a coveted spot at the greatest athletic event in the world, the Olympic Games. Now that lifelong dream of becoming an Olympian will be delayed and you're devastated.\n\n\"Behind a stream of tears, you're going to wonder how you'll ever be able to break the news to your team captain. Your teammates and friends will have to contend on behalf of your country without you.\n\n\"With a new day though, you'll have a new attitude. What else can you do? While your Olympic goal is seemingly on hold, people around the globe are in crises, battling COVID, with real pressure, real hardship and real-life struggles. You're just missing a big tournament.\"\n\nGauff will be the second seed at the Paris Games and she hopes to follow in the footsteps of 23-time Grand Slam winner Williams, who won four Olympic gold medals (one in the singles and three in the doubles).\n\nThe 9 women to win Olympic Games tennis gold - ft. Serena Williams, Steffi Graf\n\nTennis at the Olympic Games: The 7 greatest moments - ranked!\n\nBut it is not just in terms of medals that Gauff wants to emulate her hero as she also wants to \"break barriers\".\n\nThe reigning US Open champion added: \"It's always been an honor to represent the United States. As a member of the U.S. Billie Jean King Cup team, you will rally for the red, white and blue throughout your career, a distinct privilege you will enjoy.\n\n\"While tennis is an individual sport, you relish the relationships with your teammates. You've been lucky enough that your on-court relationships have turned into off-court friendships. One of those notable friendships is with your idol, Serena Williams.\n\n\"Serena was once just a stranger printed on a poster hanging in your room, and now you still can't believe she's a friend and mentor. Her profound impact on tennis, what it means to be a champion and to break barriers is a legacy you hope to uphold and carry with you into your first Olympic Games.\n\n\"So, I'll spoil the story for you - you do get to finally play at your first Olympic Games in Paris. The excitement is overwhelming. You can't wait to travel with your teammates, to take on the Olympic tennis tournament and hopefully increase the United States' medal count that you continually check each Olympics.\"\n\nREAD NEXT: Coco Gauff: Who makes up the team behind reigning US Open champion?", "source": {"uri": "tennis365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis365.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shahida_jacobs@tennis365.com", "name": "Shahida Jacobs", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Navarro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emma Navarro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danielle_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Danielle Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Pegula", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Pegula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Olympic_broadcasts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC Olympic broadcasts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Jean_King_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billie Jean King Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffi_Graf", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steffi Graf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.ps-aws.com/c?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2me2qg8dfiw8u.cloudfront.net%2Fcontent%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F07%2F24093843%2FCoco-Gauff-dreams-of-emulating-Serena-Williams.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757281", "eventUri": "eng-9757281", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

In 2021, everything was ready for Gauff to be an Olympian at the age of 17 but then a positive COVID test ruined everything.\n\nWhile it was one of the most heartbreaking and devastating moments of Gauff's career, she has since managed to achieve great things in the game and make the last couple of years a very successful period. And ahead of her Olympic debut - where the top-ranked American female tennis player is hoping for a medal - the 20-year-old penned a letter to her 17-year-old-self, in which she reflected on her past couple of years and that includes forming a friendship with one of the greatest players ever.\n\n\"While tennis is an individual sport, you relish the relationships with your teammates. You've been lucky enough that your on-court relationships have turned into off-court friendships. One of those notable friendships is with your idol, Serena Williams,\" Gauff's letter posted on the NBC Olympic reads.\n\n\"Serena was once just a stranger printed on a poster hanging in your room, and now you still can't believe she's a friend and mentor. Her profound impact on tennis, what it means to be a champion and to break barriers is a legacy you hope to uphold and carry with you into your first Olympic Games.\"\n\nThroughout this year, world No. 2 Gauff has repeated several times that winning a medal at the Paris Olympics is one of her biggest goals and targets for this year. And since the 2023 US Open champion has been one of the best and most consistent players over the last year, there is no doubt that she will be a favorite at the Paris Olympics and also one of the strongest contenders for a medal.\n\nBut that won't be Gauff's lone chance at a medal since she is also set to play in the women's doubles event with Jessica Pegula. While they don't play doubles regularly, they have been one of the best top teams when they share the same side of the net. That makes Gauff and Pegula one of the top contenders for a medal.\n\nWhile nothing is confirmed, there are also indications that the 20-year-old American will play in the mixed doubles event.\n\n\"In your phone under your vision notes, you wrote that you want to win a medal at the Olympics. Gold, silver, bronze - it doesn't matter. But you've already won, you've made your childhood dream of playing at the Olympics, representing the United States, a real reality. And now, finally, you get to enjoy it,\" Gauff shared in the latter.\n\nGauff's remarks have made it perfectly clear that she wants to leave Paris with at least one medal in at least one competition. But she is also aware that putting massive expectations and pressure on herself to achieve that goal could backfire and have a very negative impact.\n\nWith that being said, the current world No. 2 suggests that \"trying to minimize the moment\" could be the best thing to do.\n\n\"I've grown up a lot so now I'm just taking in the moments and being grateful for every day I get to step on the court, and every day that I get to be alive in general. I could probably go into it making it a big deal - which it is a big deal - but I think I play my best tennis when I try to minimize the moment as much as possible, so I'm just going to enjoy it;\" Gauff said in an interview with the WTA.\n\n\"I think it's one of those things that win or lose, it will always be a positive experience for me - even if I could experience the biggest disappointment there, I still got to compete at an Olympics. So I'm just going to try and enjoy it.\"\n\nAt Roland Garros, Gauff finished as singles runner-up in 2022 while she was a semifinalist this year. When it comes to doubles, Gauff won this year's title with Katerina Siniakova and was also a finalist in 2022 with Pegula.\n\nNothing is certain but Roland Garros has been a happy hunting place for Gauff so far and she will certainly hope that continues next week.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dzevad_mesic@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Dzevad Mesic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2008_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Pegula", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Pegula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate\u0159ina_Siniakov\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kate\u0159ina Siniakov\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Tennis_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's Tennis Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image151669.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757281", "eventUri": "eng-9757281", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

Three years ago, a 17-year-old Gauff was devastated to miss the Tokyo Olympics after testing positive for COVID-19 on the eve of her departure to Japan, making her upcoming campaign in Paris something she says she'll enjoy to the fullest.\n\n\"Behind a stream of tears, you're going to wonder how you'll ever be able to break the news to your team captain. Your teammates and friends will have to contend on behalf of your country without you,\" Gauff wrote in the letter, published by the NBC Olympics website.\n\n\"With a new day though, you'll have a new attitude. What else can you do? While your Olympic goal is seemingly on hold, people around the globe are in crises, battling COVID, with real pressure, real hardship and real-life struggles. You're just missing a big tournament.\n\n\"The fresh perspective on your situation will make a new goal clear to you: qualifying for the 2024 Paris Games.\"\n\nBecause of that emotional reaction to missing what was expected to be her first Games, Gauff wants her 17-year-old self to know that she's \"already won\" by securing a berth in this year's competition on the back of a run during the qualifying period that included her first WTA 1000 and WTA 500 titles, and her first major victory last summer at the US Open.\n\nAlways quick to raise her hand to compete for her country in Billie Jean King Cup play, and one of the Hologic WTA Tour's most prolific doubles players, Gauff relishes competing in a team environment, and will be a threat to win multiple medals when the tennis competition gets underway in Paris this Saturday.\n\nIn that camp, she's following in the footsteps of Williams, winner of four Olympic gold medals (one in singles and three in doubles with her sister, Venus Williams) who represented the U.S. in Olympic competition four times.\n\n\"While tennis is an individual sport, you relish the relationships with your teammates,\" Gauff wrote. \"You've been lucky enough that your on-court relationships have turned into off-court friendships. One of those notable friendships is with your idol, Serena Williams. Serena was once just a stranger printed on a poster hanging in your room, and now you still can't believe she's a friend and mentor.\n\n\"Her profound impact on tennis, what it means to be a champion and to break barriers is a legacy you hope to uphold and carry with you into your first Olympic Games.\"\n\nFrom her first press conferences of the season, to an April cover story in Vogue magazine where she posed in a glittering gold dress, Gauff made no secret of her desire to be standing on the podium by the time the Olympic tennis event concludes -- something she reiterated to herself in the first-person essay. But as she gets ready for the culmination of a \"childhood dream,\" she says she's not solely focused on the result. She wants to \"learn and ... enjoy\" all that awaits her.\n\n\"The excitement is overwhelming. You can't wait to travel with your teammates, to take on the Olympic tennis tournament and hopefully increase the United States' medal count that you continually check each Olympics,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Besides the battle on the court, be sure to enjoy the whole experience outside the confines of Roland Garros. There will be athletes from across the world that you admire that you will have the opportunity to connect with. You can learn about new sports that have nothing to do with a baseline, backhand or the world of tennis.\n\n\"In your phone under your vision notes, you wrote that you want to win a medal at the Olympics. Gold, silver, bronze-it doesn't matter. But you've already won, you've made your childhood dream of playing at the Olympics, representing the United States, a real reality. And now, finally, you get to enjoy it.\"", "source": {"uri": "wtatennis.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Women's Tennis Association"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Olympic_broadcasts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Olympic broadcasts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_500_tournaments", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WTA 500 tournaments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_1000_tournaments", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WTA 1000 tournaments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Jean_King_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Billie Jean King Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WTA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hologic", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hologic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Venus Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://photoresources.wtatennis.com/photo-resources/2024/07/23/f3404b48-21f9-47b2-88ba-30c1a4278ad2/Coco_Gauff_-_ecotrans_Ladies_Open_2024_-_Day_6-DSC_5916.jpg?width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757281", "eventUri": "eng-9757281", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

According to her, entrepreneurs have to be delusional.\n\n\"I think delusional is great. All of the greatest athletes and greatest artists have to have a little bit of craziness and delusion. Having a little bit of craziness in your goal is kind of healthy,\" she said.\n\nIn October 2023, she was on SportsPro's 50 Most Marketable list as one of the world's most marketable tennis players.

She'll be the third Black woman to wave the stars and stripes at a Summer Olympics opening ceremony, following Evelyn Ashford in Seoul 1988 and Dawn Staley in Athens in 2004.\n\nWhile many current tennis stars are skipping the Olympics, due to the extra workload -- Americans Ben Shelton and Frances Tiafoe among them -- Gauff has been looking forward to Paris, and her Olympic debut, for some time. \"I get goosebumps representing my country,\" Gauff told TIME back in March, sitting at the public courts she grew up playing on in Delray Beach, Fla. \"I want to win a gold so bad.\" A COVID diagnosis forced Gauff to miss the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.\n\nGauff is entered into three events: women's singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. Olympic tennis will take place on the clay courts of Roland Garros, home of the French Open. Gauff reached the semifinals of this year's French, losing to world No. 1 Iga Swiatek in the semifinals. Swiatek won her third straight French Open this year.\n\nSwiatek isn't skipping the Olympics.\n\nGauff's selection as flag bearer caps off an incredible start to an American athlete career. She first emerged five years ago, at Wimbledon, when Gauff, just 15, upset five-time Wimbledon champion Venus Wiliams in the first round. She became the youngest woman to reach Wimbledon's fourth round in almost three decades. Just a few months before that magical run, Gauff had lost 6-1, 6-1, in a qualifying round of a low-level pro tournament in Bonita Springs, Fla. She displayed little effort, and her mom, Candi, offered her the option to step away from tennis and enroll in a brick-and-mortar high school if she wasn't going to at least give full effort.\n\nShe stuck with tennis, and after Wimbledon that summer suddenly found herself sitting in Michelle Obama's Washington, D.C. office. Obama's main piece of advice: It's OK to say no to people when they're making too many demands.\n\nGauff also showed maturity beyond her years in 2020, when she spoke out against police violence following the murder of George Floyd, against the advice of her parents who were worried about their 16-year-old daughter weighing in on a charged issue. \"If you are choosing silence,\" she said at a protest in Delray Beach, \"you are choosing the side of the oppressor.\" Her tennis fell short of expectations the next few years: pundits chirped about her forehand as being a weak spot. \"That got in my head a little bit,\" she told TIME earlier this year.\n\nBut a run to her first Grand Slam final, at the French in 2022, where she lost to Swiatek, lifted her confidence, and she delighted the hometown fans during her victory at last year's U.S. Open, riffing on her love of anime and how doubters inspired her. She was the first American teen to win the U.S. Open in nearly a quarter century.", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_gregory@time.com",

Here's what you need to know about the first post-pandemic Games.\n\nPARIS -- Three years ago, Coco Gauff was kept out of the Olympics after testing positive for COVID-19 days before her scheduled departure.\n\nThis time, she'll be carrying the U.S. flag at the opening ceremony.\n\nGauff will join NBA superstar LeBron James as the opening ceremony flag bearers for Team USA at the 2024 Paris Olympics, the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee announced Wednesday. She is the first tennis player to serve in the role.\n\nThe pair were selected to lead the U.S. delegation into the Games in a vote of fellow athletes, conducted by Team USA's athletes' commission. At recent Olympics, the U.S. has selected one male athlete and one female athlete to serve as flag bearers.\n\n\"I never thought in a million years I would have the honor of carrying the American flag for Team USA in the Opening Ceremony,\" Gauff said in a statement. \"I could not be more proud to lead my teammates with LeBron as we showcase our dedication and passion on the biggest stage there is - at a moment where we can bring athletes and fans together from around the world.\"\n\nGauff, 20, is making her Olympic debut in Paris after blossoming into one of tennis' brightest stars. She has won two Grand Slam titles - including the U.S. Open championship last summer - and is currently No. 2 in the world in the Women's Tennis Association's world rankings.\n\nThe opening ceremony for the Paris Games begins Friday at 1:30 p.m. ET, or 7:30 p.m. in Paris. It is slated to be the first in Olympic history to take place outside of a stadium, with athletes floating down the Seine River on barges rather than parading into a stadium.\n\nThe U.S. is expected to fill at least one full boat of the nearly 100 in the parade; Countries with smaller delegations will share boats.\n\nWhile James and Gauff will lead the athlete delegation at the Games, the U.S. political delegation will be led by First Lady Jill Biden. According to a statement released by the White House on Monday, she will be joined by a handful of politicians - including U.S. Senators Chris Coons, D-Delaware, and Alex Padilla, D-California -as well as South Carolina women's basketball coach Dawn Staley and figure skating gold medalist Brian Boitano.\n\nThe U.S. delegation will also include Casey Wasserman, the chairperson of the organizing committee for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, and Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass. Team USA will be second-to-last in the traditional parade of nations Friday as the host of the next Summer Olympics.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"},

Alica Schmidt, Athletics\n\nGerman sprinter, Alica Schmidt, has got hearts racing beyond the track. With over five million Instagram followers, the 25-year-old athlete has garnered attention from high-end fashion houses, having worked with Puma, Nike and BOSS.\n\nLast year, Schmidt went the extra mile in her career, walking for BOSS in their Milan show, while simultaneously releasing a sportswear collaboration.\n\n2. Coco Gauff, Tennis\n\nKnown for her bright and bold looks on the court, American tennis star Coco Gauff brings vibrancy to more than just her game.\n\nGauff, 20, shot to fame following her historic defeat of Venus Williams at Wimbledon in 2019 when she was only 15. The following year, Gauff became the second youngest US player to make the Olympic team.\n\nThe young star was dubbed the tennis world's new fashion 'it girl' last year following her successful collaboration with New Balance. Her collection was innovative, taking inspiration from basketball shoes and incorporating a mid-cut that is rarely seen in tennis attire. Gauff has single-handedly elevated tennis-core with cool street-style accents.\n\n3. Sha'Carri Richardson, Athletics\n\nUS track star Sha'Carri Richardson could be easy to miss, with her record times in the 100 and 200-metre sprints, but the 24-year-old makes sure she's noticed with her head-turning ensembles.\n\nRecently photographed in a Ralph Lauren Collection bodysuit for Vogue's August cover, Richardson is known for bringing bold (if not gold) glamour and extravagance to every look, most notably through her nails.\n\n4. Miles Chamley-Watson, Fencer\n\nThe Rio 2016 Olympic bronze medallist, Miles Chamley-Watson, is covered from head-to-toe in kit when he takes to the piste. But the US fencer has a lot to show off the field.\n\nThe London-born US-representing athlete channels his creative side through fashion, even having walked for Vogue World: Paris last month.\n\nSilk material, polka dot suits and open shirts that reveal his intricate tattoos showcase the 34-year-old's personality away from the rigorous demands of his sport.\n\n5. Dalia Kaddari, Athletics\n\n200-metre sprinter, Dalia Kaddari, is known for her timeless Italian fashion. Having stormed the track at the European Team Championships in 2021, she went on to earn a gold medal at the European U23 Championships in Tallinn, Estonia.\n\nWorking with longstanding brands such as New Balance, the 23-year-old proudly showcases her country's synonymous style, both on and off the field.", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish News"},

she will be among the leading contenders in the mixed doubles draw with the 20-year-old set to partner US men's No 1 Taylor Fritz at Paris 2024.\n\nBoth Gauff and Fritz are making their Olympic debut in Paris and the partnership is undoubtedly a force to be reckoned with in the mixed draw.\n\nWith a combined ranking of 13th - Gauff being WTA No 2, and Fritz ATP No 11 - the pair look set to be the third seed in the draw.\n\nIt has been a big morning for Gauff, who has not only had her place in the mixed draw confirmed.\n\nThe US star has been confirmed as her nation's youngest Olympic opening

winner says Coco Gauff has 'something to prove' ahead of Olympics and US Open title defence\n\nOn paper, the top seeds look set to be the German pairing of Alexander Zverev and Laura Siegemund, with the latter using her doubles ranking to enter.\n\nThe pair played a key role in Germany's successful United Cup campaign at the beginning of the season, and Zverev will be looking for a second Olympic

Stefanos Tsitsipas and Maria Sakkari, who are set to compete for Greece.\n\nTsitsipas previously expressed doubt about playing with Sakkari in Paris, though the two are now confirmed to unite once again after pairing up in Tokyo.\n\nElsewhere, WTA world No 4 Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan will pair up with Alexander Bublik, while Mirra Andreeva and Daniil Medvedev compete under the neutral athlete banner.\n\nFrench hopes sit on the shoulders of Caroline Garcia and Edouard Roger-Vasselin, while real-life couple Katerina Siniakova and Tomas Machac compete for Czechia.\n\nDanish stars

Alica Schmidt, Athletics\n\nGerman sprinter, Alica Schmidt, has got hearts racing beyond the track. With over five million Instagram followers, the 25-year-old athlete has garnered attention from high-end fashion houses, having worked with Puma, Nike and BOSS.\n\nLast year, Schmidt went the extra mile in her career, walking for BOSS in their Milan show, while simultaneously releasing a sportswear collaboration.\n\n2. Coco Gauff, Tennis\n\nKnown for her bright and bold looks on the court, American tennis star Coco Gauff brings vibrancy to more than just her game.\n\nGauff, 20, shot to fame following her historic defeat of Venus Williams at Wimbledon in 2019 when she was only 15. The following year, Gauff became the second youngest US player to make the Olympic team.\n\nThe young star was dubbed the tennis world's new fashion 'it girl' last year following her successful collaboration with New Balance. Her collection was innovative, taking inspiration from basketball shoes and incorporating a mid-cut that is rarely seen in tennis attire. Gauff has single-handedly elevated tennis-core with cool street-style accents.\n\n3. Sha'Carri Richardson, Athletics\n\nUS track star Sha'Carri Richardson could be easy to miss, with her record times in the 100 and 200-metre sprints, but the 24-year-old makes sure she's noticed with her head-turning ensembles.\n\nRecently photographed in a Ralph Lauren Collection bodysuit for Vogue's August cover, Richardson is known for bringing bold (if not gold) glamour and extravagance to every look, most notably through her nails.\n\n4. Miles Chamley-Watson, Fencer\n\nThe Rio 2016 Olympic bronze medallist, Miles Chamley-Watson, is covered from head-to-toe in kit when he takes to the piste. But the US fencer has a lot to show off the field.\n\nThe London-born US-representing athlete channels his creative side through fashion, even having walked for Vogue World: Paris last month.\n\nSilk material, polka dot suits and open shirts that reveal his intricate tattoos showcase the 34-year-old's personality away from the rigorous demands of his sport.\n\n5.

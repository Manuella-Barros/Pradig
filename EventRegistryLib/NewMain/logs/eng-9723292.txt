Liverpool and Uruguay striker Nunez was at the centre of the chaos, and was punched by a rival fan before retaliating.\n\nInitially, it was not clear what sparked the brawl, as Uruguay stars began jumping into the crowd while Colombia players were celebrating their victory on the pitch. But Uruguay defender Jose Maria Gimenez later expressed his side of the story, claiming that Colombia fans started to turn on friends and family of the Uruguay players who were sitting behind the team benches.\n\nGimenez slammed the lack of police presence as the mass brawl erupted in the stands between players, fans, and loved ones moments after the game ended, as he said: \"It was a disaster; there was no police and we had to defend our families.\n\nREAD MORE: Darwin Nunez in huge brawl in stands as Liverpool star hits fans at Copa America\n\nREAD MORE: Virgil van Dijk claims ref's actions at final whistle vs England said it all about penalty\n\n\"This is because of two or three who have one drink too many,\" he added. The crowd at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte was filled with a Colombia majority, who matched the energy of a hostile Copa America semi-final.\n\nGimenez then stated that the actions of the Uruguay players were forced due to their families being attacked both verbally and physically by a section of Colombia fans. \"A certain sector of the Colombian fans made an avalanche where our loved ones were,\" said Gimenez.\n\nA video then surfaced of Nunez hugging his son on the field, looking visibly emotional after the traumatising incident. A report from Uruguayan outlet El Pais stated that Uruguay players were punched and kicked during the incident, before being led onto the field by security.\n\nThe report claimed that relatives of Uruguay midfielder Manuel Ugarte were hurt during the incident, and he consoled them on the field. The scenes after the game were similar to the events on the field during the 90 minutes, as a fierce semi-final saw eight players shown cards.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nJefferson Lerma put Colombia ahead after 39 minutes against the run of play, after Nunez had missed two major opportunities to hand Uruguay the lead. Just before half-time Colombia defender Daniel Munoz was then sent off for a second bookable offence, as he elbowed Ugarte in the ribs.\n\nColombia will face Argentina in Sunday's Copa America final after extending their unbeaten run to 28 games after the ugly 1-0 win.

Colombia will meet Lionel Messi's Argentina in the final of the continental tournament in Miami on Sunday.\n\nThe Colombian players were left in tears as they celebrated the sensational victory in front of thousands of fans, who traveled to Charlotte and filled the stands. James Rodriguez's emotional celebration was reflective of the mood in the camp as Colombia worked their way through to their first Copa America final since 2001. Colombia will defend their 28-game unbeaten run -- the longest in their football history -- when they meet defending champions and pre-tournament favourites Argentina in the big final.\n\nColombia managed to hold on to the 1-0 lead until the final whistle despite being reduced to 10 men for 45 minutes of the semi-final. Jefferson Lerma put them ahead in the first half with a well-timed header from a corner and the Colombian backline did the rest of the job, making sure Uruguay were constantly under pressure.\n\nUruguay paid the price for being wasteful upfront. Liverpool star Darwin Nunez missed several chances in the first half and Colombia made them pay. It could have easily been game over for Colombia when they were reduced to 10 men just before half-time. Daniel Munoz lost his cool and got himself sent off, with the right back receiving a second yellow card for elbowing Manuel Ugarte in the chest when play was stopped.\n\nHowever, Colombia showed incredible grit and determination to hold off Uruguay, who dominated possession in the second half. Former Barcelona star Luis Suarez nearly equalised for Uruguay, but the post denied him and his team a chance to comeback into the game.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, goals from Lionel Messi and Julian Alvarez helped Argentina beat Canada 2-0 and book their place in yet another final of Copa America.

Liverpool star Darwin Nunez was among the ones who were seen punching fans in the stands during the ugly post-match scenes. Fans were seen hurling caps, cans, and punches at the Uruguay players, who were making their way back to the changing room after a disappointing loss in the last-eight match.\n\nIn a video shot by one of the fans at the Bank of America Stadium, Darwin Nunez can be seen getting irked by chants from Colombian fans before he enters the stands and throws punches at a few of them. Barcelona's Ronald Araujo and Atletico Madrid's Jose Maria Gimenez were also seen standing alongside Nunez when the fight broke out. Security officials and police officers rushed to calm the situation down and escort the players away from the scene. A few players, including Nunez, returned to the field and met their families, who reportedly were abused by a section of fans.\n\nAlso Read: 10-man Colombia beat Uruguay, to face Argentina in final\n\nUruguay captain Gimenez lashed out at the security situation in Charlotte, saying the players feared for the well-being of their families, pointing fingers at hostile behaviour from Colombia fans, who dominated the stands on Thursday.\n\n\"It's a total disaster. There wasn't a single police officer. They showed up half an hour later. A disaster. And we were there, standing up for ourselves, for our loved ones,\" Gimenez told the broadcasters after the match.\n\n\"Our families are suffering because of some people who have a few drinks and don't know how to drink, who act like children. Hopefully, they'll take more precautions for the next game so this doesn't happen again, because this is a disaster,\" he added.\n\nNunez, who looked shaken after the incident, was cooled by his Liverpool teammate Luis Diaz and veteran Luis Suaraz.\n\nIt was a disappointing evening for Nunez and Uruguay as they paid the price for not being clinical with their chances in the Copa America semi-final. Nunez missed three good opportunities to put Uruguay in the lead in the first half before Colombia took the lead in the 39th minute after Jefferson Lerma headed a corner into the net.\n\nColombia were down to 10 men after Daniel Munoz was sent off after a second yellow for elbowing Uruguy's Manuel Ugarte in the chest.

AP\n\nTen-man Colombia stunned Uruguay 1-0 to reach the final of the 2024 Copa America after a high-octane semi-final on Wednesday. This is Colombia's first final in 23 years and they reached there with a 39th-minute Jefferson Lerma header.\n\nThe Colombians will now face holders Argentina in Sunday's final in Miami.\n\nIt was an anarchic semi-final played in front of a packed and passionate crowd which ended with scuffles on the field and fighting in the stands, including several players who had climbed in among supporters amid the flying punches.\n\nColombia, despite having Daniel Munoz sent off just before the interval and facing plenty of Uruguay pressure, hung on for a famous victory to the delight of their massive following of fans.\n\nThe downtown streets of the North Carolina city were packed with partying fans in bright yellow Colombia jerseys hours before the kick-off.\n\nInside the 74,800 capacity Bank of America Stadium, it was like a home game in Bogota with only pockets of Uruguayan supporters breaking up the wall of yellow on all four sides of the venue.\n\nNot surprisingly in such an atmosphere, Colombia started strongly with their livewire Liverpool winger Luis Diaz doing well to wriggle some space for a cross on the left, finding Daniel Munoz at the back post but the full-back's header was off target.\n\nUruguay were, as always, a threat on the counter-attack and their Liverpool star, Darwin Nunez, was close to finishing off one break when Rodrigo Bentancur found him with a clever pass but the forward poked his shot wide.\n\nNunez had another opening when Maximiliano Araujo played him clear in the inside-right channel but the striker rushed his shot, blasting high and wide.\n\nAt the other end, Colombia forced a turnover which led to James Rodriguez curling in a cross from the right but Jhon Cordoba's header was off target.\n\nLerma breakthrough\u00c2\n\nThe breakthrough came in the 39th minute when Lerma rose majestically above Jose Maria Gimenez and powerfully headed home Rodriguez's corner.\n\nIt was the sixth assist of the tournament for Rodriguez with the former Real Madrid midfielder beating the record for most assists in a single Copa, which was set by Lionel Messi in 2021.\n\nColombia looked to make the most of their momentum with Richard Rios forcing a save out of Uruguay keeper Sergio Rochet, after being played in by Munoz.\n\nBut having been so influential down the right in the opening half, Munoz lost his head completely, just before the break, picking up a second yellow card, after landing an elbow on Manuel Ugarte.\n\nIt was a moment of madness which left Colombia to defend their lead with just 10 men for the entire second half.\n\nColombia coach Nestor Lorenzo took off Rodriguez, who was also on a yellow card, in the 62nd minute as Uruguay gradually began to turn their numerical advantage into real pressure.\n\nNicolas de la Cruz threatened with a low drive before substitute Luis Suarez clipped the outside of the post with a drive from the edge of the box after good work from Federico Valverde.\n\nValverde, the Real Madrid midfielder, then went close himself with a low drive as Colombia's back-line continued to ride their luck.\n\nGiveaway from Uruguay keeper and fell to Mateus Uribe, who despite time and space placed his shot wide of the post.\n\nIn stoppage time Uruguay had a great chance to force penalties when Nunez laid the ball off to substitute Giorgian de Arrascaeta on the edge of the box but he leaned back and put his shot over the bar.\n\nThere was still time for Uribe to waste another chance to make sure of the win, this time hitting the bar in the final minute, but he will be forgiven his wastefulness by the delirious Colombian supporters.\n\nThe celebrations were marred by ugly scenes in the stands will concern organizers CONMEBOL ahead of a final which is sure to attract huge numbers of Argentines as well as Colombians.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Our work is based on the conviction that soccer connects and unites us through its positive values.\n\n\"There is no place for intolerance and violence on and off the pitch. We invite everyone in the remaining days to pour all their passion into cheering on their national teams and having an unforgettable party.\"", "source": {"uri": "osundefender.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OsunDefender"}, "authors": [{"uri": "media_writing@osundefender.com", "name": "Media Writing", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "kazeem_prioritses_accuracy@osundefender.com", "name": "Kazeem Prioritses Accuracy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin,_Northern_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atl\u00e9tico_Madrid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atl\u00e9tico Madrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONMEBOL", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CONMEBOL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.osundefender.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/skysports-uruguay-colombia_6623567-1024x576-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723292", "eventUri": "eng-9723292", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Now comes the ultimate test for Los Cafeteros: the Copa America final against defending champion Argentina.\n\nJefferson Lerma headed in James Rodriguez's corner kick late in the first half and 10-man Colombia held on to reach its first Copa America final in 23 years with a 1-0 victory over Uruguay on Wednesday in Charlotte.\n\nColombia, unbeaten in a national-record 28 matches, next heads to Miami Gardens, Fla., for the final against Lionel Messi and Argentina on Sunday.\n\nColombia was considerably the better side on Wednesday for the opening 45 minutes, only to be forced to hold on after Daniel Munoz received his second booking for an elbow thrown into Manuel Ugarte's torso in first-half stoppage time.\n\n\"We were very courageous,\" Colombia manager Nestor Lorenzo said through an interpreter. \"Even when we were one man down, we left two forwards on the pitch to always have an impact and create some danger.\"\n\nLos Cafeteros pushed on through the second half by a significantly pro-Colombian crowd of more than 70,000.\n\nColombia broke its previous record of 27 matches unbeaten set in the early 1990s by a group of players who finished third in the 1993 and 1995 Copa Americas. Colombia's only title came as host in 2001.\n\n\"They gave us a very important legacy,\" Lorenzo said of that early '90s team. \"They left it for us, and that was the foundation for Colombia football.\"\n\nColombia technically could add to its run without winning the title, since losing the final on penalties would count in the record books as a draw.\n\nRodriguez now has six assists, the most in a single Copa America since the stat was first kept in 2011.\n\nUruguay, which won all three of its group-stage games, did not score in either of its knockout-phase matches. The loss to Colombia ended influential manager Marcelo Bielsa's latest bid at a first major title in international play.\n\n\"The match was constantly interrupted, it was constantly stop and start,\" Bielsa lamented of the second half, through an interpreter. \"We should have created more chances and caused damage to the opponent. Even though we had some clear opportunities, we should have generated more goal opportunities than the ones we did.\"\n\nLerma put Colombia in front in the 39th minute after Rodriguez delivered the latest in a tournament full of perfectly struck set pieces.\n\nThis one came from a corner dropped onto Lerma's head at the back post. Lerma outjumped Jose Maria Gimenez to send his header downward, narrowly inside the left post before Uruguay goalkeeper Sergio Rochet could react.\n\nA great start for Los Cafeteros became far more complicated seven minutes later when Munoz rightly received his second caution from referee Cesar Ramos.\n\nUruguay all-time leading scorer Luis Suarez entered in the 67th minute and immediately made his presence felt in the 71st, striking the outside of the right post with a shot from just inside the penalty area.\n\nHowever, the insertion of center back Yerry Mina and switch to a five-man back line by Colombia manager Nestor Lorenzo helped limit Uruguay from there.\n\nColombia's Mateus Uribe missed the game's two best late chances, dragging an 88th-minute opportunity low and wide of the left post and seeing another effort in stoppage time deflect off a charging Rochet and then the crossbar.\n\n\"He is feeling a bit sad because he's a lion on the pitch and wants more,\" Lorenzo said of Uribe. \"I hugged him and I told him without him we wouldn't be where we are, so that he has to hold his head up high.\"\n\nUruguay will remain in Charlotte to face Canada in Saturday's third-place match, in what will be La Celeste's best finish at the tournament since winning the 2011 title. However, Uruguay could be short-handed if CONMEBOL issues punishments in relation to a post-match fight on Wednesday.\n\nAfter a scuffle with Colombian players at the center circle following the final whistle, multiple Uruguayan players wound up fighting fans in the stands. Darwin Nunez and Ronald Araujo were identified by multiple media reports as two of the Uruguayans involved in the melee.\n\nUruguay defender Jose Maria Gimenez said, according to The Athletic, that he and his teammates were defending their families from Colombian supporters.", "source": {"uri": "charlotteobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Charlotte Observer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

They showed up half an hour later. A disaster. And we were there, standing up for ourselves, for our loved ones.\n\n\"Hopefully, organisers take a little more precautions with our families, with the people and those around the stadiums. Because this happens every game. Our families are suffering because of some people who have a few drinks and don't know how to drink, who act like children.\"\n\nThe Uruguayan Football Association (AUF) has said it will analyse all the footage before deciding whether to make an official complaint. But it is clear the AUF believes it was an oversight to put the players' friends and families in the same area as Colombia supporters without any sort of partition.\n\n\"I think there should've been some kind of barrier, especially because it was known practically from the beginning of the tournament that the Colombian fans were going to purchase 95 per cent of the tickets and that area (of the stadium) could get complicated,\" Ignacio Alonso, the AUF president, said.\n\nAs for the actions of Nunez, Gimenez and others, Alonso maintained what they did was only to be expected in the circumstances. \"The Uruguayan players reacted instinctively to what is natural: which is to defend and protect the children that were in that part of the stand, the women who were being assaulted, the wives, fathers, children and brothers who were there. It's an instinctive response of a father,\" he added.\n\nThe backdrop to all of this is that emotions had been running high at the stadium all night -- Colombia played the entire second half with 10 men after Daniel Munoz was shown a red card just before the interval -- but it was the final whistle, after seven minutes of stoppage time, that brought the first of two flashpoints.\n\nInitially, there was a melee in the centre circle, where more than 40 players and staff congregated immediately after the game. Some Colombia and Uruguay players embraced one another while others -- Uruguay's Luis Suarez and Colombia's Miguel Borja among them -- became involved in an altercation. There was a lot of pushing and shoving elsewhere but, on the face of it, nothing more sinister than that.\n\nMoments later, though, some of the Uruguay players started to sprint towards the touchline, in an area just to the right of their dugout. At first, it was unclear what was going on, other than that some children wearing Uruguay shirts were being carried out of the lower tier and onto the pitch.\n\nThe videos that emerged later provided a fuller picture and showed Nunez, along with Gimenez and the Barcelona defender Ronald Araujo, climbing up into the stand and angrily confronting Colombia supporters. As everything got more heated, Nunez appeared to be struck by one fan. The Liverpool striker also appeared to throw a punch back.\n\n\"'Some of the players had wives, small children, their parents, older relatives... They went to see how they were doing,\" Suarez said. \"Then those things started to happen, the images that you've seen. They (Nunez, Gimenez and others) were trying to protect their families. From what I saw, there were a lot of relatives and children affected. You're left powerless in that situation.\"\n\nContrary to what Gimenez thought, police officers were present at the scene, albeit they took some time -- more than 60 seconds -- to get the situation under control and needed the help of security personnel.\n\nPrior to that, it had threatened to turn into a free-for-all as other Uruguay players and staff got involved, clambering over seats. Video footage appears to show Rodrigo Bentancur throwing an object of some sort into that area.\n\nAs for Nunez, he was clearly still irate and deeply upset by everything that had happened when he got down from the stand. The forward picked up a chair, ran towards an area where Colombia fans were goading him, and threw it into the wall below, prompting some of the Uruguay substitutes to drag him away.\n\nNunez looked extremely emotional at that point. He was consoled by one of the Uruguay backroom staff on the pitch and also by Suarez and Luis Diaz, the Colombia forward who plays alongside him for Liverpool.\n\nAs the dust started to settle and the fans spilt out of the stadium, there were Uruguay players still on the pitch holding their children. Matias Vina had a baby in his hands at one stage, Nicolas de la Cruz sat with his daughter on his knee on the floor, and Nunez was later pictured with a child on his shoulder.\n\nThe Uruguay players looked like they were in a state of shock as much as anything. \"It was an ugly moment,\" Sergio Rochet, the Uruguay goalkeeper, said. \"It's not nice to see these problems, especially when your family is only two metres away. We are sad to go out of the tournament and now we have to deal with this situation.\n\n\"From what I saw, they (the supporters) started throwing things. You try to stay away from that, but when you see that it's your family, small children, it's difficult. I was surprised by the lack of empathy from the Colombia players. I think they should have come to calm the waters.\"\n\nLike a lot of people in the stadium, the Uruguay manager Marcelo Bielsa had no idea what was going on at first. He said he initially thought his players \"were going to thank the Uruguayan fans for the support. But then I learned that there were other kinds of unfortunate difficulties.\"\n\nAs for CONMEBOL, South American football's governing body issued a statement that made no reference whatsoever to any issues around a lack of organisation at the stadium -- something that was evident in so many ways on Wednesday night -- or safety problems.\n\n\"CONMEBOL strongly condemns any act of violence that affects football,\" it said. \"Our work is based on the conviction that soccer connects and unites us through its positive values. There is no place for intolerance and violence on and off the field. We invite everyone in the remaining days to pour all their passion into cheering on their national teams and having an unforgettable party.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stuart_james@nytimes.com", "name": "Stuart James", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguayan_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uruguayan Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Ara\u00fajo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Ara\u00fajo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONMEBOL", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CONMEBOL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Borja", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miguel Borja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_D\u00edaz_(footballer,_born_1997)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis D\u00edaz (footballer, born 1997)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Rochet", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Rochet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_Bielsa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcelo Bielsa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigo_Bentancur", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rodrigo Bentancur"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/07/11051233/GettyImages-2160913470-scaled-e1720689273621.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723292", "eventUri": "eng-9723292", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Once the on-pitch commotion had subsided, the Uruguay players headed towards the stands, according to The Mirror.\n\nNunez led several Uruguay players into the crowd before hostility erupted from Colombian fans, leading to a large-scale fight between players and spectators. After being hit by a fan, Nunez defended himself, with footage showing him retaliating against multiple supporters.\n\nBarcelona's Ronald Araujo was also caught up in the fracas, with thousands of shocked fans capturing the incident on their phones. Security intervened to separate the two groups, swiftly escorting the Uruguay players towards the changing rooms.\n\nAs reported by Uruguayan publication El Pais, the Uruguay players had entered the crowd to support family members and friends seated behind the team bench. With a predominantly Colombian crowd in the stadium, the relatives of the Uruguay stars were reportedly subjected to abuse.\n\nA melee erupted involving players, officials, and fans after the football game, held at the Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina, United States. Team leader Nunez ushered his fellow players into the stands to join their loved ones who had been brought onto the field for safety as tensions continued to rise.\n\nNotably, Jorge Giordano, director of the Uruguay national football team, and press officer Felipe Cotelo found themselves amidst the drama.\n\nReports indicate that Manuel Ugarte, a midfield player from Uruguay, rushed on-field to aid his injured family members amidst the chaos. It's also been noted that certain Uruguay-based supporters didn't walk away unscathed from the incident due to being vastly outnumbered by rival Colombian fans.\n\nJose Maria Gimenez, defender for Team Uruguay, did not mince words about the ordeal; calling it an absolute \"disaster\" and criticising the absence of law enforcement on the grounds. He was quoted saying: \"It was a disaster; there was no police and we had to defend our families.\"\n\nPlacing the blame on a minority of overindulged individuals, he further commented: \"This is because of two or three who have one drink too many. A certain sector of the Colombian fans made an avalanche where our loved ones were,\".\n\nIn the wake of the events, CONMEBOL, the governing body, is set to assess the situation prior to Sunday's highly anticipated Copa America final. The showdown will see Colombia, with their remarkable two-year-long defeat-free run, up against Argentina in Miami.\n\nDespite their impressive stats, Colombia heads into the match as the underdogs.\n\nArgentina are hoping to win a third-straight trophy, after Lionel Messi lifted the Copa America trophy in 2021 before winning the World Cup a year later. Messi had never won an international trophy before 2021, but has the chance to add to his legacy on Sunday in his new home city, after signing for MLS side Inter Miami last year.", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joseph_wilkes@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Joseph Wilkes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Ara\u00fajo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Ara\u00fajo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Lerma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson Lerma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Ugarte_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Ugarte (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Pa\u00eds", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "El Pa\u00eds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONMEBOL", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CONMEBOL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article29518794.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_gettyimages-2161557367.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723292", "eventUri": "eng-9723292", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez and about a dozen Uruguay teammates then went into the stands as fans brawled. A video showed N\u00fa\u00f1ez hitting a fan in Colombian team colours.\n\nJefferson Lerma scored the only goal in front of a fervent and overwhelmingly pro-Colombia crowd of 70,644 at Bank of America Stadium when he headed in a deep corner from James in the 39th minute.\n\nJames becomes the first South American player with six assists at a single major tournament since Pel\u00e9 for Brazil at the 1970 World Cup.\n\nColombia's task of maintaining their advantage was complicated when defender Daniel Mu\u00f1oz was sent off in first-half stoppage time after receiving a second yellow card for swinging an elbow at Uruguay's Manuel Ugarte. Mu\u00f1oz received his first yellow card from Mexican referee C\u00e9sar Ramos in the 31st minute for a reckless slide tackle on Maximiliano Ara\u00fajo.\n\nLiverpool striker Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez failed to take advantage of multiple first-half opportunities, with Colombia goalkeeper Camilo Vargas not having to make his first save until he stopped Nicol\u00e1s de la Cruz's attempt in the 68th minute.\n\nSubstitute Luis Su\u00e1rez, Uruguay's career leader with 68 goals, hit the outside of a post with a shot in the 71st as Uruguay struggled to find a breakthrough against the 10 men.\n\nColombia's Mateus Uribe, another second-half sub, put an open shot wide in the 88th, and Uribe's open shot in the fourth minute of stoppage time ricocheted off the body of sliding goalkeeper Sergio Rochet then the crossbar.\n\nBut one goal proved enough for Colombia to reach their third Copa Am\u00e9rica final and first since winning their only title as hosts in 2001.\n\nAfter the game, videos showed Uruguay players wading into the stands to exchange blows with Colombia fans as police personnel tried to keep the two sides apart.\n\nUruguay captain Jose Maria Gimenez said the players were trying to defend their families.\n\n\"Let me say something before they cut you off because they won't let us speak into the microphone, they don't want me to say anything about what's going on but this is a disaster,\" Gimenez said on the official broadcast. \"Please be careful, our families are in the stands, there are little newborn babies. It was a disaster; there was no police and we had to defend our families.\n\nArgentina are seeking a record 16th Copa Am\u00e9rica title and looking to join Spain as the only countries to win three straight major titles.\n\nWednesday's match was played in 90-degree heat on a surface that was converted from artificial turf to grass in the weeks leading up to the contest.\n\nUruguay will face

A 39th-minute Jefferson Lerma header sealed victory for the Colombians, who will now face holders Argentina in Sunday's final in Miami.\n\nIt was an anarchic semi-final played in front of a packed and passionate crowd which ended with scuffles on the field and fighting in the stands, including several players who had climbed in among supporters amid the flying punches.\n\nColombia, despite having Daniel Munoz sent off just before the interval and facing plenty of Uruguay pressure, hung on for a famous victory to the delight of their massive following of fans.\n\nThe downtown streets of the North Carolina city were packed with partying fans in bright yellow Colombia jerseys hours before the kick-off.\n\nInside the 74,800 capacity Bank of America Stadium, it was like a home game in Bogota with only pockets of Uruguayan supporters breaking up the wall of yellow on all four sides of the venue.\n\nNot surprisingly in such an atmosphere, Colombia started strongly with their livewire Liverpool winger Luis Diaz doing well to wriggle some space for a cross on the left, finding Daniel Munoz at the back post but the full-back's header was off target.\n\nUruguay were, as always, a threat on the counter-attack and their Liverpool star, Darwin Nunez, was close to finishing off one break when Rodrigo Bentancur found him with a clever pass but the forward poked his shot wide.\n\nNunez had another opening when Maximiliano Araujo played him clear in the inside-right channel but the striker rushed his shot, blasting high and wide.\n\nAt the other end, Colombia forced a turnover which led to James Rodriguez curling in a cross from the right but Jhon Cordoba's header was off target.\n\nAlso read: Euro 2024: Final minute Watkins goal takes England into final over Netherlands\n\nThe breakthrough came in the 39th minute when Lerma rose majestically above Jose Maria Gimenez and powerfully headed home Rodriguez's corner. It was the sixth assist of the tournament for Rodriguez with the former Real Madrid midfielder beating the record for most assists in a single Copa, which was set by Lionel Messi in 2021.\n\nColombia looked to make the most of their momentum with Richard Rios forcing a save out of Uruguay keeper Sergio Rochet, after being played in by Munoz.\n\nBut having been so influential down the right in the opening half, Munoz lost his head completely, just before the break, picking up a second yellow card, after landing an elbow on Manuel Ugarte.\n\nIt was a moment of madness which left Colombia to defend their lead with just 10 men for the entire second half.\n\nColombia coach Nestor Lorenzo took off Rodriguez, who was also on a yellow card, in the 62nd minute as Uruguay gradually began to turn their numerical advantage into real pressure.\n\nNicolas de la Cruz threatened with a low drive before substitute Luis Suarez clipped the outside of the post with a drive from the edge of the box after good work from Federico Valverde. Valverde, the Real Madrid midfielder, then went close himself with a low drive as Colombia's back-line continued to ride their luck.\n\nGiveaway from Uruguay keeper and fell to Mateus Uribe, who despite time and space placed his shot wide of the post.\n\nIn stoppage time Uruguay had a great chance to force penalties when Nunez laid the ball off to substitute Giorgian de Arrascaeta on the edge of the box but he leaned back and put his shot over the bar.\n\nThere was still time for Uribe to waste another chance to make sure of the win, this time hitting the bar in the final minute, but he will be forgiven his wastefulness by the delirious Colombian supporters.", "source": {"uri": "wionews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WION"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

When we were down one we kept two strikers...and that is an act of courage that was rewarded,\" he said.\n\nThe celebrations were marred by ugly scenes in the stands will concern organizers CONMEBOL ahead of a final which is sure to attract huge numbers of Argentines as well as Colombians. -- AFP", "source": {"uri": "malaymail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Malay Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Rodr\u00edguez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "James Rodr\u00edguez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Lerma", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson Lerma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_D\u00edaz_(footballer,_born_1997)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis D\u00edaz (footballer, born 1997)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ejection (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Rochet", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Rochet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N\u00e9stor_Araujo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "N\u00e9stor Araujo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigo_Bentancur", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rodrigo Bentancur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Valverde", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federico Valverde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Ugarte_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Ugarte (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgian_de_Arrascaeta", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giorgian de Arrascaeta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mateus_Uribe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mateus Uribe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_Bielsa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcelo Bielsa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONMEBOL", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CONMEBOL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.malaymail.com/malaymail/uploads/images/2024/07/11/thumbs/400x400/222925.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723292", "eventUri": "eng-9723292", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 7, "textEnd": 14}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

We had to stand up for our loved ones\"\n\nThose were the pleas of defender Jose Maria Gimenez postgame, who witnessed family members of La Celeste, Uruguay players themselves, Colombia fans and organizers scuffle in the stands for more than 10 minutes.\n\nMoments after Colombia closed out a 1-0 victory over Uruguay in the Copa America semifinals in Miami, it all went to chaos. An altercation broke out in the stands that included striker Darwin Nunez, defender Ronald Araujo and others clashing with fans.\n\nVideo replays showed that punches were thrown, objects were tossed and people were struck. It was a dangerous and unsettling scene. And one that marred what has been a damn good game.\n\nColombia showed an incredible amount of heart while down a man, outlasting Uruguay to earn that 1-0 win that sent them to the Copa America final. But what happened post-match certainly dampened what happened during the game.\n\nNunez, Araujo and a several other players could face ramifications, especially after a brawl that seemed to snowball. A video showed N\u00fa\u00f1ez hitting a fan in Colombia team colors, and according to the Associated Press, it took more than 10 minutes for police to restore order. The public address announcer asked for fans to leave the stadium, but several supporters remained.\n\nAbout 100 Uruguayan fans and members of the federation staff remained on the field more than 20 minutes after the game, while Colombia fans made their way out to celebrate.\n\nSouth American football's governing body CONMEBOL, which organizes Copa America, said it is investigating the incident.\n\n\"I thought that the incident ended with some argument on the midfield and when I saw that happening I went to the locker room,\" Uruguay coach Marcelo Bielsa said in a press conference. \"I thought that they were thanking the fans for their support. But then I learned that there were some problems over there unfortunately.\"\n\nEventually, the focus will return to soccer, and the upcoming clash between Colombia and Argentina with a trophy on the line. Maybe that match will be good enough to establish itself as the defining moment of this tournament, but perhaps not. That unfortunately will probably be Wednesday night's melee.\n\nIt wasn't supposed to be that way, and it didn't have to be.

Colombia is headed to the Copa America championship game for the first time in 23 years after a contentious win over Uruguay in which it played the second half a man short and players brawled with fans in the stands following the final whistle.\n\nCharlotte (North Carolina), Jul 11 (AP) Colombia is headed to the Copa America championship game for the first time in 23 years after a contentious win over Uruguay in which it played the second half a man short and players brawled with fans in the stands following the final whistle.\n\nJefferson Lerma scored in the 39th minute for a 1-0 win Wednesday night and a matchup with Lionel Messi and defending champion Argentina on Sunday.\n\nAlso Read | Jefferson Lerma's Header Powers Colombia to 1-0 Win Over Uruguay, Seals Date With Argentina in Copa America 2024 Final.\n\n\"Until you overcome your weaknesses you cannot grow,\" Colombia coach Nester Lorenzo said through a interpreter. \"And when you overcome those obstacles you can grow.\"\n\nDaniel Mu\u00f1oz was ejected in first-half stoppage time for an elbow that led to his second yellow card. Despite Uruguay having 61.9% possession, Colombia held on to reach the championship for the first time since winning its only Copa title as host in 2001.\n\nAlso Read | UEFA Euro 2024: Ollie Watkins' Late Goal Put England Into Final After Beating Netherlands 2-1.\n\nColombia extended its unbeaten streak to a team record 28 games, one more than from 1992-94 and the longest current streak in men's international soccer.\n\n\"They are very hungry as players and very eager and they really add many elements to their game beyond the tactical side,\" Lorenzo said.\n\nIn a match that included seven yellow cards in addition to the red, players from both teams pushed and shoved in a scrum on the field at the final whistle. Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez and about a dozen Uruguay teammates went into the stands as fans brawled.\n\nA video showed N\u00fa\u00f1ez hitting a fan in Colombian team colors.\n\nDefending champion Argentina and Colombia meet at Miami Gardens, Florida, in the tournament finale. The Albiceleste are seeking a record 16th Copa title and are looking to join Spain from 2008-12 as the only countries to win three straight major championships.\n\nUruguay stays in Charlotte to meet Canada in Saturday night's third-place match.\n\nBefore an overwhelmingly pro-Colombia crowd of 70,644 that filled Bank of America Stadium with yellow jerseys and flags, Uruguay fell behind for the first time in the tournament.\n\nJames Rodr\u00edguez's corner kick was headed in from short range by Lerma, who outjumped Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez for his third international goal and second of the tournament. Rodr\u00edguez has six assists in the tournament -- triple the total of any other player.\n\nMu\u00f1oz received his first yellow card from Mexican referee C\u00e9sar Ramos in the 31st minute for a reckless slide tackle on Maximiliano Ara\u00fajo and his second for elbowing Manuel Ugarte in the stomach.\n\nRodr\u00edguez was given a yellow card in the 55th minute for arguing with Ramos when the referee failed to stop play after Richard R\u00edos was kicked on a shin by Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez.\n\nR\u00edos was removed on a stretcher, re-entered the match, then went down in another challenge and was substituted in the 62nd minute. Rodr\u00edguez was removed at the same time to keep him eligible for the final.\n\nColombia goalkeeper Camilo Vargas didn't have to make his first save until he stopped Nicol\u00e1s de la Cruz in the 68th minute.\n\nLuis Su\u00e1rez, Uruguay's career leader with 68 goals, entered in the 66th minute and hit the outside of a post with a shot in the 71st. He grasped his head in his hands in disgust.\n\n\"The moments in which we could unbalance the game, we did not succeed,\" Uruguay coach Marcelo Bielsa said. \"We should have generated more goal situations than we did.\"\n\nColombia's Mateus Uribe, another second-half sub, put an open shot wide in the 88th, and Uribe's open shot in the fourth minute of stoppage time ricocheted off the body of sliding goalkeeper Sergio Rochet and then the crossbar.\n\nUruguay moved Rochet up to the attacking half of the field in the final minute, desperate for a goal.\n\nThe match was played in 90-degree heat on a surface that was converted from artificial turf to grass in the weeks leading up the game.\n\nPlayers on the NFL's Carolina Panthers have been outspoken about soccer teams having the luxury of playing on grass on their home field. Players say NFL games on artificial turf leave them more susceptible to injuries.\n\nWith two games left, attendance of 1.48 million is just 1,663 shy of the total for the 2016 tournament in the United States.

We had to go and defend our own just because they can't control their drinking,' he said.\n\nDarwin Nunez entered the stands and began fighting fans after Uruguay lost to Colombia\n\nRonald Araujo

When we were down one we kept two strikers...and that is an act of courage that was rewarded,\" he said.\n\nThe celebrations were marred by ugly scenes in the stands will concern organizers CONMEBOL

Colombia appeared more likely to create the first big chance, but it was Uruguay's Darwin Nunez who came close.\n\nNunez battled past multiple Colombian defenders in the penalty area and unleashed a powerful shot to the bottom left corner, narrowly missing. Despite several chances, the Uruguayan striker couldn't score.\n\nAfter losing center back Ronald Araujo to injury against Brazil, Uruguay suffered another blow as Rodrigo Bentancur went off injured in the 35th minute with Guillermo Varela replacing him.\n\nIn the 40th minute, Colombia finally broke through as James Rodriguez's set-piece delivery leading to a headed goal. Rodriguez's whipped corner found Jefferson Lerma, who powered it into Rochet's near post.\n\nThis goal marked a milestone for Colombia's captain, as he broke Lionel Messi's record for the most assists in a single tournament edition with his sixth, giving Colombia the lead in the semifinal.\n\nIn the 45th minute, the match shifted as Daniel Munoz received a second yellow card, reducing Colombia to 10 men just before halftime.\n\nBy the 70th minute, the game became increasingly stretched.

This will be their third time reaching the final (1975, 2001).\n\nColombia has booked their place in the Copa America 2024 final after a dramatic 1-0 victory over Uruguay in a tense semifinal clash at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte.\n\nColombia took the lead in the 39th minute through a well-worked corner. James Rodr\u00edguez, in a moment of brilliance, delivered a pinpoint cross that found Jefferson Lerma's head.\n\nThe midfielder's powerful header gave Uruguay's goalkeeper no chance, sending the Colombian fans in the 70,644 strong crowd into a frenzy.\n\nJust before halftime, the momentum shifted when Colombian defender Daniel Munoz was shown a second yellow card, reducing his team to 10 men. This setback could have easily derailed Colombia's dream run, but they showed remarkable resilience.\n\nColombia's defense stood firm throughout the second half, repelling numerous Uruguayan attacks. Despite going down a man, they remained disciplined and frustrated Uruguay's attempts to find an equalizer.\n\nThe Colombians also had their chances to extend their lead. Midfielder Mateus Uribe saw two golden opportunities go begging in the latter stages of the match, much to the disappointment of the Colombian faithful.\n\nUruguay, on the other hand, continued their struggles in front of goal. Their star striker Darwin Nunez failed to convert any of his four shots in the first half, while Jose Gimenez also spurned two chances in the second. Uruguay, who haven't scored in their last two games, couldn't break Colombia's resolute defense.\n\nWith the final whistle, Colombia erupted in celebration. This victory extends their unbeaten streak to a staggering 28 games. They now face a gargantuan challenge in the final - Lionel Messi's Argentina, the reigning Copa America and World Cup champions.

The heated match ended with chaotic scenes extending into the stands rivaling the notorious Malice in the Palace.\n\nChaos erupted postgame in Charlotte as several Uruguay players stormed into the stands at Bank of America Stadium and clashed with Colombian fans.\n\nIn a match marked by seven yellow cards and one red, players from both sides engaged in a scrum on the field at the final whistle. Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez and around a dozen of his Uruguay teammates went into the stands, where fans were brawling. A video captured N\u00fa\u00f1ez striking a fan wearing Colombian team colors.\n\nThe cause of the Uruguay, Colombia brawl\n\nUruguay's Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez addressed the broadcast after the altercation, alleging that the brawl was triggered by harassment of Uruguay players' families by a group of Colombian fans.\n\nThe violence followed a frustrating defeat for Uruguay, which was competing for a spot in the final to challenge Argentina for its first Copa Am\u00e9rica title since 2011. Instead, Uruguay will face Canada in the third-place game on Saturday, likely without several players due to impending disciplinary actions stemming from the brawl.\n\nHours before kickoff, the downtown streets of North Carolina were bustling with enthusiastic fans in vibrant yellow Colombia jerseys.\n\nFans were quick to react on X(formerly Twitter) after witnessing the brawl:\n\nOne user @onegiordano wrote: \"Shameful, totally unprofessional... @CopaAmerica\"\n\nAnother user, @ugartesgf seemed to be on the side of Uruguay stating, \"THEY WERE DEFENDING THEIR KIDS. THEIR FAMILY\"\n\nWhile @soulistaken said, \"Colombia winning on and off the field\"\n\nOne goal was enough for Jefferson Lerma and Colombia\n\nUruguay, was expected to overcome Colombia in the semifinal, but faltered in the 40th minute when Jefferson Lerma headed in a stunning corner kick from James Rodriguez.\n\nTheir chances of mounting a comeback were boosted early in the second half when Colombia's Daniel Mu\u00f1oz fouled Manuel Ugarte, resulting in a second yellow card and reducing his team to 10 men against Uruguay's 11.\n\nMu\u00f1oz was booked twice by Mexican referee C\u00e9sar Ramos during the match. His first yellow card came in the 31st minute for a reckless slide tackle on Maximiliano Ara\u00fajo, and his second was issued for elbowing Manuel Ugarte in the stomach.\n\nRodr\u00edguez received a yellow card in the 55th minute for disputing with Ramos when the referee did not stop play after Richard R\u00edos was kicked on the shin by Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez.\n\nR\u00edos was taken off on a stretcher, returned to the match, then went down again in another challenge and was substituted in the 62nd minute. Rodr\u00edguez was also substituted at the same time to ensure he remained eligible for the final.\n\nUruguay's near misses\n\nUruguay's all-time leading goal scorer, Luis Su\u00e1rez, came on as a substitute in the 66th minute and struck the outside of the post with a shot in the 71st minute.\n\nColombian goalkeeper Camilo Vargas didn't face his first shot on goal until he saved Nicol\u00e1s de la Cruz's attempt in the 68th minute.\n\nColombia's Mateus Uribe, who came on as a second-half substitute, missed an open shot wide in the 88th minute. Then, in the fourth minute of stoppage time, Uribe's attempt struck the body of sliding goalkeeper Sergio Rochet and deflected off the crossbar.\n\nThe game took place in 90-degree heat on a field that had been converted from artificial turf to grass in the weeks leading up to the match.\n\nDefending champions Argentina will face Colombia on Sunday night in Miami Gardens, Florida. La Albiceleste are aiming for a record 16th Copa America title and hope to become only the second country, after Spain from 2008 to 2012, to win three consecutive major championships.", "source":

Among domestic attendees, 54% traveled from outside the Carolinas.\n\nTwo of those supporters were Lucia Lopez and Agustin Aguerre -- a mother and son who were born in Uruguay and traveled from their homes in Washington, D.C., and New York to watch Wednesday's semifinal.\n\nBoth have seen plenty of Uruguay matches -- Aguerre was at La Celeste's last Copa America triumph in 2011 -- but haven't been able to go to a game together since Aguerre was little. After Uruguay topped Brazil in penalty kicks in Saturday's quarterfinal, the two bought tickets and flew to meet up in Charlotte.\n\n\"There were about 20 Colombians for every Uruguayan (at the airport),\" Aguerre said.\n\nA stadium that was largely clad in yellow celebrated the game's only goal. Former Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Everton star James Rodriguez swung in a corner kick that found the head of Lerma, who powered the ball into the back of the net to give Colombia a 1-0 lead in the 39th minute.\n\nThe goal was met by a roar from Colombia fans, including a family with three generations in attendance.\n\nEdgar Ayerbe Sr., his son Edgar Ayerbe Jr. and daughter in-law Jeannette Ayerbe as well as their sons, Alex and Max Ayerbe, drove down from Raleigh for the historic game. Ayerbe Sr., who was born in Cali, Colombia, estimates he's been to between 15 and 20 Colombia matches in his lifetime and got to accompany his grandsons for their first Colombia game.\n\n\"Yeah I know, but it wasn't like this, it wasn't like this,\" he responded -- with the noise of drums, horns and chants from both sets of supporters behind him.\n\nEdgar Sr.'s nephew, Dani Sandoval, was also in attendance, unsurprisingly.\n\nHe's followed Colombia to every game this tournament with Parceros United, an organization and brand that hosts events and parties for Colombia fans before games in different cities. Sandoval, who was born in Colombia and moved to the U.S. at age 12, and a partner started the organization after he followed Los Cafeteros in Russia at the 2018 World Cup.\n\nDespite Colombia having the better of the play and taking the lead after Lerma's goal, a majority of the stadium became much more nervous minutes later when Colombia went down to 10 men after Daniel Munoz's second yellow card.\n\nEven in a tense second half in which Uruguay created chances to equalize, Colombia held on in front of a crowd of raucous supporters in Charlotte to extend its unbeaten run to a record 28 games -- a streak that spans back to March 2022. After the final whistle, Uruguay and Liverpool forward Darwin Nunez jumped into the stands and exchanged punches with fans.\n\nDespite the ugly scenes after the game ended, Colombia will get a chance to earn its second Copa America title -- its only previous triumph came in 2001 -- against Lionel Messi and Argentina on Sunday in Miami. Their passionate fans that descended on Charlotte will surely follow them.", "source": {"uri": "charlotteobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Charlotte Observer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

defeat Uruguay 1-0 to reach Copa America final", "body": "Ten-man Colombia defeated Uruguay 1-0 to reach the final of the Copa America for the first time in 23 years after an ill-tempered semi-final on Wednesday.\n\nA 39th-minute Jefferson Lerma header sealed victory for the Colombians, who will now face holders Argentina in Sunday's final in Miami.\n\nIt was an anarchic semi-final played in front of a packed and passionate crowd which ended with scuffles on the field and fighting in the stands, including several players who had climbed in among supporters amid the flying punches.\n\nColombia, despite having Daniel Munoz sent off just before the interval and facing plenty of Uruguay pressure, hung on for a famous victory to the delight of their massive following of fans.\n\nThe downtown streets of the North Carolina city were packed with partying fans in bright yellow Colombia jerseys hours before the kick-off.\n\nInside the 74,800 capacity Bank of America Stadium, it was like a home game in Bogota with only pockets of Uruguayan supporters breaking up the wall of yellow on all four sides of the venue.\n\nNot surprisingly in such an atmosphere, Colombia started strongly with their livewire Liverpool winger Luis Diaz doing well to wriggle some space for a cross on the left, finding Daniel Munoz at the back post but the full-back's header was off target.\n\nUruguay were, as always, a threat on the counter-attack and their Liverpool star, Darwin Nunez, was close to finishing off one break when Rodrigo Bentancur found him with a clever pass but the forward poked his shot wide.\n\nNunez had another opening when Maximiliano Araujo played him clear in the inside-right channel but the striker rushed his shot, blasting high and wide.\n\nAt the other end, Colombia forced a turnover which led to James Rodriguez curling in a cross from the right but Jhon Cordoba's header was off target.\n\n- Lerma breakthrough -\n\nThe breakthrough came in the 39th minute when Lerma rose majestically above Jose Maria Gimenez and powerfully headed home Rodriguez's corner.\n\nMore from this section Tory leadership hopeful wants Boris Johnson to return - but has harsh words for Farage Parkside Drive residents calling on city to make their street safer Defiant Biden throws down gauntlet to Democrats\n\nIt was the sixth assist of the tournament for Rodriguez with the former Real Madrid midfielder beating the record for most assists in a single Copa, which was set by Lionel Messi in 2021.\n\nColombia looked to make the most of their momentum with Richard Rios forcing a save out of Uruguay keeper Sergio Rochet, after being played in by Munoz.\n\nBut having been so influential down the right in the opening half, Munoz lost his head completely, just before the break, picking up a second yellow card, after landing an elbow on Manuel Ugarte.\n\nIt was a moment of madness which left Colombia to defend their lead with just 10 men for the entire second half.\n\nColombia coach Nestor Lorenzo took off Rodriguez, who was also on a yellow card, in the 62nd minute as Uruguay gradually began to turn their numerical advantage into real pressure.\n\nNicolas de la Cruz threatened with a low drive before substitute Luis Suarez clipped the outside of the post with a drive from the edge of the box after good work from Federico Valverde.\n\nValverde, the Real Madrid midfielder, then went close himself with a low drive as Colombia's back-line continued to ride their luck.\n\nGiveaway from Uruguay keeper and fell to Mateus Uribe, who despite time and space placed his shot wide of the post.\n\nIn stoppage time Uruguay had a great chance to force penalties when Nunez laid the ball off to substitute Giorgian de Arrascaeta on the edge of the box but he leaned back and put his shot over the bar.\n\nThere was still time for Uribe to waste another chance to make sure of the win, this time hitting the bar in the final minute, but he will be forgiven his wastefulness by the delirious Colombian supporters.\n\nThe celebrations were marred by ugly scenes in the stands will concern organizers CONMEBOL ahead of a final which is sure to attract huge numbers of Argentines as well as Colombians.\n\nsev/rcw", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nUruguay's forward Darwin Nunez was embroiled in a fiery brawl as punches were exchanged between the Liverpool ace and spectators after his nation was ousted from the Copa America by Colombia.\n\nThe tension escalated between the two countries following the final whistle, with Colombia narrowly securing a 1-0 victory courtesy of Jefferson Lerma's header in the 39th minute. Once the on-pitch scuffle subsided, the Uruguay players headed towards the stands.\n\nNunez spearheaded a group of Uruguay players into the crowd before hostility erupted from Colombian fans, leading to a large-scale fight between the players and the supporters. After being struck by a fan, Nunez was seen defending himself, with footage revealing him retaliating against several spectators.\n\nREAD MORE:Everything Craig Bellamy said in first Wales press conference as he lays out what he expects\n\nREAD MORE: 'Forget about formations!' Inside Craig Bellamy's first public appearance as Wales boss\n\nLater, the Liverpool star was spotted embracing his young son on the pitch, who might have been involved in the chaotic scenes. Barcelona's Ronald Araujo was also part of the incident, with thousands of shocked fans capturing the altercation on their mobile phones.\n\nSecurity personnel intervened to separate the two groups, attempting to escort the Uruguay players to the dressing room as swiftly as possible, reports the Mirror.\n\nAs reported by Uruguayan publication El Pais, the Uruguay players ventured into the crowd to back their family and friends who were seated just behind the team bench. With a significant majority of Colombian fans inside the stadium, the relatives of Uruguay stars were subjected to abuse.\n\nNunez spearheaded the charge of players into the stands as their family and friends were ushered onto the pitch for safety. The situation quickly deteriorated, becoming physical.\n\nUruguay national team director Jorge Giordano and press officer Felipe Cotelo found themselves embroiled in the chaos.\n\nThe report also mentioned that Uruguay midfielder Manuel Ugarte tended to his injured relatives on the field. Several Uruguayan supporters sustained serious injuries during the melee, finding themselves overwhelmed by the larger group of Colombian fans.\n\nUruguay's defender Jose Maria Gimenez recounted the ordeal, labelling it a \"disaster\" due to the absence of police. \"It was a disaster; there was no police and we had to defend our families,\" he expressed.\n\nGimenez further criticised the situation, attributing the violence to a minority of overzealous fans. \"This is because of two or three who have one drink too many. A certain sector of the Colombian fans made an avalanche where our loved ones were,\" he elaborated.\n\nIn light of these events, governing body CONMEBOL is set to conduct a thorough review before Sunday's Copa America final, which sees Colombia facing off against Argentina in Miami. Despite being on an impressive 28-game unbeaten streak, spanning more than two years, Colombia will play as underdogs to Argentina.\n\nArgentina are on the hunt for a third consecutive trophy, following Lionel Messi's triumphs in the Copa America 2021 and the World Cup a year later. Prior to 2021, Messi had not won an international trophy, but now he has the opportunity to further cement his legacy this Sunday in his new home city, having signed with MLS team Inter Miami last year.", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mathew_davies@walesonline.co.uk", "name": "Mathew Davies", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Bellamy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Craig Bellamy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Lerma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson Lerma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Ara\u00fajo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Ara\u00fajo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Pa\u00eds", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "El Pa\u00eds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Ugarte_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Ugarte (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Giordano", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jorge Giordano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONMEBOL", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CONMEBOL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/article29518891.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_gettyimages-2161557367.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723292", "eventUri": "eng-9723292", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Lerma header sealed victory for the Colombians, who will now face defending Copa America champions Argentina in Sunday's final in Miami.\n\nIt was an anarchic semi-final played in front of a packed and passionate crowd which ended with scuffles on the field and fighting in the stands, including several players who had climbed in among supporters amid the flying punches.\n\nColombia, despite having Daniel Munoz sent off just before the interval and facing plenty of Uruguay pressure, hung on for a famous victory to the delight of their massive following of fans.\n\nThe win was the 28th game without defeat for Colombia, setting a new record for the team.\n\nThe downtown streets of the North Carolina city were packed with partying fans in bright yellow Colombia jerseys hours before the kick-off.\n\nNot surprisingly in such an atmosphere, Colombia started strongly with their livewire Liverpool winger Luis Diaz doing well to wriggle some space for a cross on the left, finding Daniel Munoz at the back post but the full-back's header was off target.\n\nUruguay were, as always, a threat on the counter-attack and their Liverpool star, Darwin Nunez was close to finishing off one break when Rodr Bentancur found him with a clever pass but the forward poked his shot wide.\n\nNunez had another opening when Maximiliano Araujo played him clear in the inside-right channel but the striker rushed his shot, blasting high and wide.\n\nAt the other end, Colombia forced a turnover which led to James Rodriguez curling in a cross from the right but Jhon Cordoba's header was off target.\n\nThe breakthrough came in the 39th minute when Lerma rose majestically above Jose Maria Gimenez and powerfully headed home Rodriguez's corner.\n\nIt was the sixth assist of the tournament for Rodriguez with the former Real Madrid midfielder beating the record for most assists in a single Copa, which was set by Lionel Messi in 2021.\n\nColombia looked to make the most of their momentum

(AP) -- Colombia is headed to the Copa America championship game for the first time in 23 years after a contentious win over Uruguay in which it played the second half a man short and players brawled with fans in the stands following the final whistle.\n\nJefferson Lerma scored in the 39th minute for a 1-0 win Wednesday night and a matchup with Lionel Messi and defending champion Argentina on Sunday.\n\n\"Until you overcome your weaknesses you cannot grow,\" Colombia coach Nester Lorenzo said through a interpreter. \"And when you overcome those obstacles you can grow.\"\n\nDaniel Mu\u00f1oz was ejected in first-half stoppage time for an elbow that led to his second yellow card. Despite Uruguay having 61.9% possession, Colombia held on to reach the championship for the first time since winning its only Copa title as host in 2001.\n\nColombia extended its unbeaten streak to a team record 28 games, one more than from 1992-94 and the longest current streak in men's international soccer.\n\n\"They are very hungry as players and very eager and they really add many elements to their game beyond the tactical side,\" Lorenzo said.\n\nIn a match that included seven yellow cards in addition to the red, players from both teams pushed and shoved in a scrum on the field at the final whistle. Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez and about a dozen Uruguay teammates went into the stands as fans brawled.\n\nA video showed N\u00fa\u00f1ez hitting a fan in Colombian team colors.\n\nCONMEBOL released a statement after the game saying that it strongly condemns any act of violence that affects the game.\n\n\"Our work is based on the conviction that soccer connects and unites us through its positive values,\" the organization said. \"There is no place for intolerance and violence on and off the field. We invite everyone in the remaining days to pour all of their passion into cheering on their national teams and having an unforgettable party.\"\n\nDefending champion Argentina and Colombia meet at Miami Gardens, Florida, in the tournament finale. The Albiceleste are seeking a record 16th Copa title and are looking to join Spain from 2008-12 as the only countries to win three straight major championships.\n\nUruguay stays in Charlotte to meet Canada in Saturday night's third-place match.\n\nBefore an overwhelmingly pro-Colombia crowd of 70,644 that filled Bank of America Stadium with yellow jerseys and flags, Uruguay fell behind for the first time in the tournament.\n\nJames Rodr\u00edguez's corner kick was headed in from short range by Lerma, who outjumped Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez for his third international goal and second of the tournament. Rodr\u00edguez has six assists in the tournament -- triple the total of any other player.\n\nMu\u00f1oz received his first yellow card from Mexican referee C\u00e9sar Ramos in the 31st minute for a reckless slide tackle on Maximiliano Ara\u00fajo and his second for elbowing Manuel Ugarte in the stomach.\n\nRodr\u00edguez was given a yellow card in the 55th minute for arguing with Ramos when the referee failed to stop play after Richard R\u00edos was kicked on a shin by Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez.\n\nR\u00edos was removed on a stretcher, re-entered the match, then went down in another challenge and was substituted in the 62nd minute. Rodr\u00edguez was removed at the same time to keep him eligible for the final.\n\nColombia goalkeeper Camilo Vargas didn't have to make his first save until he stopped Nicol\u00e1s de la Cruz in the 68th minute.\n\nLuis Su\u00e1rez, Uruguay's career leader with 68 goals, entered in the 66th minute and hit the outside of a post with a shot in the 71st. He grasped his head in his hands in disgust.\n\n\"The moments in which we could unbalance the game, we did not succeed,\" Uruguay coach Marcelo Bielsa said. \"We should have generated more goal situations than we did.\"\n\nColombia's Mateus Uribe, another second-half sub, put an open shot wide in the 88th, and Uribe's open shot in the fourth minute of stoppage time ricocheted off the body of sliding goalkeeper Sergio Rochet and then the crossbar.\n\nUruguay moved Rochet up to the attacking half of the field in the final minute, desperate for a goal.\n\nThe match was played in 90-degree heat on a surface that was converted from artificial turf to grass in the weeks leading up the game.\n\nPlayers on the NFL's Carolina Panthers have been outspoken about soccer teams having the luxury of playing on grass on their home field. Players say NFL games on artificial turf leave them more susceptible to injuries.\n\nWith two games left, attendance of 1.48 million is just 1,663 shy of the total for the 2016 tournament in the

Liverpool also plans to speak with the UFF before making any decision on the matter, ESPN is reporting. The team also wants to check on Nunez's wellbeing in addition to his family's.\n\nUruguayan newspaper El Pais reported that Nunez jumped into the stands to confront Colombian supporters whom he believed posed a threat to his family and the families of his teammates. Nunez attempted to launch a chair into the crowd at one point, but was thwarted by a security guard.\n\nNunez as well as teammates Jose Gimenez and Ronald Araujo battled with Colombian fans while Tottenham midfielder Rodrigo Betancur was seen throwing two bottles into he crowd - one of which hit a Uruguayan staffer.\n\nThere is some concern that Nunez could face a lengthy ban from South American football's governing body, CONMEBOL. What's more, FIFA has the ability to issue a world-wide ban, which would impact Nunez's 2024-25 season with Liverpool.\n\nLiverpool FC officials plan to hold immediate talks with Darwin Nunez (center) after the brawl\n\nRead More Darwin Nunez may face a lengthy BAN after violent clashes with Colombia fans\n\nNunez and about a dozen Uruguay teammates went into the stands as fans brawled at Bank of America Stadium following a 1-0 loss to Colombia in a Copa America semifinal on Wednesday night.\n\nAfter a physical and contentious match, a melee broke out behind the Uruguay bench after Mexican referee C\u00e9sar Ramos' final whistle.\n\nThe crowd of 70,644 was about 90% in favor in Colombia, but a small patch of Uruguay fans fought with Colombia supporters as beverages were thrown.\n\nN\u00fa\u00f1ez and teammates then climbed a staircase into the crowd. A video showed N\u00fa\u00f1ez hitting a fan in Colombian team colors.\n\nGimenez said players went in the crowd to protect their families.\n\n'This is a disaster. Our family is in danger. We had to get into the stands to take out our loved ones with small babies, newborns,' he told TUDN. 'Everything was a disaster. There was not a single police officer.'\n\nIt took more than 10 minutes for police to arrive on the scene and to restore order. The public address announcer asked for fans to leave the stadium, but several supporters remained.\n\nAbout 100 Uruguayan fans and members of the federation staff remained on the field for their own protection more than 20 minutes after the game, while Colombia fans made their way out to celebrate.\n\nCONMEBOL released a statement after the game saying that it strongly condemns any act of violence that affects the game.\n\n'Our work is based on the conviction that soccer connects and unites us through its positive values,' the organization said.

The match took place at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, N.C., and things took an ugly turn after the full-time whistle sounded.\n\nA number of Uruguay players entered the stands and began fighting with Colombia's fans, going through a connecting stairwell that led up from the pitch. Here is the video that was shown on the FOX television broadcast.\n\nUruguay's Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez, who plays at the club level for England's Liverpool F.C., was at the forefront of the altercation. N\u00fa\u00f1ez had taken off his jersey at that point but could easily be recognized by his distinctive man bun. Take a look at another video angle from the stands, which showed Colombia fans hurling trash and liquids at the Uruguay players, who responded by throwing punches.\n\nAn additional angle aired on local television showed N\u00fa\u00f1ez squaring up to fight (and then eating a shot to the dome).\n\nThe semifinal match was a contentious affair that saw Colombia go down to 10 men late during the first half after Daniel Mu\u00f1oz was sent off for violently elbowing Uruguay's Manuel Ugarte. Mu\u00f1oz had already gotten a yellow card earlier in the match and drew a second yellow with the elbow, triggering a red card and an automatic ejection.\n\nFour other yellow cards were shown between the two teams during the contest, and hostilities continued after the final whistle too. Players from both Uruguay and Colombia were seen exchanging shoves in a postgame scrum at midfield that was seemingly initiated by Uruguay forward Luis Suarez (who has a long history of issues with opponents).\n\nColombia now advances to play Argentina on Sunday in what will be their first Copa America final appearance since they won the whole thing back in 2001. Colombia also extended their national team's undefeated streak to a very impressive 28 matches. But their victory over Uruguay on Wednesday may end up getting overshadowed by the ugly melee between players and fans that took place in the stands afterwards.", "source": {"uri": "larrybrownsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Larry Brown Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darryn_albert@larrybrownsports.com", "name": "Darryn Albert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_N\u00fa\u00f1ez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whistle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hurling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Ugarte_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Ugarte (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ejection (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/uruguay-colombia-fans-fight.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723292", "eventUri": "eng-9723292", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

You don't want your city mentioned as the dateline on coverage of an international sporting controversy, but here we are.\n\nWas there enough security at the stadium? Were the Uruguayan family members really in imminent danger, as a Uruguayan player would claim later on the official TV broadcast? Could all of this have been avoided? Those are the questions that will be wrestled with in the coming hours and days, and the questions that will sully what otherwise was a spectacular summer night of soccer, with Colombia upsetting Uruguay, 1-0, in one of the biggest soccer matches Charlotte has hosted. By winning, Colombia earned a spot in the Copa America final Sunday against Argentina.\n\nThis result delighted the near-sellout crowd of 70,644 fans at Bank of America Stadium, which was mostly clad in yellow and blue and appeared to be about 90% in favor of Colombia. Throughout the game -- actually, throughout this overly physical Copa tournament -- tempers flared and yellow cards were issued. After the game, there were some arguments on the field between the players.\n\nBut all of that was sort of normal. What brought this incident into the abnormal was what looked like -- from social media and Fox Soccer videos -- close to a dozen Uruguayan teammates going into the stands. This happens so rarely in sports that when it does, documentaries sometimes get made about it (see \"Malice in the Palace,\" the infamous NBA player/fan brawl between Detroit and Indiana in 2004.)\n\nUruguay is contending that its players believed their family members -- who were indeed surrounded by thousands of rowdy Colombian fans celebrating a victory -- were in danger. That's purportedly why what is usually a sacrosanct line -- the one between players and fans -- was breached.\n\nIn an impassioned interview with the official TV broadcast that was translated from Spanish and posted to X by the @FoxSoccer account, Uruguay captain Jose Maria Gimenez said in part: \"They stormed all our families, a certain sector of Colombian fans. They don't want me to say anything about what's going on, but this is a disaster. This is a disaster.\n\n\"Our family is in danger,\" Gimenez continued. \"We had to get on top of the stands ASAP to rescue our loved ones with newborn babies. It was a disaster. There was not a single policeman. ... And we were there facing the consequences for our people. Those who are organizing this (need to be) a little more careful with the families and with the people around the stadiums. Our families are suffering because of some who drink one or two shots of alcohol; who don't know how to drink; who behave like children.\"\n\nFortunately, everyone who walks into Bank of America stadium goes through some sort of metal detector. What happened Wednesday was seemingly confined to fisticuffs and thrown drinks. Any injuries likely will be minor.\n\nBut it's not a good look. The game had already been contentious, with Colombia's Daniel Munoz sent off for getting two yellow cards in the same contest. That left Colombia down one man for the entire second half. But Colombia held off Uruguay, made a first-half goal stand up and won anyway. Then came the brief disagreements and arguments on the field after the final whistle.\n\nAnd then, the fight in the stands.\n\nVideos appear to show some security people trying to get to the altercation that included Uruguayan star forward Darwin Nunez, but having difficulty due to crowded aisles and people leaning in trying to videotape or watch the fight. Stadium officials weren't immediately available for comment.\n\nUruguay still has another game to play in Charlotte, too. Because of the loss, Uruguay will play Canada on Saturday at Bank of America Stadium in the third-place game.\n\nSuspensions from the Copa America organization -- which sustained a black eye here, too -- would certainly seem likely. The tournament's governing body is called CONMEBOL and issued a milquetoast statement after that said \"CONMEBOL strongly condemns any act of violence that affects football\" and not much else.\n\nAfter the inevitable suspensions, I wonder if Uruguay will even have enough players to field a team against Canada.\n\nIn any case, it was a good night for a while for soccer, and for Charlotte.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(punishment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suspension (punishment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Soccer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ejection (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotape", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Videotape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONMEBOL", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CONMEBOL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin,_Northern_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/charlotte_observer_mcclatchy_513/542cc27b1e99f59d36b5c00dfef5cfc1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723292", "eventUri": "eng-9723292", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

The match ended with chaotic scenes on and off the pitch.\n\nThe game's only goal came from Jefferson Lerma, who scored six minutes before halftime. Despite Colombia being reduced to ten men, Uruguay couldn't find an equalizer, leaving the players and fans deeply disappointed. The final whistle marked the beginning of more troubles as emotions ran high.\n\nChaos in the stands\n\nAfter the match, the situation escalated as Uruguay's star player, Darwin Nunez, became involved in a brawl. Nunez and other players climbed into the stands to confront Colombian supporters. This confrontation quickly turned violent, with players, officials, and supporters getting into physical altercations. Nunez himself was caught by a punch during the melee.\n\nThe trouble started when friends and family members of the Uruguayan team, who were sitting behind the team benches, were targeted by some Colombian fans. Uruguay captain Jose Maria Gimenez spoke to reporters about the lack of security at the stadium. He expressed his frustration, saying, \"It was a disaster; there was no police, and we had to defend our families. This is because of two or three who have one drink too many. A certain sector of the Colombian fans made an avalanche where our loved ones were.\"\n\nThe chaos left many Uruguayan players and staff shaken. Nunez, visibly upset, managed to bring his family to the safety of the pitch. He was seen hugging his son on the field, a poignant moment highlighting the distress caused by the incident. Other Uruguayan players and staff were also reported to have been punched and kicked during the chaos. The situation now awaits an official response from CONMEBOL, the governing body for South American football.\n\nThe aftermath of the match raised significant concerns about security at the stadium and the behavior of some fans. The lack of police presence and the inability to control the crowd led to dangerous situations for the players and their families. Uruguay's experience serves as a reminder of the need for better security measures at football matches to protect everyone involved.\n\nEmotional impact on Uruguay players and families\n\nThe emotional toll on the players and their families was significant. Nunez, who had to console his young son on the field, represented the distress felt by many. The sight of a professional athlete, known for his strength and resilience, showing vulnerability publicly struck a chord with many fans and observers. It underscored the fact that football players, despite their fame and prowess on the field, are human beings with families and loved ones who can be deeply affected by such incidents.\n\nThe violence also brought into focus the behavior of a small but disruptive group of fans who can tarnish the reputation of the sport. Football is meant to bring people together, fostering a sense of community and shared passion. However, when that passion turns into aggression, it creates an unsafe environment that detracts from the joy of the game.\n\nThe incident will likely be a topic of discussion for a long time, not only because of its impact on the current Copa America tournament but also because of its implications for future events. Authorities will need to implement stricter security measures and take decisive action against those who incite violence. This will help ensure that football remains a sport where players can perform, and families can enjoy the game without fear.\n\nFor now, Uruguay must regroup and focus on their upcoming challenges. The players will need to support each other and their families as they recover from this traumatic experience. The incident is a stark reminder of the unpredictable nature of football and the need for vigilance both on and off the field. Uruguay's Copa America clash with Colombia will be remembered for the result on the pitch and the troubling events that unfolded afterward.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fahad_hamid@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Fahad Hamid", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin,_Northern_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Lerma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson Lerma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONMEBOL", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CONMEBOL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 17}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Uruguay-star-Darwin-Nunez-consoles-his-son-during-spat-with-Colombian-fans-after-Copa-America-exit.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723292", "eventUri": "eng-9723292", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

started strongly with their livewire Liverpool winger Luis Diaz doing well to wriggle some space for a cross on the left, finding Daniel Munoz at the back post but the full-back's header was off target.\n\nUruguay were, as always, a threat on the counter-attack and their Liverpool star, Darwin Nunez, was close to finishing off one break when Rodrigo Bentancur found him with a clever pass but the forward poked his shot wide.\n\nNunez had another opening when Maximiliano Araujo played him clear in the inside-right channel but the striker rushed his shot, blasting high and wide.\n\nAt the other end, Colombia forced a turnover which led to James Rodriguez curling in a cross from the right but Jhon Cordoba's header was off target.\n\n- Lerma breakthrough -\n\nThe breakthrough came in the 39th minute when Lerma rose majestically above Jose Maria Gimenez and powerfully headed home Rodriguez's corner.\n\nIt was the sixth assist of the tournament for Rodriguez with the former Real Madrid midfielder beating the record for most assists in a single Copa, which was set by Lionel Messi in 2021.\n\nColombia looked to make the most of their momentum with Richard Rios forcing a save out of Uruguay keeper Sergio Rochet, after being played in by Munoz.\n\nBut having been so influential down the right in the opening half, Munoz lost his head completely, just before the break, picking up a second yellow card, after landing an elbow on Manuel Ugarte.\n\nIt was a moment of madness which left Colombia to defend their lead with just 10 men for the entire second half.\n\nColombia coach Nestor Lorenzo took off Rodriguez, who was also on a yellow card, in the 62nd minute as Uruguay gradually began to turn their numerical advantage into real pressure.\n\nNicolas de la Cruz threatened with a low drive before substitute Luis Suarez clipped the outside of the post with a drive from the edge of the box after good work from Federico Valverde.\n\nValverde, the Real Madrid midfielder, then went close himself with a low drive as Colombia's back-line continued to ride their luck.\n\nGiveaway from Uruguay keeper and fell to Mateus Uribe, who despite time and space placed his shot wide of the post.\n\nIn stoppage time Uruguay had a great chance to force penalties when Nunez laid the ball off to substitute Giorgian de Arrascaeta on the edge of the box but he leaned back and put his shot over the bar.\n\nThere was still time for Uribe to waste another chance to make sure of the win, this time hitting the bar in the final minute, but he will be forgiven his wastefulness by the delirious Colombian supporters.\n\nThe celebrations were marred by ugly scenes in the stands will concern organizers CONMEBOL ahead of a final which is sure to attract huge numbers of Argentines as well as Colombians.\n\nsev/rcw\n\nMore from this section\n\nProNotary Announces Exciting New Partner Program\n\n[Not Banned] Failed to Detect Location 12 Error Fixed by iToolab AnyGo Pok\u00e9mon GO

Colombia played the entire second half one man down after Daniel Mu\u00f1oz was sent off with a red card for an aggressive shove in the first half.\n\nColombia heads to the Copa Am\u00e9rica final for just the third time in the tournament's history.

Video footage revealed Suarez's role in antagonising the opposition, contributing to the ensuing brawl.\n\nAs the final seconds wound down and Colombia secured their 1-0 victory, chaos erupted in the middle of the pitch. Players, referees, camera crews, and business executives became entangled in a frenzied scrum, the scene a blur of motion and confusion.\n\nAmid it all, the Uruguayan legend, donning his iconic No. 9 jersey, was seen towering over rival players and shoving members believed to be part of the opposition's coaching staff. With tensions running high, Suarez pushed a man in a red hat off balance, igniting further chaos as a reserve Uruguayan player retaliated.\n\nREAD MORE: Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz shared exchange moments before ugly Copa America brawl\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool should pile on Chelsea misery as Michael Edwards can fix $3M transfer error\n\nThe commentary team captured the moment perfectly: \"I'll give you one guess who sparked this originally,\" they said as the cameras zoomed in on Suarez. \"And now it's boiling over,\" they continued as more coaches rushed in to subdue the pandemonium.\n\nThe heated tensions didn't stop at the pitch; they spilled dramatically into the stands when Darwin Nunez was one of a number of Uruguay players who scaled the stands and clashed with Colombia fans. Nunez, shirtless and visibly furious, was seen exchanging punches, defending himself while shouting at his antagonists as drinks flew across the stands.\n\nThe crowd continued to taunt the striker as the situation turned into a chaotic spectacle. Uruguay defender Jose Maria Gimenez claimed players were defending their nearby families from Colombia fans. Gimenez said: \"It was a disaster; there was no police and we had to defend our families.\"\n\nColombia clinched a 1-0 victory over Uruguay after Jefferson Lerma connected on a header from a whipping cross by James Rodriguez, giving the team an early lead in the first half. However, Daniel Munoz made the win more challenging for Colombia, reducing them to 10 men after receiving a second yellow card for elbowing Manuel Ugarte in the chest, drawing an unnecessary foul.\n\nDespite having the numerical advantage, Uruguay struggled to generate any meaningful attack, managing just two shots on goal throughout the game. They attempted to apply pressure, winning late free kicks in the game's defining moments, but failed to convert any of their chances as the clock wound down.\n\nCurrently, CONMEBOL has not addressed any of the video footage from the tumultuous semifinal, nor has it announced any punishments. But in the past, the governing body announced its speedy condemnation of violence last year when three fans were arrested over a brawl in Rio de Janeiro ahead of the Copa Libertadores final between Argentina's Boca Juniors and Brazil's Fluminense.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rory_robinson@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Rory Robinson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_D\u00edaz_(footballer,_born_1997)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luis D\u00edaz (footballer, born 1997)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Ugarte_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Ugarte (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluminense_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fluminense FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Rodr\u00edguez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Rodr\u00edguez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Header (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONMEBOL", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CONMEBOL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Libertadores", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copa Libertadores"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Juniors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boca Juniors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Lerma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson Lerma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Shooter", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Shooter", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33216512.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2161558382.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723292", "eventUri": "eng-9723292", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

in the second half, Jefferson Lerma's header in the first half proved to be the decisive goal, setting up a final clash with the world champions, Argentina.\n\nUruguay were handed a numerical advantage when Colombia's Daniel Munoz was dismissed at the end of the first half, but they failed to capitalise on it.\n\nDarwin Nunez squandered three excellent scoring opportunities early in the match, curling one effort inches wide and failing to hit the target with two other attempts.\n\nUruguay paid the price for their profligacy when Lerma outjumped the defense at a corner and directed his header past goalkeeper Sergio Rochet, with James Rodriguez claiming his sixth assist of the tournament.\n\nColombia started strongly with their Liverpool winger Luis Diaz doing well to wriggle some space for a cross on the left, finding Daniel Munoz at the back post but the full-back's header was off target.\n\nUruguay were, as always, a threat on the counter-attack and their Liverpool star, Darwin Nunez, was close to finishing off one break when Rodrigo Bentancur found him with a clever pass but the forward poked his shot wide.\n\nNunez had another opening when Maximiliano Araujo played him clear in the inside-right channel but the striker rushed his shot, blasting high and wide.\n\nAt the other end, Colombia forced a turnover which led to James Rodriguez curling in a cross from the right but Jhon Cordoba's header was off target.\n\nThe breakthrough came in the 39th minute when Lerma rose majestically above Jose Maria Gimenez and powerfully headed home Rodriguez's corner.\n\nIt was the sixth assist of the tournament for Rodriguez with the former Real Madrid midfielder beating the record for most assists in a single Copa, which was set by Lionel Messi in 2021.\n\nColombia looked to make the most of their momentum with Richard Rios forcing a save out of Uruguay keeper Sergio Rochet, after being played in by Munoz.\n\nBut having been so influential down the right in the opening half, Munoz lost his head completely, just before the break, picking up a second yellow card, after landing an elbow on Manuel Ugarte.\n\nIt was a moment of rowdiness which left Colombia to defend their lead with just 10 men for the entire second half.\n\nColombia coach Nestor Lorenzo took off Rodriguez, who was also on a yellow card, in the 62nd minute as Uruguay gradually began to turn their numerical advantage into real pressure.\n\nNicolas de la Cruz threatened with a low drive before substitute Luis Suarez clipped the outside of the post with a drive from the edge of the box after good work from Federico Valverde.\n\nValverde, the Real Madrid midfielder, then went close himself with a low drive as Colombia's back-line continued to ride their luck.\n\nGiveaway from Uruguay keeper fell to Mateus Uribe, who despite time and space placed his shot wide of the post.\n\nIn stoppage time, Uruguay had a great chance to force penalties when Nunez laid the ball off to substitute Giorgian de Arrascaeta on the edge of the box, but he leaned back and put his shot over the bar.\n\nThere was still time for Uribe to waste another chance to make sure of the win, this time hitting the bar in the final minute, but he will be forgiven for his wastefulness by the delirious Colombian supporters.", "source": {"uri": "leadership.ng", "dataType": "news",

(AP) -- Colombia is headed to the Copa America championship game for the first time in 23 years after a contentious win over Uruguay in which it played the second half a man short and players brawled with fans in the stands following the final whistle.\n\nJefferson Lerma scored in the 39th minute for a 1-0 win Wednesday night and a matchup with Lionel Messi and defending champion Argentina on Sunday.\n\n\"Until you overcome your weaknesses you cannot grow,\" Colombia coach Nester Lorenzo said through a interpreter. \"And when you overcome those obstacles you can grow.\"\n\nDaniel Mu\u00f1oz was ejected in first-half stoppage time for an elbow that led to his second yellow card. Despite Uruguay having 61.9% possession, Colombia held on to reach the championship for the first time since winning its only Copa title as host in 2001.\n\nColombia extended its unbeaten streak to a team record 28 games, one more than from 1992-94 and the longest current streak in men's international soccer.\n\n\"They are very hungry as players and very eager and they really add many elements to their game beyond the tactical side,\" Lorenzo said.\n\nIn a match that included seven yellow cards in addition to the red, players from both teams pushed and shoved in a scrum on the field at the final whistle. Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez and about a dozen Uruguay teammates went into the stands as fans brawled.\n\nA video showed N\u00fa\u00f1ez hitting a fan in Colombian team colors.\n\nCONMEBOL released a statement after the game saying that it strongly condemns any act of violence that affects the game.\n\n\"Our work is based on the conviction that soccer connects and unites us through its positive values,\" the organization said. \"There is no place for intolerance and violence on and off the field. We invite everyone in the remaining days to pour all of their passion into cheering on their national teams and having an unforgettable party.\"\n\nDefending champion Argentina and Colombia meet at Miami Gardens, Florida, in the tournament finale. The Albiceleste are seeking a record 16th Copa title and are looking to join Spain from 2008-12 as the only countries to win three straight major championships.\n\nUruguay stays in Charlotte to meet Canada in Saturday night's third-place match.\n\nBefore an overwhelmingly pro-Colombia crowd of 70,644 that filled Bank of America Stadium with yellow jerseys and flags, Uruguay fell behind for the first time in the tournament.\n\nJames Rodr\u00edguez's corner kick was headed in from short range by Lerma, who outjumped Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez for his third international goal and second of the tournament. Rodr\u00edguez has six assists in the tournament -- triple the total of any other player.\n\nMu\u00f1oz received his first yellow card from Mexican referee C\u00e9sar Ramos in the 31st minute for a reckless slide tackle on Maximiliano Ara\u00fajo and his second for elbowing Manuel Ugarte in the stomach.\n\nRodr\u00edguez was given a yellow card in the 55th minute for arguing with Ramos when the referee failed to stop play after Richard R\u00edos was kicked on a shin by Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez.\n\nR\u00edos was removed on a stretcher, re-entered the match, then went down in another challenge and was substituted in the 62nd minute. Rodr\u00edguez was removed at the same time to keep him eligible for the final.\n\nColombia goalkeeper Camilo Vargas didn't have to make his first save until he stopped Nicol\u00e1s de la Cruz in the 68th minute.\n\nLuis Su\u00e1rez, Uruguay's career leader with 68 goals, entered in the 66th minute and hit the outside of a post with a shot in the 71st. He grasped his head in his hands in disgust.\n\n\"The moments in which we could unbalance the game, we did not succeed,\" Uruguay coach Marcelo Bielsa said. \"We should have generated more goal situations than we did.\"\n\nColombia's Mateus Uribe, another second-half sub, put an open shot wide in the 88th, and Uribe's open shot in the fourth minute of stoppage time ricocheted off the body of sliding goalkeeper Sergio Rochet and then the crossbar.\n\nUruguay moved Rochet up to the attacking half of the field in the final minute, desperate for a goal.\n\nThe match was played in 90-degree heat on a surface that was converted from artificial turf to grass in the weeks leading up the game.\n\nPlayers on the NFL's Carolina Panthers have been outspoken about soccer teams having the luxury of playing on grass on their home field. Players say NFL games on artificial turf leave them more susceptible to injuries.\n\nWith two games left, attendance of 1.48 million is just 1,663 shy of the total for the 2016 tournament in the

As Colombia celebrated their slender 1-0 victory in the Copa America semi-final, chaos ensued.\n\nThe pitch turned into a frenzy of players, officials, and staff, with Uruguay's No. 9 in the thick of it and appearing to push a member of the Colombian coaching team. His actions triggered a domino effect, inciting a Uruguayan substitute player to join the fracas.

Nunez, caught in the middle of the mayhem, traded punches with fans while trying to protect his family.\n\nUruguay's defender Jose Maria Gimenez was fuming post-match, revealing the squad had to step in to protect their loved ones from rowdy Colombia supporters. Heart-wrenching snaps later showed Nunez comforting one of his children on the field.\n\nGimenez said: \"It was a disaster; there was no police and we had to defend our families,\" The player suggested a handful of overzealous fans were to blame, adding: \"This is because of two or three who have one drink too many. A certain sector of the Colombian fans made an avalanche where our loved ones were.\"\n\nColombia just about scraped past Uruguay with a 1-0 victory, all thanks to Jefferson Lerma's header connecting with a great cross from James Rodriguez in the first half. The win was made even tougher when Daniel Munoz got his marching orders for a second yellow after catching Manuel Ugarte with an elbow, leaving Colombia a man short.\n\nEven with the numerical advantage, Uruguay struggled to pose a real threat, only managing a measly two shots on target throughout the game. They huffed and puffed for a late leveller, bagging free kicks at crucial junctures but just couldn't make it count, as the match slipped through their fingers.\n\nCONMEBOL, which leads South American football, responded in the aftermath of the violent incidents by announcing its intent to conduct a thorough evaluation prior to Sunday's Copa America final. Colombia, currently relishing an impressive 28-match unbeaten run spanning over two years, will face Argentina in Miami despite being considered the underdogs.\n\nArgentina, under the leadership of football wizard Lionel Messi, is eager to clinch a third consecutive title following their victories in the Copa America 2021 and last year's World Cup. Despite not winning an international trophy until 2020, Messi, who now plays for MLS's Inter Miami after his transfer last year, is keen to bolster his impressive legacy this coming Sunday in his new home city.", "source": {"uri": "dailystar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "neil_docking@dailystar.co.uk", "name": "Neil Docking", "type": "author", "isAgency":

After his career started to go downhill following his move away from Real Madrid, Rodriguez has found his second wind as he continued his magical run in the semi-final against Uruguay.\n\nIn the 39th minute, Rodriguez produced a pinpoint cross and found Jefferson Lerma, who headed the ball into the back of the net. With Colombia in the lead, Rodriguez claimed his sixth assist in the ongoing campaign of the Copa America. He surpassed Argentina maestro, Lionel Messi's tally of five in a single Copa America campaign. He achieved the feat in 2021, during Albiceleste's title-winning campaign. (Copa America: Massive Fight Breaks Out After Uruguay-Colombia Semi-Final, Darwin Nunez Involved!)\n\nThe 32-year-old attacking midfielder kicked off his campaign by bagging two assists against Paraguay in Colombia's opening group game. He went on to register one against Costa Rica and two again in Colombia's quarterfinal clash against Panama.\n\nDespite taking a lead, Colombia's task to defend their slender one-goal advantage became an intricate affair. Defender Daniel Munoz swung his elbow at Uruguay's Manuel Ugarte, was shown a second yellow card and got sent off the field in the first-half stoppage time. With time running out, Uruguay decided to introduce one of their most prolific strikers, Luis Suarez, into the thick of the action.\n\nIn the 71st minute, he had the opportunity to bring the game back on level terms but failed to deliver in the decisive moment. Colombia struck the crossbar in the final minutes of the game, but one goal turned out to be sufficient to seal their date with Argentina in the final.\n\nAfter the game, a scuffle broke out between the Uruguay players and Colombia fans. In the video that went viral on social media, Liverpool striker Darwin Nunez and some Uruguay players allegedly climbed into the stands, had an altercation and clashed with each other. Nunez was allegedly at the forefront of the incident. Uruguay will face Canada in the third-place playoff on Saturday.

There, it will face a stiff task against Lionel Messi and reigning World Cup champion Argentina, which cruised through its half of the field while allowing a single goal in five games.\n\nColombia and Argentina will face off Sunday night in Miami.\n\nWednesday's semifinal was played in Charlotte, but might as well have been hosted in Bogot\u00e1. The Bank of America stands were packed with fans sporting yellow Colombia gear. Colombia delivered for those fans in a testy game that tallied six yellow cards and a red-card ejection before the postgame exchanges.\n\nColombia entered Wednesday's game as the highest-scoring team in the tournament (11 goals), fresh off a 5-0 quarterfinal win over Panama. It struck first on a corner kick in the 38th minute. James Rodr\u00edguez sent the ball to the back post on the corner kick, where Jefferson Lerma leapt high in the air and squeezed the ball between the post and goalkeeper Sergio Rochet.\n\nThe goal was just the second allowed by Uruguay all tournament.\n\nColombia's defense, meanwhile, stifled a Uruguay offense that scored nine goals in four previous Copa Am\u00e9rica games. Uruguay didn't put any of its four first-half shots on goal.\n\nThe tide threatened to shift late in the second half. Colombia's Daniel Mu\u00f1oz, who picked up a yellow card earlier in the half on a tackle, picked up his second yellow just before the half. After a scuffle following a foul on Colombia's Davinson S\u00e1nchez, Uruguay's Manuel Ugarte grabbed Mu\u00f1oz's jersey from behind.\n\nMu\u00f1oz responded with an elbow to the chest that knocked Ugarte to the turf, drawing his second yellow and ultimately a red card that led to his ejection.\n\nHead coach N\u00e9stor Lorenzo protested to no avail. Mu\u00f1oz was tossed, and Colombia was set to play the second half a man down.\n\nUruguay's offense was much improved after halftime as it controlled the ball and put two of its seven shots on goal. But it didn't convert on the scoreboard as Colombia held on for victory.\n\nThe tension that marked the game throughout carried over at midfield after the final whistle. Players traded shoves and blows at midfield in the moments after the game.\n\nThe scuffle was eventually subdued on the field, but carried over into the stands, where Uruguayan players including Liverpool's Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez traded blows and shoves with Colombia fans.

(AP) -- Colombia is headed to the Copa America championship game for the first time in 23 years after a contentious win over Uruguay in which it played the second half a man short and players brawled with fans in the stands following the final whistle.\n\nJefferson Lerma scored in the 39th minute for a 1-0 win Wednesday night and a matchup with Lionel Messi and defending champion Argentina on Sunday.\n\n\"Until you overcome your weaknesses you cannot grow,\" Colombia coach Nester Lorenzo said through a interpreter. \"And when you overcome those obstacles you can grow.\"\n\nDaniel Mu\u00f1oz was ejected in first-half stoppage time for an elbow that led to his second yellow card. Despite Uruguay having 61.9% possession, Colombia held on to reach the championship for the first time since winning its only Copa title as host in 2001.\n\nColombia extended its unbeaten streak to a team record 28 games, one more than from 1992-94 and the longest current streak in men's international soccer.\n\n\"They are very hungry as players and very eager and they really add many elements to their game beyond the tactical side,\" Lorenzo said.\n\nIn a match that included seven yellow cards in addition to the red, players from both teams pushed and shoved in a scrum on the field at the final whistle. Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez and about a dozen Uruguay teammates went into the stands as fans brawled.\n\nA video showed N\u00fa\u00f1ez hitting a fan in Colombian team colors.\n\nCONMEBOL released a statement after the game saying that it strongly condemns any act of violence that affects the game.\n\n\"Our work is based on the conviction that soccer connects and unites us through its positive values,\" the organization said. \"There is no place for intolerance and violence on and off the field. We invite everyone in the remaining days to pour all of their passion into cheering on their national teams and having an unforgettable party.\"\n\nDefending champion Argentina and Colombia meet at Miami Gardens, Florida, in the tournament finale. The Albiceleste are seeking a record 16th Copa title and are looking to join Spain from 2008-12 as the only countries to win three straight major championships.\n\nUruguay stays in Charlotte to meet Canada in Saturday night's third-place match.\n\nBefore an overwhelmingly pro-Colombia crowd of 70,644 that filled Bank of America Stadium with yellow jerseys and flags, Uruguay fell behind for the first time in the tournament.\n\nJames Rodr\u00edguez's corner kick was headed in from short range by Lerma, who outjumped Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez for his third international goal and second of the tournament. Rodr\u00edguez has six assists in the tournament -- triple the total of any other player.\n\nMu\u00f1oz received his first yellow card from Mexican referee C\u00e9sar Ramos in the 31st minute for a reckless slide tackle on Maximiliano Ara\u00fajo and his second for elbowing Manuel Ugarte in the stomach.\n\nRodr\u00edguez was given a yellow card in the 55th minute for arguing with Ramos when the referee failed to stop play after Richard R\u00edos was kicked on a shin by Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez.\n\nR\u00edos was removed on a stretcher, re-entered the match, then went down in another challenge and was substituted in the 62nd minute. Rodr\u00edguez was removed at the same time to keep him eligible for the final.\n\nColombia goalkeeper Camilo Vargas didn't have to make his first save until he stopped Nicol\u00e1s de la Cruz in the 68th minute.\n\nLuis Su\u00e1rez, Uruguay's career leader with 68 goals, entered in the 66th minute and hit the outside of a post with a shot in the 71st. He grasped his head in his hands in disgust.\n\n\"The moments in which we could unbalance the game, we did not succeed,\" Uruguay coach Marcelo Bielsa said. \"We should have generated more goal situations than we did.\"\n\nColombia's Mateus Uribe, another second-half sub, put an open shot wide in the 88th, and Uribe's open shot in the fourth minute of stoppage time ricocheted off the body of sliding goalkeeper Sergio Rochet and then the crossbar.\n\nUruguay moved Rochet up to the attacking half of the field in the final minute, desperate for a goal.\n\nThe match was played in 90-degree heat on a surface that was converted from artificial turf to grass in the weeks leading up the game.\n\nPlayers on the NFL's Carolina Panthers have been outspoken about soccer teams having the luxury of playing on grass on their home field. Players say NFL games on artificial turf leave them more susceptible to injuries.\n\nWith two games left, attendance of 1.48 million is just 1,663 shy of the total for the 2016 tournament in the United States.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

During seven minutes of stoppage time, Uribe had another one-on-one, but Rochet made a crucial save, deflecting the shot off the bar.\n\nUruguay held on for the final minutes, and a last-gasp effort was blocked by a Colombian defender.", "source": {"uri": "socialnews.xyz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Social News XYZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Rock_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hard Rock Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Gardens,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Gardens, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami Gardens, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Ara\u00fajo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Ara\u00fajo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Rodr\u00edguez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Rodr\u00edguez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigo_Bentancur", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rodrigo Bentancur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillermo_Varela", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guillermo Varela"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mateus_Uribe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mateus Uribe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Lerma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson Lerma"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://boxoffice.socialnews.xyz/get_ians_img.php.jpg?url=Colombia+outlast+Uruguay+to+punch+ticket+to+Copa+America+final", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723292", "eventUri": "eng-9723292", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 16, "textEnd": 23}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

The charge appeared to be spearheaded by Liverpool striker Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez, who could be seen throwing punches in the middle of the fracas.\n\nMore angles:\n\nUruguay's Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez spoke to the broadcast after the incident, claiming the brawl was preceded by the Uruguay players' families being harassed by a group of Colombia fans and urging the tournament organizers to make changes with security.\n\nThe violence was preceded by a frustrating loss for Uruguay, which was playing for a chance to face Argentina in the final for its first Copa Am\u00e9rica title since 2011. Instead, it will face Canada in the third-place game on Saturday, and it will almost certainly be missing a few players as discipline for the brawl is handed out.\n\nUruguay was favored to defeat Los Cafeteros in the semifinal, but fell behind in the 40th minute on a beautiful corner kick from James Rodriguez that Jefferson Lerma headed into the net. Their hopes for a comeback were bolstered early in the second half when Colombia's Daniel Mu\u00f1oz hit Manuel Ugarte, leading to a second yellow card and leaving his team in a 10-vs.-11 situation.\n\nUruguay kept up the pressure and had some real scoring chances, but just couldn't get the ball in the net by the time expired.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nA horrific scene broke out at the end of a Copa Am\u00e9rica semifinal on Wednesday night as Uruguay players brawled with Colombian fans in the stands.\n\nAfter Colombia defeated Uruguay, 1-0, to advance to the Copa Am\u00e9rica final, things turned violent when cameras caught Uruguay players, seemingly led by Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez, walking into the stands and throwing punches at Colombia fans.\n\nSecurity at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina, attempted to hold players back, but things were already getting too ugly.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nN\u00fa\u00f1ez appeared to throw several punches in videos of the brawl that have surfaced, while Uruguay defender Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez threw a punch as well.\n\nColombia fans were fighting back, throwing punches themselves while others were throwing objects toward the brawl while it was taking place.\n\nAfter things finally settled, everyone wanted to get to the bottom of why Uruguay players would jump into the stands and fight fans. Gim\u00e9nez said the families of the Uruguay players were in danger.\n\nUNITED STATES KNOCKED OUT OF COPA AM\u00c9RICA AFTER HEARTBREAKING LOSS TO URUGUAY\n\n\"Please be careful because the families are in the stands. They stormed all our families, a certain sector of Colombia fans and they won't let us speak on the microphone,\" Gim\u00e9nez said to Fox Sports in a Spanish interview that was translated to English. \"I'm going to say it now because I know I can. Because if not, they'll cut you off.\n\n\"This is a disaster. Our families are in danger. We had to get on the top of the stands as soon as possible to rescue our loved ones with newborn babies. It was a disaster.\n\n\"I hope those who are organizing this are a little more careful with the families, with the people and with the people around in the stadiums. It's a disaster because all the matches are the same. The families are suffering because of some who drink one or two shots of alcohol that don't know how to drink who behave like children and are not decent.\"\n\nGim\u00e9nez's argument that Uruguay players were protecting their families was reiterated by Uruguay Football Association President Ignacio Alonso.\n\n\"Uruguay's players had an instinctive reaction, which is natural, which is going to defend and protect the children who were on that side of the stands, who were suffering attacks, the women, the parents, the closest family members, siblings,\" he said in a Spanish interview that was translated to English.\n\nCONMEBOL, which is the South American governing body of Copa Am\u00e9rica, released its own statement, saying they strongly condemn \"any act of violence that affects football.\"\n\n\"Our work is based on the conviction that soccer connects and unites us through its positive values. There is no place for intolerance and violence on and off the field,\" the statement read.\n\nBefore the fight broke out in the stands, things were already chippy with these two teams on the pitch. First, Daniel Mu\u00f1oz was sent off for the match after receiving two yellow cards, leaving Colombia down one man for the entire second half. Mu\u00f1oz had elbowed Uruguay's Manuel Ugarte, leading to the referee to pull out his second card.\n\nThen, at the end of the match, players and staff members from both teams were seen in a scuffle at midfield, with pushing and shoving taking place before it broke up.\n\nWhile emotions run high during any sporting event, nobody ever wants to see them spill over in this fashion.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCONMEBOL will hope the Copa Am\u00e9rica final between Colombia and Argentina this Sunday will not see the same reckless behavior.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_thompson@foxnews.com", "name": "Scott Thompson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Mar\u00eda_Gim\u00e9nez", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_N\u00fa\u00f1ez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Ugarte_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Ugarte (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getafe_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Getafe CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ejection (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONMEBOL", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CONMEBOL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/07/1024/512/Colombia-Uruguay-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723292", "eventUri": "eng-9723292", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

And despite Uruguay having 61.9% possession, Colombia held on to reach the title match of CONMEBOL's championship event for South American national men's soccer teams for the first time since winning its only Copa America title as host in 2001.\n\nArgentina beat Canada 2-0 in the first semifinal on Tuesday night at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, the site of the 2026 World Cup final. Also the reigning World Cup champion, Argentina will be seeking a record-breaking 16th Copa America title this weekend and trying to join Spain as the only men's national soccer teams to win three straight major titles. La Roja sandwiched its 2010 World Cup title with the 2008 and 2012 UEFA European Championship tournament crowns.\n\nUruguay will remain in Charlotte to meet Canada in Saturday night's third-place match.\n\nColombia extended its unbeaten streak to a team record 28 games, one more than its from 1992 to 1994 and the longest current streak in international men's soccer.\n\n\"They are very hungry as players and very eager, and they really add many elements to their game beyond the tactical side,\" Lorenzo said.\n\nIn a match that included seven yellow cards in addition to the red for Mu\u00f1oz, players from both teams pushed and shoved in a scrum on the field at the final whistle. Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez and about a dozen Uruguay teammates went into the stands as fans brawled, and a video showed N\u00fa\u00f1ez hitting a fan in Colombian team colors.\n\nCONMEBOL released a statement after the game saying that it strongly condemns any act of violence that affects the game.\n\n\"Our work is based on the conviction that soccer connects and unites us through its positive values,\" the organization's statement read. \"There is no place for intolerance and violence on and off the field. We invite everyone in the remaining days to pour all of their passion into cheering on their national teams and having an unforgettable party.\"\n\nBefore an overwhelmingly pro-Colombia crowd of 70,644 that filled Bank of America Stadium with yellow jerseys and flags, Uruguay fell behind for the first time in the tournament.\n\nJames Rodr\u00edguez's corner kick was headed in from short range by Lerma, who outjumped Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez for his third international goal and second of the tournament. Rodr\u00edguez has six assists in the tournament, triple the total of any other player.\n\nMu\u00f1oz received his first yellow card from Mexican referee C\u00e9sar Ramos in the 31st minute for a reckless slide tackle on Maximiliano Ara\u00fajo and his second for elbowing Manuel Ugarte in the stomach.\n\nRodr\u00edguez was given a yellow card in the 55th minute for arguing with Ramos when the referee failed to stop play after Richard R\u00edos was kicked on a shin by Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez.\n\nR\u00edos was removed on a stretcher, reentered the match, then went down in another challenge and was substituted in the 62nd minute. Rodr\u00edguez was removed at the same time to keep him eligible for the final.\n\nColombia goalkeeper Camilo Vargas didn't have to make his first save until he stopped Nicol\u00e1s de la Cruz in the 68th minute.\n\nLuis Su\u00e1rez, Uruguay's career leader with 68 goals, entered in the 66th minute and hit the outside of a post with a shot in the 71st. He grasped his head in his hands in disgust.\n\n\"The moments in which we could unbalance the game, we did not succeed,\" Uruguay coach Marcelo Bielsa said. \"We should have generated more goal situations than we did.\"\n\nColombia's Mateus Uribe, another second-half sub, put an open shot wide in the 88th, and Uribe's open shot in the fourth minute of stoppage time ricocheted off the body of sliding goalkeeper Sergio Rochet and then the crossbar.\n\nUruguay moved Rochet up to the attacking half of the field in the final minute, desperate for a goal.\n\nThe match was played in 90-degree heat on a surface that was converted from synthetic turf to grass in the weeks leading up the game.\n\nPanthers players have been outspoken about soccer teams having the luxury of playing on grass on their home field. Players from teams around the NFL have expressed concerns that games played on synthetic turf leave them more susceptible to injuries.\n\nWith two games left in this year's Copa America, attendance of 1.48 million is just 1,663 shy of the total for the 2016 tournament in the United States, which set the event's record.", "source": {"uri": "timesfreepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

After the on-field scrum relaxed, the Uruguay players made their way over to the stands.\n\nNunez led a number of Uruguay players into the crowd before Colombia fans started being hostile to the group, and a mass fight erupted between players and supporters. Nunez was punched by a fan and began defending himself as footage showed him swinging at multiple supporters in retaliation.\n\nBarcelona star Ronald Araujo was also involved, as thousands of fans recorded the altercation on their phones in disbelief. Security then stepped in to separate both parties, and attempted to lead the Uruguay players into the locker room as quickly as possible.\n\nMore to follow...\n\nThere will be more to follow on this breaking news story and Mirror Sport will bring you the very latest updates, pictures and video as soon as possible.\n\nPlease check back regularly for updates on this developing story.\n\nFollow us on Google News, Flipboard, Apple News, Twitter, Facebook or visit The Mirror homepage.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joseph_mcbride@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Joseph McBride", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin,_Northern_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Header (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Lerma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson Lerma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Ara\u00fajo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Ara\u00fajo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33216464.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_DarwinNunez.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723292", "eventUri": "eng-9723292", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Credit - Nick Tre. Smith -- Icon Sportswire/Getty Images\n\nThe Copa Am\u00e9rica soccer tournament held in the U.S. this summer has been characterized by intense physicality on the field. But while seven yellow cards and one red card were issued during the semifinal on Wednesday night, it ended up being action off the field that grabbed the most attention.\n\nA sea of yellow filled the Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, N.C. -- as supporters of Colombia far outnumbered those of their blue-wearing rivals Uruguay -- but tensions quickly turned red-hot after the full-time whistle sent Uruguay home and Colombia to the final.\n\nIn videos of the scene that quickly went viral on social media, opposing spectators threw punches and beverages at one another, while Uruguayan players -- including Liverpool forward Darwin Nu\u00f1ez and Barcelona defender Ronald Ara\u00fajo -- climbed into the stands to join in the brawl.\n\nNu\u00f1ez could be seen taking several swings at Colombia fans as his teammates attempted to hold him back before security officials appeared to separate the two sides.\n\nThe tussle in the stands took place after a brief scuffle between the opposing players on the pitch, following a testy match that saw favorites Uruguay lose to Colombia, 1-0, despite being a man up for the entire second half after Colombia's Daniel Mu\u00f1oz was sent off for elbowing an opponent. Colombia has now extended its record unbeaten streak to 28 games as it heads to Miami next to take on Lionel Messi and Argentina for the South American title on Sunday.\n\nAfter the melee had subsided, Uruguayan captain Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez told reporters that his teammates had acted in response to a group of Colombia fans attacking the Uruguayan players' families, who were seated in a section near the touchline. \"They stormed all our families,\" Gim\u00e9nez said, complaining about the lack of official security intervention. \"This is a disaster. Our family is in danger. We had to get on top of the stands ASAP to rescue our loved ones.\"\n\nIgnacio Alonso, president of the Uruguayan Football Association, reiterated the explanation, telling reporters after the game: \"Uruguay's players had an instinctive reaction that is natural, which is to defend and protect the children who were in that area of the stadium and were suffering attacks on the women, on the parents, on the closest family members, siblings. And it's a father's reaction that is intuitively natural and was very rational given the events that surrounded them.\"\n\nESPN commentator and former U.S. national team player Herculez Gomez echoed the frustrations of the Uruguayans, calling the lack of security at the stadium \"dangerously pathetic,\" as he shared on X footage of Nu\u00f1ez consoling his young son in the aftermath of the altercation.\n\nCONMEBOL, the South American soccer body that organizes the Copa Am\u00e9rica, condemned the violence in a statement, saying fans should channel their passion into cheering and that \"there is no place for intolerance and violence on and off the field.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_N\u00fa\u00f1ez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Penalty card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONMEBOL", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CONMEBOL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Mar\u00eda_Gim\u00e9nez", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Ara\u00fajo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Ara\u00fajo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ejection (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herculez_Gomez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Herculez Gomez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguayan_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uruguayan Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/a041762bee6f14b22eedc377821f6c2e", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723292", "eventUri": "eng-9723292", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-07-", "textStart": 190, "textEnd": 197}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

The Bank of America stands were packed with fans sporting yellow Colombia jerseys eager to cheer their team on. Colombia delivered for those fans in a testy game that tallied six yellow cards saw a red-card ejection.\n\nColombia entered Wednesday's game as the highest-scoring team in the tournament (11 goals), fresh off a 5-0 quarterfinal win over Panama. It struck first on a corner kick in the 38th minute. James Rodr\u00edguez sent the ball to the back post on the corner kick, where Jefferson Lerma leapt high in the air and squeezed the ball between the post and goalkeeper Sergio Rochet.\n\nThe goal was just the second allowed by Uruguay all tournament.\n\nColombia's defense, meanwhile, stifled a Uruguay offense that scored nine goals in four games en route to Wednesday's matchup. Uruguay didn't put any of its four first-half shots on goal.\n\nThe tide threatened to shift late in the second half. Colombia's Daniel Mu\u00f1oz, who picked up a yellow card earlier in the half on a tackle, picked up his second just before the half. After a scuffle following a foul on Colombia's Davinson S\u00e1nchez, Uruguay's Manuel Ugarte grabbed Mu\u00f1oz's jersey from behind.\n\nMu\u00f1oz responded with an elbow to the chest that knocked Ugarte to the turf, drawing his second yellow and ultimately a red card that led to his ejection.\n\nHead coach N\u00e9stor Lorenzo protested to no avail. Mu\u00f1oz was tossed, and Colombia was set to play the second half a man down.\n\nUruguay's offense was much improved after halftime as it controlled the ball and put two of its seven shots on goal. But it didn't convert on the scoreboard as Colombia held on for victory.\n\nThe tension that marked the game throughout carried over at midfield after the final whistle. Players traded shoves and blows at midfield in the moments after the game.\n\nThe scuffle was eventually subdued on the field, but carried over into the stands, where Uruguayan players including one identified as Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez traded blows and shoves with Colombia fans in the stands.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_owens@aol.com", "name": "Jason Owens", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corner_kick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corner kick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Ugarte_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Ugarte (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Rochet", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Rochet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Rodr\u00edguez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Rodr\u00edguez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Lerma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson Lerma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogot\u00e1", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bogot\u00e1"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bogot\u00e1"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Panama"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Panama"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_N\u00fa\u00f1ez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N\u00e9stor_Lorenzo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "N\u00e9stor Lorenzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davinson_S\u00e1nchez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Davinson S\u00e1nchez"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Trading_Card_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Trading Card Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Guides", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hgNInMNl5GwlXBpQqMmrJg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_yahoo_sports_800/709c0fc616101bfeca91cc55b11e1e6a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723292", "eventUri": "eng-9723292", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2011-07-", "textStart": 116, "textEnd": 123}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

James Rodriguez to claim his sixth assist of the tournament.\n\nColombia were then reduced to 10 men when right-back Munoz received a second yellow card for elbowing Manuel Ugarte in the chest when

Messi and Argentina wait for Colombia in Miami. This Sunday will be the first major final the Cafeteros have played in since they won the Copa at home in 2001.\n\nWhat a half of football the first period of this game was. A goal, an injury and of course some red card drama were all on the menu in the first 45 minutes of this semifinal.\n\nColombia came out of the blocks firing, like they have done all tournament, but at times their pressing game left them way too open at the back, and Liverpool forward Darwin Nu\u00f1ez had some fantastic chances. He took advantage of the space behind the Colombia defence, but he failed to convert on various occasions.\n\nDaniel Mu\u00f1oz was menacing down the right flank for Colombia, and had a good header at goal bounce just wide. Richard Rios had a decent strike saved and striker Jhon C\u00f3rdoba scuffed at another effort. They went into the break 1-0 up thanks to a Jefferson Lerma header from a fine James Rodr\u00edguez corner, a deserved goal for a strong front-footed performance.\n\nColombia also went into the break one man down though, as Crystal Palace fullback Mu\u00f1oz saw all of his positive energy misplaced in a moment of rage. He struck Manuel Ugarte with an elbow off the ball and was rightfully dismissed upon a VAR review of the incident. After such a great half for Colombia, Mu\u00f1oz would leave his team disadvantaged and miss the final in case of victory.\n\nAt the start of the second half Colombia made a defensive change and set up in a 4-3-2 shape to try and seal the defence without completely losing all attacking options. D\u00edaz and Cordoba were the outlets for a team that went from a high press to a low block during the break.\n\nAfter an hour of the game James had to be substituted. He was beginning to see red after receiving a yellow card from the referee. Richard Rios was injured and had to come off himself, and captain James was booked in the aftermath. Those were tough minutes for Los Cafeteros, and after that Luis Suarez entered the fray for Uruguay who began to apply more and more pressure.\n\nWith 20 minutes left of normal time Luis Diaz found himself with an opening on the counter but couldn't pick the correct shot or pass to give Colombia a vital second. Seconds later Suarez struck the woodwork for Uruguay after a fine move down the right.\n\nThese two sides met in Colombia last year and drew 2-2, and names like James and Suarez would tempt you to reminisce about their World Cup knock-out battle back in 2014 when James Rodriguez took the World by storm. This Copa Am\u00e9rica semifinal became a classic of its own.\n\nWith the man advantage Uruguay dominated the ball in the second half and did apply pressure on Colombia, but they didn't really create much in the way of clear chances. Tangles between players from both sides, great Colombia defending and the odd dangerous counter attack made for an incredible spectacle nonetheless. Not to mention the tension in the air.\n\nSeven minutes of stoppage time saw Colombia hit the crossbar on yet another break. As if they were throwing away their own final confirmation, but at the other end Uruguay were being just as wasteful in what was a truly thrilling tie with an emotional atmosphere.\n\nThe final whistle went after what felt like an eternity and sparked scenes of jubilation amongst Colombia players and fans alike. It also means they are a record 28 games without defeat in international football and as mentioned they have a date with destiny this weekend, against World Cup winners Argentina and Lionel Messi.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Rodr\u00edguez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "James Rodr\u00edguez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_N\u00fa\u00f1ez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_D\u00edaz_(footballer,_born_1997)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luis D\u00edaz (footballer, born 1997)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Ugarte_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Ugarte (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C\u00f3rdoba,_Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jhon_C\u00f3rdoba", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jhon C\u00f3rdoba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Lerma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson Lerma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/668f3d204d9c6b3cd6f8af2e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723292", "eventUri": "eng-9723292", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina set up the title decider.\n\nThis will be against defending champions Argentina on Sunday.\n\nColombia's Daniel Munoz was sent off at the end of the first half and, while Uruguay dominated possession, they could not make the man-advantage count.\n\nThis was as Darwin Nunez missed three good opportunities to score early on.\n\nThe Liverpool forward had a great chance in the penalty box in the 17th minute, but he curled his effort inches wide before a scuffed shot.\n\nAnother curling strike failed to find the target as he sat on his haunches wondering how he had missed.\n\nUruguay were made to pay for those missed chances when Lerma rose above the defence at a corner-kick and squeezed his header past goalkeeper Sergio Rochet.\n\nIt helped James Rodriguez to claim his sixth assist of the tournament.\n\nColombia were then reduced to 10 men when right-back Munoz received a second yellow card for elbowing Manuel Ugarte in the chest when play was stopped.\n\nWith Uruguay dominating possession in the second half, Bielsa threw on Luis Suarez in the 67th minute.\n\nThe veteran striker nearly scored moments later, with the 37-year-old's shot hitting the post as he sank to his knees in frustration.\n\nColombia had a golden opportunity to seal the win in the 88th minute when they won the ball back in Uruguay's penalty box, but Mateus Uribe sent his low shot wide.\n\nHe saw another one deflect off the goalkeeper and cannon off the crossbar in added time.\n\nColombia, who extended their unbeaten run to 28 games, held on for a famous win

Despite several injuries, contentious refereeing decisions, and a second half filled with valiant defending, Colombia extended its unbeaten streak to 27 games straight with their win over Uruguay. They looked terrifying in transition, divebombing their pitiable opponents with their fluid, dribble-heavy front four. James Rodriguez, now 32 and playing with Sao Paulo, looked like he was 23 again lighting up Real Madrid.\n\nColombia showed why they were the most dominant team in South America, even over Brazil and Argentina, with their first-half performance against Uruguay. The attack looked beautiful to watch, often connecting, drawing themselves out of position, and beating their markers one-on-one.\n\nJames, who has found his rhythm this Copa America, created three chances throughout the match. Luis Diaz looked electric down the left, holding the ball up at times, but drifting into the middle other times to set up teams. Colombia is a team full of experience, both with their clubs and each other. They seem poised yet patient, thrillingly intense in attack but solid on defense.\n\nThe first big moment was a rough tackle on Colombia striker Jhon Cordoba, which injured Cordoba's tackler. While putting in a tackle on Cordoba, key anchoring midfielder Rodrigo Bentacur collided with Mathias Olivera. It took Bentacur several minutes to get up, and when he did, he was accompanied by a pained grimace and a clutched thigh. Bentacur eventually had to leave the game early.\n\nThe first big moment in their high-tempo match came through the speedy Darwin Nunez. After a give-and-go with Mathias Olivera, Nunez danced past center-back Carlos Cuesta. The Liverpool striker got the ball to the top of the box, and with keeper Camilo Vargas off his line, he had a fair shot on goal. But, his curling effort spun just over the crossbar.\n\nJames created something out of nothing with his set-piece magic. Rodriguez floated a cross towards the back post, meeting a powerful header from Jefferson Lerma. Lerma's effort narrowly squeaked past keeper Sergio Rochet, and just like that, Colombia had their opener.\n\nAnd then, tremors. The sound and feel of Colombia fans jumping in their seats could have passed for an earthquake. Bank of America Stadium looked vibrant with the yellow jerseys that scattered the stadium.\n\nIt seemed only moments later that the excitement would turn to dread. After Daniel Munoz had a brief argument with a Uruguay defender, Manuel Ugarte put his hand on Munoz's shoulder and another in Munoz's rib cage. Munoz turned around and gave Ugarte a reactionary elbow.\n\nAlthough the conflict was brief, it was enough for the referee to give Munoz a yellow card, his second of the day. Despite protests from Colombia staff and players, Munoz took the walk of shame as halftime neared. Colombia would have to defend their one-goal lead with ten men.\n\nAround 10 minutes after halftime, Colombia's skillful midfielder Richard Rios took a tough tackle from Maximiliano Araujo. Rios, who looked injured and begged for treatment, was initially disregarded by the ref until the protests of James delayed the game. James got booked, but Rios got treatment and eventually left out of the game. The scenario showed questionable refereeing and set the tone for a physical first half.\n\nIt took several valiant efforts to keep Uruguay from equalizing. Vargas came up with an incredible stop against Nunez in the 65th minute, selflessly shielding the near post by sacrificing his body. Luis Suarez hit the post after receiving a well-hit Federico Valverde pass. The Inter Miami striker seemed dumbfounded and frustrated that his shot pinged off the woodwork -- Suarez hasn't scored for Uruguay since March 2022.\n\nDespite going down a man, Colombia was still lethal in transition. In the 89th minute, with fatigue setting in, super-sub Luis Sinisterra scampered onto a clumsily-hit Rochet pass in the box. Sinisterra shoved it towards teammate Kevin Castano. Castano passed to Matheus Uribe at the edge of the box, but his shot rolled narrowly wide of the post.\n\nUribe had a chance to redeem himself in stoppage time after Castano played Sinisterra through on goal. Sinisterra squared the ball to Uribe with only the keeper to beat from 12 yards out, but Uribe sent his shot flying into Rochet. The shot bounced off the inside of the crossbar and outside of the net, to the dismay of Uribe. Luckily, it didn't matter. Despite the embarrassing miss, the referee blew his full-time whistle to the excited whoops of Colombian fans.\n\nThe customary pitch invasion from the players and the half-field celebrations were marred by antics from the Uruguayan players. Uruguay and Colombia got into a brawl after the game, with Suarez one of the players having to be separated. Darwin Nunez led a fight in the stands, with Uruguayan players fighting Colombia fans in a scene resembling Malice at the Palace. However, reports emerged that Colombia fans 'avalanched' the section of the players' families. Nunez was seen consoling his distraught two-year-old son after the scene.\n\nColombia will travel to Miami to face Argentina on Sunday. If Colombia wins, it will be their first Copa America title since beating Mexico on home turf in 2001. It would be a deserved victory for a Colombia side that has looked dominant throughout the tournament. Uruguay will stay in Charlotte to take on Canada in the third-place game.", "source": {"uri": "worldsoccertalk.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Soccer Talk"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Several big-name players were involved in the fight including the Liverpool and Uruguay striker Darwin Nunez who appeared to punch a fan and had to be held back in the midst of the violence.\n\nAccording to Uruguay defender Jose Maria Gimenez, several Colombian fans had turned aggressive towards the families of the Uruguay players who were sitting in the stands with children present amongst them. \"This is a disaster, our family was in danger,\" \"We had to get into the stands to get our loved ones out, with small newborn babies. There was not a single police officer and we were there standing up for our own,\" said Gimenez after the match. According to Marco Bielsa, the Uruguay coach did not see the drama unfold as he had already gone into the dressing room. \"There was some argument in the midfield, and when I saw that happening, I went to the locker room. I thought they were thanking the fans for their support, But then I learned there were some problems over there, unfortunately.\" Said Bielsa when asked about the situation.\n\nSeveral visuals have surfaced of Darwin Nunez getting punched by a fan and also of him punching a fan in the face in the violent aftermath of the match. There were already instances of emotions flaring after the final whistle when it was seen that Luis Suarez was seen scuffling with a few players and coaches. The governing body of Copa America 2024, CONMEBOL released a strong statement after the violent acts stating that- \"CONMEBOL strongly condemns any act of violence that affects football. Our work is based on the conviction that soccer connects and unites us through its positive values. There is no place for intolerance and violence on and off the field,\" the organization said. \"We invite everyone in the remaining days to pour all their passion into cheering on their national teams and having an unforgettable party.\"", "source": {"uri": "zeenews.india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zee News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vienna"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vienna"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONMEBOL", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CONMEBOL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2024/07/11/1436608-untitled-design-2024-07-11t124739.284.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723292", "eventUri": "eng-9723292", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Despite Uruguay having 61.9 percent possession, Colombia held on to reach the championship for the first time since winning its only Copa title as host in 2001.\n\nColombia extended its unbeaten streak to a team record 28 games, one more than from 1992-94 and the longest current streak in men's international soccer.\n\n\"They are very hungry as players and very eager and they really add many elements to their game beyond the tactical side,\" Lorenzo said.\n\nIn a match that included seven yellow cards in addition to the red, players from both teams pushed and shoved in a scrum on the field at the final whistle. Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez and about a dozen Uruguay teammates went into the stands as fans brawled.\n\nA video showed N\u00fa\u00f1ez hitting a fan in Colombian team colors.

Rodr\u00edguez has six assists in the tournament -- triple the total of any other player.\n\nMu\u00f1oz received his first yellow card from Mexican referee C\u00e9sar Ramos in the 31st minute for a reckless slide tackle on Maximiliano Ara\u00fajo and his second for elbowing Manuel Ugarte in the stomach.\n\nRodr\u00edguez was given a yellow card in the 55th minute for arguing with Ramos when the referee failed to stop play after Richard R\u00edos was kicked on a shin by Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez.\n\nR\u00edos was removed on a stretcher, re-entered the match, then went down in another challenge and was substituted in the 62nd minute. Rodr\u00edguez was removed at the same time to keep him eligible for the final.\n\nColombia goalkeeper Camilo Vargas didn't have to make his first save until he stopped Nicol\u00e1s de la Cruz in the 68th minute.\n\nLuis Su\u00e1rez, Uruguay's career leader with 68 goals, entered in the 66th minute and hit the outside of a post with a shot in the 71st.

Objects, including drinks, food, and other projectiles, were also launched back and forth between the opposing factions.\n\nWhile Uruguay will now face Canada in the third-place play-off, the post-match incident casts a shadow over the tournament.

cross on the left, finding Daniel Munoz at the back post but the full-back's header was off target.\n\nUruguay were, as always, a threat on the counter-attack and their Liverpool star, Darwin Nunez,

(AP) -- Jefferson Lerma scored in the 39th minute, and Colombia played a man short the entire second half in a 1-0 win over Uruguay on Wednesday night to reach the Copa America final against Lionel Messi and Argentina.\n\nDaniel Mu\u00f1oz was ejected in first-half stoppage time for his second yellow card, but Colombia held on to reach the championship for the first time since winning its only Copa title as host in 2001. Colombia extended its unbeaten streak to a team record 28 games, one more than from 1992-94 and the longest current streak in men's international soccer.\n\nIn a contentious match that included seven yellow cards and one red, players from both teams pushed and shoved in a scrum on the field at the final whistle. Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez and about a dozen Uruguay teammates went into the stands as fans brawled. A video showed N\u00fa\u00f1ez hitting a fan in Colombian team colors.\n\nDefending champion Argentina and Colombia meet Sunday night at Miami Gardens, Florida. The Albiceleste are seeking a record 16th Copa title and are looking to join Spain from 2008-12 as the only countries to win three straight major championships.\n\nUruguay stays in Charlotte to meet Canada in Saturday night's third-place match.\n\nBefore an overwhelmingly pro-Colombia crowd of 70,644 that filled Bank of America Stadium with yellow jerseys and flags, Uruguay fell behind for the first time in the tournament.\n\nJames Rodr\u00edguez's corner kick was headed in from short range by Lerma, who outjumped Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez for his third international goal and second of the tournament. Rodr\u00edguez has six assists in the tournament -- triple the total of any other player.\n\nMu\u00f1oz received his first yellow card from Mexican referee C\u00e9sar Ramos in the 31st minute for a reckless slide tackle on Maximiliano Ara\u00fajo and his second for elbowing Manuel Ugarte in the stomach.\n\nRodr\u00edguez was given a yellow card in the 55th minute for arguing with Ramos when the referee failed to stop play after Richard R\u00edos was kicked on a shin by Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez.\n\nR\u00edos was removed on a stretcher, re-entered the match, then went down in another challenge and was substituted in the 62nd minute. Rodr\u00edguez was removed at the same time to keep him eligible for the final.\n\nColombia goalkeeper Camilo Vargas didn't have to make his first save until he stopped Nicol\u00e1s de la Cruz in the 68th minute.\n\nLuis Su\u00e1rez, Uruguay's career leader with 68 goals, entered in the 66th minute and hit the outside of a post with a shot in the 71st. He grasped his head in his hands in disgust.\n\nColombia's Mateus Uribe, another second-half sub, put an open shot wide in the 88th, and Uribe's open shot in the fourth minute of stoppage time ricocheted off the body of sliding goalkeeper Sergio Rochet and then the crossbar.\n\nUruguay moved Rochet up the field in the final minute, desparate for a goal.\n\nThe match was played in 90-degree heat on a surface that was converted from artificial turf to grass in the weeks leading up the game.\n\nPlayers on the NFL's Carolina Panthers have been outspoken about soccer teams having the luxury of playing on grass on their home field. NFL games at venue are played on artificial turf, which players say leaves them more susceptible to injuries.\n\n___\n\nAP Copa America coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/copa-america", "source":

And in doing so, he has matched the all-time record in Copa America history.\n\nThe midfielder delivered a perfect corner kick for Jefferson Lerma to head into the back of the net. And his goal ended up being the match-winner, in what was a tense game in the Bank of America Stadium.\n\nA brawl broke out between the Uruguay players and Colombia fans, with Darwin Nunez punching a fan in the process. The players said that their families were at risk due misbehaviour from opposition patrons and the lack of security in the area only complicated matters.", "source": {"uri": "technosports.co.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechnoSports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arsh_das@technosports.co.in", "name": "Arsh Das", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Rock_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hard Rock Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Rodr\u00edguez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Rodr\u00edguez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shutout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Valverde", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federico Valverde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corner_kick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corner kick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Lerma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson Lerma"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://technosports.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GSK9YDFXoAAF9mP.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723292", "eventUri": "eng-9723292", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Stadium, it was like a home game in Bogota with only pockets of Uruguayan supporters breaking up the wall of yellow on all four sides of the venue.\n\nNot surprisingly in such an atmosphere, Colombia started strongly with their livewire Liverpool winger Luis Diaz doing well to wriggle some space for a cross on the left, finding Daniel Munoz at the back post but the full-back's header was off target.\n\nUruguay were, as always, a threat on the counter-attack and their Liverpool star, Darwin Nunez, was close to finishing off one break when Rodrigo Bentancur found him with a clever pass but the forward poked his shot wide.\n\nNunez had another opening when Maximiliano Araujo played him clear in the inside-right channel but the striker rushed his shot, blasting high and wide.\n\nAt the other end, Colombia forced a turnover which led to James Rodriguez curling in a cross from the right but Jhon Cordoba's header was off target.", "source": {"uri": "jamaicaobserver.com", "dataType":

Former Leeds United boss Bielsa told the media: \"Uruguay was in a clear condition to win this match if you assess the individual talent in each squad.

Nunez was among the Uruguay players who went up into the stands at the end of the clash and appeared to become involved in altercations with supporters wearing the yellow shirts of Colombia.\n\nSouth American football's governing body, CONMEBOL, responded by stating: \"CONMEBOL strongly condemns any act of violence that affects football.

We invite everyone in the remaining days to pour all their passion into cheering on their teams and having an unforgettable party.\"\n\nA full investigation is now expected from CONMEBOL and FIFA may even get involved to determine the full reasons behind the unsavoury scenes.\n\nUruguay defender Jose Maria Gimenez branded the incident a \"disaster\" and criticised the lack of police present on site. \"It was a disaster; there was no police and we had to defend our families,\" said Gimenez. \"This is because of two or three who have one drink too many.

It has been suggested that he was stepping in to defend his family after initially climbing up to the area where his partner, Lorena Manas, was watching the game.\n\nNunez is staring down the possibility of a significant suspension for his involvement in the brawl. Liverpool are set to reach out to the 25-year-old when the time difference allows them to check in on his and his family's welfare after a distressing evening in Charlotte.\n\nThe club will also speak directly to the Uruguay Football Federation to get their version of events and it's understood no official statement will be imminent with Anfield officials keen to establish all the facts around the incident before determining the best course of action.\n\nWhile what happens next is unclear at this current time, should Nunez not be handed a swift suspension, his tournament is not actually over.\n\nUnlike the European Championship, the Copa America has a third-place play-off, with Uruguay next in action against Canada in the early hours of Sunday morning (UK time). As things stand, Nunez is free to play in the game.\n\nLiverpool traditionally give their international players a three-week break following close-season excursions with their countries. Therefore, Nunez is not expected back to start pre-season until the start of August.

Their last defeat dates back to February 2022, served to them by the opposition that awaits them in the final of the ongoing tournament on Sunday.\n\nUruguay had their chances to go in front throughout the 90 minutes but struggled to guide the ball into the back of the net.\n\nLiverpool's ace Darwin Nunez attempted to side-foot the ball inside the back of the net, but his shot was a whisker away from his target in the 19th minute.\n\nIt was Rodriguez who carried the attacking threat and paved the way for Colombia to lift their first Copa America title since 2001.\n\nIn front of an avid atmosphere created by the ecstatic fans, he served the ball to Jefferson Lerma, who headed the ball into the net in the 39th minute of the game.\n\nDespite going in front, Colombia's task to defend their slender one-goal advantage became an intricate affair. Defender Daniel Munoz swung his elbow at Uruguay's Manuel Ugarte, was shown a second yellow card and got sent off the field in the first-half stoppage time.\n\nWith time running out, Uruguay decided to introduce one of their most prolific strikers, Luis Suarez, into the thick of the action.\n\nIn the 71st minute, he had the opportunity to bring the game back on level terms but failed to deliver in the decisive moment.\n\nColombia struck the crossbar in the final minutes of the game, but one goal turned out to be sufficient to seal their date with Argentina in the final.

There, it will face a stiff task against Lionel Messi and reigning World Cup champion Argentina, which cruised through its half of the field while allowing a single goal in five games.\n\nColombia and Argentina will face off Sunday night in Miami. Canada and\n\nWednesday's semifinal was played in Charlotte, but might as well have been hosted in Bogot\u00e1. The Bank of America stands were packed with fans sporting yellow Colombia jerseys eager to cheer their team on. Colombia delivered for those fans in a testy game that tallied six yellow cards saw a red-card ejection.\n\nColombia entered Wednesday's game as the highest-scoring team in the tournament (11 goals), fresh off a 5-0 quarterfinal win over Panama. It struck first on a corner kick in the 38th minute. James Rodr\u00edguez sent the ball to the back post on the corner kick, where Jefferson Lerma leapt high in the air and squeezed the ball between the post and goalkeeper Sergio Rochet.\n\nThe goal was just the second allowed by Uruguay all tournament.\n\nColombia's defense, meanwhile, stifled a Uruguay offense that scored nine goals in four games en route to Wednesday's matchup.

Mu\u00f1oz was tossed, and Colombia was set to play the second half a man down.\n\nUruguay's offense was much improved after halftime as it controlled the ball and put two of its seven shots on goal. But it didn't convert on the scoreboard as Colombia held on for victory.\n\nThe tension that marked the game throughout carried over at midfield after the final whistle.

Colombia has now extended its record unbeaten streak to 28 games as it heads to Miami next to take on Lionel Messi and Argentina for the South American title on Sunday.\n\nAfter the melee had subsided, Uruguayan captain Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez told reporters that his teammates had acted in response to a group of Colombia fans attacking the Uruguayan players' families, who were seated in a section near the touchline. \"They stormed all our families,\" Gim\u00e9nez said, complaining about the lack of official security intervention. \"This is a disaster.

Colombia progressed to the title clash despite being reduced to 10 men as Lerma's winner secured their spot in Sunday's final, leaving Uruguay to reflect on what could have been.\n\n\"Uruguay was in a clear condition to win this match if you assess the individual talent in each squad,\" Bielsa told reporters post-match. \"I manage the team that, in my opinion, had the stronger individual talent vis- -vis the opponent, and we weren't able to make the difference that I thought we were going to make if you compared both formations.\" Uruguay, a team with a storied history and 15 Copa America titles, entered the tournament as one of the favorites. They had impressive victories over hosts United States and five-time World Cup champions Brazil, but could not replicate that form against Colombia.\n\n\"I am personally liable for not achieving the result, despite having these players that were capable of being superior than the opponent,\" Bielsa continued. \"We were not able to seize our extra man advantage, and when a team wins with less individual talent, logically, the manager that is coaching the weaker team shows that he is superior than the coach that had the best players.\"\n\nUruguay had several opportunities to score in the first half but struggled to create clear chances after Colombia's Daniel Munoz was sent off just before halftime. Bielsa noted the disruption this caused to the match's flow.\n\n\"The first half, even if we didn't dominate possession, it was very even, and we should have made the difference. With one man down in the second half for Colombia, the match was completely interrupted,\" Bielsa explained. \"It was constantly start and stop. We should have created more chances and caused damage to the opponent. In the last minutes, they could have scored because they had clear chances. But we tried every possible way, every possible path.\"\n\nThe aftermath of the match saw clashes between Uruguay players and Colombia fans in the stands, prompting an investigation by CONMEBOL. Uruguay will now face Canada in the third-place playoff match on Saturday, seeking to salvage some pride from their Copa America campaign.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_Bielsa", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marcelo Bielsa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Lerma", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson Lerma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ejection (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONMEBOL", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CONMEBOL"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202407/uruguay-coach-marcelo-bielsa-114310747-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=5DyltWOFnBIOqNXcAgRr0El5Jns2XXDo", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723292", "eventUri": "eng-9723292", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

South American football federation CONMEBOL have released statement condemning the actions and will launch a full scale investigation into what exactly happened.\n\nNunez's Uruguay met with Colombia in the semi-final, vying for a spot in Sunday's final against Argentina. Colombia were the victors, however, clinching a 1-0 victory, thanks to a goal from Jefferson Lerma 40 minutes into the game.\n\nThe Colombians had to play half of the match with only 10 players after Daniel Munoz, Lerma's teammate from Crystal Palace, was sent off after receiving two yellow cards. Despite having an extra player, Nunez and Uruguay couldn't capitalise on the advantage, and Colombia managed to hold their ground in Charlotte, North Carolina, securing the win.\n\nREAD MORE: Luis Diaz and Luis Suarez gestures to Darwin Nunez after Copa America brawl sum them up\n\nREAD MORE: Darwin Nunez outburst speaks volumes as Liverpool star feels pressure\n\nHowever, things took a turn for the worse after the final whistle, when a brawl erupted in the stands - and Nunez was at the heart of it. The Liverpool forward led the Uruguayan squad into the crowd, much to the displeasure of the Colombian fans.\n\nNunez seemed to be struck by one of the fans, before he defended himself. Security quickly intervened and tried to defuse the situation, escorting Nunez and his teammates back to the changing room. The scenes were widely criticised by South America's governing body, CONMEBOL, in the aftermath.\n\nA statement from CONMEBOL disclosed: \"CONMEBOL strongly condemns any act of violence that affects football. Our work is based on the conviction that football connects us and unites us, through its positive values. There is no place for intolerance and violence on and off the field. We invite everyone in the remaining days to pour all their passion into cheering on their teams and having an unforgettable party.\"\n\nAUF president Ignacio Alonso also addressed the incident, but defended his players who, he claims acted in the best interest of their families' safety.\n\n\"The Uruguayan players had an instinctive, natural reaction, which was to defend the children who were being attacked, their wives, parents, siblings. It was a natural, instinctive reaction that was rational given the events that were taking place,\" Alonso said (via ESPN).\n\n\"We were in a box, where we had some attacks and we protected some children, opening the area to some kids who were scared and having some crises, but fundamentally what is worrying is what happened down on the field, where there was more diligence in repairs than in precaution.\n\n\"They quickly followed the evacuation protocol and we were able to resolve the situation, not without some inconvenience that you all saw. We are analyzing the images. There is no one who is currently in difficulty and measures were taken so that they could receive transport in appropriate places.\n\n\"Assistance was provided to those who had panic attacks, and now we are going to review them a little more at the hotel. In all tournaments, families are in the stands, there is usually a cordon or something similar, especially for a stadium that was 95% sold out before the start of the cup.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joshua_lees@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Joshua Lees", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONMEBOL", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CONMEBOL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin,_Northern_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Lerma", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson Lerma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ejection (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_D\u00edaz_(footballer,_born_1997)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luis D\u00edaz (footballer, born 1997)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguayan_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uruguayan Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/article33216401.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_gettyimages-2161546600.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723292", "eventUri": "eng-9723292", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

The former Real Madrid midfielder registered his sixth assist of the tournament as Jefferson Lerma's headed effort beat Sergio Rochet at his near post to put Colombia 1-0 up.\n\nEverything was going well for Colombia up until stoppage time near the end of the first 45. Crystal Palace full-back Daniel Munoz was shown a red card after elbowing Manuel Ugarte, and the 28-year-old pleaded his case to referee Cesar Arturo Ramos as replays showed Ugarte shoving him near his midsection. However, Ramos wasn't buying it, and Colombia were down to 10 players with a one goal lead.\n\nDespite playing the entire second half with 10 players, Colombia managed to survive and advance to the final with a resilient defensive showing. While Uruguay experienced heartbreak, they still have plenty to be proud of with their new identity under Marcelo Bielsa.\n\nAs for Nestor Lorenzo's Colombia, things just keep continuing to fall in place for the South American nation led by Rodriguez. Colombia have been one of the best teams at the tournament and rightfully deserve a place in the final where they come up against reigning champions Argentina and Lionel Messi.\n\nIt'll be a tough task in taking down the best national team in the world, but Colombia are more than capable of pulling off an upset to lift their second-ever Copa America title in over two decades.\n\nGK: Sergio Rochet - 6/10 - Denied Richard Rios from close range to make up for his near-post shortcomings on Lerma's header.\n\nCB: Sebastian Caceres - 7/10 - Didn't put a foot wrong in the backline against a talented Colombia attack.\n\nCB: Jose Gimenez - 6/10 - A decent performance outside of Lerma jumping over him to head home the winning goal in the first half.\n\nCB: Mathias Olivera - 7/10 - One of Uruguay's better players from the first half that was unfortunately taken off at the begging of the second 45.\n\nDM: Manuel Ugarte - 7/10 - Was pretty much everywhere for Uruguay, even filling in at center-back during parts of the first half.\n\nDM: Federico Valverde - 7/10 - Calm and composed on the ball as always from the Real Madrid figure. However, it wasn't enough to send La Celeste to the final.\n\nRM: Facundo Pellistri - 6/10 - Couldn't get into a rhythm down the right-hand side and was hooked for Olivera.\n\nAM: Nicolas de la Cruz - 7/10 - Uruguay were already under considerable pressure in the first half and de la Cruz getting booked with a super late challenge didn't help things. He rebounded with a much better performance in the second half, though.\n\nAM: Rodrigo Bentancur - 6/10 - Displayed good movement with tidy passing under pressure before being forced off due to a lower leg injury.\n\nLM: Maxi Araujo - 5/10 - Invisible for the most part. Just didn't provide Uruguay with any presence on the left-wing.\n\nST: Darwin Nunez - 5/10 - The Liverpool forward was presented with a couple of golden opportunities at the top of the Colombia penalty area but couldn't covert.\n\nSUB: Guillermo Varela (35' for Bentancur) - 5/10 - Didn't help the cause by getting booked before being taken off in place of Suarez.\n\nSUB: Giorgian de Arrascaeta (46' for Olivera) - 6/10 - Helped speed the tempo up in the midfield at times after coming on.\n\nSUB: Cristian Olivera (46' for Pellistri) - 6/10 - Set up what would've been the equalizing goal had Suarez's converted inside the penalty area.\n\nSUB: Luis Suarez (67' for Varela) - 6/10 - Unlucky to not level the score as his right-footed shot smacked the post.\n\nSUB: Agustin Canobbio (90' for de la Cruz) - N/A\n\nMarcelo Bielsa - 6/10 - The former Leeds United boss came out in full force with a very attacking lineup that many questioned before kick-off -- which isn't a huge surprise exactly except for the fact that a trip to the final was on the line. His decision to gamble and change things up wasn't what was needed for a match of this nature, but Uruguay proved they can once again hang with the best as the 2026 World Cup approaches.", "source":

Heading into Wednesday's semifinal against Uruguay, Colombia has had things its own way at the Copa Am\u00e9rica, scoring goals for fun, and winning three of their four matches, with the lone blemish -- if you can call it that -- a draw with Brazil.\n\nBut in Wednesday's match, Colombia had to summon all of its reserves. Los Cafeteros played more than half the match with 10 men following Daniel Munoz's second yellow card in in first-half stoppage-time. But it was able to ride more set piece brilliance from James Rodr\u00edguez, some stretched-to-the-limit defending, and yes, some luck too to prevail 1-0, earning a trip to just the third Copa final in its history.\n\n\"I think this is a squad that is giving its all, and beyond the circumstances of the match, they really deserve this and we're very happy,\" said Colombia manager Nestor Lorenzo, with the help of a translator. \"We're very happy for bringing joy to the Colombian people.\"\n\nUruguay is a team that loves to shove teams -- literally sometimes -- out of their comfort zone, pressing all over the field in a bid to achieve maximum chaos. After a slow start, La Celeste appeared to be doing exactly that, with Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez twice going close. Jefferson Lerma's goal, however, put Colombia ahead just before half-time. But then Munoz's ill-advised elbow to Manuel Ugarte's chest -- especially in the age of VAR -- earned him a second caution and the player advantage to Uruguay.\n\n\"One of the main topics we discuss is that we never want to be one man down,\" said Lorenzo. \"It is almost impossible to maintain performance with 10 players on the pitch. Teams that were dominating their opponents, when they were one man down, were eliminated from the tournament.\"\n\nColombia proved to be the exception, with Lorenzo maximizing his bench, and the team going beyond what it thought possible.\n\n\"We always talk about multiplying the efforts. Sometimes 10 can make the effort of 12 players,\" said Lorenzo.\n\nFor Uruguay manager Marcelo Bielsa, the ejection was the ultimate poisoned gift. Instead of being able to pounce on turnovers and create opportunities in transition, Uruguay was faced with the prospect of trying to break down a Colombia side that was increasingly content to sit back and defend. The chaotic became predictable.\n\n\"I would have preferred to avoid the sending off of the Colombian player because what happened in the second half,\" he said. \"Given the way in which Colombia had to play to maintain the situation with one man down, it created greater challenges than the ones we were facing when they were 11.\"\n\nIt helped Colombia's cause that another moment of magic from Rodriguez had helped Los Cafeteros into a lead, with his corner-kick setting up Lerma for the game's only goal. It was Rodriguez's record-breaking sixth assist of the tournament, continuing his stellar run through this Copa Am\u00e9rica. But for Lorenzo, there were 14 other heroes.\n\n\"I think it's a group that wants to be protagonist of this tournament. They want to win,\" he said. \"They are very hungry as players and eager and they really add many elements to the game beyond the tactical side. I think we we're at the pivotal moment and we also see that there are some weaknesses that we need to overcome. And until you overcome those, you cannot grow. And when you do overcome those obstacles, you can evolve. So, I think we're doing very well and yes, we are moving forward.\"\n\nRodriguez's performance was in contrast to that of another legendary player in Uruguay's Luis Su\u00e1rez. Bielsa threw Suarez on with 23 minutes remaining in a bid to find the elusive goal that would take the match to penalties. Suarez had his opportunities too. He had a wide-open look at goal in the 72nd minute, only to hit the outside of the post. He had a chance to create danger two minutes later only to shank his touch over the end line when he had considerable space in the box.\n\nIt was one of many situations in which Lorenzo got the better of Bielsa. For a time, the Colombia manager continued to play with two forwards after Munoz's sending off, before resorting to a five-man back line late, as Colombia began to tire. Lorenzo's side actually came closest to scoring, but substitute Mateus Uribe squandered a pair of wide-open chances late. It didn't matter. Colombia survived. As for Lorenzo, he refused to look at the match as a contest of managers.\n\n\"I think that to beat Bielsa you need to walk many miles,\" he said. \"He is a revered coach and I really admire him as a person, and it was our turn to win.\"\n\nIf there was anything to take a shine off the game, it was the post-match melee in which several Uruguay players went into the stands to battle Colombia fans after they felt their family members were in danger. The apparent lack of sufficient security will certainly go down as another instance where CONMEBOL's poor organization of the tournament was revealed. The image of Nunez comforting his child will be one of the enduring images of the tournament.\n\nNow Lorenzo, an Argentine, finds himself going up against the country of his birth in the final. He mentioned that his friends have been talking about the possibility. But Lorenzo has been laying down some Columbian roots for some time. He was an assistant with Colombia for seven years under Jose Pekerman during one of the stops the two made together, and he's been in charge of the senior team since 2022.\n\n\"I think it will be a very beautiful moment,\" he said of Sunday's final. \"I will be next to players that I have known throughout my career and really admire.\"\n\nAs for the team itself, this is new ground to a degree. Los Cafeteros have but one Copa Am\u00e9rica title to their name, from back in 2001, and were beaten finalists on one other occasion in 1975. The semifinals have been a veritable graveyard, however. Seven times previously Colombia has fallen in that round, including three years ago when Argentina beat then on penalties on their way to the title. At last, the semifinal hoodoo has been vanquished.

In a way, they already are.\n\nDarwin Nunez misses, mazy Luis Diaz runs, Luis Suarez hysterics, lung-busting end-to-end action - you'd be forgiven for forgetting that this match was a Copa America semifinal taking place in North Carolina.\n\nWednesday's matchup between Colombia and Uruguay - played in an American footballs stadium, no less - had an overwhelming Premier League flavor as Colombia clung to a 1-0 win in an extremely heated clash.\n\nReally, there was something for everybody, including Darwin Nunez's many skeptics after the Liverpool forward burned three chances in the first half - one which caused teammate Federico Valverde to pound the floor in frustration.\n\nThere would be plenty more British-based influence.\n\nLiverpool's Darwin Nunez had a brutal night as he missed several great chances to score\n\nCrystal Palace's Jefferson Lerma notched the lone goal for Cololmbia, who are now in the Copa America finals\n\nCrystal Palace midfielder Jefferson Lerma scored the opener for Colombia, who also started Liverpool's Luis Diaz and former Spurs midfielder Rodrigo Bentancur.\n\nLerma's Eagles teammate Daniel Munoz was also sent off for a second, silly yellow card on the stroke of half time when he elbowed Manuel Ugarte, while Man United's Facundo Pellestri bustled up and down the wing - without much luck.\n\nAnd Liverpool legend - and current Inter Miami star - Luis Suarez was brought on as a second half-substitute with Uruguay chasing a goal. He almost just got them one when he hit the post from inside the box.\n\nMake no mistake about it, though: despite the current Premier League players and alums, this was a decidedly South American affair, as a sea of yellow filled the Bank of America Stadium stands, and the streets of Charlotte before.\n\nOne Colombian reporter even performed a prayer in Spanish right before kick off.\n\nHe may have needed it during a hectic, end-to-end night that saw Colombia clinging to their slender lead towards the end.\n\nThings seemed to go off the rails for Colombia when Richard Rios got hurt in the second half. Not necessarily because of his play prior, but because of the feverish reaction it elicited as Uruguay continued play with him crumpled in the corner.\n\nJames Rodriguez angrily beelined the referee and got in his face during the next stoppage and was subsequently booked. The yellow didn't do much damage, but the moment of madness saw Uruguay creep back in the game.\n\nNunez again saw a chance go begging when the ball got stuck in his feet in the box, before Colombia's Camilo Vargas made a fairly miraculous diving save in the 68th minute.\n\nThere was a (discarded) penalty shout too, and more memorably a chance that the ever-lethal Suarez spurned from close in the 71st minute.\n\nThe miss caused him to fall to the ground in anguish, before Valverde whizzed a shot wide minutes later.\n\nColombia, barely, would hold on despite sub Mateus Uribe missing two golden chances after coming on as a sub. The first of which, in the 88th minute, was hit wide from point-blank range and the second - which was even harder to miss - somehow ricocheting off of Rochet onto the bar.\n\nUruguay kept pushing - after Maximiliano Araujo saw his shot saved in the 88th - but ultimately came up short.\n\nMore to follow", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"},

Speculation has emerged that Suarez attempted to bite Miguel Borja in a viral video, which then kickstarted the fight. Uruguay players, including Darwin Nunez, were then involved in a fight between players and Colombia supporters in the stands of the stadium.\n\nColombia's Copa America semi-final against Uruguay descended into chaos after the final whistle, with players getting involved in a mass brawl both amongst themselves and with fans in the crowd. And a video of Luis Suarez has since gone viral, with fans speculating that he tried to bite an opposition player which led to tempers flaring on the pitch.\n\nTuesday night's match was a feisty encounter as both teams looked to book their place in the final, with the victor going on to face Argentina. It was Colombia who took the lead in the game, thanks to Crystal Palace's Jefferson Lerma.\n\nNestor Lorenzo's side were then dealt a blow when Daniel Munoz was sent off shortly before half-time for elbowing Manuel Ugarte, but despite Uruguay's efforts after the interval, they could not find an equaliser. Frustration continued to build as the game wore on, with a total of eight yellow cards shown before full time in their 1-0 defeat.\n\nRelated Ranking the Top 11 South American Footballers in History\n\nFrom Lionel Messi to Ronaldo, South America has produced some of the greatest players of all-time.\n\nSuarez Confronts Miguel Borja at Full Time Fans speculate he tried to bite Colombian\n\nTempers seemingly boiled over after the final whistle went, which confirmed Uruguay's elimination from the competition. Players and coaching staff clashed on the field, and it was Suarez's actions which seemingly set things off.\n\nFootage after the game appears to show the former Liverpool man walking up to Miguel Borja following the game and leaning in towards his shoulder. Some have said that he attempted to bite the forward before he walked away to talk to James Rodriguez. That then led to everything kicking off, with Suarez even seen throwing a punch at one member of Colombia's coaching staff.\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time that Suarez attempted to bite a player, having committed three similar offences during his career. While at Ajax in 2010, he bit PSV's Otman Bakkal on the shoulder, which led to a seven-game suspension. He then received a 10 game ban for biting Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic while at Liverpool, before then being suspended for four months by FIFA after biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini in 2014.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Luis Suarez is Uruguay's top scorer of all time with 68 goals, 10 more than Edinson Cavani who is in second place and 32 more than third-placed Diego Forlan.\n\nDarwin Nunez Fights in Crowd After Game Players seemingly concerned over the safety of their families\n\nSuarez's actions likely would have received more attention were it not for the wild scenes off the pitch which then emerged after the final whistle. Uruguay players were seen storming into the crowd to confront Colombia's supporters, with footage even showing Darwin Nunez fighting them in the stands.\n\nThe reason behind the scuffle off the pitch was supposedly because of their families being made to feel unsafe by Colombia fans who were all around them. Jose Maria Giminez expressed after the match that they had to defend their loved ones, labelling the entire situation 'a disaster'. CONMEBOL were also forced to release a statement, saying that there was no place for violence at the competition.\n\n\"Our work is based on the conviction that soccer connects and unites us through its positive values. There is no place for intolerance and violence on and off the field. We invite everyone in the remaining days to pour all of their passion into cheering on their national teams and having an unforgettable party.\"\n\nUruguay will be hoping for calmer scenes when they take on Canada in their third-place playoff match on Sunday 14th July, as both teams seek to get their hands on a bronze medal.

Colombia emphatically defeated Panama in the quarter-finals 5-0, while Uruguay survived a penalty shootout against Brazil. Tonight, the two sides faced off to decide who gets to take on the reigning champions, Argentina, in the Copa America final.\n\nHow the game unfolded\n\nIn front of a stadium of yellow shirts, Colombia looked the more dangerous side in the early stages of the match, pushing forward with precision and speed to test Uruguay's makeshift backline. It was La Celeste, though, who had the first real chance of the game when Darwin Nunez released a left-footed strike that went just wide in the 17th minute. The Liverpool striker would have two more decent looks at goal, but he lacked the end product.\n\nUruguay might not have been able to capitalize on their chances, but Colombia did not make the same mistakes. Jefferson Lerma, back in the starting XI after serving a one-game suspension for yellow card accumulation, got on the end of another brilliant James Rodriguez corner with a header at the back post in the 39th minute.\n\nJust six minutes after the opening goal, Daniel Munoz, who was already booked 31st minute, received a second yellow for elbowing Manuel Ugarte in the chest. Colombia went into the locker room up a goal, but down a man.\n\nA goal for Uruguay felt inevitable in the second half, but La Celeste struggled to take advantage of their extra player. Their best chance came in the 71st minute when an unmarked Luis Suarez kissed the outside of the post with a strike from 15 yards out. Marcelo Bielsa's squad kept knocking on the door, but could not find an equalizer against Colombia's stout backline, forcing them to settle for the third place match while Colombia advanced to the Copa America final.\n\nGK: Camilo Vargas - 7/10 - Vargas kept a clean sheet tonight and made timely saves when it mattered most.\n\nRB: Daniel Munoz - 3/10 - Munoz was sent off in the first half after receiving two yellow cards, leaving his team with ten men in a must-win match.\n\nCB: Davinson Sanchez - 7/10 - Down a man, Sanchez was called upon to both maintain Colombia's clean sheet and stop Luis Suarez in the second half.\n\nCB: Carlos Cuesta - 7/10 - Cuesta carried the ball forward from the backline in the first half, contributing to Colombia's attack, but he had to stand tall in the second half to keep Uruguay off the scoresheet.\n\nLB: Johan Mojica - 6/10 - Mojica defended well tonight, especially once Colombia went down to ten men. The left-back effectively took Facundo Pellistri and Cristian Olivera out of the game.\n\nDM: Richard Rios - 6/10 - Rios is the engine of Colombia's midfield, constantly helping out on defense while also pushing forward on the attack. He was also the victim of several harsh tackles that eventually forced him off the pitch in the 61st minute.\n\nDM: Jefferson Lerma - 7/10 - After serving his one-game suspension for yellow card accumulation, Lerma returned to the starting XI and scored Colombia's only goal tonight.\n\nRM: Jhon Arias - 5/10 - Arias had a quiet first half, supporting the attack when he could. The midfielder was subbed off at halftime, though, in favor of a defender after Munoz's red card.\n\nAM: James Rodriguez - 7/10 - Rodriguez recorded his sixth assist tonight on Colombia's only goal, the most by a single player since 2011.\n\nLM: Luis Diaz - 8/10 - Diaz terrorized the right side of Uruguay's defense, using his speed and dribbling ability to take on various players and carve out goalscoring opportunities. The Liverpool player put forth a valiant effort down a man to hold the ball up.\n\nST: Jhon Cordoba - 5/10 - Cordoba found himself on the end of a couple half-chances, but the striker failed to test Sergio Rochet.\n\nSUB: Santiago Arias - 6/10 - Arias was subbed on at halftime to slot in at right-back after Munoz was sent off. Despite only making one prior appearance this Copa America, the defender did well to help his backline stop Uruguay.\n\nSUB: Mateus Uribe - 5/10 - Uribe came on for the injured Rios and brought energy to the Colombian midfield as they fought to defend with ten men. Uribe could have sealed the game in the 88th and the 94th minute, but missed both chances.\n\nSUB: Kevin Castano - 5/10 - Castano's fresh legs were a welcomed reprieve for the tired Colombians on the pitch.\n\nSUB: Yerry Mina - 6/10 - Mina was subbed on in the 75th minute to give Los Cafeteros an extra center-back.\n\nSUB: Luis Sinisterra - N/A - Sinisterra came on in the 86th minute and joined in on the defensive effort.\n\nNestor Lorenzo - 8/10 - Nestor Lorenzo deserves all the credit for leading Colombia to the Copa America 2024 final. The manager made crucial substitutions after Daniel Munoz was sent off in the first half, giving his side every chance to maintain their 1-0 lead and their unbeaten streak. It takes a certain resilience to survive down a man in a semi-final against a team that had not lost at this year's Copa America, but Lorenzo's squad came out with the victory.", "source": {"uri":

There, it will face a stiff task against Lionel Messi and reigning World Cup champion Argentina, which cruised through its half of the field while allowing a single goal in five games.\n\nThe game was played in Charlotte, but might as well have been hosted in Bogot\u00e1. The Bank of America stands were packed with fans sporting yellow Colombia jerseys eager to cheer their team on. Colombia delivered for those fans in a testy game that tallied six yellow cards saw a red-card ejection.\n\nColombia entered Wednesday's game as the highest-scoring team in the tournament (11 goals), fresh off a 5-0 quarterfinal win Panama. It struck first on a corner kick in the 38th minute. James Rodr\u00edguez sent the ball to the back post on the corner kick, where Jefferson Lerma leapt high in the air and squeezed the ball between the post and goalkeeper Sergio Rochet.\n\nThe goal was just the second allowed by Uruguay all tournament.\n\nColombia's defense, meanwhile, stifled a Uruguay offense that scored nine goals in four games en route to Wednesday's matchup. Uruguay didn't put any of its four first-half shots on goal.\n\nThe tide threatened to shift late in the second half. Colombia's Daniel Mu\u00f1oz, who picked up a yellow card earlier in the half on a tackle, picked up his second just before the half. After a scuffle following a foul on Colombia's Davinson S\u00e1nchez, Uruguay's Manuel Ugarte grabbed Mu\u00f1oz's jersey from behind.\n\nMu\u00f1oz responded with an elbow to the chest that knocked Ugarte to the turf, drawing his second yellow and ultimately a red card that led to his ejection.\n\nHead coach N\u00e9stor Lorenzo protested to no avail. Mu\u00f1oz was tossed, and Colombia was set to play the second half a man down.\n\nUruguay's offense was much improved after halftime as it controlled the ball and put two of its seven shots on goal.

The Reds are keen to establish the facts around the worrying scenes at the Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte which saw their striker enter the crowd and get involved in altercations with Colombia supporters before they make any official comment.\n\nIt comes after claims from Uruguay captain Jose Maria Gimenez that a 'disaster' could have occurred as Uruguay players' families were targeted by Colombia supporters. Gimenez, along with Ronald Araujo, Nunez, and other Uruguay players jumped into the stands and it was the Liverpool striker who was singled out in altercations.\n\nThe Atletico Madrid defender said: \"I hope that those organising this event take more care of the families, the people, and the surroundings of the stadiums because this is a disaster.\n\n\"The same thing happens in every match. Our families are suffering because of those who drink too much alcohol and behave like children with no sense. I hope they take precautions and it doesn't happen again because this is a disaster.\"\n\nColombia, despite having 10 men for the second half, held on to a 1-0 win to book a place in the final against Argentina on Sunday.\n\nBut the game will be remembered for the scenes at the end. Liverpool will now wait for the time difference to allow them to contact Nunez as part of their duty of care for the player and also speak to the Uruguayan football federation to establish the facts. Nunez, 25, could face a ban for his actions despite the potential reasoning behind it.\n\nSouth American football's governing body, CONMEBOL, said: \"CONMEBOL strongly condemns any act of violence that affects football.\n\n\"Our work is based on the conviction that football connects us and unites us, through its positive values. There is no place for intolerance and violence on and off the field.\n\n\"We invite everyone in the remaining days to pour all their passion into cheering on their teams and having an unforgettable party.\"\n\nNunez was clearly emotional as he held one of his children on the pitch after he had returned down from the stands at the American stadium.\n\nFormer Tottenham midfielder Eric Dier was given a four-match ban and fined \u00a340,000 for climbing over seats to confront a fan in March 2020. Dier claimed he was defending his brother, Patrick, in the scenes after\n\nSpurs had lost to Norwich in an FA Cup clash while he had also been abused himself. But the independent panel ruled against Dier and he was handed a ban.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Defender Daniel Munoz swung his elbow at Uruguay's Manuel Ugarte, was shown a second yellow card and got sent off the field in the first-half stoppage time.\n\nWith time running out, Uruguay decided to introduce one of their most prolific strikers, Luis Suarez, into the thick of the action.\n\nIn the 71st minute, he had the opportunity to bring the game back on level terms but failed to deliver in the decisive moment.\n\nColombia struck the crossbar in the final minutes of the game, but one goal turned out to be sufficient to seal their date with Argentina in the final.

(AP) -- Jefferson Lerma scored in the 39th minute, and Colombia played a man short the entire second half in a 1-0 win over Uruguay on Wednesday night to reach the Copa America final against Lionel Messi and Argentina.\n\nDaniel Mu\u00f1oz was ejected in first-half stoppage time for his second yellow card, but Colombia held on to reach the championship for the first time since winning its only Copa title as host in 2001. Colombia extended its unbeaten streak to a team record 28 games, one more than from 1992-94 and the longest current streak in men's international soccer.\n\nIn a contentious match that included seven yellow cards and one red, players from both teams pushed and shoved in a scrum on the field at the final whistle and some players went into the stands to scrap with fans.\n\nDefending champion Argentina and Colombia meet Sunday night at Miami Gardens, Florida. The Albiceleste are seeking a record 16th Copa title and are looking to join Spain from 2008-12 as the only countries to win three straight major championships.\n\nBefore an overwhelmingly pro-Colombia crowd of 70,644 that filled Bank of America Stadium with yellow jerseys and flags, Uruguay fell behind for the first time in the tournament.\n\nJames Rodr\u00edguez's corner kick was headed in from short range by Lerma, who outjumped Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez for his third international goal and second of the tournament. Rodr\u00edguez has six assists in the tournament -- triple the total of any other player.\n\nMu\u00f1oz received his first yellow card from Mexican referee C\u00e9sar Ramos in the 31st minute for a reckless slide tackle on Maximiliano Ara\u00fajo and his second for elbowing Manuel Ugarte in the stomach.\n\nRodr\u00edguez was given a yellow card in the 55th minute for arguing with Ramos when the referee failed to stop play after Richard R\u00edos was kicked on a shin by Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez.\n\nR\u00edos was removed on a stretcher, re-entered the match, then went down in another challenge and was substituted in the 62nd minute. Rodr\u00edguez was removed at the same time to keep him eligible for the final.\n\nColombia goalkeeper Federico Valverde didn't have to make his first save until he stopped Nicol\u00e1s de la Cruz in the 68th minute.\n\nLuis Su\u00e1rez, Uruguay's career leader with 68 goals, entered in the 66th minute and hit the outside of a post with a shot in the 71st. He grasped his head in his hands in disgust.\n\nColombia's Mateus Uribe, another second-half sub, put an open shot wide in the 88th, and Uribe's open shot in the fourth minute of stoppage time ricocheted off the body of sliding goalkeeper Sergio Rochet and then the crossbar.\n\nUruguay moved Rochet up the field in the final minute, desparate for a goal.\n\nThe match was played in 90-degree heat on a surface that was converted from artificial turf to grass in the weeks leading up the game.\n\nPlayers on the NFL's Carolina Panthers have been outspoken about soccer teams having the luxury of playing on grass on their home field. NFL games here are played artificial turf, which players say leaves them more susceptible to injuries.\n\nAP Copa America coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/copa-america", "source": {"uri":

The altercation involved players, referees, camera crews, and business executives became entangled in a frenzied scrum, the scene a blur of motion and confusion.\n\nSuarez, wearing his renowned No. 9 shirt, was spotted towering over opponents and shoving individuals thought to be from Colombia's coaching team. With tensions running high, Suarez pushed a man in a red hat off balance, igniting further chaos as a reserve Uruguayan player retaliated.\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool plan for Darwin Nunez as club prepare response to shocking scenes in South America\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool already have ready-made Van Dijk replacement to save them millions\n\nThe commentators captured the moment perfectly: \"I'll give you one guess who sparked this originally,\" before the camera focused on Suarez. \"And now it's boiling over,\" they added, witnessing more figures from the sidelines dive in to try and calm the storm.\n\nThe chaos wasn't confined to the pitch; it spilled over into the stands where Liverpool's Darwin Nunez was seen scaling barriers to confront Colombian supporters. A shirtless Nunez engaged in a fistfight, defending himself while exchanging heated words, as beverages were thrown through the air.\n\nThe crowd continued to taunt the striker as the situation turned into a chaotic spectacle. Uruguay's Jose Gimenez spoke out about the incident, claiming that the players had to step in to protect their families from aggressive Colombia fans due to a lack of police presence.\n\nGimenez commented: \"It was a disaster; there was no police and we had to defend our families.\" Colombia secured a narrow 1-0 win against Uruguay with Jefferson Lerma heading in a superb cross from James Rodriguez early on.\n\nThe victory was made more difficult when Daniel Munoz got sent off for a second bookable offence after elbowing Manuel Ugarte, leaving Colombia with ten men. Despite being a man down, Uruguay couldn't capitalise on their advantage, managing only two shots on target during the entire match.\n\nThey pushed for an equaliser, winning free kicks towards the end but were unable to make them count, with the game slipping away from them. As of now, CONMEBOL has not responded to any footage from the controversial semi-final or issued any disciplinary actions.\n\nHowever, they have previously acted quickly against violence, as seen last year when three supporters were arrested following a fight in Rio de Janeiro before the Copa Libertadores final between Boca Juniors and Fluminense.\n\nLFC: Join our WhatsApp community, sign up to a newsletter or listen to our podcasts HERE", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bruna_reis@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Bruna Reis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Ugarte_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Ugarte (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluminense_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fluminense FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Rodr\u00edguez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Rodr\u00edguez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ejection (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONMEBOL", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CONMEBOL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Libertadores", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copa Libertadores"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boca_Juniors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boca Juniors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Lerma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson Lerma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article29522558.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2161556964.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723292", "eventUri": "eng-9723292", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

Colombia extended its unbeaten streak to a team record 28 games, one more than from 1992-94 and the longest current streak in men's soccer.\n\nIn a contentious match that included seven yellow cards and one red, players from both teams pushed and shoved in a scrum on the field at the final whistle and some players went into the stands to scrap with fans.\n\nDefending champion Argentina and Colombia meet Sunday night at Miami Gardens, Florida.\n\nBefore an overwhelmingly pro-Colombia crowd at Bank of America Stadium, filled with yellow jerseys and flags, Uruguay fell behind for the first time in the tournament.\n\nJames Rodr\u00edguez's corner kick was headed in from short range by Lerma, who outjumped Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez for his third international goal and second of the tournament. Rodr\u00edguez has six assists in the tournament -- triple the total of any other player.\n\nMu\u00f1oz received his first yellow card from Mexican referee C\u00e9sar Ramos in the 31st minute for a reckless slide tackle on Maximiliano Ara\u00fajo and his second for elbowing Manuel Ugarte in the stomach.\n\nRodr\u00edguez was given a yellow card in the 55th minute for arguing with Ramos when the referee failed to stop play when Richard R\u00edos was kicked on a shin by Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez.\n\nR\u00edos was removed on a stretcher, re-entered the match, then went down in another challenge and was substituted in the 62nd minute. Rodr\u00edguez was removed at the same time to keep him eligible for the final.\n\nColombia goalkeeper Federico Valverde didn't have to make his first save until he stopped Nicol\u00e1s de la Cruz in the 68th minute.\n\nLuis Su\u00e1rez, Uruguay's career leader with 68 goals, entered in the 66th minute and hit the outside of a post with a shot in the 71st.\n\nColombia's Mateus Uribe, another second-half sub, put an open shot wide in the 88th, and Uribe's open shot in the fourth minute of stoppage time ricocheted off the body of sliding goalkeeper Sergio Rochet and then the crossbar.\n\nThe match was played in 90-degree heat on a surface that was converted from artificial turf to grass in the weeks leading up the game.\n\nArgentina is seeking a record 16th Copa America title and is looking to join Spain as the only countries to win three straight major titles.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

What Copa America rules say about brawl with Colombian fans", "body": "Uruguay's Copa America semifinal clash with Colombia descended into madness at the blow of the final whistle, with La Celeste star Darwin Nunez among a handful of Uruguay players to head into the stands to confront Colombia fans following their 1-0 defeat to Los Cafeteros.\n\nNunez was the most prominent player to enter the stands, climbing over scaffolding to get involved in the action. He greeted one rowdy Colombian supporter (who had already thrown punches at the growing mass of Uruguayan representatives at Bank of America Stadium) with a pair of hooks and took a shot from another yellow-clad Colombian fan.\n\nUruguay captain Jose Maria Gimenez explained what compelled members of La Celeste to enter into the stands during a post-match interview with Spanish-language broadcaster TUDN, revealing that a segment of the Colombian fans created an \"avalanche\" around the players' families.\n\n\"Our families were in danger, we had to go into the stands to get our loved ones out, with small, newborn children. The policemen came after half an hour,\" Maria Jimenez said.\n\n\"We were standing up for ourselves, for our people. I hope that those who are organizing this are more careful with the families and with the [fans], it's a disaster, the same thing happens every match. Our families are suffering because of some [fans] who have two shots of alcohol and behave like children and have no decent sense of decency.\"\n\nNoble as that is, it's unclear whether such an explanation would suffice for CONMEBOL, South American soccer's governing body. Former France and Manchester United star Eric Cantona was famously handed a nine-month ban for launching a kung-fu kick toward a Crystal Palace supporter back in 1995. Could such a ruling set a precedent for Nunez and his Uruguayan teammates' actions?\n\nThe Sporting News gives you the run down on just what will happen with Nunez and the rest of the Uruguay side following Wednesday's explosive fireworks.\n\nMORE: Darwin Nunez, La Celeste players enter stands, throw punches after Copa America loss\n\nAt present, it's unknown whether Nunez and the other Uruguayan players who joined him in the bleachers will see heavy penalties -- including suspensions -- levied in their direction.\n\nChapter 15 of CONMEBOL's Copa America rule book details the governing body's outlook on handling disciplinary matters. There is no section describing the protocol if a brawl between players and fans erupts in the stands. However, Article 145 does highlight that teams found to have violated disciplinary guidelines are also \"exclusively\" liable for civil or other litigation from other soccer federations, as well as any other third party involved in the matter.\n\nGiven the number of people involved in the skirmish in Charlotte, that could represent a whole lot of third parties.\n\nFor what it's worth, CONMEBOL did condemn the clash that took place in the Bank of America stands.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whistle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin,_Northern_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUDN_(United_States_TV_channel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TUDN (United States TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Cantona", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eric Cantona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONMEBOL", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CONMEBOL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_governing_body", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports governing body"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sporting_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Sporting News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-07/Darwin-Nunez-071024-getty-ftr.jpg?itok=s_ZnPwLQ", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723292", "eventUri": "eng-9723292", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

Uruguay captain Jose Maria Gimenez explained that some of his teammates entered the stands to defend their families from a group of Columbia supporters.\n\nDarwin Nunez, a star for Liverpool, was among the group of Uruguay players who made its way into the stands after drinks were flying and fans in the specific section were already getting physical. The attendance during Wednesday night's contest was north of 70,000 with the overwhelming majority of fans showing support for Columbia.\n\nDuring a post-match interview on the field, Gimenez did not mince words about the situation that unfolded in the stands, bluntly explaining that families were in danger.\n\n\"They stormed all our families,\" Gim\u00e9nez said. \"A certain sector of Colombia fans, and they won't let us speak on the microphone. I'm going to say it now because I know I can because if not they'll cut you off. This is a disaster. Our family is in danger. We had to get on the top of the stands ASAP to rescue our loved ones. With newborn babies. It was a disaster.\"\n\nHe also went on to suggest that some fans didn't know how to handle their alcohol, which played a factor in things getting physical.\n\n\"I hope that those who are organizing this are a little more careful with the families, with the people and with the people around in the stadiums. It's a disaster because all the matches are the same,\" he continued. \"Our families are suffering because of some who drink one or two shots of alcohol that don't know how to drink. Who behave like children and are not decent.\"\n\nWhile Gimenez claimed that police and security did not arrive to help until a half hour after tempers flared, ABC reports that authorities took more than 10 minutes to arrive.\n\nNunez was seen consoling his young child on the field after the brawl.\n\nCONMEBOL released a statement following the incident:\n\n\"CONMEBOL strongly condemns any acts of violence that affects football. Our work is based on the conviction that soccer connects and unites us through its positive values. There is no place for intolerance and violence on and off the pitch. We invite everyone in the remaining days to pour all their passion into cheering on their national teams and having an unforgettable party.\"\n\nIt's safe to assume several suspensions are coming for the Uruguay players who jumped into the stands, and also an investigation into fans who allegedly put families in danger.\n\nUruguay is set to take on Canada on Saturday in a third-place match.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_harris@outkick.com", "name": "Mark Harris", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbia, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin,_Northern_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Mar\u00eda_Gim\u00e9nez", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONMEBOL", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CONMEBOL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/07/uruguay-fan-fight.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723292", "eventUri": "eng-9723292", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

(AP) - Jefferson Lerma scored in the 39th minute, and Colombia played a man short the entire second half in a 1-0 win over Uruguay on Wednesday night to reach the Copa America final against Lionel Messi and Argentina. Daniel Mu\u00c3\u00b1oz was ejected in first-half stoppage time for his second yellow card, but Colombia held on to reach the championship for the first time since winning its only Copa title as host in 2001. Colombia extended its unbeaten streak to a team record 28 games, one more than from 1992-94 and the longest current streak in men's international soccer. In a contentious match that included seven yellow cards and one red, players from both teams pushed and shoved in a scrum on the field at the final whistle and some players went into the stands to scrap with fans. Defending champion Argentina and Colombia meet Sunday night at Miami Gardens, Florida. The Albiceleste are seeking a record 16th Copa title and are looking to join Spain from 2008-12 as the only countries to win three straight major championships. Before an overwhelmingly pro-Colombia crowd of 70,644 that filled Bank of America Stadium with yellow jerseys and flags, Uruguay fell behind for the first time in the tournament. James Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez's corner kick was headed in from short range by Lerma, who outjumped Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00c3\u00ada Gim\u00e9nez for his third international goal and second of the tournament. Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez has six assists in the tournament -- triple the total of any other player. Mu\u00c3\u00b1oz received his first yellow card from Mexican referee C\u00e9sar Ramos in the 31st minute for a reckless slide tackle on Maximiliano Ara\u00c3\u00bajo and his second for elbowing Manuel Ugarte in the stomach. Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez was given a yellow card in the 55th minute for arguing with Ramos when the referee failed to stop play after Richard R\u00c3\u00ados was kicked on a shin by Darwin N\u00c3\u00ba\u00c3\u00b1ez. R\u00c3\u00ados was removed on a stretcher, re-entered the match, then went down in another challenge and was substituted in the 62nd minute. Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez was removed at the same time to keep him eligible for the final. Colombia goalkeeper Federico Valverde didn't have to make his first save until he stopped Nicol\u00c3\u00a1s de la Cruz in the 68th minute. Luis Su\u00c3\u00a1rez, Uruguay's career leader with 68 goals, entered in the 66th minute and hit the outside of a post with a shot in the 71st. He grasped his head in his hands in disgust. Colombia's Mateus Uribe, another second-half sub, put an open shot wide in the 88th, and Uribe's open shot in the fourth minute of stoppage time ricocheted off the body of sliding goalkeeper Sergio Rochet and then the crossbar. Uruguay moved Rochet up the field in the final minute, desparate for a goal. The match was played in 90-degree heat on a surface that was converted from artificial turf to grass in the weeks leading up the game. Players on the NFL's Carolina Panthers have been outspoken about soccer teams having the luxury of playing on grass on their home field. NFL games here are played artificial turf, which players say leaves them more susceptible to injuries. ___ AP Copa America coverage:", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news",

Bookies think that even without him, Uruguay can beat Canada. What do we think? Keep reading this Canada vs. Uruguay preview to find out.\n\nCanada can count itself lucky for getting to the Final Four of the 2024 Copa America. This is because they haven't been great on the field since the start of the tournament. In the group stage, they lost 2:0 to Argentina, beat Peru 1:0, and drew 0:0 with Chile. As a result, they finished second in the group and got to play against Venezuela in the quarterfinal.\n\nIt was a tough game, which finished 1:1 in regulation. After two sets of extra times, a penalty shootout decided the victor - it was Canada. They advanced to the semifinal where they were met by Argentina once again. History repeat itself and Canada lost 2:0.\n\nAre they in for another loss? Betting odds sure suggest so, which is probably because Canada's not great offensively. These guys scored only two goals in regulation in five games of the 2024 Copa America.\n\nUruguay looked great until the semifinal, especially following the win over Brazil. However, in the semifinal, they lost 1:0 to 10-men Colombia despite attacking with all they had for more than 45 minutes.\n\nThe worst thing is that some of Uruguay's players lost their nerves which caused huge problems for everyone. This goes especially for Darwin Nunez who got into a fight with Colombia's fans in the stands. As a result, he could be forced to miss many games not just for Uruguay but also for Liverpool. We're talking months of inaction.\n\nBut the big question is when will his suspension start. Will it be before or after the Uruguay vs. Canada game on July 13? No one seems to know, but one thing is certain, even if he plays, he will need to behave himself and the same applies to his teammates.\n\nUruguay need to show they're gentlemen, which is why we expect to see them play non-aggressive soccer on July 13. If they cut down on fouls, we could see Canada make some good chances and potentially score a goal or two.\n\nThe bad news for the Canadians is that that probably won't be enough as Uruguay's roster is packed with amazing forwards. With or without Nunes, these guys are going to win.", "source": {"uri": "gamblingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GamblingNews"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessie_carter@gamblingnews.com", "name": "Jessie Carter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_Bielsa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marcelo Bielsa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peru"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Peru"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://www.gamblingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/canada-uruguay-copa-america-2024.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723292", "eventUri": "eng-9723292", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 1798, "textEnd": 1805, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

A single goal by Jefferson Lerma in the 39th minute was enough to send Colombia through to the final. However, the post-match scenes were far from celebratory, as tensions boiled over into chaos on the field.\n\nEmotions ran high as the final whistle blew, confirming Colombia's victory. Players from both teams, referees, camera crews, and officials became embroiled in a frenzied scuffle. Among the chaos, Luis Suarez was seen confronting and pushing Colombian players and staff members, clearly frustrated by his opponents' outcome and behavior.\n\nThe situation escalated further when Darwin Nunez climbed into the stands to confront Colombian fans. Shirtless and visibly enraged, Nunez exchanged punches with fans and defended himself amid a flurry of thrown drinks. The scene quickly turned into a spectacle, overshadowing Colombia's triumph.\n\nLuis Suarez speaks out on Uruguay's defeat and drama afterwards\n\nAfter the match, Luis Suarez addressed the media, expressing his frustration with the events that unfolded. \"What bothers me the most is the way they mock,\" Suarez stated. \"There are always clashes, laughs, words, whatever. But what bothers me the most is the way they mock and celebrate, it makes no sense.\"\n\nSuarez emphasized the importance of sportsmanship, comparing the situation to Uruguay's previous match against Brazil. \"We eliminated Brazil and none of us walked past any Brazilian player. On the contrary, we went to greet them. We're colleagues on the field; we know the suffering of a defeat. Walking past a fellow professional like that looks bad, but the one above sees everything and everything comes back.\"\n\nHe urged his teammates to stay strong and united despite the setback. \"As a group, we need to rise, stay strong, stay united. We will often face situations like this.\"\n\nThe governing body of South American football, CONMEBOL, has issued a statement condemning the violence that followed the game. However, it remains to be seen what specific actions will be taken against the players involved.\n\nWhile the altercation has taken some focus away from the match itself, Colombia's performance deserves recognition. Their disciplined defense and strategic play led to Lerma's decisive goal, ensuring their place in the final. The team's ability to maintain composure under pressure was key to their success.\n\nThough overshadowed by the post-match chaos, Colombia's victory has set the stage for an exciting Copa America final against Argentina, led by Lionel Messi. The final promises to be a thrilling encounter, with both teams eager to lift the coveted trophy.\n\nColombia's win over Uruguay was a significant achievement, but the scenes that followed marred the triumph. Players' actions on both sides have sparked a debate about sportsmanship and the expected behavior of professional athletes. As Colombia prepares to face Argentina in the final, the team will need to focus on their game and rise above the distractions. Football fans around the world will be eagerly watching to see who will emerge victorious in the Copa America final.\n\nThis match will test both teams' skill and character. The spotlight will be on how they handle the pressure and maintain their professionalism on the field. The Copa America final promises to be a memorable event, showcasing the best of South American football.

It was a natural, instinctive reaction that was rational given the events that were taking place,\" he remarked, via ESPN.\n\n\"We were in a box, where we had some attacks and we protected some children, opening the area to some kids who were scared and having some crises, but fundamentally what is worrying is what happened down on the field, where there was more diligence in repairs than in precaution.\"\n\n\"They quickly followed the evacuation protocol and we were able to resolve the situation, not without some inconvenience that you all saw.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_findlater@mirror.co.uk", "name": "James Findlater", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin,_Northern_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Darwin, Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Ugarte_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Ugarte (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONMEBOL", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CONMEBOL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atl\u00e9tico_Madrid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atl\u00e9tico Madrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguayan_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uruguayan Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/article33220559.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_nunez.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723292", "eventUri": "eng-9723292", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4196078431372549, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

However, the moment was bittersweet, as Darwin's team couldn't secure victory despite having the upper hand against a ten-man Colombian side.\n\nColombia's victory was nothing short of dramatic. Daniel Munoz was given a red card after elbowing Uruguay's Manuel Ugarte, reducing Colombia to ten men while holding a slim 1-0 lead in the first half of extra time. The red card, a second yellow for Munoz, added to the tension after his initial booking in the 31st minute, which followed a yellow card for Uruguay's Nicolas de la Cruz just five minutes earlier.\n\nREAD MORE: Mohamed Salah meeting Arne Slot for first time goes down exactly how Liverpool fans hoped it would\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool transfer news LIVE: Jeremie Frimpong deadline, Karim Adeyemi 'talks', Joao Neves plan\n\nThe game-defining moment came in the 39th minute, just before the red card drama when Jefferson Lerma soared to meet a cross from James Rodr\u00edguez. Lerma's header from the left side of the six-yard box found the bottom left corner, igniting Colombian celebrations as they took the lead.\n\nDespite having a numerical advantage for over half the match, Uruguay struggled to mount a meaningful offense. They managed just two shots on goal, hampered by Colombia's tenacious defense and indomitable spirit, even with a man down.\n\nWhile Nunez showed sportsmanship toward D\u00edaz after the game, the post-match scene turned fiery when he entered the stands only in his GPS vest and exchanged punches with fans as drinks flew in his direction. Uruguay star Jose Maria Gimenez later claimed players were defending their families who were sat in the area.\n\n\"It was a disaster; there was no police and we had to defend our families,\" Gimenez said. \"This is because of two or three who have one drink too many. A certain sector of the Colombian fans made an avalanche where our loved ones were.\"\n\nBoth Nunez and Diaz are expected to be in the plans of new manager Anrne Slot after reports previously suggested that they could be looking to part ways with Nunez and add a striker like Ollie Watkins. \"I assume he will fit really well into my playing style because I like him,\" said Slot. \"I've told him already, yes. He is one of the players I have spoken to\".\n\nThe young duo contributed significantly to Liverpool's offense last season, netting 19 of the team's 86 Premier League goals. Liverpool finished third in the league, trailing only Manchester City and Arsenal.

(AP) - Jefferson Lerma scored in the 39th minute, and Colombia played a man short the entire second half in a 1-0 win over Uruguay on Wednesday night to reach the Copa America final against Lionel Messi and Argentina.\n\nDaniel Mu\u00c3\u00b1oz was ejected in first-half stoppage time for his second yellow card, but Colombia held on to reach the championship for the first time since winning its only Copa title as host in 2001. Colombia extended its unbeaten streak to a team record 28 games, one more than from 1992-94 and the longest current streak in men's international soccer.\n\nIn a contentious match that included seven yellow cards and one red, players from both teams pushed and shoved in a scrum on the field at the final whistle and some players went into the stands to scrap with fans.\n\nDefending champion Argentina and Colombia meet Sunday night at Miami Gardens, Florida.

Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez has six assists in the tournament -- triple the total of any other player.\n\nMu\u00c3\u00b1oz received his first yellow card from Mexican referee C\u00e9sar Ramos in the 31st minute for a reckless slide tackle on Maximiliano Ara\u00c3\u00bajo and his second for elbowing Manuel Ugarte in the stomach.\n\nRodr\u00c3\u00adguez was given a yellow card in the 55th minute for arguing with Ramos when the referee failed to stop play after Richard R\u00c3\u00ados was kicked on a shin by Darwin N\u00c3\u00ba\u00c3\u00b1ez.\n\nR\u00c3\u00ados was removed on a stretcher, re-entered the match, then went down in another challenge and was substituted in the 62nd minute.

He grasped his head in his hands in disgust.\n\nColombia's Mateus Uribe, another second-half sub, put an open shot wide in the 88th, and Uribe's open shot in the fourth minute of stoppage time ricocheted off the body of sliding goalkeeper Sergio Rochet and then the crossbar.\n\nUruguay moved Rochet up the field in the final minute, desparate for a goal.\n\nThe match was played in 90-degree heat on a surface that was converted from artificial turf to grass in the weeks leading up the game.\n\nPlayers on the NFL's Carolina Panthers have been outspoken about soccer teams having the luxury of playing on grass on their home field.

He was the hot new thing, the man of the hour.\n\nRodriguez's club career never took off, though, and for a decade he remained a one-time flash in the pan, unable to recreate his magic on the biggest stages. After leaving the Spanish capital in 2017, stints at Bayern Munich, Everton, Al Rayyan in Qatar, Olympiacos in Greece, and finally landing most recently at Brazilian club Sao Paulo, he's yet to find his footing.\n\nThen suddenly, on U.S. soil 10 years later, with the Colombian legend largely a fading memory for fickle-minded casual fans around the world, he suddenly exploded back on the scene, leading Los Cafeteros into the Copa America final and onto the precipice of a return to international glory.\n\nMORE: Colombia outlast Uruguay in Copa America semifinal\n\nColombia had fallen a long way from its dazzling run to the 2014 World Cup quarterfinals, where they narrowly lost to Brazil just before the Selecao's infamous dismantling at the hands of Germany. They managed to scrape together a pair of third-place finishes at the Copa America since, but they reached a low point when they failed to qualify for the 2022 World Cup four years after an uninspiring Round of 16 exit in Russia 2018.\n\nThen came new leadership in the form of new boss Nestor Lorenzo, a relatively inexperienced Argentine coach who has defibrillated Colombia back to life with Rodriguez at the heart of the turnaround. Colombia are suddenly in the midst of a sensational 28-game unbeaten streak that dates all the way back to early 2022, with Lorenzo having yet to suffer a single defeat in charge of the side.\n\nOf course, one man cannot do it all -- not at the 2014 World Cup, where Rodriguez had help from the likes of fellow superstars Radamel Falcao, David Ospina, and Juan Cuadrado, and not at the 2024 Copa America either. Only, this time there aren't any other superstars in the squad. Colombia in 2024 are the epitome of the idea that the whole is more than the sum of the parts.\n\n\"In 2014 James was the main striker, the top scorer, the man of the match many times,\" said Lorenzo after the win over Uruguay, \"and at this moment he is also doing very well, accompanied by the whole group.\"\n\nEven amidst the sudden unbeaten streak, Colombia had yet to truly reawaken until Rodriguez turned back the clock 10 years and rediscovered what saw fans fall in love with him in Brazil, what this Copa America has so desperately lacked: fun.\n\nJames Rodriguez is, deep down at his core, just pure freakin' fun. The delicious through-balls, the pinged switches, the dazzling dribbles -- even the sarcastic smile on his face as he walks away from berating an official. James Rodriguez is having fun again, and so is everyone else watching.\n\n\"I think it is a group that wants to be protagonists of this tournament,\" Lorenzo said. \"They want to win, they are very hungry as players and eager to add elements to the match beyond the tactical side. I think we are at a pivotal moment. There are some weaknesses to overcome, but when you overcome those obstacles, that's how you can grow and evolve.\"\n\nDon't think that's just fluff, either. A revitalized Rodriguez has crafted six assists for his Colombia teammates at the Copa America, while nobody else in the entire competition has more than two. He also leads the tournament in chances created, racking up 19 through the semifinals.\n\nDuring the first half of the semifinal against Uruguay, the one-time wonderboy was again his glittering self, assisting Jefferson Lerma's opener with a pinpoint corner. Marcelo Bielsa had clearly instructed his side to eliminate the Colombian playmaker from their buildup, but they could do nothing to stop his dead-ball accuracy. The heavily pro-Colombia crowd lapped it up, right until Daniel Munoz's idiotic dismissal changed the game and put Los Cafeteros on their heels.\n\nYet Colombia persisted because that's what they've done throughout the last two years. They did so largely without Rodriguez on the field, hauled off after 62 minutes amidst tired legs and a desperate defensive duty over the last half-hour. That part was not fun for Colombia, not in the slightest, but they managed to outlast Uruguay even with a pair of heinous misses by Mateus Uribe.\n\nAs the Colombia bench exploded onto the pitch at the full-time whistle, the joy was evident. Rodriguez broke down in tears as he hugged Luis Diaz and other teammates.\n\nIn typical CONMEBOL fashion, just as it had in the match, Rodriguez's moment was quickly extinguished by further events as a fight broke out when Uruguay players entered the Bank of America Stadium stands.\n\nBut make no mistake, today was James Rodriguez's day, and with it, his unique, one-of-a-kind career gets one more moment under the bright lights.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Our work is based on the conviction that football connects us and unites us, through its positive values.\n\n\"There is no place for intolerance and violence on and off the field. We invite everyone in the remaining days to pour all their passion into cheering on their teams and having an unforgettable party.\"\n\nGimenez explained: \"Colombian fans in a certain section descended on all our families. Our families were in danger. We had to rush into the stands to remove our loved ones with tiny newborn babies.\n\n\"It's a total disaster. There wasn't a single police officer. They showed up half an hour later. A disaster. And we were there, standing up for ourselves, for our loved ones.\"\n\nLuis Suarez said: \"They were trying to protect their families. From what I saw, there were a lot of relatives and children affected. You're left powerless in that situation.\"\n\nUruguay goalkeeper Rochet said: \"This could have been avoided. I thought this came about from where the families of players was sitting. When you see your family there there...we wanted to take our families out of there.\"\n\nAUF president Ignacio Alonso told reporters: \"The players reacted instinctively to what is natural, which is to defend and protect the children that were in that part of the stands, the women who were being assaulted, the wives, fathers, children and brothers who were there.\n\n\"It's an instinctive response of a father.

Hopefully, they'll take more precautions for the next game so this doesn't happen again because this is a disaster,\" he added.\n\nNunez was later calmed by his teammates Luis Diaz and veteran Luis Suarez.\n\nUruguay failed to capitalise on their chances and lost the game by 0-1 as a result.

After Argentina punched its ticket on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win over Canada, Colombia and Uruguay went head-to-head in Charlotte on Wednesday. It was billed as potential classic and lived up to the hype, as Jefferson Lerma scored a goal in the 39th minute off of a James Rodriguez corner kick to give the Colombians a 1-0 win.\n\nThe game itself got tense early on, which is not unusual for high-profile Copa America games. And just before the half, Daniel Mu\u00f1oz got a red card that meant Colombia had to scratch and claw for the game's final 45 minutes. Things were chippy throughout, and after the game, some players and staffers got into it on the field.\n\nThat had nothing on what happened in the stands. While it's unclear what sparked things, a collection of Uruguayan players were not happy with Colombian fans. There was some beer thrown, there were players going into the stands themselves, and Liverpool forward Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez threw punches.\n\nAgain, it's unclear what led to things popping off like this, because while emotions ran high during the game, it never exactly seemed like players felt compelled to run into the stands and start fighting opposing fans.

Two of its crew members jumped into the sea and rescued the woman, who was airlifted by helicopter to land.

An altercation broke out in the stands that saw striker Darwin Nunez, defender Ronald Araujo and others clash with fans. Punches were thrown, objects were tossed and people were struck.\n\nThe horrifying scenes put everyone in that vicinity at risk.\n\nSecurity, meanwhile, fought just about no one as virtually everyone in the stadium could do little but stand and watch. All control was lost for what felt like an eternity. Men, women, children... all were in danger for a few minutes and no one could stop it.\n\nThere was, however, a game played at one point. And, unfortunately, it was a damn good one, too.\n\nColombia showed an incredible amount of guts while down a man, outlasting Uruguay to earn a 1-0 win that sent them to the Copa America final.\n\nThat's not the talking point though, is it? No, when what happens on Wednesday night in Charlotte happens, the soccer gets overshadowed just a little bit.\n\nRealistically, careers were altered. Nunez, Araujo and a few of their Uruguayan teammates will certainly be feeling the ramifications of this for a long time.\n\nIt was a failure of epic proportions and an embarrassment on a night that should have been a celebration. Truthfully, all involved are lucky it didn't get worse. For a few minutes there, it felt like that brawl was a snowball that was only going to build and build. Everyone played their part and everyone should be embarrassed by the part they played.\n\nAgain, there was a game of soccer in there and there's another one on Sunday. Eventually, the focus will turn to a clash between Colombia and Argentina with a trophy on the line. Maybe that match will be good enough to establish itself as the defining moment of this tournament, but probably not. That unfortunately will probably be Wednesday night's melee.\n\nIt wasn't supposed to be that way and, if a few people had just kept cooler heads, it didn't have to be.

Liverpool's Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez exploited these spaces but failed to capitalize on several opportunities.\n\nColombia's Daniel Mu\u00f1oz was a constant threat on the right wing, narrowly missing a header. Richard Rios had a shot saved, and Jhon C\u00f3rdoba misfired another attempt. However, Jefferson Lerma broke the deadlock with a well-placed header from a James Rodr\u00edguez corner, giving Colombia a deserved lead.\n\nDespite their lead, Colombia faced a setback when Mu\u00f1oz was sent off for elbowing Uruguay's Manuel Ugarte, following a VAR review. This left Colombia with ten men and without Mu\u00f1oz for the final, should they advance.\n\nIn the second half, Colombia made defensive adjustments, adopting a 4-3-2 formation to fortify their defense while maintaining some attacking potential.

Jhon Cordoba almost doubled his side's advantage following another Rodriguez's delivery from a set piece, but the Krasnodar forward's header just missed the target.\n\nLuis Suarez replaced Guillermo Varela in the 67th minute and injected some much-needed urgency into Uruguay's play.\n\nThe veteran Inter Miami forward sent Colombian hearts fluttering when he received Mathias Olivera's pass on the counterattack before sending a 20-yard drive crashing off the right post.\n\nColombia squandered a gilt-edged chance to put the result beyond doubt when an unmarked Kevin Castano side footed wide from 12 yards after Luis Sinisterra's pass.\n\nUruguay continued to push forward in search of an equalizer and Giorgian de Arrascaeta again went close with a dipping effort that was palmed over by goalkeeper Camilo Vargas.\n\nThe frenetic tempo continued into stoppage time. Mateus Uribe had another opportunity to score Colombia's second goal, but his low effort from 15 yards hit the bar after deflecting off Rochet's right leg. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Lerma", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson Lerma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Rodr\u00edguez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Rodr\u00edguez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ejection (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetLife_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MetLife Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Rochet", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Rochet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Ugarte_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Ugarte (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgian_de_Arrascaeta", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giorgian de Arrascaeta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Sinisterra", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis Sinisterra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Math\u00edas_Olivera", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Math\u00edas Olivera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C\u00f3rdoba,_Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mateus_Uribe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mateus Uribe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Krasnodar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Krasnodar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camilo_Vargas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Camilo Vargas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillermo_Varela", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guillermo Varela"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Petanque", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Petanque", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723292", "eventUri": "eng-9723292", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 11, "textEnd": 18}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

It was La Celeste, though, who had the first real chance of the game when Darwin Nunez released a left-footed strike that went just wide in the 17th minute. The Liverpool striker would have two more decent looks at goal, but he lacked the end product.\n\nUruguay might not have been able to capitalize on their chances, but Colombia did not make the same mistakes. Jefferson Lerma, back in the starting XI after serving a one-game suspension for yellow card accumulation, got on the end of another brilliant James Rodriguez corner with a header at the back post in the 39th minute.\n\nJust six minutes after the opening goal, Daniel Munoz, who was already booked 31st minute, received a second yellow for elbowing Manuel Ugarte in the chest. Colombia went into the locker room up a goal, but down a man.\n\nA goal for Uruguay felt inevitable in the second half, but La Celeste struggled to take advantage of their extra player. Their best chance came in the 71st minute when an unmarked Luis Suarez kissed the outside of the post with a strike from 15 yards out. Marcelo Bielsa's squad kept knocking on the door, but could not find an equalizer against Colombia's stout backline, forcing them to settle for the third place match while Colombia advanced to the Copa America final.\n\nGK: Camilo Vargas - 7/10 - Vargas kept a clean sheet tonight and made timely saves when it mattered most.\n\nRB: Daniel Munoz - 3/10 - Munoz was sent off in the first half after receiving two yellow cards, leaving his team with ten men in a must-win match.\n\nCB: Davinson Sanchez - 7/10 - Down a man, Sanchez was called upon to both maintain Colombia's clean sheet and stop Luis Suarez in the second half.\n\nCB: Carlos Cuesta - 7/10 - Cuesta carried the ball forward from the backline in the first half, contributing to Colombia's attack, but he had to stand tall in the second half to keep Uruguay off the scoresheet.\n\nLB: Johan Mojica - 6/10 - Mojica defended well tonight, especially once Colombia went down to ten men. The left-back effectively took Facundo Pellistri and Cristian Olivera out of the game.\n\nDM: Richard Rios - 6/10 - Rios is the engine of Colombia's midfield, constantly helping out on defense while also pushing forward on the attack. He was also the victim of several harsh tackles that eventually forced him off the pitch in the 61st minute.\n\nDM: Jefferson Lerma - 7/10 - After serving his one-game suspension for yellow card accumulation, Lerma returned to the starting XI and scored Colombia's only goal tonight.\n\nRM: Jhon Arias - 5/10 - Arias had a quiet first half, supporting the attack when he could. The midfielder was subbed off at halftime, though, in favor of a defender after Munoz's red card.\n\nAM: James Rodriguez - 7/10 - Rodriguez recorded his sixth assist tonight on Colombia's only goal, the most by a single player since 2011.\n\nLM: Luis Diaz - 8/10 - Diaz terrorized the right side of Uruguay's defense, using his speed and dribbling ability to take on various players and carve out goalscoring opportunities. The Liverpool player put forth a valiant effort down a man to hold the ball up.\n\nST: Jhon Cordoba - 5/10 - Cordoba found himself on the end of a couple half-chances, but the striker failed to test Sergio Rochet.\n\nSUB: Santiago Arias - 6/10 - Arias was subbed on at halftime to slot in at right-back after Munoz was sent off. Despite only making one prior appearance this Copa America, the defender did well to help his backline stop Uruguay.\n\nSUB: Mateus Uribe - 5/10 - Uribe came on for the injured Rios and brought energy to the Colombian midfield as they fought to defend with ten men. Uribe could have sealed the game in the 88th and the 94th minute, but missed both chances.\n\nSUB: Kevin Castano - 5/10 - Castano's fresh legs were a welcomed reprieve for the tired Colombians on the pitch.\n\nSUB: Yerry Mina - 6/10 - Mina was subbed on in the 75th minute to give Los Cafeteros an extra center-back.\n\nSUB: Luis Sinisterra - N/A - Sinisterra came on in the 86th minute and joined in on the defensive effort.\n\nNestor Lorenzo - 8/10 - Nestor Lorenzo deserves all the credit for leading Colombia to the Copa America 2024 final. The manager made crucial substitutions after Daniel Munoz was sent off in the first half, giving his side every chance to maintain their 1-0 lead and their unbeaten streak. It takes a certain resilience to survive down a man in a semi-final against a team that had not lost at this year's Copa America, but Lorenzo's squad came out with the victory.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Penalty card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Rodr\u00edguez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "James Rodr\u00edguez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Lerma", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson Lerma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Ugarte_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Ugarte (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Cuesta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Cuesta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Mojica", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Johan Mojica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facundo_Pellistri", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facundo Pellistri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Math\u00edas_Olivera", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Math\u00edas Olivera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Arias", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Santiago Arias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Vargas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eduardo Vargas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ejection (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_Bielsa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marcelo Bielsa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camilo_Vargas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Camilo Vargas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jhon_Arias_(footballer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jhon Arias (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_D\u00edaz_(footballer,_born_1997)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis D\u00edaz (footballer, born 1997)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Sinisterra", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis Sinisterra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Rochet", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Rochet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerry_Mina", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yerry Mina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C\u00f3rdoba,_Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mateus_Uribe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mateus Uribe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dribbling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dribbling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/0.jVYohs7blFZF9tVRU4VA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/90min_articles_646/67bf229f69ba69fe3b83eeb934968531", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723292", "eventUri": "eng-9723292", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

In an exciting and close semi-final match of the Colombian national team managed to advance to the final by beating Uruguay 1-0. The only goal of the match was scored by Crystal Palace's Jefferson Lerma in the 39th minute, thanks to an excellent assist from James Rodr\u00edguez. However, things got complicated for the Colombians just before half-time, when Daniel Mu\u00f1oz was sent off in the 45+1 minute, leaving Colombia with one less player for the entire second half. During the second half, Uruguay took advantage of their numerical advantage and constantly attacked, desperately seeking an equalizer. The Charr\u00faas dominated possession and created several goal-scoring opportunities, but the Colombian defense remained firm and organized, demonstrating a great ability to withstand pressure.\n\nThe Colombian defenders and goalkeeper became the heroes of the match, holding on to the score and securing their place in the final. As an interesting fact, the Colombian team continues to increase its unbeaten record of 28 games without losing, 22 wins and draws. Now, Colombia is preparing to face Argentina in the grand final of the 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica, which will be held on Sunday, July 14.

Manchester City's Julian Alvarez and Inter Miami's Lionel Messi scored the goals for Argentina. Julian Alvarez is set to join Argentina's Olympic squad at the end of this month, as the South American team looks to add an Olympic f\u00fatbol medal to the recent Copa Am\u00e9rica and World Cup titles.\n\nColombia, meanwhile, beat favorites Uruguay 1-0 on Wednesday (June 10) with a first half goal by Jefferson Lerma.

The United States National Men's Team were knocked out in group play -- see Day 12 for that -- but the tourney goes on.\n\nWhen you look at the Copa brackets, you had an idea as to who was going to be in the final, all things being equal and chalk being chalk.\n\nOne side gave you an idea that Argentina was going to be waiting for the survivor -- and I use that word \"survivor\" on purpose -- of the other side of the bracket.\n\nArgentina was given a Canada side that, I'm fairly sure you'll agree, was playing with house money in getting as far as they did. But full credit to head coach Jesse Marsch for getting as far as they did with the roster construction being what it is and the amount of time the staff had to integrate their ideas for play.\n\nBut Tuesday night was the end of the line for the last CONCACAF side as both Lionel Messi and Julian Alvarez scored to make a fairly easy night of it for a 2-0 win. At the same time, Rodrigo made sure Marsch remembered what he had gotten himself into with this opponent. Thanks to our friends at TyC for this one:\n\nThe other half of the bracket was meant to be an absolute shootout amongst a LOT of very good teams. The last two very good teams -- Colombia and Uruguay -- squared off in Charlotte to figure out the opponent for Argentina.\n\nAnd all I'll say is this: FIND A REPLAY OF THIS MATCH IF YOU MISSED IT FROM CHARLOTTE.\n\nActually, I'll say a little more.\n\nIf you want to compare the Euros and the Copa, there is NO comparison. This match was the personification of what this tournament means to these nations and the American audience found it out front and center.\n\nJames Rodriguez registered his sixth assist in the tourney, finding Jefferson Lerma in the 39th minute for a 1-0 lead for Los Cafeteros (Colombia). Thanks to TUDN for the highlight:\n\nBut there was another moment of intrigue added to the soap opera late in the first half where the team with the lead did something you can't have happen -- get a red card while up a goal. Thanks again to TUDN for this moment, when Daniel Munoz throws an elbow:\n\nAnd in one of the most intense 45 minutes you'll see all calendar year, Colombia held on -- even as Uruguay had to chase and created chances to equalize AND STILL COULDN'T CONVERT. Colombia's unbeaten streak is now at 28 straight and they had to SUFFER for it as they play Argentina for their first Copa America title in 23 years on Sunday night in Miami.\n\nOh, the last team to beat Colombia more than two years ago? You guessed it: Argentina.\n\nHere's your PSA: Find a seat. Find some friends. Watch the final and you'll see what this entire tournament has meant across the 16 nations were invited.\n\nWe'll walk through it all together. Play it safe, everyone. I'll talk to you soon!\n\nThe matchups to determine the semifinals in the right-hand side of the bracket had a fair amount of intrigue in both.\n\nThe early matchup had Colombia and the second CONCACAF guest that had made it this far -- Panama. If you look at odds and things to give you part of your information leading into sporting events, Panama was a BIG underdog. And with that knowledge, the semifinal showed why Colombia is a national squad to be reckoned with in the Copa America.\n\nJames Rodriguez, so far, has been \"good James\" -- the one you see when he's not injured (nagging or otherwise). He's been a source of positional gravity that is forcing defenses to pay more attention to him than planned which means teammates of his are more open to create. And Colombia did so to extend their unbeaten string of matches to 27 and counting.\n\nAfter Jhon Cordoba and James scored to make it 2-0 early, Rodriguez helped out on goal No. 3, thanks to our friends at TUDN:\n\nThree became four and, eventually, five and Panama left the suburbs of Phoenix with a Round of 16 appearance.\n\nThe second match, from downtown Las Vegas had two heavyweights going at it in Uruguay and Brazil. We have made the point here that this Brazil team is NOT the Brazil team you're used to seeing. No \"jogo bonito.\" No free-flowing artistry. All those things you look at on YouTube, point at, and go \"THAT!\"\n\n\"THAT\" currently is not Brazil. It is plodding at times, physical, mucking it up occasionally, and every-once-in-a-while just not a pleasant viewing experience from what we all know from history. When you don't have Vinicius Jr. to be one of your playmakers from yellow card accumulation, it also doesn't make things any easier.\n\nSo, for 90 minutes this match was not what we have seen previously in the tournament. 41 fouls were called and only four *TOTAL shots on goal the entire time for both sides. Even the VAR-reviewed and upheld red card on Nahitan Nandez for Uruguay didn't help things along. So, straight to penalties!\n\nThis is where Uruguay's Sergio Rochet came up big, thanks to TUDN once again:\n\nBrazil hit the post later in the shootout and Uruguay advanced after a conversion in the top of the fifth frame...\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nColombia and Uruguay face off Wednesday night in Charlotte after Argentina and Canada play Tuesday night in New Jersey.\n\nAnd, by the time we reconvene, we may have an answer about the future of Gregg Berhalter and his place in the U.S. Men's National Team.\n\nEnjoy your days off! Play it safe, everyone. I'll talk to you soon!\n\nI say that because I KNOW there will be calm voices coming from USMNT fans over the fact that Jesse Marsch knows how to sing \"O, Canada\" at the top of his lungs and will wander around on a field in suburban Dallas carrying the Maple Leaf Flag after the Canadian Men's National Team's penalty shootout win over Argentina to advance to the Copa America semifinals.\n\n(ed. Note and reader note- I know that was a tremendous run-on sentence. But I think what we saw was worthy of that structure.)\n\nCanada actually got the lead on a goal from a tight space from Nashville SC's Jacob Shaffelburg. But the goalkeeper that has proven himself to be nothing short of a brick wall and clairvoyant between the sticks had this moment that evened everything up.\n\nThe match, in the second half specifically, had no filter and seemingly had no desire to be anything but an end-to-end tennis match at full sprint -- conditioning to be reviewed later. And the viewers of the match were the ones who were truly entertained. Chance after chance after chance led to no goals and the immediate ending -- penalty kicks.\n\nHere's the short version of all six frames to decide the winner, thanks again to FOX Soccer:\n\nSo, we now know Argentina gets Canada on the left-hand side of the Copa America bracket. And all the voices that are screaming for a decision on the U.S. National Team situation are staring at events inside their own country and wondering: \"THAT COULD HAVE BEEN US RIGHT NOW!\"\n\nWell, maybe. That thought pattern isn't really one attached to a direct, cause-and-effect situation. I understand the wishful thinking linked to what happened to the Canadian Men's National Team. But it's not a straight line applied to Marsch and *any national team coaching situation.\n\nBy the way, the Kone penalty kick was worth a reported $8 million to the National Team. Considering their current state of financial affairs, they ought to name a statue of the moment and plant it in the town square in the location of Ismael Kone's choosing.\n\nSATURDAY: We'll know the right-hand side of the bracket by the end of the night. Colombia and the other CONCACAF-invited guest to make it this far, Panama, play in suburban Phoenix in the afternoon followed by the Uruguay and Brazil match in Las Vegas after that one is concluded.\n\nWe'll then know the last four standing for the Tuesday semifinals.\n\nWe'll walk through it all together. Play it safe, everyone. I'll talk to you soon.\n\nLegitimately, there are times in the sport where you just shake your head, tip your cap, and move on because the solutions you thought you had weren't solutions at all.\n\nEmiliano Martinez, the goalkeeper for Argentina, has to be -- HAS TO BE in every opponent's head as they step up to the penalty spot trying to decide a match.\n\nIn the first match of the Copa America 2024 knockouts, Argentina was taken to extra movement after a late equalizer by Ecuador to tie the match in Houston at 1-1.\n\nThe rule for the Copa this year is that, instead of like they do in the Euros and play an extra 30 minutes before heading to penalty kicks, they go straight there. And heading to the top of the first, our friends at Fox Soccer timed it perfectly to see a unicorn from the best player of this generation:\n\nI, legitimately, cannot remember the last time something like that happened involving Messi and a penalty kick decision: a panenka that hit the crossbar. Ask me. Can't tell you.\n\nOh, what's a \"panenka?\" From our friends at the Wikipedias...\n\n\"In association football, the panenka is a technique used while taking a penalty kick in which the taker, instead of kicking the ball to the left or right of the goalkeeper, gives a light touch underneath the ball, causing it to rise and fall within the centre of the goal, deceiving the goalkeeper who most likely will have committed to a dive away from the centre.\n\nThe technique was most notably executed by Czech player Anton\u00edn Panenka, who scored a decisive penalty in the UEFA Euro 1976 final in Belgrade, when he beat West German goalkeeper Sepp Maier to claim the title for the Czechoslovakia national team. The technique garnered Panenka much media attention and praise, but it was likewise deemed risky. Due to it being difficult to execute correctly and relatively easy to save for the goalkeeper if anticipated, a panenka has rarely been attempted at professional knock-out tournaments. Sports journalists have noted that only highly respected players, such as Andrea Pirlo at the Euro 2012, who can deal with the consequences of missing such an attempt, have tried scoring with a panenka at major tournaments.\n\nBut Martinez wasn't about to let Messi go out on a miss and came up big with a save:\n\nNot once, but twice:\n\nArgentina won in the top of the fifth frame to advance to the semifinals. But Martinez continues to be an insane factor in the success of his club. He has been in four penalty shootouts. Martinez has faced 18 shots -- half of them missed by opponents and EIGHT OF THOSE SAVED BY EMI MARTINEZ.\n\nUnreal.\n\nHe was integral in saving penalties in the Argentina chase for a World Cup for his country. Round \"Next\" seems to be what we're seeing now. Or, in other words: \"Thursday night.\"\n\nFRIDAY: Venezuela and Canada play in suburban Dallas to see who moves on in the second of four quarterfinals matchups. How will Jesse Marsch react to the knockouts having made it farther than the host country his national squad is playing the match in?\n\nWe'll walk through it together. Play it safe, everyone. I'll talk to you soon.\n\nWe started the 2024 Copa America with 10 CONMEBOL nations and six guests to fill out the 16-team tournament here in the United States...\n\nNow, we're down to the final eight after the last night of the group stage. Group D had its share of drama with Brazil taking on Colombia in Santa Clara, Calif., and Costa Rica trying to make up ground with a big win over winless Paraguay in Austin, Texas.\n\nLos Ticos (Costa Rica) jumped out to a two-goal lead in the first quarter of the match and cruised to a 2-1 win. Frankly, it wasn't even that close of a match. Paraguay finishes the Group stage without a point and a goal difference of minus-5 (scoring three and allowing eight).\n\nFor Atlanta United fans, Miguel Almiron started and played only 45 minutes before being replaced at the half. He only registered 14 touches, was dispossessed three times, and was whistled for a foul. The next step for \"Miggy\" will be trying to find out where he'll be hanging his hat next season. There are reports in English media that his current club, Newcastle, are shopping him and there may be interest from clubs in Saudi Arabia.\n\nCosta Rica leaves the tournament making some noise but being in a difficult group to get out of with the next two teams we'll talk about.\n\nMost of the noise on the evening came from the events at Levi's Stadium with Brazil, Colombia, and VAR taking center stage all over again.\n\nLet's start with a rhetorical question: Does this look offside to you? Thanks to our friends at TUDN:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/TUDNUSA/status/1808314787312332856\n\nAs you saw, the goal was wiped off the board and the match (temporarily) stayed 1-0 in favor of Brazil. But the larger issue was the implementation of VAR drawing the line of discussion, literally, ON THE WRONG PLAYER. Thanks to FOX Soccer:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/FOXSoccer/status/1808313902473924883\n\nColombia equalized before the half time whistle, so the scoring ends up a bit \"moo\" (thanks to legendary actor Joey Tribbiani) and that was the final score of the group stage overall. Colombia wins the group and Brazil is second. The Brazil side, however, will be without global star Vinicius, Junior for the next round because of yellow card accumulation.\n\n(Don't take it up with me. Take it up with CONMEBOL. I didn't make the rules.)\n\nNOW WHAT?\n\nBrazil not winning the group means they get Uruguay. Colombia gets Panama. Venezuela gets Canada and, on July Fourth, Argentina plays Ecuador in Houston, Texas.\n\nSo, who had Canada as the one CONCACAF team making it to the knockout rounds?\n\nNot it. And a LOT of questions remain.\n\nSo, enjoy your July 3rd and your early July Fourth activities and we'll pick it all back up then.\n\nWe'll walk through the final eight together. Play it safe, everyone. I'll talk to you soon.\n\nRemember the talk we had about Mexico yesterday? Also, do you remember the anticipated reaction from everyone inside that particular country?\n\nThe United States Men's National Team will be watching the rest of the Copa America inside their country as spectators after a 1-0 loss to Uruguay in Kansas City. Combined with the Panama 3-1 win in Orlando, Panama advances to the knockouts and the U.S. is done...\n\nWhat the USMNT needed was to better the result of the Panamanians with simultaneous kickoffs in KC and central Florida. That didn't happen.\n\nThe U.S. was outshot by Uruguay 12 to 8 and only three of those eight were listed on target. Throughout the match, the physical nature of play was seemingly allowed to occur without repercussion from Peruvian center ref Kevin Ortega, who was reffing his first match in his tenure inside the Copa America. There were moments that confused both players and spectators as to what protocol was going to be with fouls and how they were going to be administered, if they were at all.\n\nUS striker Flo Balogun had to be subbed in the 41st minute with an injury; later information called it a hip pointer. That injury couldn't keep a substitution and a sub window on the board that could have helped later in the match if needed.\n\nUruguay would score in the second half. Here is that moment, thanks to our friends at FOX Soccer.\n\nAnd, remember, that was reviewed upstairs...\n\nFor the record, here's how the USMNT Copa ended, thanks again to FOX Soccer:\n\n\"I see no issue with the direction we're heading,\" goalkeeper Matt Turner told Jenny Taft from FOX Sports after the match. \"When you have a fight like that on the pitch in every single game we're in in this tournament, it speaks volumes to how the manager prepare us.\"\n\nThat speaks to how the players are backing head coach Gregg Berhalter. But in a tournament that had such high expectations that weren't met, it may have to be a decision to move on -- and do so quickly.\n\n\"I don't think this tournament really had anything to do with the staff or the tactics or the way we play,\" Gio Reyna said after the match. \"I think it was more individual mistakes. The staff can only do so much....at the end of the day, the players didn't do enough to go through.\"\n\nOrtega's performance will be universally panned without question. And the fact that he was in an environment above his level of experience made the match a frustrating watch.\n\nI guess also shaking a captain's hand after a match is also a challenge.\n\nBut that's another matter entirely.\n\nThe questions, sirens, pitchforks, tiki torches, and megaphones will be out in force for the foreseeable future involving the USMNT. We'll see where they go.\n\nTUESDAY: Group D gets the last two spots decided in the quarterfinals\n\nBoth matches in Group D are 9 p.m. EDT starts: Brazil plays Colombia in Santa Clara, California while Costa Rica and Paraguay will be in Austin, Texas. Colombia is heading to the knockouts. Brazil is in charge of their own destiny and finishing second. Costa Rica has an outside chance of advancing but they need a loss by Brazil and overcoming a 6-goal difference advantage. Paraguay is eliminated.\n\nWe'll walk through it all together... Play it safe, everyone, I'll talk to you soon...\n\nLet's face it: CONCACAF guest nations as a part of the 2024 Copa America have not fared well out of the blocks.\n\nThe first location we'll check in on is Austin, Texas, where Venezuela squared off against Jamaica in Group B. And there was going to be a piece of history either way as match day three had simultaneous starts. If La Vinotinto (Venezuela) were to win, the team would have won three straight matches during the Copa for the first time in their history. If Jamaica drew with Venezuela or won, they would earn their first ever point at the competition.\n\nAfter 45 minutes, we were talking about the latter. But that changed with a three-goal outburst in the second half by Venezuela. Here's the second of those from Salomon Rondon -- let's just say that he powered through to make this one happen.\n\nThanks to our friends at TUDN for the look:\n\nLa Vinotinto is headed to the Quarterfinals against Group A's Canada on July 5 at AT&T Stadium in suburban Dallas.\n\nThe second match we'll talk about has deeper issues attached. And for this one, we go to suburban Phoenix, Ariz.\n\nEl Tri (Mexico), as we have talked about, is a program in transition. And a lot of nations are passing by the former world power. They were playing Ecuador last in group play and needed a result to advance to the knockouts.\n\nThey didn't get it. But we'll skip to the end for the moment of consternation. In second-half injury time, Guatemalan referee Mario Escobar awarded a penalty to Mexico. But after a VAR check, he overturned that decision.\n\nHere's the walkthrough, thanks again to our friends at TUDN:\n\nThe final result was a 0-0 draw: Ecuador qualified for the Quarterfinals of the Copa, while the tournament ended for Mexico.\n\nWhat will follow is the standard amount of totally rational conversation from pundits and fans alike about the patience needed to see the younger talent grow as a part of the program so Mexico can return to being a force to be reckoned with. Just give it time (sarcasm).\n\nWhat will happen, as it started last night on broadcast television, are the pitchforks and tiki torches for anyone and everyone associated with this three-and-out in another competition. Words like \"crisis\" were floated around just moments after the match was over. And the yelling, screaming, ranting, and raving will be around for quite a while.\n\nTOMORROW: Speaking of yelling, screaming, ranting, and raving...\n\nIt's \"do or die\" for the U.S. Men's National Team against Uruguay. And it's probably, \"Win and win by more than a goal.\" The questions remain about the group leaders. Will they rotate their starting lineup or play as normal? Uruguay head coach Marcelo Bielsa will not be on the touchline (serving a match suspension for not bringing the team back out after halftime in a timely fashion in their last match).\n\nThe U.S. will be without Tim Weah for two matches for his red card that he received in the match at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. It will be interesting to see how Gregg Berhalter tackles the line up for this one in Kansas City. Bolivia and Panama will be playing at the same time in Orlando.\n\nIf the U.S. doesn't win, you're looking at Bolivia to pull an upset against Panama (translation: BIG UPSET IF THAT HAPPENS) to get into the knockouts.\n\nThe scoring was in short supply on Saturday night in Group A as we found out who was the second team to follow Argentina into the knockout round.\n\nAnd the answer is Canada, under their new head coach in Jesse Marsch.\n\nA rotated side from Argentina and head coach Lionel Scaloni went up against Chile in suburban Miami, without Scaloni due to a suspension from the previous-match decision of lollygagging to return for the second half. Lionel Messi was left out of the match to keep an eye on his health, wear, and tear.\n\nThe star of the show was Inter Milan striker Lisandro Martinez- whose second half double propelled Argentina to a 2-0 win over Peru. He now leads all scorers in the Copa with 4 goals and has scored seven goals in his last seven international matches.\n\nHere's his first one on the night, thanks to our friends at TUDN:\n\nThe other team ends up making history as Canada's Men's National Team goes forward with a goalless draw with Chile in Orlando. Chile played almost 70 minutes down a man after a second yellow card was issued to Gabriel Suazo near the half-way point of the first half.\n\nCanada becomes the third invitee in tournament history to make it to the knockouts in their first visit to the Copa. Since there weren't any goals to speak of, here's what it meant to the country's soccer community through the eyes of OneSoccer's Kristian Jack\n\nCanada will play either Venezuela, Mexico or Ecuador at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas in the next round- whoever wins Group B, basically.\n\nSUNDAY: It'll be Group B's turn to determine who goes to the knockouts. Both matches are slated for 8PM eastern time.\n\nJamaica and Venezuela will play in Austin, Texas while Mexico and Ecuador will play in suburban Phoenix. Venezuela are, currently, top of the group and are awaiting their place in the knockouts with 6 points and wins over both teams playing in Phoenix. Jamaica would need a win by a HUGE margin to make up the goal difference among them and the teams playing in Phoenix.\n\nThe rub in this group is the one goal-goal difference between Mexico and Ecuador. A draw sends Ecuador through. A win sends whoever that team is through to the next round.\n\nA team truly in transition when it comes to their coaching, personnel, identity, and capability got to dust off some of the old ways in the nightcap Friday in a 4-1 blowout of Paraguay in Las Vegas.\n\nVinicius, Junior scored his first ever brace for the country as his Brazil side had a 3-0 lead at intermission. Here's his first of the match that got things rolling, thanks to TUDN:\n\nThe match, frankly, didn't feel that close (and wasn't) until Alderete for Paraguay scored early in the second half to cut the margin to two goals. Lucas Paqueta, who plays his club ball at West Ham in the Premier League, slotted home a penalty kick with 25 minutes to go for the final margin.\n\nAlthough, Paqueta may not be chosen for PK's down the line as he missed another in the match itself. We'll keep an eye on that decision when it comes to pass further down the line in the tourney.\n\nThis was a far better result for Brazil than the Group D opener against Costa Rica where Los Ticos were happy just being in the building and had no desire to score against the Verdeamarelha. They're at four points and just need to secure one more point in matchday three to advance to the knockout stage. Paraguay was eliminated.\n\nThe early match of the day was the first for State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona where another pro-Colombian crowd cheered on their country in a dominant 3-0 win over the earlier-mentioned Costa Rican side.\n\nLos Cafeteros became the third team to qualify for the knockouts as Luis Diaz, Davinson Sanchez and Jhon Cordoba scored for their team and James Rodriguez picked up his third assist of the tournament.\n\nLos Ticos keeper Patrick Sequeira had some marvelous and acrobatic moments early to keep things scoreless. But his own aggressiveness on Cordoba led to the Diaz penalty conversion in the first half. Thanks, once again, to TUDN:\n\nLuis Diaz? Claro, casi!\n\nThe Sanchez and Cordoba goals were three minutes apart and put some quick distance between the two sides early Friday evening.\n\nCosta Rica can still qualify for the knockouts, but they'll need help on the last match day.\n\nSATURDAY: It's the beginning of the last group stage match days to determine who goes on and who goes home. In Group A, Argentina and Peru square off at 8pm eastern in suburban Miami while Canada and Chile start at the same time up the road in Orlando.\n\nArgentina is set to rotate their side with first place locked up- translation: No Messi and, maybe, no Angel diMaria. Just how rotated they'll be is an interesting subplot. If Chile beats Canada, they advance. If through some act of magic, Peru beats Argentina, it could come down to goal difference.\n\nYesterday, we talked about Mexico and their national team being in a situation like that for their last group stage match.\n\nIt can now be said about the U.S. Men's National Team after their 2-1 loss at Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium in front of a crowd of just over 59,000 dressed in their best red, white and blue threads.\n\nIt took all of 12 minutes for the home fans to be concerned over the status of starting goalkeeper Matt Turner. Turner was undercut by Panama's Cesar Blackman while going airborne to get a handle on a the ball inside the 18-yard box. No card was given by center referee Ivan Barton of El Salvador -- and that would set a tone for the remainder of the match.\n\nFour minutes later, USA's Timothy Weah lashed out with a straight right hand to Panama defender Rod Miller. Initially, Weah was given a yellow card. But upon review, it was upgraded to a red and the U.S. would play with 10 men for the remainder of the night.\n\nWeah would post an apology to his Instagram later Thursday evening, thanks to the Fox Soccer for the screen cap:\n\nAntonee Robinson and Folarin Balogun combined for a USA 1-0 lead in the 22nd minute, but Panama equalized and that's where we were after 45 minutes.\n\nUSMNT head coach Gregg Berhalter made three changes at the half, including goalkeeper Ethan Horvath for Matt Turner in net. It was later disclosed that Turner was pulled from the match for a \"leg contusion\" and not anything to do with the collision early in the match.\n\nPanama took the lead in the 83rd minute as Jose Fajardo put a ball past Horvath and that would be the end result. The USMNT now face, for all intents and purposes, a \"must-win\" match against Uruguay, who throttled Bolivia 5-0 to lead Group C ahead of the showdown in Kansas City Monday night.\n\nFor the USMNT to advance to the knockout phase, their result against Uruguay in their final group-stage game must match or better Panama's result against Bolivia.\n\nIf Panama beats Bolivia, the U.S. must beat Uruguay and will then depend on tiebreakers -- with goal difference being the first one on the flow chart. If Panama draws, the U.S. would advance with a win or a draw. If Bolivia beats Panama (Caveat: Bolivia are 41 places lower in the international rankings), the U.S. would advance with a win or a draw, while a loss would leave goal difference as the determining factor.\n\nGot all that? There will be a test later on.\n\nFRIDAY: We'll have more on the U.S. match from Mercedes-Benz here at gpb.org. Then Group D takes center stage as Colombia and Costa Rica square off in Glendale, Ariz., at 6 p.m. EDT while Paraguay and Brazil play in Las Vegas at 9 p.m. EDT.\n\nAnd it has nothing to do with the thoughts of some federations about playing on grass in stadia across the country.\n\nIf you're a fan of Mexico, they now face a \"backs against the wall\" situation after losing to Venezuela 1-0 in suburban Los Angeles. It's win or go home in their final group match day against Ecuador in a few days' time. But they had chances and just couldn't convert any of them down a goal. It even included this penalty kick attempt by Orbelin Pineda.\n\nLet's just say it didn't go well -- thanks to our friends at FOX Soccer:\n\nThe Vinotinto (the national team for Venezuela) and El Tri mixed it up on the field when the match was over. It will be interesting to see if anything comes of the puffing out of chests and finger pointing at your opponent after Matchday 2.\n\nThe first match of Day 7 was in Las Vegas and featured Ecuador taking care of Jamaica 3-1... An own goal in the 13th minute by the Reggae Boyz defense and a Kendry Paez penalty at the end of the first half gave Jamaica a big mountain to climb. But Michail Antonio registered a penalty conversion of his own and the match was on (your piece of trivia here: The Antonio goal was the first-ever scored by Jamaica in their Copa history). Alan Minda, however, would score in the 91st minute for the winning margin, 3-1.\n\nTHURSDAY: The U.S. Men's national team starts Day 8 of competition at Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium with a 6 p.m. eastern kick against Panama.\n\nUSMNT midfielder Tim Weah has been impressed with Atlanta so far- involving and not involving soccer: \"Atlanta is a progressive city,\" Weah says. \"I think the training center is gonna be in a perfect place where all of us- we're all pretty much East Coast boys- so, you know, I see myself in the future kind of investing in Atlanta as well.\n\n\"Either, you know, getting land out here, building a house, so that my family could be close when I come back. It's not a bad call.\"\n\nThe other match on the day is back in New Jersey as Uruguay and Bolivia square off at 9 p.m. EDT. It's anticipated to be the second step before the two favorites (Uruguay and the US) collide to determine the top seed coming out of Group C in match day three.\n\nWord of warning: If you're taking your own transportation to downtown Atlanta, get to the stadium early and be aware of road closures. Remember, with the U.S. presidential debate going on in Midtown Atlanta late into the evening, you'll have roadblocks, closures, and all the other related headaches you can imagine as you and 70,000 other futbol fans try to get home before next Monday night.\n\nCanada and Peru had prepared us for a physical match in the 90-degree weather in Kansas City, where a linesman official collapsed from heat exhaustion and was taken off the field in a stretcher.\n\nSo much so that the Peruvian head coach said (paraphrasing) that if his players had to use their fists, they would use their fists. Obviously, you can't actually do that, but there were a few moments that leaned in that direction.\n\nFirst, you had a head butt that only got a talking-to by the ref, courtesy of Fox Sports:\n\nBut, later you had this moment that forced Peru to play with ten:\n\nAnd fifteen minutes later, Canada scored their first-ever goal in the Copa America. It would stand up, and in a must-win match to stay around for a chance at the knockout round, they got it. Final score: Canada beats Peru 1 - 0.\n\nThe nightcap was in front of a sellout crowd in New Jersey as Argentina squared off against Chile. Chile goalkeeper Claudio Bravo was an absolute force between the sticks in trying to preserve the goalless draw. The 41-year-old made eight saves on the night- six from inside the 18-yard box. But, on a third successive corner by Argentina in the 88th minute, Lisandro Martinez slammed the ball home for the winning margin. Final score: Argentina beats Chile 1 - 0.\n\nWEDNESDAY: The US Men's National Team will have a second morning of practice getting ready for Thursday's match with Panama at Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium. US Soccer presented Atlanta United keeper Brad Guzan a jersey for being the 641st different player to get an international call-up in the history of the program on Tuesday.\n\n\"It feels good to be in Atlanta,\" goalkeeper Matt Turner said after morning practice Tuesday. \"I've played in MLS for a number of years and this is one of the away games you didn't really ever want to play- especially when they first came into the league. So, we know that the fan turn out at Mercedes-Benz for Atlanta United's really good and we're hoping to see some of that and feel that energy from the crowd on Thursday night.\n\n\"We saw that they had a pretty good turnout for the Argentina-Canada game, so we're hoping for some of the same for us.\"\n\nOn the field, Group B has Ecuador and Jamaica in the early match in Las Vegas and Venezuela playing Mexico in the night cap at SoFi Stadium in suburban Los Angeles.\n\nHow will El Tri respond to the Edson Alvarez injury?\n\nWell, when you're Costa Rica going up against Brazil, that's the case.\n\nThe late match last night was a match that will NOT, under any circumstance, be kept in any kind of a television time capsule -- unless you're a fan of Los Ticos.\n\nAt SoFi Stadium in suburban Los Angeles, Brazil was left frustrated and held scoreless in a match that will be remembered for how slanted it was in the stats column for Brazil. It will also be remembered for just how uninterested in having any kind of second half offense Costa Rica was.\n\nBrazil almost had three times the amount of possession. They outshot Costa Rica 19 to 2. Costa Rica had 34 clearances on defense compared to 7 and the Brazil goalkeeper didn't have to make a save all night long.\n\nBut Costa Rica will feel like they won the World Cup and Brazil will be viewed through the troublesome prism of a team that is in transition from older players to younger ones and that is still trying to figure out who they are.\n\nBrazil got CONCACAF'ed in a CONMEBOL tournament. Basically, that means you were shown every trick in the book to frustrate you and make you \"not win\" a match. If you know someone in downtown San Jose, give them a call. You may not be able to hear them over the shouting of holding mighty Brazil scoreless for 90 minutes.\n\nIn the first match of the day in Houston, the TV pictures showed that Colombia's fans came in some of the strongest numbers to date. Their counterparts from Paraguay were scattered throughout the building and were quite hard to find.\n\nInternational star James Rodriguez starred in his 100th cap (Colombian national team appearance) for his home country and was showing the brilliance that has given his career homes like Porto (Portugal), Monaco (in the French league), Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. For fans, it was a flashback of what the 32-year-old, who now plays in Brazil, has meant when he has been healthy and in the right system. Colombia scored twice in a 10-minute span and held on for a 2-1 win.\n\nBrighton's Julio Enciso scored with 20 minutes to go for Paraguay, but they couldn't get any closer. Former Atlanta United and current Newcastle attacker Miguel Almiron started for Paraguay, and logged a quiet 59 minutes before being removed.\n\nTUESDAY: It's Matchday Two for Group A as Peru and Canada play at 6 p.m. EDT in suburban Kansas City and the nightcap at the Meadowlands in New Jersey as Argentina takes on Chile.\n\nIt was Lionel Messi's 37th birthday Monday, by the way, and fans serenaded him from outside his hotel room from the street level.\n\nI wonder how many fans actually ate their piece and how many froze it for posterity?\n\nWe'll see later today.\n\nIt's a day where we'll work backwards again because Group C presents an early marker for the USA.\n\nThe nightcap was in suburban Miami as Uruguay and Paraguay played in front of a crowd slightly over 33,000. Coached by \"El Loco,\" Marcelo Bielsa, Uruguay made a point to put a lot of pressure on their opponents -- as is Bielsa's M.O. It paid off in the second half as the one goal scored in the first half was accompanied by two more for a late 3-0 lead.\n\nParaguay scored an, \"Oh, by the way\" goal late to bring the margin back to two and a 3-1. (That goal will become really important later in the story here.)\n\nFor the U.S., it was a chance to go up against one of the weaker teams in CONMEBOL in Bolivia. U.S. Men's Soccer captain and forward, Christian Pulisic put in an early header in the third minute for the quick lead Sunday night in front of a large crowd in suburban Dallas -- the quickest-ever lead in team history.\n\nNot to be outdone in the first 45 minutes, Folarin Balogun scored for the hosts to double the lead before the half. That would be the eventual final score as the U.S. improves to 6-0-0 at AT&T Stadium lifetime.\n\n\"He's a selfless leader,\" Berhalter told reporters about Pulisic after the match. \"He goes out and he just competes and works really hard, and that helps the team. And then you add to the fact that he's highly skilled and he can make plays on the offensive end, it's a great combination.\"\n\n\"To me, it was an outstanding performance tonight.\"\n\nHere are highlights, thanks to CONMEBOL, US Soccer, and Copa America.\n\nOh, the math!\n\nRight now, after one match, Uruguay leads the group -- on goals scored, the third tiebreaker. Both teams earned three points for their victories and have the same goal difference, but the three Uruguayan goals are one better than the red, white, and blue offense. All signs point to the last group match between these two to determine the top seed coming out of group play down the line.\n\nTOMORROW: Group D kicks off their play in Houston at 6 p.m. EDT with Colombia and Paraguay followed by Brazil and Costa Rica at SoFi Stadium in suburban Los Angeles at 9 p.m. EDT.\n\nWe'll walk through it all together... Play it safe, everyone, I'll talk to you soon...\n\nApparently, in the Copa in Houston on Saturday, June 22.\n\nLet's work backwards ...\n\nThe night cap was in a fairly full NRG Stadium in Houston (53,763 in attendance) Saturday as Jamaica took on Mexico in front of an unsurprisingly, fairly-dominant, pro El Tri crowd...\n\nThere are concerns going forward as Mexico forward Edson Alvarez had to be removed from the match in the first half with a suspected hamstring injury. He was in tears as he was being helped off the turf by two team physios. The standard offensive problems continue to trouble Mexico and it looked like Jamaica went on the scoreboard first with a Michail Antonio header- but not so fast, my friends.\n\nVAR pulls the goal back but Mexico would score a few minutes later. Gerardo Arteaga gave his side the lead and the eventual win.\n\nThe first match of the day was in Santa Clara, California as Ecuador and Venezuela kicked off Group B play. Ecuador's Enner Valencia put his team at an early deficit with this play.\n\nSo, naturally, adding to the chaos, Ecuador's Jeremy Sarmiento would score first giving his 10-man side a lead. It wouldn't last, however, as Venezuela would finally take advantage of their man-advantage. Jhonder C\u00e1diz and Eduard Bello, who came on at halftime, scored for Venezuela, giving La Vinotinto the 2-1 win.\n\nSUNDAY: Two more matches at 6pm and 9pm eastern time from Group C\n\nThe first match involves the USA and their debut in the tournament against Bolivia -- once again at AT&T Stadium in suburban Dallas. Uruguay and Panama finish the evening at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami.\n\n\"We've been speaking about this for a while and it's finally around the corner so we're all excited and we want to get to a good start,\" USA midfielder Yunus Musah admits after the learning experience of the two friendlies that happened leading into Copa America. \"Being really solid defensively and being really organized, we saw that it was difficult for Brazil to beat us so we see that as like a strength of us and we want to carry that on because that's what's going to help us.\"\n\nFor all the free-flowing futbol we saw on Day 1, Day 2 was nothing of the sort as Peru and Chile played at AT&T Stadium in suburban Dallas Friday, June 21. There's always a saying that you can't win (something) on the first day of (insert competition name here), but you certainly can lose it.\n\nIn looking a great deal like the Netherlands-France match earlier in the day in Euro2024 that was an uninspiring goalless draw, the solo match for the Copa America looked like both teams didn't want to completely fall out of consideration from finishing second in the group that involves Argentina. The top two teams in each group advance to the knockout stages. The third and fourth place teams go home.\n\nA win gives you three points in group play. A draw means each team registers a point in the standings. A loss gives you nothing.\n\nThe center ref, Wilton Pereira Sampaio of Brazil, certainly enjoyed the sound of his own whistle in a match that lacked any kind of rhythm. He called 37 fouls and issued four yellow cards along the way. For Atlanta United fans, defender Luis Abram came in as a late-match substitute to help secure the point for his native Peru.\n\nTOMORROW: There are two Copa America matches- Group B contests involving Ecuador and Venezuela at 6pm eastern from Santa Clara, California and Mexico and Jamaica in Houston, Texas at 9PM eastern.\n\nIt was as close as you could get to an Argentina home match without actually being in Buenos Aires.\n\nArgentina fans in their 80s watched their team for the first time in person, looking to meet Messi. Young fans wore Messi jerseys, wanting to meet the man who is considered to be one of the world's best soccer players. And then there were the fans who brought in posters, banners, and spray-art of the GOAT of the sport -- they were all in attendance.\n\nFor the sellout crowd of just over 70,000 fans, the Thursday, June 20 Copa Am\u00e9rica game was all about Argentina.\n\nMessi had two chances to score in the second half, where his team passed long and over-the-top of the Canadian backline: the first was a goal in the 65th minute that gave the crowd a 1v2 slaloming chase inside the 18; the second opportunity resulted in a tackle that dispossessed Messi inside the box from behind about 15 minutes later. The majority of fans wanted a penalty call on the second chance, but it wasn't considered.\n\nMessi and Lautaro Martinez combined to break through the Canada press to score goal No. 2 in the 88th minute for the final margin. The win snapped a four match-opening game losing streak across Argentina's last four national team competitions.\n\nNext up for the two teams are matches on Tuesday, June 25 when Argentina plays Chile at The Meadowlands in New Jersey and Canada travels to Kansas City to take on Peru.\n\nMessi, with the start for Argentina, set a new record for appearances in the tournament with 35 (and counting, presumably).", "source": {"uri": "gpb.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Georgia Public Broadcasting"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jon_nelson@gpb.org", "name": "Jon Nelson", "type": "author", "isAgency":

A 39th-minute Jefferson Lerma header sealed the victory for the Colombians to face defending champions Argentina in the final. James Rodriguez provided his sixth assist of the tournament to be the leading assist maker in a single edition of the tournament.\n\nThe game had a complicated start as tackles were flying through from both sides, sending clear, physical messages. Just after the goal in the first half, things went downhill for the Colombians as Daniel Munoz was sent off with a second yellow for an elbow at Uruguay's Manuel Ugarte, reducing them to ten men for the second half.\n\nDespite Uruguay's efforts, they could not break down the opposition in the second half. In the final 20 minutes, they went all in as Luis Suarez hit the crossbar. Federico Valverde, the Real Madrid midfielder, then went close with a low shot as Colombia's defense continued to rely on chance. In stoppage time, they had a golden opportunity to force penalties when Nunez sent the ball to replacement Giorgian de Arrascaeta on the edge of the box, but he leaned back and blasted over the bar.\n\nUruguay coach Marcelo Biesla took the blame for the defeat. He said, \"We were clearly in a position to win this game... I take full responsibility for not having been able to establish an advantage when we had the players capable of doing so.\"\n\nThe Colombian winger made history in the game by moving ahead of Lionel Messi for the most assists in a single edition of the Copa America. He surpassed the Argentine maestro, who had earlier recorded five assists in the 2021 Copa America campaign. In the 39th minute, he put in a pin-point cross, which Jefferson Lerma scored to make it the winning goal for their team.", "source": {"uri": "zeenews.india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zee News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Rodr\u00edguez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Rodr\u00edguez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Ugarte_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Ugarte (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ejection (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Lerma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson Lerma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Valverde", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federico Valverde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgian_de_Arrascaeta", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giorgian de Arrascaeta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_(footballer,_born_1988)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcelo (footballer, born 1988)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2024/07/11/1436519-mixcollage-11-jul-2024-11-30-am-8555.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723292", "eventUri": "eng-9723292", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

Oddly enough, Bielsa kept striker Luis Su\u00e1rez on the bench for quite a while during the second half. Eventually, in his first minute on the pitch, Su\u00e1rez hit the goalpost, proving the Rosario-born man's tactics unsuitable.\n\nAs time passed by, Colombia built up a robust rearguard, thanks to which they were on average closer than Uruguay to stretching the lead which would have meant a lethal blow way before the final whistle. Keeper Sergio Rochet was more active than his Colombian counterpart Camilo Vargas despite Uruguay's unproductive territorial prevalence.\n\nIn the duel pitting Argentine coaches against each other, Lorenzo prevailed against the arguably overrated Bielsa who looked baffled as he cursed time and again blaming his team's shortcomings on bad luck when it was visibly a combination of player stamina with a good strategy, both of which Uruguay lacked while Colombia had plenty.\n\nIn addition, fortune never was on Bielsa's side since he was forced to make an early change when Rodrigo Bentancurt left the field injured in the 34th minute.\n\nBy earning a berth against Canada for third place also at Charlotte on Saturday, Uruguay also squandered the chance to untie the score with Argentina since both teams have won 15 Copas America each. Colombia have played only two finals, losing to Peru in 1975 and beating Mexico in 2001 for their only title.\n\nThe competition is traditionally reserved for the teams making up the South American Football Confederation (Conmebol).

The throng ended up penetrating relatively deep into the stands, and it seemed to get out of hand at first.\n\nN\u00fa\u00f1ez actually climbed onto the scaffolding to get into the stands, seeming pretty eager to have a hand in the action, as seen in the video below.\n\nIt honestly gets wilder with each new angle.\n\nIt's unclear what exactly prompted N\u00fa\u00f1ez and the rest of the Uruguayan side to advance into the stands, but there were some words to be said between either side. There were also small fights during the game between the two teams that could have caused some tension among the fans.\n\nThat being said, it's not often players are even allowed in the stands, let alone actively want to go into them.

It was an electric start right from the first while, with both teams hustling and chances keeping fans on the edge of their seat.\n\nGoalkeepers Sergio Rochet and Camilo Vargas were kept on their toes, sometimes pushing last-ditch efforts onto the woodwork while passion poured out onto every inch of the pitch.

They defeated Brazil to win the 2021 Copa America and downed France in an electric 2022 FIFA World Cup title match.\n\nLionel Messi is of course the main attraction for any Argentina game, but its entire team has played well throughout the tournament.\n\nGoalkeeper Emiliano Martinez is one of the best at his position in the world and he leads a defense that allowed one goal and held four clean sheets so far at the Copa America.\n\nColombia features an equally as impressive defensive unit that held Uruguay scoreless in Wednesday's semifinal despite playing the entire second half down a man.\n\nLos Cafeteros conceded on two occasions in the tournament, once to Brazil and another time to Paraguay. They held three clean sheets and have not conceded in two knockout-round contests.\n\nColombia put up five goals on Panama in the quarterfinals, but that had more to do with the gap in overall quality in that game than what Colombia can bring to the field on Sunday.\n\nLiverpool's Luis Diaz and James Rodriguez are the most dangerous players for Colombia, and while they can be dangerous in attack, they lack experience in an international final with their national team.\n\nArgentina has a roster full of battle-tested players and that could be a massive advantage for the reigning Copa champion if the game is close going into the second half.\n\nColombia will likely play with no pressure because of its underdog role, but if it falls behind, it may not have an answer for Argentina.\n\nHistory is not on Colombia's side either. It has a single win in its last 12 meetings with Argentina and it only owns a single Copa title from 2001.\n\nThree of the last four Copa America finals had less than two goals in regulation and two of them went to penalties, so expect a tight affair in which one moment of brilliance, potentially from Messi, makes the difference.\n\nIf you or someone you know has a gambling problem, crisis counseling and referral services can be accessed by calling 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537) (IL/IN/MI/NJ/PA/WV/WY), 1-800-NEXT STEP (AZ), 1-800-522-4700 (CO/NH), 888-789-7777/visiting ccpg.org/chat (CT), 1-800-BETS OFF (IA), 1-877-770-STOP (7867) (LA), visiting OPGR.org (OR), or calling/texting TN REDLINE 1-800-889-9789 (TN) or 1-888-532-3500 (VA).\n\nOdds and lines subject to change. 21+ (18+ NH/WY).

But while the South American nation celebrated their victory, Suarez wasn't best pleased with Borja.\n\nAs the 37-year-old approached Borja, a clip shows Suarez sticking his head into the Colombian's shoulder, in what appears like an attempt at another bite. Suarez then walks away to congratulate James Rodriguez, who had sunk to his knees, before returning to Borja and sparking ugly scenes after the match.\n\nBoth sets of players and coaching staff clashed, with Suarez then seen to throw a punch at one of Colombia's back room members.\n\nThe Inter Miami forward has previously bitten three different players during his career, resulting in lengthy bans on each occasion. While playing for Ajax in 2010, the Uruguayan bit PSV player Otman Bakkal on the shoulder, resulting in a seven-game suspension.\n\nA few years later, while at Liverpool, Suarez then picked up a ban of ten matches after he bit Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic.

However, he lacked the necessary composure and sent his shot wide of the bottom-left corner after 22 minutes.\n\nShortly after, Nunez was through again but hurried his effort and sent it over the bar. Nunez appeared to be in disbelief following his second crucial miss, having earlier expressed his anger after squandering a significant opportunity.\n\nAs he spun away in frustration, he screamed as it became clear he was feeling the pressure of leading the line for Uruguay in an enormous game, knowing Lionel Messi and Argentina await in the final. Within the first 30 minutes, Nunez had taken all four of Uruguay's shots but failed to challenge Vargas on any occasion.\n\nEntering the semi-final, Nunez had scored two goals in four games at Copa America for Uruguay and was on a scoring spree ahead of the tournament. He had netted in seven consecutive games for Uruguay, totalling eight in ten, but his visibly frustrated reaction suggested he was perhaps feeling the pressure of the occasion.\n\nThe Liverpool forward had scored in Uruguay's first two games of Copa America, securing victories over Panama and Bolivia. Despite failing to score in a 1-0 win over the United States men's national team, he is still considered a superior option to Luis Suarez by head coach Marcelo Bielsa.\n\nMany supporters have been torn on Nunez since Liverpool club-record move from Benfica in 2022. He's netted 20 times in 65 Premier League matches.\n\nDespite showing signs of being a top-tier striker, Nunez has been ridiculed by opposing fans for squandering key opportunities. He always seems to be in the right spot but occasionally lacks the killer instinct when presented with a golden chance.\n\nSince making his Premier League debut, Nunez has taken 192 shots in 65 games, with 83 hitting the mark. While 20 of those on-target attempts have found the back of the net, he's missed 47 significant chances.\n\nOn average, Nunez misses a major opportunity every 0.72 matches, but he's also had a run of bad luck. No other player has hit the woodwork more than Nunez (14) since he arrived in England.\n\nFans are optimistic that new Liverpool manager Arne Slot can bring out the best in Nunez next season. His Copa America exploits are sure to have boosted his confidence before returning to pre-season - but the semi-final was a frustrating end to a tournament which saw him shoulder plenty of responsibility for his national side.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rich_jones@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Rich Jones", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "joseph_mcbride@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Joseph McBride", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camilo_Vargas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Camilo Vargas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Vargas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eduardo Vargas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Panama"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Panama"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bolivia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bolivia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_Bielsa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcelo Bielsa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.L._Benfica", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S.L.

The Argentinian great achieved the feat in 2021, during Albiceleste's title-winning campaign.\n\nRodriguez kicked off his campaign by bagging two assists against Paraguay in Colombia's opening group game.\n\nHe went on to register one against Costa Rica and two again in Colombia's quarter-final against Panama.\n\nArgentina will face Columbia in their Copa America title defence on Sunday, July 14.", "source": {"uri": "rediff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rediff.com India Ltd."}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Rodr\u00edguez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "James Rodr\u00edguez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Lerma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson Lerma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Costa Rica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Costa Rica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguay", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paraguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Paraguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Panama"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Panama"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://im.rediff.com/sports/2024/jul/11james-rodriguez.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723292", "eventUri": "eng-9723292", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-14", "textStart": 1220, "textEnd": 1227}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 98, "relevance": 1}

Mac Allister, Nunez or Diaz certain to come back a Copa America winner, we can be sure that at least one Liverpool player will be on a huge high when they next walk through the door of the AXA

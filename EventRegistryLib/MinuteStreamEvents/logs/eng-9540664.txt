While the little one has been kept away from the glare of public scrutiny by his mum and dad, rumour has it they might share a snap of him and his baby sis, Princess Lilibet, on the big day.\n\nIn the meantime, royal enthusiasts have noticed something striking. They reckon Archie bears an uncanny resemblance to Princess Eugenie's eldest son, August, who she shares with hubby Jack Brooksbank.\n\nThe comparison was made after lovely Eugenie uploaded several snaps of her tribe on Instagram to celebrate Jack's recent birthday. One of those pictures showed Jack and August having some fun in the sun at the beach, doing what all dads do - sticking long bits of seaweed onto his unsuspecting child's head!\n\nAs soon as the upload hit the web, one ardent observer piped up and said: \"August looks so much like Archie.\" And it appears they're right - both mini-royals share the same light brown wavy hair and pink-tinged cheeks. A heart-warming stream of well-wishes ensued for Jack and praise towards Eugenie about her beautiful family, reports the Mirror.\n\nArchie entered the world back in 2019 at Portland Hospital in London. Staying true to their desire for privacy, Harry and Meghan opted not to participate in the traditional photo op on the hospital steps that followed Royal births in the past, instead announcing Archie's arrival via Buckingham Palace and a quaint easel bearing the joyful news outside the famous palace.\n\nThe Sussexes are known for their privacy, especially when it comes to their children. However, earlier this year, Meghan reportedly hired a photographer to capture some new family photos.\n\nIn March, Meghan collaborated with photographer Jake Rosenberg to take pictures of her and her children at their Montecito mansion in California. This extravagant photo shoot is thought to have been timed with the launch of her lifestyle brand, American Riviera Orchard.\n\nReports suggest that she had photos taken with her two children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.

It is unclear if the Sussexes will post a new picture of him to mark the occasion, but in the meantime, royal fans have spotted a resemblance between Archie and Princess Eugenie's eldest son August, whom she shares with her husband, Jack Brooksbank.\n\nThe resemblance was pointed out after Eugenie posted a number of photos on Instagram to wish her husband a happy birthday on Saturday.

I'm four-and-a-half' Misan was showing him how to do photography the last time he was with us, and I bought Archie a camera, and he said, 'But it's not a Leica like Misan'.\"\n\nShe continued: \"I said, 'You are not getting a Leica! Not even for Christmas'.\" She then joked with her photographer friend, saying: \"So thank you for the inspiration across the board.\"\n\nLeica cameras can cost thousands of pounds - or dollars - because they take a lot of time and hard work to make. They are also incredibly rare and are only sold in small amounts.\n\nThe Sussexes with their baby son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor in 2019\n\nPreviously, Harry revealed a very unusual gift the late Queen Elizabeth sent his son for Christmas. When Archie was two, his great-grandmother asked Harry and Meghan what he wanted for Christmas - and the Duchess of Sussex said Archie wanted a waffle maker.\n\nThe late Queen then had the gift shipped out to the Sussexes' home in Montecito, California. After making the revelation to comedian James Corden on The Late Late Show, Harry added: \"So she sent us a waffle maker for Archie, so breakfast now Meg makes up a beautiful organic mix, in the waffle maker, flip it, out it comes. He loves it. And now I have waffles for breakfast, bit of yogurt, bit of jam on top. I don't know if that's the right thing to do. Berries, bit of honey.\"\n\nJames seemed confused and interrupted Harry, saying: \"Sorry you're glossing over the fact that I cannot for the life of me imagine the Queen ordering a waffle maker to be sent to Santa Barbara. I can't get my head around it.\" Harry replied: \"I don't even know how to comment on that.

While Archie was born in the UK, he moved to America with his parents when he was one. Archie and Lilibet have visited the UK just once - for Queen Elizabeth's Platinum Jubilee.\n\nRoyal expert Tom Quinn claims the monarch will reach out to the Duke of Sussex today so he can wish Archie a happy birthday. Quinn also claims the King has discussed the idea of video-calling his son and grandson.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to The Mirror, the royal author said: \"King Charles dislikes new technology, but is desperate to keep in touch with his grandchildren on the other side of the Atlantic so he will certainly call Harry and wish Archie Happy Birthday. Charles been asking about video calling, but according to his aides, he's uncomfortable with the idea. If he makes an ordinary telephone call to Harry it means he can have a quick word with Archie without the need to talk to Meghan, a prospect that fills him with dread.\"\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on

Harry and Meghan try to keep the children's lives as private as possible but revealed some details in their Netflix documentary series last year.\n\nREAD MORE: Prince Archie's adorable request for gift that Meghan Markle refused\n\nArchie with his dad Harry Meghan holding her two children, Archie and Lilibet\n\nIn the series, Archie, who is celebrating his fifth birthday today, was seen chasing seagulls at the beach, picking oranges with his parents in their garden in Montecito, and playing with the two family dogs. Archie attended pre-school in California and is set to start full-time education next year when he turns six.\n\nHaving only spent the first few months of his life in the UK, Archie feels like the US is \"home\", Harry previously said. For his birthday today, Archie is likely to have a quiet, private party with some simple games, a cake, and ice cream, according to a royal expert.\n\nAuthor Tom Quinn said Blind Man's Bluff could be one of the games for the party, which is likely to be attended by his friends from school, his grandmother Doria Ragland, and some celebrities who live in the Montecito area. Speaking exclusively to The Mirror, Mr Quinn said Meghan enjoys organising birthdays for her children but she wants them to be \"very private affairs\" so that Archie and Lilibet can experience \"the more ordinary things in life\".\n\nHarry and Meghan also have two family dogs that Archie enjoys playing with\n\nThe author said: \"When it comes to her children's birthdays, Meghan is almost obsessed with the idea that they should be quiet, very private affairs, with simple games, a birthday cake and ice cream. Archie is a real live-wire who loves rushing around at top speed so there will also be blind man's bluff and tag among other games. Meghan combines a deep sense of her own global importance in the wider world with a desire to make her children experience what she sees as the more ordinary things in life.\n\n\"So, for Archie's birthday, there will be friends from school, Meghan's mother Doria Ragland and one or two celebrities - any celebrity neighbour with a child the same age, and that includes actors Katie Perry and Orlando Bloom and their daughter Daisy - will definitely be invited.\" Last year, Meghan planned a \"low-key\" birthday party for Archie at home which he enjoyed with his family as his sister, Lilibet, who turned two in June, also joined in the fun.\n\nThe celebrations were small and intimate, with only Archie's grandmother, Doria Ragland, and Meghan's close friend, Victoria Jackson, in attendance. In a special touch, Meghan baked a lemon cake for Archie using fruit from their garden, a source said. The couple's \u00a311million home in Montecito was decorated for the occasion, with balloons and streamers adding to the festive atmosphere.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter,

The following May, the couple welcomed Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, now Prince Archie of Sussex, in London.\n\nWhen Archie was 8 months old, his parents announced their plans to step back from their royal roles, and the family moved from the U.K. to California. Since then, the family has settled into life on the West Coast, where Archie and his younger sister, Princess Lilibet, are growing up largely outside the public eye.\n\nHowever, the family's life in California hasn't stopped Harry and Meghan from sharing the occasional anecdote about their young children. In 2022, Prince Harry told Today's Hoda Kotb that Archie had inherited some of his cheekiness -- and loved to interrupt Zoom calls.\n\n\"Archie spends more time interrupting our Zoom calls than anybody else,\" he said of then-2-year-old Archie. \"But he often gets us off them, as well, so that's also a nice thing.\"\n\nThese days, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are focused on their children. A California source told PEOPLE in August 2023 Meghan \"just wants to focus on their kids and their life in Montecito,\" adding that the couple \"are very united when it comes to family values and how to raise their kids.\"\n\n\"They are both great parents,\" the source continued. \"Their kids are their world.\"\n\nIn May 2024, a source close to the family told PEOPLE that Prince Harry and Meghan planned to celebrate Archie's 5th birthday with a private get-together before Harry heads to the U.K. for the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games.\n\nFrom the meaning of his name to how his parents keep him connected to his late grandmother Princess Diana, here's everything to know about Prince Archie of Sussex.\n\n\"We are pleased to announce that Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex welcomed their firstborn child in the early morning on May 6th, 2019,\" their team wrote. \"Their Royal Highnesses' son weighs 7lbs. 3oz.\"\n\nThe statement continued: \"The Duchess and baby are both healthy and well, and the couple thank members of the public for their shared excitement and support during this very special time in their lives.\"\n\nUnlike other royal family members, Prince Harry and Meghan did not take photos with newborn Archie outside the hospital. The pair later formally introduced Archie in a photo call and in a picture released on Instagram alongside his maternal grandmother, Doria Ragland, his great-grandmother the late Queen Elizabeth and his great-grandfather the late Prince Philip.\n\nHis name is very popular in the U.K.\n\nAfter Harry and Meghan announced the name of their son, Archie became one of the most popular baby names in the U.K. In 2020, Archie ranked in the top 10 most popular baby boy names for the first time.\n\nBut Archie was almost given a different moniker -- one that became his middle name instead. During a children's book reading at the 2022 Invictus Games, Meghan spoke to another parent whose son was named Harrison.\n\n\"[Meghan] was like, 'Harrison, that's Archie's middle name,' and [my wife] was like, 'Yeah, I know,' \" athlete and RAF nursing officer Sherry McBain recalled to PA. \"They were just having a chat because Harry and Meghan couldn't decide between Archie and Harrison for the first name.\"\n\nArchie's first name also helped inspire his parents to name their foundation Archewell. After launching the organization, the pair explained: \"Before SussexRoyal came the idea of 'arche' -- the Greek word meaning 'source of action.' We connected to this concept for the charitable organization we hoped to build one day, and it became the inspiration for our son's name. To do something of meaning, to do something that matters. Archewell is a name that combines an ancient word for strength and action, and another that evokes the deep resources we each must draw upon.\"\n\nArchie stays connected to his late grandmother Princess Diana\n\nThough Archie's paternal grandmother, Princess Diana, died over two decades before he was born, Prince Harry and Meghan have found ways to keep her legacy part of their children's lives.\n\nIn their 2022 Netflix docuseries Harry & Meghan, the couple pointed out a framed photo of Diana hanging in Archie's bedroom. As Meghan and Archie looked at the photo, Archie reached out to touch the portrait while Meghan asked, \"Who's that?\" before continuing, \"Hi, Grandma. That's Grandma Diana.\"\n\nPrince Harry had previously mentioned the photo in Archie's room in the series The Me You Can't See. \"I got a photo of her in his nursery, and it was one of the first words that he said -- apart from 'mama,' 'papa,' it was then 'grandma.' Grandma Diana,\" Harry said. \"It's the sweetest thing, but at the same time, it makes me really sad because she should be here.\"\n\nHe started using a royal title after his grandfather King Charles acceded to the throne\n\nSince Archie was a great-grandchild of the sitting monarch at the time of his birth, he did not receive a royal title. However, under the rules established by King George V in the 1917 Letters Patent, both Archie and his younger sister were eligible to receive prince and princess titles after their grandfather, King Charles, acceded to the throne.\n\nWhile there had been behind-the-scenes arguments regarding Archie and Lilibet's titles following the death of Queen Elizabeth, in March 2023, the palace updated the royal family's official website to reflect Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet's titles.\n\nA spokesperson for the palace explained that the timing was on purpose. \"The children's titles have been a birthright since their grandfather became monarch,\" the spokesperson said. \"This matter has been settled for some time in alignment with Buckingham Palace.\"\n\nIn February 2024, Archie and Lilibet's names were updated again after their parents adopted Sussex as their family surname. Archie's official name is now Prince Archie of Sussex.\n\nArchie turned 4 on King Charles' coronation day\n\nMay 6, 2023, was a big day for the royal family for two reasons: It was the day of King Charles' coronation and Archie's 4th birthday.\n\nPrince Harry managed to be in the U.K. for his father's coronation ceremony and quickly flew back to California to celebrate his son. As a source told PEOPLE ahead of the big day: \"It's going to be a low-key party at home. They'll have friends around them and Meghan's mom, Doria. Meghan will definitely have support that weekend.\"\n\nThe source added that Lilibet would join the festivities. \"They are so sweet together,\" they said. \"Archie loves Lili. He's such a sweet boy. When she's not around, he asks, 'Where's Lili?' \"\n\nHe has a lot of ideas about what he will be when he grows up\n\nHarry has described his older child as chatty, and at the 2022 Invictus Games opening ceremony, he shared that Archie was already thinking about what kind of job he would have as an adult.\n\n\"When I talk to my son Archie about what he wants to be when he grows up, some days it's an astronaut, other days it's a pilot -- a helicopter pilot obviously -- or Kwazii from Octonauts,\" he said. \"If you're laughing, then you've seen that.\"\n\nHarry added that he hopes his son and daughter are good people, whatever their professions might be. He said: \"But what I remind him is that no matter what you want to be when you grow up, it's your character that matters most, and nothing would make his mum and me prouder than to see him have the character of what we see before us today.\"\n\nHe is very energetic\n\nArchie is known for having a lot of energy, something that both of his parents have noted.\n\nWhile attending a private garden party alongside Ed Sheeran in July 2021, Harry shared that, at the time, Lilibet was calm while Archie zoomed around their home. \"We've been lucky so far,\" Harry said. \"She's very chilled and seems happy to just sit there while Archie is running around like crazy.\"\n\nIn October 2022, Harry gave an update on both of his kids while speaking to WellChild Awards recipients, saying, \"Archie is very, very busy. And Lili is learning to use her voice, which is great.\"", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephanie_kaloi@people.com", "name":

Nevertheless, it is believed that Charles will still send Archie a birthday present, even though they won't be together on this special occasion.\n\nAccording to royal expert Tom Quinn, the monarch will send his grandson a card and a small present to wish him a happy birthday. Tom told us: \"There has even been talk that he will send one of his own watercolour paintings to Archie as a present as Meghan loves homemade gifts and dislikes extravagant expensive presents.\"\n\nHe continued: \"But King Charles and his team are desperately worried that whatever the king sends to his grandson may be misinterpreted by Harry and Meghan. Charles famously gave Prince George a beautiful hand-made swing engraved on the seat with George's name, but Harry has told him repeatedly that this sort of present is too grand for Archie.\"\n\nTom also claimed the King could reach out to his youngest son\u2002to organise a video call for his grandson's birthday. The royal author added: \"King Charles dislikes new technology, but is desperate to keep in touch with his grandchildren on the other side of the Atlantic so he will certainly call Harry and wish Archie Happy Birthday.\n\n\"Charles been asking about video calling, but according to his aides, he's uncomfortable with the idea. If he makes an ordinary telephone call to Harry it means he can have a quick word with Archie without the need to talk to Meghan, a prospect that fills him with dread.\",", "source": {"uri": "thenews.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News International"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Archie_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Archie of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Quinn_(Spooks)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Quinn (Spooks)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Lilibet_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Princess Lilibet of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watercolor_painting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Watercolor painting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monarch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_George_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince George of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotelephony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Videotelephony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/History", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical_Personages", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical Personages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2024-05-06/l_1185953_035747_updates.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540664", "eventUri": "eng-9540664", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 328, "textEnd": 333}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

It's thought the New York-based snapper flew to their lavish property in March to take images.\n\nMeghan has previously shared a number of sweet snaps of her family and here, we've take a look back at some of the adorable images of her son Archie.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Which of Meghan Markle's former pals are still loyal after friend group drifted apart\n\nArchie's first image Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, pose with their newborn son Archie\n\nIn 2019, just days after his birth, Meghan and Harry showed off their son in snaps at St George's Hall in Windsor Castle. Taking to Instagram at the time, the Sussexes said in a statement: \"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are pleased to announce they have named their first born child: Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor.\n\n\"This afternoon Their Royal Highnesses introduced Her Majesty The Queen to her eighth great-grandchild at Windsor Castle. The Duke of Edinburgh and The Duchess' mother were also present for this special occasion.\"\n\nFirst royal tour for Archie Archie joined his parents on a royal tour\n\nWhen he was five months old, Archie went on his first royal tour. The October 2019 journey saw Archie, Meghan and Harry take part on a 10-day trip which covered South Africa, Angola, Malawi and Botswana.\n\nArchie only featured once on the trip when the trio met Nobel Peace Prize award-winner Desmond Tutu. During the royal tour, Meghan also shared the adorable nickname she called her son. She gushed: \"Say hello, hello, hi. Oh bubba.\"\n\nFirst birthday Meghan's mum Doria celebrated with the Sussexes\n\nWhen Archie celebrated his first birthday, the family held a scaled-back party with only close-knit family attending. This included Meghan's mum, Doria Ragland. It's thought the couple had initially planned a more lavish affair with a number of A-list friends, such as Serena Williams. However, a COVID-19 lockdown in California scuppered their plans. A royal source said at the time: \"It will be just the three of them. Meghan \u00adunderstandably refuses to take any risks with guests or travel.\"\n\nArchie with his nanny Lorren Khumalo was hired to help\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex hired Lorren Khumalo to help look after Archie while they juggled their hectic schedules. At the time, the Sussexes were still working members of the Royal Family and resided at Frogmore Cottage.\n\nPreviously speaking on an episode of The Breakfast Club with Zenzele Ndebele, Lorren said she decided to wear a dark outfit with \"nice kitten heels\" for her first time meeting the royals. She explained: \"I'll look presentable for a royal so I need to do my best. But I didn't use any make-up, I said if they take me, they take me as I am.\n\n\"I wasn't born with a silver spoon, I'm not blue blood, I will go as I am and trust me with my God, I'll get this job.\"\n\nHarry plays with Archie Prince Harry and Archie enjoyed a slip'n'slide\n\nIn their Netflix docuseries, Harry and Meghan gave viewers a glimpse into their home life. In one scene, Harry was spoted holding his son on his lap as they enjoyed a go on a slip'n'slide together.\n\nMeghan kisses Archie Meghan Markle shared a sweet moment with her son\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex was seen kissing Archie when he was a baby as the mother and son spent time together in the nursery at Frogmore Cottage. Harry was sure to capture the sweet moment on camera with Meghan looking beautiful wearing a white dress with a paisley blue pattern.\n\n* Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter,

Meghan wants Archie to associate his birthday with all things American because Archie is already constantly asking about his royal family in the UK.\n\n\"Archie loves the idea that his grandad lives in a castle and Meghan is worried that a magnificent shepherd's hut or similar extravagant present will only increase Archie's growing interest in his royal connections.\" The comments come as the author said Charles will make a sweet gesture to mark Archie's fifth birthday today.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nThe youngster has only met his grandfather on several occasions, with his parents Meghan and Harry being caught in a bitter feud with the Royal Family. However, it is believed Charles is \"desperate\" to change things. Mr Quinn claimed the monarch will reach out to his younger son, Harry, so he can wish Archie a happy birthday. Quinn also claimed the King has discussed the idea of video-calling his son and grandson.\n\nThe royal author said: \"King Charles dislikes new technology, but is desperate to keep in touch with his grandchildren on the other side of the Atlantic so he will certainly call Harry and wish Archie Happy Birthday. Charles been asking about video calling, but according to his aides, he's uncomfortable with the idea. If he makes an ordinary telephone call to Harry it means he can have a quick word with Archie without the need to talk to Meghan, a prospect that fills him with dread.\"\n\nArchie and his sister Princess Lilibet have spent very little time in the UK. While Archie was born in the UK, he moved to America with his parents when he was one. Archie and Lilibet have visited the UK just once - for Queen Elizabeth's Platinum Jubilee.\n\nThe Mirror has contacted Buckingham Palace for comment.\n\n*Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessica_gibb@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Jessica Gibb", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "chiara_fiorillo@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Chiara Fiorillo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_George_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prince George of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Archie_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prince Archie of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monarch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Castle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Lilibet_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princess Lilibet of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum_Jubilee_of_Elizabeth_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotelephony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Videotelephony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Birthday_to_You", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Happy Birthday to You"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telephone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32743491.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_prince1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540664", "eventUri": "eng-9540664", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-05-", "textStart": 1193, "textEnd": 1201}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's son is 5 years old as of May 6, 2024. While the Duke and Duchess of Sussex celebrate ahead of the Invictus Games anniversary and a trip to Nigeria, King Charles III is reportedly \"uncomfortable\" about calling his grandson to wish him a happy birthday. According to a royal commentator, the king's not keen on the idea of speaking to Archie in an \"ordinary\" phone call or making a video call to the Sussexes.\n\nIt seems King Charles is in something of a tricky situation as Archie, one of the 75-year-old monarch's five grandchildren, turns 5.\n\nHe is, per royal author Tom Quinn, not enthusiastic about video-calling Archie, who lives in Montecito, California, with Harry, Meghan, and Princess Lilibet, to wish him a happy birthday. Nor does he like the alternative of making an \"ordinary\" phone call.\n\n\"King Charles dislikes new technology,\" the Gilded Youth author told The Mirror. (Harry briefly touched on his father's aversion to modern technology in Spare, recalling how the king preferred letters to the phone during the now-39-year-old's tours of Afghanistan.)\n\nNevertheless, King Charles is \"desperate to keep in touch with his grandchildren on the other side of the Atlantic, so he will certainly call Harry and wish Archie [a] happy birthday.\"\n\n\"Charles [has] been asking about video calling, but according to his aides, he's uncomfortable with the idea,\" Quinn continued.\n\nThe alternative of a regular old phone call isn't entirely appealing either because King Charles is concerned about not speaking to his daughter-in-law.\n\n\"If he makes an ordinary telephone call to Harry,\" the author said, \"it means he can have a quick word with Archie without the need to talk to Meghan, a prospect that fills him with dread.\"\n\nMay 6 is not only special for Archie, but it's also meaningful for King Charles, who was crowned the same day in 2023. (Harry attended the London, England, coronation ceremony alone while Meghan stayed in California with Archie and Lilibet.)\n\n\"It's a bittersweet day for the king when he marks the anniversary of his coronation as it's also Archie's birthday,\" Phil Dampier, a royal author, told The Sun.\n\n\"I'm sure it breaks Charles's heart that his grandchildren Archie and Lilibet are growing up on the West Coast with American accents, and yet he hardly knows them,\" Dampier said. \"Harry and Meghan may arrange occasional Zoom calls, but it's not the same as seeing them in person.\"\n\nDampier went on to note how King Charles has been a \"doting granddad\" to Prince William and Kate Middleton's children, Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 9, and Prince Louis, 6. \"I'm sure he'd love to have the same relationship with his other two. It's a very difficult situation.\"\n\n\"Charles probably compensates for not seeing them by showering love on George, Charlotte, and Louis,\" he added. \"But obviously, it would be better for all concerned if the rifts were healed and some kind of normal family relations resumed.\"\n\nKing Charles has met Archie and Lilibet only a handful of times, with June 2022 marking their last in-person meeting.\n\nA birthday call to Archie -- in whatever form of communication -- from King Charles isn't likely to be a total surprise in the Sussex household. The reason is that Harry has reportedly stayed in touch with his father.\n\n\"Harry has kept in regular contact with his father on several occasions and made no secret of his desire to see him when he can,\" a source previously told The Mirror. \"He has been especially concerned about him and hopes the king will be well and able to see him as planned.\"\n\nAs for seeing the Prince and Princess of Wales, that's a different story. William's schedule while Harry marks 10 years of the Invictus Games will take him away from London.\n\n\"Their relationship remains extremely fractured,\" the insider said. \"Harry has privately expressed a wish to sit down with his brother, but now is not the time.\"\n\nHowever, King Charles wishes Archie a happy birthday; he'll encounter a similar situation on June 4, 2024, when Lilibet turns 3.", "source": {"uri": "cheatsheet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mandi_kerr@cheatsheet.com", "name": "Mandi Kerr", "type": "author", "isAgency":

He could also be enrolled in kindergarten in the autumn now that he is five.\n\nWhen Meghan was in labour at the private Portland Hospital, Harry revealed that he used the laughing gas meant for his wife to calm his nerves, and said the couple's bodyguards delivered them a takeaway Nando's.\n\nThe pair also listened to songs by German artist Deva Premal, who turned Sanskrit mantras into music, during the delivery.\n\nWhen the contractions quickened, Meghan hopped in a bathtub to deliver the baby and had an epidural to help with the pain of labour.\n\nHarry said he held Meghan's hand as she pushed to deliver Archie, and revealed she had a complicated birth, describing his son's head as being 'tangled'.\n\nArchie walks along the beach with his mother and their pet beagle, Guy\n\nArchie plays with a toy grand piano in an image that was revealed in Harry and Meghan's Netflix documentary\n\nArchie with his mother Meghan on his first birthday in 2020.

His first home was Frogmore Cottage near Windsor Castle.\n\nA clip from the Netflix series showed him gazing up to his father from a baby rocker, whilst a photo showed him gazing up at his nanny Lorren Khumalo, who had wrapped him in a yellow and brown cloth - traditional in Zimbabwe.\n\nAnother emotive clip of the young royal showed Archie reaching to touch a photo of his late grandmother Princess Diana on his nursery wall in Frogmore Cottage.\n\nMeghan was hear saying: 'Who's that? Hey grandma.'\n\nIn October 2019, Prince Harry and Meghan announced that they would be taking six weeks off royal duties for some 'family time' with their newborn.\n\nThey travelled to Canada, staying for a period on Vancouver Island.\n\nBy January the follow year, however, the pair said they would 'step back as senior members of the Royal Family' splitting their time between the UK and North America.\n\nBy March 2020, just before the pandemic sent many parts of the world into lockdowns, the couple and their young son had moved to Los Angeles.\n\nIn July that year, they moved into their Santa Barbara home, in Montecito, which reportedly cost them $14 million.\n\nThe home is close to their celebrity friend Oprah Winfrey, as well as other showbiz stars such as Ellen DeGeneres, Katy Perry and her husband Orlando Bloom.\n\nMeghan and Harry beam as they show their newborn son to the world in St George's Hall at Windsor Castle\n\nHarry and Meghan show baby Archie to his

between the Santa Ynez mountains and the Pacific Ocean.\n\nOn June 4, 2021, the family welcomed Archie's younger sister Lilibet, who will turn three in less than a month.\n\nIn an interview with The Cut magazine, Meghan told how Archie enjoyed pretending to be a doctor with a toy stethoscope and said one of his favourite things to eat is a quesadilla.\n\nOther footage from the Netflix series shows the young royal showing off his musical talent, tinkling away on a tiny piano.\n\nHe is also seen calling a sunset 'beautiful' and watching a hummingbird with his father.\n\n'We won't get a chance to be this close to hummingbirds ever again,' Prince Harry told his son.\n\nDespite asking his toddler to stay quiet and watch the wildlife, the toddler then exclaimed: 'I've got a dirty foot mama because I was with you!'\n\nWhen his great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth II died in September 2022, Archie and Lilibet remained in California and were cared for by their maternal grandmother, Doria Ragland, and their nannies.\n\nBaby Archie seen in the arms of his grandmother Doria Ragland as she sits alongside Meghan and Harry at Frogmore Cottage\n\nPrince Archie is not believed to have spent

Today is Prince Archie's fifth birthday! Somehow, the little nugget is already 5! And you may have missed the news because, well, the royal family has quite the track record when it comes to snubbing the Sussexes. Buckingham Palace has yet to release a statement wishing the young prince a happy birthday (and we won't hold our breath). Plus, his parents Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are quite private when it comes to Archie and his little sister Princess Lilibet. We doubt we'll see any birthday portraits like we saw for cousins Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis when they celebrated their birthdays in the last couple of weeks.\n\nNo, it has already panned out to be a much more private day, but insiders suspect Prince Archie will be getting a special gift from his grandfather, King Charles III. Royal expert Tom Quinn told The Mirror that King Charles will likely send a card and a small present to Archie's true home across the pond.\n\n\"There has even been talk that he will send one of his own watercolor paintings to Archie as a present as Meghan loves homemade gifts and dislikes extravagant expensive presents,\" Quinn said.\n\nAnything more than that could prove to be too much, and Quinn suspects the monarch and his team are \"desperately worried\" that any gift will be \"misinterpreted\" by Harry and Meghan. And while there's reason to believe Prince Archie will be getting a phone call from his grandpa, it likely won't be a FaceTime.\n\n\"If he makes an ordinary telephone call to Harry it means he can have a quick word with Archie without the need to talk to Meghan, a prospect that fills him with dread,\" Quinn said of the sovereign who supposedly dislikes technology enough as it is.\n\nSoon after his son's birthday, Prince Harry will likely head to the U.K. to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games -- the tournament for wounded veterans that he founded. It's unlikely his wife and children will join him for the momentous occasion since his latest legal loss puts their safety at risk.\n\nWith that in mind, some might say a sufficient security team would be an incredibly appreciated birthday gift so Prince Archie could visit his family (his doppelganger included!).

If he makes an ordinary telephone call to Harry it means he can have a quick word with Archie without the need to talk to Meghan, a prospect that fills him with dread,\" Quinn said.\n\nPeople reported that Harry and Meghan, 42, are celebrating Archie's 5th birthday \"privately\" at home before their upcoming travel plans.\n\nHarry is going to the UK for the 10th anniversary of his Invictus Games. Meghan will stay home with Archie and Princess Lilibet, 2, before linking up with her husband in Nigeria for an Invictus Games event.\n\nThe duke is not expected to see any of his family members during his time in the UK.\n\nLast year, Archie's birthday fell on the same weekend as the king's coronation, which forced Harry, 39, to shorten his trip to his native country so that he wouldn't miss the celebrations for his son in California.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex went to the coronation in May 2023 without Meghan, 42, and their two children.\n\nIt was reported that he spent less than 28 hours in the UK and didn't see or speak to his estranged family, including his brother William, outside of the ceremony.\n\nAt the ceremony, Harry was snubbed via his seating arrangement -- having been relegated to the third row in between Princess Eugenie's husband, Jack Brooksbank, and Queen Elizabeth II's cousin Princess Alexandra.\n\nThe coronation marked the first time that Harry saw his father since he released his bombshell memoir, \"Spare,\" in January. He didn't stay for any of the post-coronation festivities, instead opting to board a plane as soon as the ceremony was over while still wearing his suit and holding a clothes hanger.\n\nWhile their relationship is undoubtedly strained, Harry did fly to the UK in February after Charles revealed his cancer diagnosis. Their exchange only lasted a reported 45 minutes.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles III of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watercolor_painting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Watercolor painting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_George_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince George of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Lilibet_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princess Lilibet of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Brooksbank", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Brooksbank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Alexandra,_The_Honourable_Lady_Ogilvy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/81323873.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540664", "eventUri": "eng-9540664", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Prince Harry, 39, is heading to the U.K. this week for the celebrations surrounding the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games, and Meghan, 42, is set to reunite with her husband later in the week for a visit to Nigeria also spotlighting the sporting competition for veterans and service personnel.\n\nArchie's fifth birthday coincides with the first anniversary of his grandfather King Charles' coronation. Prince Harry attended his father's crowning ceremony last year, heading to the airport shortly after the event to fly back to California for his son's birthday festivities. Meghan missed the coronation, staying in the U.S., where they moved in 2020 after stepping back as working members of the royal family, with Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, now 2.\n\nA source told PEOPLE ahead of Archie's fourth birthday that a \"low-key\" party was planned at the family's home.\n\n\"They'll have friends around them and Meghan's mom, Doria [Ragland]. Meghan will definitely have support that weekend,\" the source said.\n\nLittle sister Lilibet was also set to be part of the festivities. \"They are so sweet together. Archie loves Lili. He's such a sweet boy. When she's not around, he asks, 'Where's Lili?' \" the source added.\n\nAfter being born in the U.K., Archie celebrated his first birthday in the U.S. in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. To celebrate the milestone, his parents shared a sweet video of their son reading the picture book Duck! Rabbit! on Meghan's lap. The clip was shared in partnership with Save the Children's #SaveWithStories campaign, launched to help kids adversely impacted by the pandemic.\n\n\"They are celebrating as a family focused on Archie and being together,\" a source told PEOPLE at the time. \"They'll have a smash cake and Zooms with family and friends. It's been beautiful weather, so perhaps a family stroll with the dogs.\"\n\nFans also got a glimpse of the festivities in the 2022 Netflix documentary Harry & Meghan, which showed Meghan's mother Doria Ragland in attendance and Archie wearing a yellow party hat.\n\nFor Archie's second birthday in 2021, Meghan and Harry shared a new photo of him holding balloons on the website of the Archewell Foundation. The couple asked for donations to COVID-19 vaccine equity for vulnerable families around the world.\n\n\"We cannot think of a more resonant way to honor our son's birthday,\" the Duke and Duchess of Sussex said in a message. \"If we all show up, with compassion for those we both know and don't know, we can have a profound impact. Even a small contribution can have a ripple effect. Together, we can uplift, protect and care for one another.\"\n\nWhile Prince Harry and Meghan didn't share any new updates for Archie's third birthday, he received well wishes on social media from the royal family.\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

That's classified. It's top secret!\"\n\n\"No, the kids are doing great,\" Harry added. \"The kids are growing up like all kids do, very, very fast.

Report denies claims", "body": "Amidst the complicated affair that is the royal family's distanced ties across the US and the UK, a new report has emerged, suggesting that King Charles wanted to give his grandson an extraordinary gift worth \u00a318,000. However, the Sussexes seemed to have allegedly rejected the plans. The convoluted story got further tangled up when a source close to the Sussex couple denied claims of Harry blocking his father's desire to give Archie a present.\n\nA report revealed by The Mirror stated that royal author Tom Quinn had intel on King Charles wanting to give Archie an exquisitely unique shepherd's hut-themed playhouse. The full-fledged establishment reportedly also had bunks and bookshelves. Quinn also divulged that the monarch had gifted Prince William's son, Prince George, a similar hut. With the same gift to Archie, he hoped to demonstrate that no favouritism was at play despite the royal family's estrangement from the California-settled younger royal couple.\n\nAlso read | Prince Harry's UK return: King Charles 'wants to see' him, but only if...\n\nWhat else did the royal expert claim about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle?\n\nAccording to The Mirror, Quinn paints a sour image of Meghan Markle, who he claims is encouragingly associating Archie's birthday \"with all things American.\" The author alleged that Archie, on the other hand, was \"constantly asking\" about his royal roots in the UK.\n\nPer Quinn's claims, Archie affectionately views the image of his grandfather residing in a castle. Apprehensive of their son's growing interest in the Royal Family, the author purported that the Sussex couple turned down the lavish gift. However, a source close to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle has now reportedly refuted these allegations.\n\nAlso read | #TomBradyRoast: Ben Affleck's fans clap back with 'facelift' jibes after his angry tirade about social media trolls\n\nContrarily, Quinn told The Mirror: \"Charles hates the idea that Harry might think he favours one grandchild over another, and he has already given Prince George a similar hut which reputedly cost a cool \u00a318,000.\" He pushed the buttons on the story against Harry and Meghan, claiming, \"(King Charles) would love to give Archie something similar but knows that Meghan and Harry are against it.\"\n\nAlthough Prince Archie was born in the UK, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex left the Royal Family and moved to California in June 2020. Ultimately, their daughter, Princess Lilibet, was born in the US in 2021. The young royal siblings, living in the US, have only visited the UK once since their parents switched continents.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "view_all@hindustantimes.com", "name": "View All", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussex", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sussex"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_George_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince George of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monarch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Archie_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince Archie of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Lilibet_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princess Lilibet of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Affleck", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Affleck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Gifts_and_Occasions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Gifts and Occasions", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance Abuse", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Gift_Baskets", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Gift Baskets", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/05/06/1600x900/topshot-britain-royals-archie_9a992cd6-a092-11e9-8ad9-cd072fe65304_1715010017815.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540664", "eventUri": "eng-9540664", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-06-", "textStart": 2392, "textEnd": 2401}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

I actually really, genuinely thought at the beginning of my relationship [with Meghan] that should this go the distance and we have kids that there's no way the ginger gene will stand up to my wife's genes, but I was wrong!\"\n\nAll three of Princess Diana's siblings -- Lady Jane Fellowes, Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Earl Charles, boast naturally vibrant red hair, a unique trait which was later passed on to Harry.\n\nAmidst Prince Archie's birthday celebrations, keep scrolling to discover the royal tot's sweetest photos highlighting his flaming red locks.\n\nHarry, Meghan and Archie visit Cape Town\n\nRoyal fans first caught a glimpse of Prince Archie's auburn hair back in September 2019 while the family-of-three were in South Africa completing a royal tour.\n\nDuring their visit, Prince Harry, Meghan and Archie met with Archbishop Desmond Tutu and his daughter Thandeka Tutu-Gxashe at the Desmond & Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation in Cape Town. And in photos shared from the visit, Archie could be seen rocking tiny tufts of vibrant red hair.\n\nTwinning with Harry\n\nThe royal tot made a string of appearances in the Duke and Duchess's Netflix docuseries titled Harry & Meghan. Royal fans were given a candid glimpse inside the pair's family life in Montecito, California, with Harry and Meghan taking viewers on a very intimate and personal journey.\n\nAmong the snippets and snapshots, the couple also included a heart-melting picture of Harry bonding with his mini-me son at home. The doting dad could be seen guiding Archie, who in turn flashed a broad grin akin to his father's cheeky grin.\n\nA musician in the making\n\nElsewhere in their eye-opening Netflix series, Harry and Meghan included a precious home video of Archie getting to grips with a miniature toy piano.\n\nIn the clip, which featured in episode six, Archie, now five, could be seen confidently playing a few notes whilst singing the nursery rhyme, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. Take a look in the video below...\n\nWhilst the youngster's musical talents left many impressed, Archie's flaming red locks arguably stole the show in all their curly glory.\n\nChristmas card photo\n\nPrince Archie's red hair also made a striking appearance back in 2021 when the youngster featured on his parents' annual Christmas card with his sister Princess Lilibet.\n\nThe photocard read: \"Happy Holidays. This year, 2021, we welcomed our daughter, Lilibet, to the world. Archie made us a 'Mama' and a 'Papa', and Lili made us a family.\"\n\nIn the picture, taken by photographer Alexi Lubomirski, Archie looked so sweet as he clambered atop his father with a cheeky expression etched across his face.\n\nWhilst the father-son duo had plenty in common thanks to their bright copper locks, Archie and Harry also coordinated in matching blue jeans and smart linen shirts.\n\nBonding with Meghan and Lilibet\n\nElsewhere in Harry & Meghan, royal fans were able to catch a peek of Archie's auburn hair in a gorgeous family photo taken in their sprawling Montecito garden.\n\nDoting mum Meghan could be seen in the snap expertly balancing both children on her hips.\n\nWhile Archie's face was hidden from view, his tousled red hair could be seen glimmering in the

The Royal Family seems to have snubbed Archie publicly as - at the time of writing - they didn't post a happy birthday message to the tot on any social media account, something they do for royal family members.\n\nRoyal author Tom Quinn, who wrote various books on The Firm, told The Mirror: \"Archie is definitely missing out on some rather sweet Royal birthday traditions - because the family is never short of money they don't buy each other expensive gifts.\"\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go toThe Mirror US .\n\nREAD MORE: 'Drama' in California after Harry and Meghan receive free bike for Archie's birthday\n\nArchie turned five today\n\nAbout the family not buying expensive gifts, Tom said: \"That would just be too easy and pointless as every member of the family has enough money to buy any and everything they want.\"\n\n\"Instead, whenever it is someone's birthday, there is a royal race to find the funniest, silliest present - Kate probably holds the record for the most amusing present,\" the author revealed.\n\nOne of her most amusing gifts went to her future brother-in-law, Prince Harry. Tom said: \"A few years before he met Meghan, Kate bought Harry a 'how to grow your own girlfriend' kit!\"\n\nKate gave Harry a 'grow a girlfriend' kit\n\n\"The fun of buying cheap, amusing presents for each other has always shown the lighter side of the Royal Family and it's sad Archie won't get to experience this,\" he added.\n\nArchie was born on May 6, 2019 - two years before his parents welcomed his younger sister, Princess Lilibet, two. Unlike previous royal births, Buckingham Palace announced the birth with a framed notice on an easel instead of an immediate photocall at the hospital steps.\n\nThough Harry and Meghan stepped back from their roles as working royals in 2020, the palace wished them happy birthdays until 2022 when it was reported that the family wouldn't do this anymore for non-working royals. When Archie was born at Portland Hospital in London, Harry said that his son's birth was \"the most amazing experience I could ever have possibly imagined.\"\n\n* Follow Mirror Celebs on Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessica_gibb@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Jessica Gibb", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "tatiana_krisztina@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Tatiana Krisztina", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Archie_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Archie of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Lilibet_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princess Lilibet of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Hospital", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portland Hospital"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32746672.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_princeharryexcl.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540664", "eventUri": "eng-9540664", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-05-06", "textStart": 1694, "textEnd": 1705}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

We have been waiting since she discovered she's a daughter of the soil.'\n\nMeghan's Nigerian heritage was referenced by Harry at the opening ceremony of the Dusseldorf Invictus Games last September, after Nigeria joined Colombia and Israel in sending their first-ever delegation to the event.\n\n'We're really excited to have new nations join us. Let's hear it for Colombia, Israel and Nigeria,' Harry told the crowd at the Merkur Spiel-Arena.\n\n'Now, I'm not saying we play favourites in our home, but since my wife discovered she is of Nigerian

But according to a report in The Telegraph, the new parents didn't want their son to be known by a title that contained the word 'dumb'.\n\nThe report says: \"They didn't like the idea of Archie being called the Earl of Dumbarton because it began with the word 'dumb' [and] they were worried about how that might look.\" A second source added that it wasn't just Meghan's concern, but that it \"also bothered Harry.\"\n\nPrince Archie was born at the Portland Hospital in London on 6 May, 2019 and made his first public appearance in his parents' arms in front of a select number of photographers in St George's Hall, Windsor Castle.\n\nThe young royal was originally styled as Master Archie Harrison Mountbatten Windsor - but this all changed when Harry and Meghan announced that Archie would be known as Prince Archie going forward as they were keen not to deny him and younger sister, Princess Lilibet, of their \"birth right\".\n\nBoth children are entitled to use princely titles as they are the grandchildren of The King, owing to the rules set out in the 1917 Letters Patent by King George V.\n\nWhile he has spent very little time in the UK, Prince Archie did get any early taste of what royal duty would feel like as he joined his parents on a tour of South Africa when he was less than a year old and was pictured meeting Archbishop Desmond Tutu.\n\nHe spent his first Christmas with his parents in Canada and remained there while his parents returned to the UK and just days later announced they were stepping back from their senior royal roles.\n\nThe family soon made a home in Montecito, California, and expanded again following the birth of Princess Lilibet Diana on 4 June, 2021.", "source": {"uri": "ok.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ok"}, "authors": [{"uri":

And we have a very good one called Cold Spring School, which has got great ratings and that's in their catchment area,\" he said on HELLO!'s A Right Royal Podcast.\n\nHappy family\n\nFew official photos of Archie have been released, but the Sussexes shared a glimpse into family life in their 2022 Netflix docuseries Harry & Meghan. From helping bake courgette muffins to tending to the chickens and walking their three dogs, he is living an idyllic childhood.\n\n\"To have outdoor space where I can go for walks with Archie and we go for walks as a family and with the dogs - you know, we go on hikes or go down to the beach, which is so close,\" Harry told US chat-show host Oprah Winfrey in 2021.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess are also making sure that Archie understands that there are those less fortunate than him. A 2022 profile on Meghan in The Cut explained: \"They are teaching Archie that some people live in big houses, some in small, and that some are in between homes. They made kits to pass out with water and peanut-butter crackers and granola bars. 'I ate one!' Archie contributes.\"\n\nEarly childhood\n\nArchie spent the first six months of his life at the Sussexes' former home Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor estate, before experiencing his first snow in Canada during Harry and Meghan's six-week break on Vancouver Island.\n\nAt five months old, he charmed on the royal tour of South Africa - his only outing with his parents on an official engagement - and showed an early love for books, giggling as Meghan read Duck! Rabbit! on his first birthday in 2020.\n\nHe \"loves being a big brother\", his mum has said, and was seen helping Lilibet to blow out her candles on her first birthday, which the family celebrated in the UK during Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee celebrations in June 2022.\n\nArchie and Lilibet are Harry and Meghan's priority - after attending the King's coronation, which coincided with his son's fourth birthday, the Duke quickly flew back to the US.\n\nThis year, Archie's big day comes ahead of Harry's return to London this week to mark the tenth anniversary of the Invictus Games, before Meghan - who has partly Nigerian heritage - joins her husband in Nigeria later this month on Invictus business, after they were invited by the Nigerian government.", "source": {"uri": "hellomagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HELLO!"}, "authors": [{"uri": "danielle_stacey@hellomagazine.com", "name": "Danielle Stacey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montecito,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Montecito, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montecito, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preschool", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Preschool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Archie_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Archie of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Lilibet_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Princess Lilibet of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor_Castle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Windsor Castle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Primary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindergarten", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kindergarten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santa Barbara, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Barbara, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_&_Meghan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry & Meghan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_documentary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Television documentary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello!_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hello!

The royal expert said Blind Man's Bluff could be one of the games for the party, which is likely to be attended by his friends from school, his grandmother Doria Ragland, and some celebrities who live in the Montecito area.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to The Mirror, Mr Quinn said Meghan enjoys organising birthdays for her children but she wants them to be \"very private affairs\" so that Archie and Lilibet can experience \"the more ordinary things in life\". The author said: \"When it comes to her children's birthdays, Meghan is almost obsessed with the idea that they should be quiet, very private affairs, with simple games, a birthday cake and ice cream.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Royal fans think Harry and Meghan's son Archie looks like another royal baby\n\nMeghan reading from the book Duck! Rabbit! to Archie on his first birthday The Sussexes with their two children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet\n\n\"Archie is a real live-wire who loves rushing around at top speed so there will also be blind man's bluff and tag among other games. Meghan combines a deep sense of her own global importance in the wider world with a desire to make her children experience what she sees as the more ordinary things in life.\n\n\"So, for Archie's birthday, there will be friends from school, Meghan's mother Doria Ragland and one or two celebrities - any celebrity neighbour with a child the same age, and that includes actors Katie Perry and Orlando Bloom and their daughter Daisy - will definitely be invited.\" Last year, Meghan planned a \"low-key\" birthday party for Archie at home which he enjoyed with his family as his sister, Lilibet, who turned two in June, also joined in the fun.\n\nThe celebrations were small and intimate, with only Archie's grandmother, Doria Ragland, and Meghan's close friend, Victoria Jackson, in attendance. In a special touch, Meghan baked a lemon cake for Archie using fruit from their garden, a source said. The couple's \u00a311million home in Montecito was decorated for the occasion, with balloons and streamers adding to the festive atmosphere.\n\nHarry will probably be surrounded by his closest friends and family\n\nThis year, it is possible that Meghan will bake a birthday cake for her son again, according to royal commentator Ingrid Seward. She also suggested there will be \"a complete ban on all plastics and a request for no plastic presents.\" Talking to The Sun, Ms Seward added: \"These parties cost a fortune. Even parents with ordinary incomes spend a lot. It can cost \u00a330 a head in the UK just for the entertainers!\"\n\nSpeaking about the gifts Archie could receive, Ms Seward claimed: \"As I said no plastic...Fancy wooden toys, books. Maybe a five-year-old size jeep or tractor but could not be plastic - have to be made of metal or wood. Very expensive as it would have to be custom-made.\n\n\"I am sure some of the LA parents will try and outdo each other on presents. But not the royals. They are pretty parsimonious as far as presents go. It's hard to find nonplastic presents for small children so it is anyone's guess.\n\n\"The Harrods toy department hardly exists anymore so it will be something from Hamleys for King Charles to give him I would imagine. Queen Camilla will have chosen it. Also the godparents will be giving presents and sending from the UK.\"\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri":

When Archie turned four, some drama erupted in Montecito, where the Sussexes live, after a shop gave the couple a free bike for their son as a birthday gift.\n\nThe owner of the bike shop Mad Dogs & Englishmen hand-delivered the gift to the Sussexes and then shared a thank-you note Harry and Meghan sent on Instagram. Harry and Meghan thanked the shop owners saying the bike \"brought much joy\" and was \"most appreciated\" by the family.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Inside Prince Archie's birthday party from cake to games and celebrity guests\n\nThe bike was hand-delivered by the shop's owner\n\nThe note, sent on behalf of Harry and Meghan, was described as a \"lovely and very kind gesture\" - but some people criticised both the store and the Sussexes. It read: \"Dear Martin and Jennifer, on behalf of Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, please accept their sincere thanks for the thoughtful gift you sent to Prince Archie for his fourth birthday. The bike has brought much joy, and is most appreciated by the family. They asked that I convey their gratitude at the lovely surprise.\"\n\nMany people commented on the post with one writing: \"Enjoy your gift little Prince.\" One more praised the shop for Archie's gift, saying: \"Very kind and thoughtful gift.\" Someone else commented: \"Cute!!!\"\n\nThe shop shared a thank-you note they received\n\nBut some people criticised the store, saying it could have donated a bike to disadvantages children, and others blasted the Sussexes for sending a note through their secretary rather than writing it themselves. A person wrote: \"How lovely. Just a shame they didn't sign the letter themselves.\" Another added: \"Couldn't even write it themselves hmm? Wow! While it's thoughtful to commission the note at all, this man went through a lot of trouble to \"hand deliver \" probably a free bike to them ...!\"\n\nDespite widespread criticism, many people defended the bike shop with one saying said the \"bullying\" it was receiving was \"absolutely insane and unfair\", adding: \"The owner gives to whoever he wants to and nobody has the right to tell him what to do.\"\n\nOne more wrote: \"Please ignore the haters. You all did a sweet gesture and sane, kind people all over the work appreciate you. Those hating on you and the Sussexes are living miserable unfulfilled lives and need to be pitied.\"\n\nThis year, Archie is likely to enjoy a quiet, private party at home with some simple games, a cake, and ice cream. Royal expert Tom Quinn said Blind Man's Bluff could be one of the games for the party, which is likely to be attended by his friends from school, his grandmother Doria Ragland, and some celebrities who live in the Montecito area.\n\nHarry and Meghan with Archie and Lilibet Archie was born on May 6, 2019\n\nSpeaking exclusively to The Mirror, Mr Quinn said Meghan enjoys organising birthdays for her children but she wants them to be \"very private affairs\" so that Archie and Lilibet can experience \"the more ordinary things in life\". The author said: \"When it comes to her children's birthdays, Meghan is almost obsessed with the idea that they should be quiet, very private affairs, with simple games, a birthday cake and ice cream.\n\n\"Archie is a real live-wire who loves rushing around at top speed so there will also be blind man's bluff and tag among other games. Meghan combines a deep sense of her own global importance in the wider world with a desire to make her children experience what she sees as the more ordinary things in life.\"\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chiara_fiorillo@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Chiara Fiorillo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Archie_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Archie of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fruit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lemon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montecito,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Montecito, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montecito, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Lilibet_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princess Lilibet of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doria_Ragland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doria Ragland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_cake", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Birthday cake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_cream", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ice cream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32745134.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_bikesplit.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540664", "eventUri": "eng-9540664", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-05-06", "textStart": 3160, "textEnd": 3171}], "sentiment": 0.5450980392156863, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Eventually, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex chose to name him Archie Harrison, along with the Royal Family's official surname Mountbatten-Windsor. But years later, Meghan admitted the two parents were torn between a few options.\n\nSpeaking to Invictus Games competitor Sherry McBain, 42, during the competition in The Hague in April 2022, she said she still loves the name Harrison. Sherry, who lives in Southampton, said: \"She was like 'Harrison, that's Archie's middle name', and Mandy was like 'Yeah, I know'. They were just having a chat because Harry and Meghan couldn't decide between Archie and Harrison for the first name.\"\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Inside Prince Archie's stateside life as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's son turns 5\n\nMeghan reading from the book Duck! Rabbit! to Archie on his first birthday Harry and Meghan with their two children\n\nMeghan chatted to Sherry, a nursing officer in the RAF, during a children's book reading event organised as part of the Invictus Games. Sherry said: \"My little boy Harrison was just over the moon that a princess has read him a story, so that went down really well with all the UK children.\"\n\nShe said Meghan was \"really open\" and \"very friendly\" at the event. She explained: \"Harrison was drawing pictures and telling her that it was a picture of a tram. I don't think it quite looked like a tram, so she was very gracious and said that's a brilliant tram, so he was delighted.\"\n\nSherry, who has been taking part in sitting volleyball and archery for Team UK, said of the Invictus Games: \"It's made a massive difference for me. It's the difference in the fact that I'm still serving. I was diagnosed with delayed complex PTSD. This journey has just meant that actually I can still live a life instead of hiding, and not stepping out of the house and just being broken.\n\n\"I owe so much to the Invictus Games and everything that it has done for me and for my family.\" Archie means \"genuine\", \"bold\" and \"brave\" and is German in origin. Short for Archibald, it is now given as a name in its own right. Harrison means \"son of Harry\", so its inclusion in Archie's full name is likely to have been a tribute to the duke.\n\nArchie entered the top 10 names for boys in England and Wales for the first time in 2020, according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Archie saw a surge in popularity, jumping 10 places from 19th to ninth. There were 2,944 babies named Archie in 2020, up from 2,544 in 2019.\n\nHarry and Meghan named their daughter - born on June 4, 2021 - Lilibet \"Lili\" Diana. Lilibet is the late Queen's family nickname and the couple refer to their daughter as Lili.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri":

But what about his family over in England? They have not forgotten his big day, or at the very least, his grandfather King Charles has not forgotten. And now that Archie is a big boy, his grandfather got him a bit of a big boy birthday present. A present with a very personal touch, no less.\n\nKing Charles, who also celebrated the one year anniversary of his coronation on Monday, reportedly sent his grandson Prince Archie a gift with his parents' wishes in mind. \"There has even been talk that he will send one of his own watercolour paintings to Archie as a present as Meghan loves homemade gifts and dislikes extravagant expensive presents,\" royal expert Tom Quinn told The Mirror.\n\nThis certainly does appear to be in keeping with the royal family's gift-giving tradition. Despite being unbelievably wealthy, they have always kept their gifts low-key and personal. Like when Queen Elizabeth bought Archie a waffle iron for Christmas as a toddler and Meghan Markle gifted Prince William a \"cereal killer\" spoon because of his love of cereal. Archie's gift of a watercolor from his grandfather might not be something he can play with (or really even be into at 5 years old), but he will have it for years to come. It might even be a collectible item someday since it was painted by a king. Hopefully Archie did get a toy or two though because come on, he is only 5.\n\nMeghan Markle and Prince Harry have not shared anything publicly about their plans for their son's birthday, but it seems likely that they celebrated at their home in Montecito, California with friends and family like the Duchess of Sussex's mom Doria Ragland and his 2-year-old little sister Lilibet. Much as they did last year, with a source close to the former royals telling People at the time that they were planning a \"low-key\" celebration for his fourth birthday. The little boy got a new bicycle for his birthday last year, so he won't be needing one of those. Perhaps he got something to do with photography, as he was asking his mom for a high-end camera like the one he had seen family friend Misan Harriman using for Christmas. That camera, a Leica, sells for around $8,000. So definitely not in keeping with the low-key gifts the royals tend to favor.", "source": {"uri": "romper.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Romper"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Archie_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Archie of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watercolor_painting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Watercolor painting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cereal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waffle_iron", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Waffle iron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_The_Queen_Mother", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Lilibet_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princess Lilibet of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misan_Harriman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misan Harriman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doria_Ragland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doria Ragland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Photography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montecito,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Montecito, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montecito, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2024/5/6/84b73e74-502b-4262-b024-84b1ccf35d79-screen-shot-2024-05-06-at-124445-pm.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540664", "eventUri": "eng-9540664", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 56, "textEnd": 61}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

The young prince was born at 05:26 on May 6, 2019, at the Portland Hospital in London. And his fifth birthday has now been brutally snubbed by the Royal Family and their official social media accounts.\n\nDespite the young prince turning five today, the Royal Family has publicly snubbed him by not wishing him a happy birthday in view of their social media followers as of yet, as they often do with other members of the family.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: The sneaky way that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are keeping one foot in the United Kingdom\n\nMeghan Markle and Prince Harry welcomed Archie in 2019\n\nThe Royal Family used to send birthday wishes to the Sussexes, even after they stepped down as senior working royals, with the late Queen wishing Meghan a happy birthday in the same year that she and Harry moved to America. Sharing a post on the Royal Family's Instagram account, she said: \"Wishing The Duchess of Sussex a very happy birthday.\"\n\nIn 2022 there was a suggestion, according to an expert, that the royal website, Twitter and Instagram pages would no longer send birthday greetings out to any non-working members of the Royal Family unless their birthday ends in a zero.\n\nThen, in August 2023, it was reported that royal aides said they only marked the birthdays of working members of the Royal Family on their official social media accounts. Which came amid Meghan's 42nd birthday and how she was seemingly \"snubbed\".\n\nArchie is the first-born child, and only son, of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Unlike previous royal births, there was no immediate photocall at the hospital steps, with his birth announced by Buckingham Palace via a framed notice on an easel outside of the iconic palace.\n\nThe young prince became a big brother when he was only two years of age, with his younger sister Lilibet being born at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara, California, on June 4, 2021, at 11:40. The two children have been raised in California, with them not in contact with their wider family in the UK.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mollie_quirk@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Mollie Quirk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Archie_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Archie of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Lilibet_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Princess Lilibet of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Hospital", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portland Hospital"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountbatten-Windsor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mountbatten-Windsor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Santa Barbara, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Barbara, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical_Personages", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical Personages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32712032.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Harry-Meghan.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540664", "eventUri": "eng-9540664", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-05-06", "textStart": 406, "textEnd": 417}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Similarly, the palace doesn't typically share messages on the likes of Princess Beatrice, Princess Eugenie and Zara Tindall's birthdays nor their children's special days.\"\n\nWhile it has not been formally announced how Archie will spend the day, if it is anything like his previous birthdays, it will be a rather pared-back affair.\n\nLast year, the young Prince was thought to have celebrated his fourth birthday at home. Archie's first birthday was captured in Netflix's Harry & Meghan. The prince was seen in his highchair which was covered in confetti wearing an adorable hat with a gorgeous fruit-topped cake.\n\nMeghan and Harry's son has celebrated all his birthdays in the United States, despite being born in London.\n\nArchie spent the first six months of his life at the Sussexes' former home Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor estate, before experiencing his first snow in Canada during Harry and Meghan's six-week break on Vancouver Island.\n\nAt five months old, he charmed on the royal tour of South Africa - his only outing with his parents on an official engagement - and showed an early love for books, giggling as Meghan read Duck! Rabbit! on his first birthday in 2020.\n\nHe \"loves being a big brother\", his mother has said, and was seen helping Lilibet to blow out her candles on her first birthday, which the family celebrated in the UK during Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee celebrations in June 2022.\n\nArchie and Lilibet are Harry and Meghan's priority - after attending the King's coronation, which coincided with his son's fourth birthday, the duke quickly flew back to the US.\n\nHis fifth birthday is likely to be more understated than his cousins Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte who celebrated her ninth birthday earlier this week, and Prince Louis of Wales, six.\n\nPrincess Kate and Prince William's children's birthdays are usually celebrated with a new photograph of the birthday girl or boy taken by their mother posted to their social media.\n\nThe Wales children's birthday celebrations have ranged from an afternoon tea at Kensington Palace through to parties at Anmer Hall in Norfolk. They also receive new toys for their birthdays like their cousin Prince Archie.", "source": {"uri": "hellomagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HELLO!"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jenni_mcknight@hellomagazine.com", "name": "Jenni McKnight", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Archie_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Archie of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Princess_Royal", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anne, Princess Royal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Lilibet_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Princess Lilibet of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doria_Ragland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doria Ragland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello!_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hello!

The bike has brought much joy, and is most appreciated by the family. They asked that I convey their gratitude at the lovely surprise.\"\n\nMany social media users chimed in on the post, with one person commenting: \"Enjoy your gift little Prince.\"\n\nScotland's Home of the Year - inside latest round of stunning properties as judges head west\n\nView gallery\n\nAnother lauded the shop's gesture for Archie, saying: \"Very kind and thoughtful gift.\"\n\nA different user added: \"Cute! ! ! \".\n\nHowever, some criticised the store's decision, suggesting that a bike could have been donated to disadvantaged children instead, and others took aim at the Sussexes for not personally signing the accompanying note.\n\nOne individual remarked: \"How lovely. Just a shame they didn't sign the letter themselves.\"\n\nAnother stated: \"Couldn't even write it themselves hmm? Wow! While it's thoughtful to commission the note at all, this man went through a lot of trouble to 'hand deliver' probably a free bike to them...! \".\n\nDespite the backlash, numerous people came to the defence of the bike shop, with one commenter describing the \"bullying\" it faced as \"absolutely insane and unfair\" and continued: \"The owner gives to whoever he wants to and nobody has the right to tell him what to do.\"\n\nAnother supporter urged: \"Please ignore the haters. You all did a sweet gesture and sane, kind people all over the work appreciate you. Those hating on you and the Sussexes are living miserable unfulfilled lives and need to be pitied.\"\n\nThis year, Archie is set to have a low-key celebration at home with classic party games, a birthday cake, and ice cream.\n\nRoyal commentator Tom Quinn shared with The Mirror that Blind Man's Bluff might be on the agenda for the bash, expected to include school pals, his grandmother Doria Ragland, and some Montecito celebrities.\n\nQuinn told The Mirror that Meghan takes pleasure in planning her children's birthdays but insists on keeping them \"very private affairs\" to allow Archie and Lilibet to enjoy \"the more ordinary things in life\".\n\nHe remarked: \"When it comes to her children's birthdays, Meghan is almost obsessed with the idea that they should be quiet, very private affairs, with simple games, a birthday cake and ice cream.\"\n\n\"Archie, who is quite the bundle of energy and loves to move quickly, will likely enjoy blind man's bluff and tag among other activities. Meghan manages to balance a strong awareness of her significant role globally with a wish for her kids to have what she considers normal life experiences.\"\n\nGet the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.

Harry was very nervous ahead of the birth and decided to try something out to calm himself down - using the laughing gas that was meant for his wife.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex recalled the moment in his memoir, Spare. Setting the scene, he explained how Meghan was bouncing on a giant ball inside Portland Hospital in London when he took \"several slow, penetrating hits.\"\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: King Charles set to 'reach out to Prince Archie' on his fifth birthday with sweet gesture\n\nPrince Harry was a nervous wreck when his son was born\n\nWriting in Spare, Harry said: \"Meg, bouncing on a giant purple ball, a proven way of giving Nature a push, laughed and rolled her eyes. I took several more hits and now I was bouncing too.\"\n\nWhen Meghan's labour began, however, Harry was forced to apologise for accidentally using the entire canister of laughing gas. He wrote: \"When her contractions began to quicken, and deepen, a nurse came and tried to give some laughing gas to Meg.\n\n\"There was none left. The nurse looked at the tank, looked at me, and I could see the thought slowly dawning: Gracious, the husband's had it all. Sorry, I said meekly.\"\n\nPrince Archie is the couple's first-born child He'll be turning five on May 6\n\nLuckily, the situation was quickly resolved by a much-needed replacement canister. Meghan saw the funny side and laughed at the situation, with Harry adding: \"The nurse had to laugh, and quickly changed the canister.\"\n\nArchie will be turning five on Monday, with it believed King Charles will reach out to wish his grandson a happy birthday. Royal expert Tom Quinn claims the monarch has even discussed the idea of video-calling his son and grandson.\n\nSpeaking to The Mirror, the royal author said: \"King Charles dislikes new technology, but is desperate to keep in touch with his grandchildren on the other side of the Atlantic so he will certainly call Harry and wish Archie Happy Birthday.\n\n\"Charles been asking about video calling, but according to his aides, he's uncomfortable with the idea. If he makes an ordinary telephone call to Harry it means he can have a quick word with Archie without the need to talk to Meghan, a prospect that fills him with dread.\"\n\n* Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scarlett_o_toole@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Scarlett O'Toole", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Archie_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Archie of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nitrous oxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Hospital", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portland Hospital"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nature (journal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotelephony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Videotelephony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monarch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telephone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32741902.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_HARRY-MAIN.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540664", "eventUri": "eng-9540664", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-05-06", "textStart": 259, "textEnd": 270}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1572, "textEnd": 1577}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

As he celebrates his fifth birthday on Monday, 6 May, just how might the young royal mark his special day?\n\n\"I wish we knew more about little Archie\", former BBC royal correspondent Jennie Bond tells OK!. \"Having seen Harry pine so much for his own family and now to know he has his two little children (rather perfectly a boy and a girl) it would be lovely to see them together. I bet Harry is an absolutely fantastic dad.\"\n\nJennie continues: \"I can imagine him romping around the garden with his kids and giving them the best life he possibly can. He was such a fun and mischievous little boy himself, it's more than likely that Archie has inherited his charmingly naughty personality.\n\n\"Of course it's his absolute right, and I think probably his obsession, to keep the children out of the media, but I think most people would just be happy for him if they could see the joy I'm sure he gets out of family life.\"\n\nAs for how the day will be spent, Jennie reflects on her own position as a grandmother to young children. She says: \"Archie's birthday falls on a Monday this year, so it could well be that he'll be spending it at school. We don't know if he has started full-time education yet.\n\n\"If my experience of being a grandmother to two children of a similar age is anything to go by, the day will begin with the kids squabbling over anything and everything.\"\n\nImagining what gifts might be in store, the expert adds: \"Archie is probably obsessed with pirates and dinosaurs. He would have loved his grandpa's tie when the king visited a cancer centre: he was wearing his special T-Rex tie decorated with tiny T-Rex dinosaurs. So I expect his birthday presents will be something to do with whatever his latest fad is. A battery operated car or truck maybe? A junior surf board?\n\n\"A party in the Californian sunshine is a great deal easier to organise than a party in our changeable British weather.\n\n\"So I expect they will have some kind of celebration in the garden of their mansion. Or maybe on the beach with some of his friends. I imagine that granny Doria will be on hand to help and join in.\n\n\"In any normal world, you could expect a video call to the folks back home. I wish we knew more about little Archie, but children can provide neutral ground for aggrieved parties to forget their differences and get on with life.\n\n\"So I very much hope, and would expect, that Harry will make contact with his father, and allow Archie to chat away with the grandpa he hardly knows.\"\n\nThe King previously revealed that he had had a \"very emotional\" meeting with Archie and Lilibet when they were last in the UK for Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee in June 2022.\n\nAs source said at the time: \"The prince, of course, hasn't seen his grandson Archie for a bit of time and so it was very, very, very special to have some time with him.

Archie is today marking his fifth year with his family, including his two year old sister, Lilibet.\n\nHe was born on May 6, 2019, at 05:26 in London's Portland Hospital. Remarkably, despite the milestone event, the young prince has been publicly overlooked by the royals on their official social media accounts today.\n\nNotably, the Royal Family often extends birthday wishes to other family members, even when they are no longer senior working royals. The Queen, prior to her passing, extended a warm birthday greeting to the Duchess of Sussex in the very year that Meghan and Harry relocated to America, reports the Mirror.\n\nHer birthday message was shared via the Royal Family's Instagram account, stating: \"Wishing The Duchess of Sussex a very happy birthday.\"\n\nAs per an expert, speaking in 2022, there is reports that the royal website, along with their Twitter and Instagram pages, will not send birthday greetings to non-working Royal Family members unless it is a significant milestone birthday, like reaching a decade.\n\nIn August 2023, it surfaced that royal aides only celebrated the birthdays of working royals on their official social media profiles. This came to light during Meghan's 42nd birthday, appearing as though she had been \"snubbed\".\n\nArchie is the eldest child and only son of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Unlike traditional royal birth traditions, Archie's arrival was not unveiled with a photoshoot outside the hospital; rather Buckingham Palace announced his birth via a framed notice displayed on an easel outside the palace.\n\nArchie became an older brother at the tender age of two, when his little sister Lilibet entered the world in Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital, California, on June 4, 2021, at 11:40 am. Both children have been raised in California with less contact than usual to their wider family residing in the UK.\n\nGet the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.

They'll have friends around them and Meghan's mom, Doria [Ragland]. Meghan will definitely have support that weekend.\" Prince Archie's little sister, Princess Lilibet, will also be around to celebrate with her big brother.\n\nArchie's first birthday was captured in Netflix's Harry & Meghan.

During the 2019 episode of Mary Berry's A Berry Royal Christmas, Kate revealed she \"stays up until midnight\" to make her children's birthday cakes.\n\nArchie's parents have also been known to enjoy a casual birthday away from the spotlight.

I can never possibly imagine how any woman does.. what they do is beyond comprehension.\" \"But we're both absolutely thrilled and so grateful for all the love and support from everyone out there,\" Prince Harry adds.\n\n\"I'm so incredibly proud of my wife. As every father and parent would ever say, your baby is absolutely amazing. But this little thing is absolutely to die for. So I'm just over the moon,\" the Duke of Sussex concludes. Fans are in awe of the announcement video as it resurfaces online on Prince Archie's fifth birthday.\n\nOne fan wrote on X, formerly Twitter, \"Little Prince Archie turning 5 today and it feels like just yesterday Prince Harry was so excited while announcing the news that he ended up thanking the horses behind him in Windsor.\" Another said, \"Can't believe it's been 5 years since this precious boy was born!

Despite this celebration, no other members of the Royal Family, or Meghan Markle, will be present to mark the occasion.\n\nThe Mirror reports that while the Duke of Sussex will manage to fit in a meeting with his father on his return to London, he is not expected to see his brother, the Prince of Wales, despite wishing to, as \"now is not the time.\"\n\nA source told the publication: \"Their relationship remains extremely fractured. Harry has privately expressed a wish to sit down with his brother but now is not the time.\"\n\nHarry last saw The King for less than 30 minutes at Clarence House back in February when the monarch's cancer announcement was made public.\n\nA source told the paper: \"Harry has kept in regular contact with his father on several occasions and made no secret of his desire to see him when he can. He has been especially concerned about him and hopes the King will be well and able to see him as planned.\"\n\nPrince Harry's solo return to Britain will start on Tuesday, 7 May - the day after his son, Prince Archie, celebrates his fifth birthday - and will come to a close on Thursday when Harry flies to Nigeria to meet up with Meghan.\n\nDuring the couple's trip to Nigeria, they are expected to meet military staff during the trip, which is linked to the Invictus Games. It is their first trip to the African nation, which holds a special place in Meghan's heart having revealed last year that she is \"43% \u00adNigerian\".\n\nMeghan has not travelled to the UK since Queen Elizabeth II's death - with it previously being said that she would stay at home with the couple's young children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, on previous occasions where Harry has arrived alone. This decision, an expert points out, is the \"clearest indication yet\" that Meghan wants very little to do with the UK.\n\nFormer BBC royal correspondent Jennie Bond toldOK!: \"I'm afraid this does seem to be the clearest indication yet that Meghan really doesn't want to return to the UK. I suppose it's not surprising because there would be a huge amount of doubt about what kind of reception she would get. But it is sad.\"\n\nOn Meghan's decision to travel to Nigeria, Jennie adds: \"The fact that she is going to Nigeria completely negates the argument that it is the issue of security that is keeping her away. They will obviously be given official security in Nigeria, but they would almost certainly be given security here on a similarly official engagement. And few people would argue that Nigeria is a safer place than the UK.\n\n\"So the only conclusion we can draw is that Meghan has absolutely no desire to set foot in the UK again. It must be sad for Harry who has made it clear that he loves his family here, and wants his children to know and understand their heritage.\"\n\nDespite being Harry's greatest supporter and joining him at almost every Invictus event since they met, Meghan's absence will be noted, Jennie says.\n\n\"Meghan has been at his side for so much of the Invictus story and it must hold a special place in their hearts because it was at the games that they made their first public appearance together. If she can travel to the Netherlands for the games, why can't she attend such an important milestone as the 10th anniversary service at St Paul's?\n\n\"It's not because of leaving the children - because she's going to Nigeria. And it can't be because of security - because she's going to Nigeria. So we are left with the one conclusion. She doesn't want to come to the UK. It's a dilemma for Harry, and it's not going to go away.\"", "source": {"uri": "ok.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ok"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_russell@ok.co.uk", "name": "Rebecca Russell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Archie_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Archie of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VIII", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edward VIII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_House", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clarence House"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St Paul's Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennie_Bond", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jennie Bond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32069906.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Invictus-Games-Opening-Ceremony.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540664", "eventUri": "eng-9540664", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 49, "textEnd": 54}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 1125, "textEnd": 1130}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

marks one-year on the throne", "body": "TODAY marks one year since Charles became King and his regal Coronation was televised around the world.\n\nWhile the day is undoubtedly a momentous memory in his mind, the anniversary will be \"bittersweet\" for King Charles, claims a royal author.\n\nPhil Dampier claims the monarch will not only be thinking about his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, but also his grandson Archie, who celebrates his fifth birthday today.\n\nThe royal expert told Fabulous: \"It's a bittersweet day for the King when he marks the anniversary of his Coronation as it's also Archie's birthday.\n\n\"I'm sure it breaks Charles's heart that his grandchildren Archie and Lilibet are growing up on the West Coast with American accents and yet he hardly knows them.\n\n\"Harry and Meghan may arrange occasional zoom calls but it's not the same as seeing them in person.\"\n\n\"Charles probably compensates for not seeing them by showering love on George, Charlotte and Louis, but obviously it would be better for all concerned if the rifts were healed and some kind of normal family relations resumed.\"\n\nPhil claimed: \"No-one knows if Harry is going to see his father but it wouldn't surprise me if he doesn't.\n\n\"It would surely be an opportunity for Meghan to also bring the children so they could see him, but I doubt it will happen.\n\n\"The King has only met Lilibet - who was named after his mother the late Queen - once, and Archie just two or three times.\n\n\"Of course we must not forget Meghan's father Thomas Markle, who has never met either of them, or even his son in law Harry.\"\n\nKing Charles has officially returned to public royal duties, 11 weeks after announcing he has cancer.\n\nLast Tuesday, the monarch, 75, swapped stories and held hands with patients as he visited a cancer treatment centre with the Queen, 76.\n\nWhen asked about his health battle and recovery, His Majesty understandably said it was a \"bit of a shock\" to be given his cancer diagnosis.\n\nPhil pointed out that Charles may not be able to see Harry if his health isn't up to it.\n\nHe claimed: \"The King is still restricting the people he sees close up because of his condition and of course last time they met it only lasted less than half an hour.\n\n\"People who have been travelling on long-haul flights often pick up bugs so the medical advice might be that they don't meet.\"\n\nAs well as any heartache over Prince Harry and grandson Prince Archie, Phil said the Coronation anniversary will be poignant, with Charles thinking about his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nHe added: \"I'm sure the King will be thinking of his mother on the day.\n\n\"At each major step of his reign he will tend to think what she would have done and learn from her wisdom, even though she is no longer with us.\n\n\"It doesn't mean he will always do exactly the same thing, and he will have his own style, but he will always remember her ways because why not learn from the most successful monarch we have ever had?\n\n\"As always, Camilla will be there to bolster him up and calm him down when required.\n\n\"She has been a magnificent support in recent months and I'm sure he would be the first to say he would have struggled to cope without her.\"\n\nThe Coronation service took place on May 6, 2023, and was watched by millions worldwide.\n\nCharles, who promised to pledge his life to his country in a solemn oath alongside Queen Camilla, has over the years expressed a desire to bring the Royal Family into the modern age.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com",

Last year, he attended his father's Coronation before dashing back to the US for the end of Archie's party.\n\nLast year, a slew of famous faces were rumoured to be on the guest list, including members from Meghan's side of the family. There were concerns that the youngster's party could even \"overshadow\" his grandfather's Coronation.\n\nAmong those thought to be invited to the American bash were couple Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi, who are close friends of Harry and Meghan. Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom were also said to have received invites, but they seemed to have other plans.\n\nLA-based author Lisa Gache, who teaches children's etiquette classes at the upscale Montecito Club, told The Telegraph: \"In Montecito, celebrities are royalty,\" reports the Express. \"It's Oprah and Ellen but also Serena Williams pregnant with her second child and Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom, whose daughter Daisy is a year younger than Archie. If there's any celebrity with a child the same age, it's safe to assume they'll be invited.\"\n\nMeghan's mum Doria Ragland, who made an appearance in the couple's tell-all Netflix series, was expected to be the only family member showing up. A source told the publication that little Archie \"barely knows his family\" and mentioned \"King Charles' sadness\" over having met him just a \"handful of times\".\n\n\"Plenty of Archie's friends, their parents and any local big names with children a similar age are expected,\" the insider shared.\n\nRegarding the party grub, another source spilled that Harry and Meghan have insisted on strict guidelines to accommodate various diets. \"They are also fixated with safety,\" someone in the know revealed to The Telegraph. \"There are emails in advance about making sure there is no gluten on the premises, even if no children are gluten-intolerant.\"\n\nFor the grown-ups, expect \"lots of salads, and not much else\". Montecito apparently has a no-go policy on booze at kids' dos, with Gache noting: \"Alcohol is frowned upon for kids' parties in Montecito. The Duke and Duchess are conscious of mental health and raising kids in an appropriate manner, I doubt they would serve it.\"\n\nIt's not known exactly how Prince Archie's birthday will be celebrated this year but Harry and Meghan will be sure to make it a memorable one for their firstborn.", "source": {"uri": "ok.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ok"}, "authors": [{"uri": "helen_kelly@ok.co.uk", "name": "Helen Kelly", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "harry_rutter@ok.co.uk", "name": "Harry Rutter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montecito,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Montecito, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montecito, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_DeGeneres", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ellen DeGeneres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy_Perry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Katy Perry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Bloom", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Bloom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Archie_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince Archie of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doria_Ragland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doria Ragland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portia_de_Rossi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portia de Rossi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprah_Winfrey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oprah Winfrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://i2-prod.ok.co.uk/royal/article32725631.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_prince-harry.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540664", "eventUri": "eng-9540664", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

The young prince was born at 05:26 on May 6, 2019, at the Portland Hospital in London. And his fifth birthday has now been brutally snubbed by the Royal Family and their official social media accounts.\n\nDespite the young prince turning five today, the Royal Family has publicly snubbed him by not wishing him a happy birthday in view of their social media followers as of yet, as they often do with other members of the family.\n\nREAD MORE: Ireland 'heatwave' hope as glorious weather maps show exact date temperatures to top 20C\n\nThe Royal Family used to send birthday wishes to the Sussexes, even after they stepped down as senior working royals, with the late Queen wishing Meghan a happy birthday in the same year that she and Harry moved to America. Sharing a post on the Royal Family's Instagram account, she said: \"Wishing The Duchess of Sussex a very happy birthday.\"\n\nIn 2022 there was a suggestion, according to an expert, that the royal website, Twitter and Instagram pages would no longer send birthday greetings out to any non-working members of the Royal Family unless their birthday ends in a zero.\n\nThen, in August 2023, it was reported that royal aides said they only marked the birthdays of working members of the Royal Family on their official social media accounts. Which came amid Meghan's 42nd birthday and how she was seemingly \"snubbed\".\n\nArchie is the first-born child, and only son, of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Unlike previous royal births, there was no immediate photocall at the hospital steps, with his birth announced by Buckingham Palace via a framed notice on an easel outside of the iconic palace.\n\nThe young prince became a big brother when he was only two years of age, with his younger sister Lilibet being born at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara, California, on June 4, 2021, at 11:40. The two children have been raised in California, with them not in contact with their wider family in the UK.\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

This wasn't Punky Brewster or Manimal. Archie Bunker was a malaprop-tripping, outer-borough (Queens), blue-collar union-man paterfamilias given to bigoted asides and (thanks to actor Carroll O'Connor) perfectly timed double-takes. Whatever Lear's satiric intentions, Archie became a beloved character during the show's heyday, before it descended into stupid laugh-track moralizing.\n\nNorman Lear was a thoughtful pro-free speech liberal Democrat, a species rarer than goldfish-swallowers on today's campuses. Even as a left-sympathizing kid I scorned Archie's liberal son-in-law and sparring partner, played by Rob Reiner, as a self-righteous ingrate, and my guess is that Lear wanted it that way.\n\nYet Lear cheated, too. The wistful line in the All in the Family theme song -- \"Mister, we could use a man like Herbert Hoover again\" -- warbled off-key by Archie and his long-suffering wife Edith, is dishonest even by sitcom standards. The archetypal Archie would have been a pedigreed FDR Democrat. His supposed Protestantism was also ridiculous: Archie -- with a different forename -- would've been Catholic.\n\nSurely he cast his first votes for FDR in 1944 and Truman in 1948 over the prig (and Kitty Carlisle's boytoy) Thomas E. Dewey, the little man on the wedding cake. Archie (without the Hollywood makeover) liked Ike but voted rotely for egghead Adlai Stevenson in '52 and '56. He was JFK all the way in 1960 before facing his first ballot-box temptation: jumping the fence for anti-Civil Rights Act Republican Barry Goldwater in 1964. But...Social Security. Archie was no entitlement-reform wonk, so he pulled the lever, with misgivings, for LBJ.\n\nIn 1968 Archie could've gone any of three ways. (And here let me recommend Luke Nichter's perceptive account of that race, The Year that Broke Politics.) George Wallace's denunciation of \"pointy-headed intellectuals\" who can't park their bicycles straight was the summit of Bunker's hill, but his defense of segregation was its nadir. In any event, Wallace's Southernness would've been too strange.\n\nHubert Humphrey's full-throated endorsement of civil rights would've irritated Archie, but the Hump was for whatever the big unions were for -- including the manufacture if not necessarily use of weapons of mass destruction -- so after a moment's hesitation in the voting booth Archie chose HHH against Nixon. The Minnesota motormouth would be his last Democrat.\n\n(Thinking on this sent me back to Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72, a formative reading experience for the teenaged me. The Aspen assassin wrote, \"Any political party that can't cough up anything better than a treacherous brain-damaged old vulture like Hubert Humphrey deserves every beating it gets. They don't hardly make 'em like Hubert any more -- but just to be on the safe side, he should be castrated anyway.\" It'd be pretty easy to update that passage for 2024.)\n\nIn 1972 Archie Bunker, over the Hump, flipped to the GOP for good, turned off by George McGovern -- or, rather, the caricatured misrepresentation (abetted by the Democratic candidate's obnoxious celebrity supporters) of the true patriot McGovern as an acid-dropping, welfare-dispensing commie.\n\nCarroll O'Connor was no more Archie Bunker than Charlton Heston was Moses. In a 1972 Democratic primary race containing two genuine if mottled populists -- Oklahoma senator Fred Harris on the \"left\" and George Wallace on the \"right\" -- the actor stumped for the silk-stocking Republican turned Democrat John Lindsay, whose limousine liberalism would've reduced Archie to paroxysmal sputtering.\n\nLong after the laughter has died, the last joke is on Archie -- the real one, not the Hoover-voting Protestant. The Bunkeresque tough-talking white Democratic mayors of the 1950s and '60s collaborated in the destruction of their cities and the neighborhoods that gave them life via urban renewal and the Interstate Highway System. At the national level, the Trumans and Johnsons that Archie supported shipped working-class boys into the abattoirs of Korea and Vietnam while militarizing the economy.\n\nArchie turned coat just as the Republicans were taking up the mantle of world policeman from Vietnam-spooked Democrats and as the GOP's stolid but solid Main Street faction was being bulldozed by Wall Street.\n\nIf only the Archie Bunkers had voted for Herbert Hoover -- who once said that what America needs is a great poem -- and George McGovern, who requested, sensibly and sincerely, that America come home in the spirit of peace and community. I'll bet Norman Lear would've loved that country.", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_in_the_Family", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All in the Family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Lear", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norman Lear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_Bunker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Archie Bunker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

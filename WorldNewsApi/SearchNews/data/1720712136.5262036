It has been around a month since the vendors happily moved into the newly completed vegetable shed only to realize that the facility lacks fans essential to fight the summer heat. They are now urging the authorities concerned to consider installing fans so that they can keep their produce fresh. About 20 vegetable vendors moved into the newly constructed integrated vegetable shed last month. The vendors thought they would not have to bear the scorching summer temperature, which goes beyond 35 degrees Celsius, once they have moved into the newly constructed vegetable shed. However, after moving in, without ceiling fans, some of them are using table fans to cool the air. But the vendors say table fans are not enough to keep the vegetables fresh. Some vendors use tarpaulin sheets to keep the heat out. Dorji Sangay, a vegetable vendor said, \u201cThe heat is unbearable between June and August. We thought that fans would have been installed. But they have not and I don\u2019t know why.\u201d Ugyen Dema, another vegetable seller said, \u201cIn places like Samdrup Jongkhar, fans are essential. It is okay to not have fans in places like Thimphu.\u201d Cheki Wangmo, who also sells vegetables in the shed said, \u201cWe are happy to have the shed and it would be great if it came with fans installed. It is hot without fans.\u201d Similarly, Kelzang, another vegetable vendor in the market also shared his frustration saying they are using table fans to beat the heat but he said the table fans are of not much help. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any options as it is not installed with ceiling fans.\u201d The vendors pay Nu 2600 each as monthly rental for the stalls. They also bear the electricity bills for their stalls. According to the Samdrup Jongkhar Thromde Administration, vegetable stalls are not installed with fans since they are in the open space. Thromde office said that with the ceiling height of four meters, installing fans will not deliver enough cool air. Nonetheless, the Samdrup Jongkhar Thromde Administration added, they will install wall fans if needed. Meat shops, restaurants, and other spaces are installed with fans. The Integrated vegetable shed was constructed spending Nu 65 M with financial support from the Government of India.

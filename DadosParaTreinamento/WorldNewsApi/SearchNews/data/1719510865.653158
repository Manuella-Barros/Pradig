{"id": 223696960, "title": "Mike Tyson vs Jake Paul: Boxing legend branded a \"killer\" by influencer rival", "text": "Boxing legend Mike Tyson still has a killer instinct at the age of 57, according to his next opponent Jake Paul. 'Iron Mike' will take on ring legend YouTuber-turned-boxer Paul on July 20 at the Dallas Cowboys stadium in Texas. Tyson hasn't fought since going eight rounds in un-scored exhibition contest against fellow icon Roy Jones Jr four years ago, but his bout against Paul will be professionally sanctioned. Paul turned 27 at the beginning of this year whilst Tyson be celebrating his 58th birthday just three weeks before his comeback. The social media star has promised not to hold back against 'Iron Mike' and views the former heavyweight champion as the toughest opponent of his boxing career so far. \"If he has the same opportunity you know damn well he's going to finish me in embarrassing fashion so I have to reciprocate that same energy. Mike Tyson is a killer, he's ruthless and he's the most vicious champion ever so I have to channel that Mike Tyson energy to finish him and the legend must fall,\" he told TMZ Sports \"It's crazy to think about but as many people as can fit in the stadium, I think it's 90,000 or 93,000. I think it's going to be packed to the brim and the global viewership could be in the hundreds of millions. It's wild and it doesn't make any sense but the fact Netflix are part of this is the perfect piece of the puzzle.\" Paul currently weighs the same as Anthony Joshua as he continues to bulk up in an effort to match Tyson's weight on fight night. 'Iron Mike' mocked Paul's new physique by calling him fat but the influencer plans on trimming down in the coming weeks, adding: \"I believe I will be able to move and dance around the ring like a true heavyweight. \"Everything has been good but it's been a little transition moving to heavyweight. I definitely needed to put on weight so that I'm able to compete with Mike Tyson and so that he's not able to throw me around in the ring. We've been sparring heavyweights and eating more food.\"", "summary": "Tyson will be 58-years-old when he fights Paul this summer but the boxing legend promised to turn back the clock by KO'ing his influencer rival", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/boxing/mike-tyson-vs-jake-paul-32896020", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32890238.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2152293974.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:26:39", "author": "Harry Davies,Harry-davies", "authors": ["Harry Davies", "Harry-davies"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.08}

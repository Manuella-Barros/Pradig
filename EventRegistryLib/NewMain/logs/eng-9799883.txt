In 2019, Hulu announced it was developing the project as a big-budget series with DiCaprio and Scorsese exec producing.\n\nLast year, Hulu decided not to proceed with the project. ABC Signature, which had the project in Association with Paramount Television Studios, indicated at the time a continuing commitment to the project and hope of finding it a new home.

DiCaprio set up a rival project, planning to rely on public domain materials of Holmes's murderous exploits. When the book rights came available, Appian Way and Double Features acquired it from Paradigm on behalf of lit agency Black Inc.\n\nIn 2015, DiCaprio set it up as a feature at Paramount, with Scorsese directing and Billy Ray to write the script. In 2022, it went to Hulu as an eight-episode series with Keanu Reeves taking the Holmes role and Todd Field directing. Scorsese and DiCaprio became solely producers. When Reeves, Field and Hulu all pulled away from the ambitious project, the ABC Signature expressed its continued commitment.

Published in 2003, the book is set in Chicago during the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition and is a work of historical non-fiction that details the story of H.H. Holmes, considered to be the first known serial killer in the U.S., and Word's Fair architect Daniel Burnham. Believed to have killed between 27 and 200 people in Chicago, Holmes uses Chicago's fascination with hosting the World's Columbian Exposition as cover to commit his grisly crimes.\n\nRelated Every Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese Movie Collaboration, Ranked\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese are considered to be the best in the world at their craft. Here are all of their movie collaborations, ranked.\n\nThe project was originally in development as a film at Paramount Pictures back in 2015, with DiCaprio and Scorsese attached as lead actor and director, respectively. News seemed to slow down over the years until it was announced that Hulu was going to develop it as a series, with DiCaprio and Scorsese still on board as executive producers, and Keanu Reeves attached to star. While that seemed promising, with Todd Field also being on board to direct, Hulu decided not to move forward with the eight-episode series and Reeves ultimately dropped out.\n\nDiCaprio's continued interest makes a lot of sense as he has been trying to get an adaptation made for years, even setting up his own project to rival one optioned by Tom Cruise when he was interested in portraying H.H. Holmes. This could be viewed as an example of \"development hell\" but so much talent is still involved and committed to getting Devil in the White City made that legging it out seems worth it.

Producer Stacey Sher confirms that Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese are still involved in the long-awaited adaptation. The Hulu series version faced setbacks with changes in casting and director, ultimately leaving the project in limbo for now.\n\nDespite many delays, Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese's long-awaited adaptation of The Devil in the White City is still in the works. Producer Stacey Sher confirms that she is still working on the project. Sher gave the update in a new interview with Deadline for the upcoming Locarno Film Festival.\n\nWhen asked if the series is coming soon, she replied \"...I hope so. It's not imminent, but it is not ever far from my mind.\" She also confirms that producers DiCaprio, Scorsese, Rick Yorn, and Jen Davisson are still involved, as well. The long-delayed project is an adaptation of Erik Larson's 2003 non-fiction bestseller The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America, which follows two parallel narratives in 1890s Chicago; the Herculean efforts by architect Daniel Burnham to mount the 1893 World's Fair, and the depredations of serial killer H.H. Holmes, who killed a number of victims in a building later dubbed the \"Murder Castle\". The project has been in development since the book's publication, but has yet to bear fruit.\n\nWhy Is It Taking So Long To Make 'The Devil in the White City'?\n\nClose\n\nUpon the book's publication, its rights were snapped up by Tom Cruise, but that project never came to fruition. DiCaprio acquired the rights to adapt the book in 2010; at the time, he intended to both produce the film and star as Holmes. In 2015, DiCaprio partnered with frequent collaborator Scorsese on the project, with Billy Ray attached to pen the script. By 2019, the project had metamorphosed into a Hulu series, with Scorsese and DiCaprio set to executive produce. It seemed to have a chance of getting made in 2022, when Keanu Reeves was set to star with Todd Field directing; however, Reeves and Field exited the project a year later. Earlier this year, Hulu announced that it would not be moving ahead with the series, leaving it in limbo.\n\nIn the interview, Sher discusses another seemingly-lost project; Quentin Tarantino's would-be final film, The Movie Critic. Although she can't discuss why Tarantino abandoned the project - \"He'd kill me if I told you why,\" - she suggests it could live on in another form, akin to Tarantino's novelization of his most recent film, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\n\nMartin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio's The Devil in the White City adaptation is still in the works; no release date has yet been announced.

According to producer Stacey Sher, the film-turned-limited series adaptation is still moving forward with the original team, despite setbacks such as Hulu dropping the series. Even though the project has been in development for almost a decade and a half, it seems there's still a chance it actually sees the light of day.\n\nMartin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio's movie adaptation The Devil in the White City has gotten an update following 14 years of development hell, indicating whether the project is ever going to be made. Based on the 2003 non-fiction book by Erik Larson, the story follows the real-life history of World's Fair architect Daniel Burnham and America's first serial killer, H.H. Holmes. DiCaprio purchased the film rights in 2010, with the film stuck in development ever since. While The Devil in the White City went to Hulu as a show, the streamer dropped the project in March 2023.\n\nSpeaking with Deadline, though, producer Stacey Sher offered a positive update on the future of The Devil in the White City, saying the limited series is still going to move forward with all the original people involved. This includes both Scorsese and DiCaprio as producers, alongside Rick Yorn and Jen Davisson. This is the first positive update for the project in years, indicating Sher's confidence despite the series no longer having a home for production.\n\nThe original version of the project would have been a movie directed by Martin Scorsese and written by Billy Ray, with DiCaprio serving as a producer.\n\nWhen Will The Devil In The White City Actually Be Released?\n\nThe most progress made on adaptation of The Devil in the White City was in January 2022, when it was announced Keanu Reeves would star in Scorsese and DiCaprio's project, while Todd Field (T\u00e1r) would direct the first two episodes. However, by October of that same year, Reeves dropped out of the project, with Field also leaving days later. This was despite expectations the series would begin filming in Chicago and Toronto by March 2023. Instead, the month filming was supposed to begin, Hulu dropped the series, leaving it to be shopped around to other networks ever since.\n\nDespite the glum circumstances the series is currently in, Sher's statement confirms work is ongoing, with all the original producers still attached. However, given the show is no longer at Hulu, anything could happen, from it remaining a limited series to the project reverting back into a movie as DiCaprio first envisioned. But, since there's no cast nor concrete information on its production, The Devil in the White City might not come out until 2026 at best. It could also be much later, depending on how big a priority it is for its lead producers.\n\nRelated 10 Martin Scorsese Projects That Never Got Made\n\nIn a career that spans over 50 year, there are plenty of what-ifs when it comes to Martin Scorsese. Here are some of his projects that never got made.\n\nAlthough it's good to know The Devil in the White City isn't cancelled despite its rough development, the lack of any concrete news about its production means it could be quite some time before it actually gets made. Since Scorsese is directing a new movie about Jesus while DiCaprio is filming the crime thriller The Battle of Baktan Cross, it seems the adaptation isn't at the forefront for either of them. But, since it's still seemingly alive, more information could be revealed soon about its potential progress.\n\nSource: Deadline", "source": {"uri": "screenrant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenRant"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese_and_Leonardo_DiCaprio", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil_in_the_White_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Devil in the White City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacey_Sher", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stacey Sher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Martin Scorsese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._H._Holmes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "H.

He subsequently set it up as a feature at Paramount with Scorsese to direct and himself to star. In 2019, Hulu announced that it was developing the project as a big-budget series with DiCaprio and Scorsese exec producing. Last year, Hulu decided not to proceed with the project. ABC Signature, which had the project in Association with Paramount Television Studios, indicated at the time a continuing comittment to the project and hope of finding it a new home. That was in March 2023.\n\nNow, when asked about the long-aborning Devil Sher, who has been with it since the beginning, told Deadline it's still happening.\n\n\"I'm still involved. I never give up,\" she said.\n\nWhen asked if we might see the screen version of Larson's book soon Sher indicated continuing interest.\n\n\"I hope so,\" she answered. \"It's not imminent, but it is not ever far from my mind.\"\n\nAs for the continued involvement of the big names previously attached to the project, Sher indicated they band was still together.\n\n\"Yes, that would be Rick [Yorn], Leo [DiCaprio], Jen [Davisson], and Mr. Scorsese. We're all still involved.\"\n\nDevil in the White City follows Dr. HH Holmes, a cunning serial killer believed to have murdered anywhere from 27 to 200 people at a time when the city of Chicago was enthralled with hosting the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893. The book plays off the contrasts between the hopeful expectations and wonders presented at the Exposition and the dark deeds of Holmes, who maneuvered in its shadows.\n\nBack when the book was published in 2003, Tom Cruise optioned it with the intention to play the killer. DiCaprio set up a rival project, planning to rely on public domain materials of Holmes's murderous exploits. When the book rights came available, Appian Way and Double Features acquired it from Paradigm on behalf of lit agency Black Inc.\n\nIn 2015, DiCaprio set it up as a feature at Paramount, with Scorsese directing and Billy Ray to write the script. In 2022, it went to Hulu as an eight-episode series with Keanu Reeves taking the Holmes role and Todd Field directing. Scorsese and DiCaprio became solely producers. When Reeves, Field and Hulu all pulled away from the ambitious project, the ABC Signature expressed its continued commitment.

The murderer was Henry H. Holmes, a young doctor who, in a malign parody of the White City, built his \"World's Fair Hotel\" just west of the fairgrounds -- a torture palace complete with dissection table, gas chamber, and 3,000-degree crematorium. Burnham overcame tremendous obstacles and tragedies as he organized the talents of Frederick Law Olmsted, Charles McKim, Louis Sullivan, and others to transform swampy Jackson Park into the White City, while Holmes used the attraction of the great fair and his own satanic charms to lure scores of young women to their deaths. What makes the story all the more chilling is that Holmes really lived, walking the grounds of that dream city by the lake.\"", "source": {"uri": "comingsoon.net", "dataType": "news", "title":

The project, which has had a complicated development history, is still moving forward, according to Sher.\n\nThe journey of adapting this non-fiction classic for the screen has seen many twists and turns. Leonardo DiCaprio first bought the film rights to the book in 2010 and planned to star in it, with Martin Scorsese set to direct.Initially, the project was set up as a feature film at Paramount Pictures.\n\nIn 2019, Hulu announced plans to turn the book into a big-budget series with DiCaprio and Scorsese as executive producers. However, Hulu decided to drop the project last year. Despite this setback, ABC Signature, which was working with Paramount Television Studios on the project, expressed a commitment to finding a new home for it. This update came in March 2023.\n\nSher, who has been involved with the project from the beginning, reassured fans that the adaptation is still in the works. When asked about the project's status, she confirmed that it is not yet ready to be released but remains a priority for her. She emphasized that the team, including DiCaprio, Scorsese, and other key individuals, is still dedicated to making it happen.\n\nThe Devil in the White City tells the story of Dr. H.H. Holmes, a notorious serial killer who operated in Chicago during the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. The book contrasts the excitement and promise of the Exposition with the dark, criminal activities of Holmes, who used the fair as a backdrop for his heinous acts.\n\nBefore DiCaprio's involvement, Tom Cruise had once shown interest in adapting the book and planned to play the role of Holmes himself. After the rights became available again, DiCaprio's production company acquired them, setting the stage for the current project.\n\nThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

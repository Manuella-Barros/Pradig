deep political divisions at home.\n\nAsked whether he thought Netanyahu was prolonging the war for his own political reasons, Biden said: \"There is every reason for people to draw that

allegations that Israel is using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, but said: \"I think they've engaged in activity that is inappropriate.\"\n\nBiden said he warned Israel not to make the same mistake the US did after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks that led to \"endless wars.\"\n\n\"And they're making that mistake,\" he said.\n\nIsraeli government spokesperson David Mencer, asked about the interview, said it was \"outside the diplomatic norms of every right-thinking country\" for Biden to make such comments about Netanyahu.\n\nLast month, the International Criminal Court's prosecutor in The Hague requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defense chief, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged war crimes.\n\nOpinion polls show most Israelis support the war but blame Netanyahu for the security failures when Hamas gunmen rampaged through Israeli communities near Gaza on Oct. 7, and would vote him out if there were an election.\n\nMass street protests have become

And so it's an internal domestic debate that seems to have no consequence,\" Biden said, referring to Netanyahu's proposed judicial overhaul that had drawn angry protests before the October 7 terror attacks by Hamas that sparked the current conflict.\n\n\"Whether he would change his position or not, it's hard to say, but it has not been helpful,\" Biden said.\n\nThe president made the comments last week as he was preparing to deliver a speech laying out what he said was an Israeli proposal to end the war and secure the release of hostages.\n\nThe speech was intended to apply pressure on Hamas and Israel to end the war, but the effect of his remarks was to put Netanyahu on the spot as the war in Gaza grinds ahead. So far, Netanyahu has yet to publicly endorse the plan, despite it being an Israeli proposal, and members of his far-right government have threatened to quit should the plan be adopted.\n\nThe president's decision to spell out in detail Israel's plan underscored his growing impatience at the logjam in talks to secure the release of hostages.\n\n\"Bibi is under enormous pressure on the hostages ... and so he's prepared to do about anything to get the hostages back,\" Biden said, using Netanyahu's nickname.\n\nRelations between Biden and Netanyahu have become strained in recent months as the war drags on. The US has grown frustrated at some of Israel's war tactics, which officials believe do not include stringent enough protections for civilians.\n\nWhite House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby downplayed Biden's comments to Time on Tuesday, telling reporters, \"I think the president was very clear in his answer on that, and we'll let the prime minister speak to his own politics and to what his critics are saying, and the president was referencing what many critics have said.\"\n\nBiden said in the interview it wasn't clear whether Israel's actions constitute war crimes, an allegation made by the International Criminal Court when it issued arrest warrants for some Israeli leaders.\n\nBut he did say Israel had engaged in \"in activity that is inappropriate.\"\n\n\"The answer is it's uncertain and has been investigated by the Israelis themselves. The ICC is something that we don't, we don't recognize,\" Biden said when asked whether he believed Israel had committed war crimes in Gaza. \"But one thing is certain, the people in Gaza, the Palestinians have suffered greatly, for lack of food, water, medicine, etc. And a lot of innocent people have been killed. But it is - and a lot of it has to do not just with Israelis, but what Hamas is doing in Israel as we speak. Hamas is intimidating that population.\"\n\nInside the White House, many view Netanyahu's unwillingness to end the war as reflective of his fragile political standing.\n\nThat precarious position could become even shakier once investigations into potential missed signals ahead of the October 7 attacks begin. In the interview, Biden declined to place blame directly on Netanyahu for any security failings.\n\n\"I don't know how any one person has that responsibility. He was the leader of the country, so therefore, it happened. But he wasn't the only one that didn't pick it up,\" Biden said.\n\nInstead, he said his principal disagreement with the Israeli leader was his refusal to begin planning for post-war Gaza and his rejection of an eventual Palestinian state.\n\n\"My major disagreement with Netanyahu is, what happens after, what happens after Gaza's over? What, what does it go back to?\" he said, adding later: \"There needs to be a two-state solution, a transition to a two-state solution. And that's my biggest disagreement with Bibi Netanyahu.\"\n\nKirby acknowledged that Biden and Netanyahu have clashed in the past, including on the viability of a two-state solution, \"but for our part, we're going to make sure that Israel has what it needs to continue to eliminate the threat by Hamas, and that we're going to continue to work with the prime minister and the war cabinet to try to get this proposal over the finish line - a proposal, I would add that was an Israeli proposal that they crafted after some diplomatic conversations with us, and which they've acknowledged is their proposal, so that's what our focus is going to be on.\"\n\nCNN's Donald Judd contributed to this report.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_liptak@aol.com", "name": "Kevin Liptak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kirby_(admiral)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Kirby (admiral)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States National Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Two-state solution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/US_Civil_War", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/US Civil War", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_cnn_articles_945/56f45c0641a0f0abf39dadff64053611", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623923", "eventUri": "eng-9623923", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 990, "textEnd": 999, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.7019607843137254, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Biden has supported a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians, but Netanyahu has opposed such an idea. While Netanyahu has said Israeli occupation is not the solution, he has not proposed an alternate vision for the \"day after\" the war.\n\nIsrael has faced international criticism for its handling of the war against Hamas, which began last October after the terrorist group killed more than 1,000 Israelis. Subsequent Israeli military strikes in Gaza have killed thousands of Palestinians, and those in Gaza have been without adequate access to food, water and medicine.\n\nNetanyahu has faced mounting criticism from the U.S. and other countries over its handling of the war as the humanitarian crisis worsens in Gaza and as civilian deaths mount. Biden has said U.S. support for Israel is \"ironclad,\" but he has voiced frustration with Netanyahu over his handling of the war, particularly over the deaths of civilians and plans to invade Rafah in southern Gaza.\n\nThe president earlier this week laid out a three-phase peace plan that would wind down fighting between Israel and Hamas and allow for the rebuilding of Gaza. Biden argued Hamas has been degraded to the point that it cannot carry out an attack similar to last October. But Netanyahu has said the war should continue until Hamas is completely destroyed.\n\nBiden told Time it was \"uncertain\" if Israeli forces had committed war crimes in Gaza. He has previously criticized an International Criminal Court (ICC) request for arrest warrants against Netanyahu and his defense minister, and said the U.S. doesn't recognize the ICC's jurisdiction over Israel or Gaza.\n\n\"But one thing is certain, the people in Gaza, the Palestinians have suffered greatly, for lack of food, water, medicine, etc. And a lot of innocent people have been killed,\" Biden told Time. \"But it is -- and a lot of it has to do not just with Israelis, but what Hamas is doing in Israel as we speak.\"\n\nBiden also told Time he does not think Israel is intentionally using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, but that the Israelis have \"engaged in activity that is inappropriate.\"\n\n\"When I went over immediately after the -- Hamas' brutal attack, I said then, and it became public, I said, don't make the same mistake we did going after bin Laden,\" Biden said. \"Don't try -- the idea of occupying Afghanistan, the idea that you had nuclear arsenals in Iran, that were being, I mean, in Iraq, that were being generated, simply not true. And it led to endless wars. They were not true. Don't make the mistakes we made. And they're making that mistake, I think.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

In an interview with Time, Biden also criticized Israel for possible war crimes and inappropriate activities. Biden warned Israel against repeating America's past mistakes.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden said Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu may be stalling on ending the war in Gaza for political reasons, according to an interview with Time magazine released on Tuesday.\n\nThe comments in the May 28 interview were made a few days before Biden detailed a proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza, and as the Israeli prime minister struggles with deep political divisions at home. Asked whether he thought Netanyahu was prolonging the war for his own political reasons, Biden said: \"There is every reason for people to draw that conclusion.\"\n\nBiden, who has been pushing for an end to the nearly eight-month war, also said it was \"uncertain\" whether Israeli forces have committed war crimes in Gaza. He rejected allegations that Israel is using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, but said: \"I think they've engaged in activity that is inappropriate.\"\n\nBiden said he warned Israel not to make the same mistake the U.S. did after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks that led to \"endless wars.\" \"And they're making that mistake,\" he said.\n\nIsraeli government spokesperson David Mencer, asked about the interview, said it was \"outside the diplomatic norms of every right-thinking country\" for Biden to make such comments about Netanyahu. Last month, the International Criminal Court's prosecutor in The Hague requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defense chief, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged war crimes.\n\nIsrael launched an air and ground offensive in Gaza last October vowing to destroy the Palestinian Islamist militant group Hamas after it attacked inside Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage, according to Israeli tallies. Around 120 hostages remain in Gaza. The Israeli assault has killed more than 36,000 people in Gaza, according to health authorities there, who say thousands more bodies are buried under rubble.\n\nOpinion polls show most Israelis support the war but blame Netanyahu for the security failures when Hamas gunmen rampaged through Israeli communities near Gaza on Oct. 7, and would vote him out if there were an election. Mass street protests have become weekly events, drawing tens of thousands demanding the government do more to bring home hostages seized by Hamas in Oct. 7 and calling for Netanyahu to go.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Israel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hague"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/16_05_2024_09_52_50_9661367.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623923", "eventUri": "eng-9623923", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-28", "textStart": 537, "textEnd": 543}, {"amb": false, "date": "2001-09-11", "textStart": 1280, "textEnd": 1294}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2384, "textEnd": 2390, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

With Israel showing no signs of stopping until Hamas is defeated, Biden told Time that people have \"every reason\" to believe Netanyahu is intentionally prolonging the conflict for his own political self-preservation.\n\n\"There is every reason for people to draw that conclusion. And I would cite that as -- before the war began, the blowback he was getting from the Israeli military for wanting to change the constitu -- change the court,\" Biden told Time, referring to a law passed by Netanyahu's coalition in July 2023 to limit the Israeli Supreme Court's oversight of government, which was struck down in January. \"And so it's an internal domestic debate that seems to have no consequence. And whether he would change his position or not, it's hard to say, but it has not been helpful.\"\n\nAsked whether he believed that Netanyahu was responsible for the intelligence failures that allowed Hamas to attack Israel on Oct. 7, Biden said that no \"one person\" was at fault, then segued and said he had a \"major disagreement\" with Netanyahu on the plan for Gaza after the war ends, shutting down the idea of Israeli forces taking control of the region.\n\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet - delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break!

But he wasn't the only one that didn't pick it up,\" Biden told Time. \"He wasn't the only one that didn't pick it up. That's why there's got to be -- my major disagreement with Netanyahu is, what happens after, what happens after Gaza's over?\"\n\n\"Do Israeli forces go back in? I've been talking to the Egyptians and been talking to the Saudis. I've been talking to the Jordanians, I've been talking to the Emiratis. The answer is, if that's the case, it can't work,\" Biden said. \"There needs to be a two-state solution, a transition to a two-state solution. And that's my biggest disagreement with Bibi Netanyahu.\"\n\nBiden and Netanyahu, both political veterans, have known each other for decades but have had an increasingly strained relationship amid disagreements on how Israel's war against Hamas should be carried out. Biden is now advocating for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza amid humanitarian concerns affecting the millions of Palestinians living in the region, but Netanyahu and his coalition believe a ceasefire can only be achieved once Hamas is degraded beyond repair, citing concerns that the terrorist group would never accept true peace.\n\nDefense experts and former U.S. officials previously told the Daily Caller News Foundation that a ceasefire now may allow Hamas to regroup, resurge and eventually attack Israel again in the future. Israel has killed thousands of Hamas fighters but thousands more remain, mostly in southern Gaza but also in the central and northern regions.\n\nThe two world leaders have had several tense phone calls about the war since Oct. 7, with Biden sometimes becoming confused or upset with Netanyahu's plans and remarks, even abruptly hanging up on Netanyahu out of anger on one occasion. Netanyahu, for his part, has apparently become upset with how the Biden administration is trying to mitigate Israel's war aims, reportedly declaring during a war cabinet meeting in May that Israel is not a \" vassal state of the United States.\"\n\nThe White House and the Israeli Embassy to the U.S. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

There is every reason for people to draw that conclusion,\" Biden said, adding that before the war, Netanyahu was facing blowback for wanting an overhaul of the nation's judicial system. \"So it's an internal domestic debate that seems to have no consequence. And whether he would change his position or not, it's hard to say, but it has not been helpful.\"\n\nBiden explained that his major disagreement with the Israeli prime minister is over Gaza's future after the war ends.\n\n\"What happens after Gaza's over? What, what does it go back to? Do Israeli forces go back in?\" he asked. \"I've been talking to the Egyptians and been talking to the Saudis. I've been talking to the Jordanians, I've been talking to the Emiratis. The answer is, if that's the case, it can't work. There needs to be a two-state solution, a transition to a two-state solution. And that's my biggest disagreement with Bibi Netanyahu.\"\n\nWhen asked if Netanyahu was the only one standing in the way of a package of proposals that might aid in transitioning to a two-state solution, Biden said he had to be careful about what he told Time because he acknowledged the magazine article would come out later on, and he was already in the process of negotiating a possible path forward.\n\n\"I think there is a clear path for a transition where the Arab states would provide security and reconstruction in Gaza in return for a longer-term commitment to a transition to a two-state solution,\" Biden said. \"And that extends all the way from Saudi Arabia, who I continue to talk to -- my team -- to the Jordanians that are trying to work bringing in goods and certain goods now, food, medicine, etc. And the Egyptians who I've been talking with frequently about what happens in terms of access for more material to get into Gaza to prevent this catastrophe from continuing.\"\n\nThe interview took place last Tuesday, several days before he announced in remarks at the White House on Friday that Israel had submitted a proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nAn Israeli official, however, told NBC News on Monday that Biden's description of the offer was \"not accurate.\"\n\nBiden's relationship with Netanyahu has grown contentious since Israel entered Gaza following Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7. The president has faced growing opposition from the far left of the Democratic Party over U.S. policy toward Israel in its efforts to help its close ally.\n\nAsked last week by Time if Israeli forces have committed war crimes in Gaza, Biden said. \"The answer is it's uncertain and has been investigated by the Israelis themselves. The ICC is something that we don't, we don't recognize,\" he added, referring to the International Criminal Court, whose chief prosecutor sought arrest warrants last month against Israeli leaders, including Netanyahu, for alleged war crimes. \"But one thing is certain, the people in Gaza, the Palestinians have suffered greatly, for lack of food, water, medicine, etc. And a lot of innocent people have been killed.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Two-state solution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egyptians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arab world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-06/240604-joe-biden-mn-1000-3e97be.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623923", "eventUri": "eng-9623923", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-28", "textStart": 291, "textEnd": 297}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2700, "textEnd": 2706}], "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

The US president revealed that he recently spoke with Israeli officials regarding their progress in Gaza, but he was hesitant to divulge the details of those communications.\n\nBiden then hinted that he agreed with speculation that Netanyahu is extending the Israel-Hamas war \"for his own political self-preservation\" and to avoid facing accountability from the Israeli public.\n\n\"There is every reason for people to draw that conclusion. And I would cite that as -- before the war began, the blowback he was getting from the Israeli military for wanting to change the constitu -- change the court. And so it's an internal domestic debate that seems to have no consequence,\" Biden told Time, referring to Netanyahu's controversial plan to reform Israel's judiciary before the war began. \"And whether he would change his position or not, it's hard to say, but it has not been helpful.\"\n\nBiden stated that he does not agree with former US President Donald Trump that Netanyahu bears most of the blame for the Hamas terror attacks on Oct. 7. In April, Trump said that the terror attacks \"should have never happened\" and criticized Netanyahu for allowing them to occur under his watch.\n\n\"I don't know how any one person has that responsibility. He was the leader of the country, so therefore, it happened. But he wasn't the only one that didn't pick it up,\" Biden said.\n\nThe president revealed that his \"major disagreement\" with the Israeli prime minister is \"what happens\" after Israel wraps up the war effort in Gaza. Any effort by the Israeli military to occupy the Gaza Strip at the conclusion of the war would be met with pushback by neighboring Arab countries, Biden said.\n\n\"I've been talking to the Egyptians and been talking to the Saudis. I've been talking to the Jordanians, I've been talking to the Emiratis. The answer is, if that's the case, it can't work,\" Biden said.\n\nInstead of occupying the Gaza strip, Biden argued that Israel needs to take steps to establish a Palestinian state.\n\n\"There needs to be a two-state solution, a transition to a two-state solution. And that's my biggest disagreement with Bibi Netanyahu,\" Biden said.\n\nNeighboring Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Jordan could help with the management and transition of Gaza at the conclusion of the Israel-Hamas war, Biden said. These countries, he explained, could provide security and assist in the rebuilding of the war-torn enclave in exchange for movement toward a two-state solution.\n\n\"I think there is a clear path for a transition where the Arab states would provide security and reconstruction in Gaza in return for a longer-term commitment to a transition to a two-state solution,\" the president continued. \"And that extends all the way from Saudi Arabia, who I continue to talk to -- my team -- to the Jordanians that are trying to work bringing in goods and certain goods now, food, medicine, etc. And the Egyptians who I've been talking with frequently about what happens in terms of access for more material to get into Gaza to prevent this catastrophe from continuing.\"\n\nThe US and Israel have engaged in intense negotiations to wind down the war in Gaza in recent months. Biden announced a three-phase plan on Friday to secure both the return of the remaining hostages kidnapped on Oct. 7 and Israel's exit from the Gaza Strip. Israeli officials have said that Biden disclosed only part of the proposal and that Israel has not agreed to end Israel's military operations against Hamas.\n\nBiden has yet to reveal how he plans to help dismantle Hamas, the Palestinian terror group that launched the war in Gaza by slaughtering over 1,200 people in southern Israel and kidnapping over 250 others on Oct. 7.", "source": {"uri": "algemeiner.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Algemeiner"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Two-state solution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arab world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egyptians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/US_Civil_War", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/US Civil War", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.algemeiner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2023-12-13T142421Z_1_LYNXMPEJBC0LE_RTROPTP_4_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-BIDEN-FAMILIES11.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623923", "eventUri": "eng-9623923", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1466, "textEnd": 1472, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": -0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

The Israeli prime minister is also facing corruption charges at home.\n\nFor months, Palestinian rights advocates have warned that Netanyahu has a personal, political interest in prolonging the war to boost his standing in Israel and extend his political career.\n\nRecent surveys in Israel show Netanyahu recovering popularity amid the war and edging out his main rival, war cabinet minister Benny Gantz.\n\nIsraeli officials close to Netanyahu have previously floated the possibility of a protracted conflict in Gaza.\n\nDays before Biden unveiled the truce proposal, Israel's National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said the fighting in Gaza would go on for at least another seven months.\n\nIn the US, Biden's response to the war in Gaza could harm his re-election chances, with public opinion polls showing that Arab, Muslim and young voters are reluctant to vote for the Democratic president over his support for Israel.\n\nBiden, a self-proclaimed Zionist, had been a staunch defender of the war. His administration has vetoed three United Nations Security Council draft resolutions that would have called for a ceasefire.\n\nThe US president also signed off in April on $14bn in additional military aid to Israel. And his administration has continued to transfer weapons to the country despite growing allegations of war crimes, including withholding aid, killing non-combatants, torturing detainees and targeting civilian infrastructure.\n\nInternational Criminal Court prosecutor Karim Khan is seeking an arrest warrant for Netanyahu and his defence minister Yaov Gallant as well as Hamas leaders over alleged war crimes.\n\nLast month, Biden rejected the ICC prosecutor's move and called it \"outrageous\", but the White House has opposed congressional efforts to impose sanctions on ICC officials for their investigation of Israeli conduct.\n\nThe Israeli offensive has killed more than 36,500 Palestinians and brought Gaza to the verge of famine.\n\nIn his interview with TIME Magazine, Biden said it is \"uncertain\" that Israel is committing war crimes in Gaza.\n\nIn December, Biden said Israel was losing support for its war on Gaza over its \"indiscriminate bombing\" of the territory - a war crime.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5,

That interview, in which Trump suggested state governments could monitor Americans' pregnancies and vowed mass deportations, quickly became a flashpoint on the campaign trail.\n\nBiden's interview sheds light on his first term in office as well as some of the challenges he faces in a potential second term if he wins what polls show is a close race with Trump.\n\nAsked if Netanyahu's political considerations were driving the war, Biden said \"there is every reason for people to draw that conclusion,\" citing the domestic \"blowback\" the prime minister received ahead of the Israel-Hamas conflict by pushing to change Israel's constitution, moves critics said would weaken democracy in the country.\n\n\"Whether he would change his position or not, it's hard to say, but it has not been helpful,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden has sought to ramp up pressure on both Israel and Hamas to agree to a three-phase Gaza peace plan that would end the fighting and secure the release of hostages captured by Hamas, which is designated a terrorist group, during its Oct. 7 raid on Israel.\n\nNetanyahu though faces pressure from far-right parties in his electoral coalition to continue the war until Hamas is rooted out from the Gaza Strip and the hostages are freed, complicating Biden's efforts. The war has posed a political risk to Biden, with key parts of his coalition, including progressives and younger voters, frustrated by his support for Israel.\n\nIn the interview Biden acknowledged that Netanyahu is \"under enormous pressure on the hostages,\" adding that the Israeli leader is \"prepared to do about anything to get the hostages back.\"\n\nStill Biden said a negotiated cease-fire was the best way to secure their release. \"Both the Israelis desperately want a cease fire in order to get the hostages home. And it's a way to begin to break the momentum,\" he said.\n\nBiden said Israel was investigating if its forces had committed war crimes, but added he did not believe the country had used starvation of civilians in Gaza as a war tactic.\n\nChina Economy\n\nThe president also addressed US-ties with China, ahead of an election in which relations between the world's two largest economies will have a central focus and both candidates have sought to cast themselves as tough on Beijing.\n\nAsked if China was meddling in the election and worries about the country deploying artificial intelligence to interfere in the vote, Biden said \"there is evidence that meddling is going on.\"\n\n\"I think China would have an interest -- let me put it like this -- would have an interest in meddling,\" he added.\n\nBiden's comments threaten to upset warming ties between the two nations following the face-to-face meeting he held last year with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Even as Biden has ramped up dialogue with Beijing, the two nations have intensified their economic competition, highlighted by sweeping tariffs the US president unveiled on a range of Chinese imports last month.\n\nBiden, who has previously called China's economy a \"ticking time bomb\" delivered another jab.\n\n\"You've got an economy that's on the brink there. The idea that their economy is booming? Give me a break,\" Biden said.\n\nTaiwan has also been a focal point for tensions between Washington and Beijing. Biden has repeatedly said the US would defend the democracy if its attacked, while China has pledged to bring Taiwan under its control eventually, by force if necessary.\n\nAsked if he would place US boots on the ground to defend Taiwan from a Chinese attack, Biden said \"it would depend on the circumstances.\" Biden said he had made it clear to Xi that there had been no change to US policy and that Washington was not seeking independence for Taiwan but that he would also support the island if Beijing sought to unilaterally change its status.\n\n\"Not ruling out using US military force. There's a distinction between deploying on the ground, air power and naval power, etc.,\" Biden said.\n\nRussia's War\n\nBiden also addressed Russia's war in Ukraine, saying the Russian military had been \"freaking decimated\" in the fight. And he predicted that Russian President Vladimir Putin would seek to threaten other nations if he was successful in the war.\n\n\"If we ever let Ukraine go down, mark my words: you'll see Poland go, and you'll see all those nations along the actual border of Russia, from the Balkans and Belarus, all those, they're going to make their own accommodations,\" Biden said.\n\nThe president has made protecting democracy at home -- and abroad -- a centerpiece of his reelection pitch, contrasting his support for Ukraine with Trump who has been skeptical of aiding Kyiv.\n\n\"Name me a world leader other than Orban and Putin who think that Trump should be the world leader in the United States of America,\" he said, referring to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.", "source": {"uri":

Meanwhile, Israel's national security adviser, Tzachi Hanegbi, said last week the war could last through the end of the year.\n\nWhen it came to the question of whether Israel has committed war crimes in Gaza, as International Criminal Court Prosecutor Karim A.A. Khan publicly alleged last month, Biden was more tepid in the Time interview: \"The answer is it's uncertain and has been investigated by the Israelis themselves...But one thing is certain, the people in Gaza, the Palestinians have suffered greatly, for lack of food, water, medicine, etc. And a lot of innocent people have been killed,\" Biden said, adding that \"a lot of it has to do not just with Israelis, but what Hamas is doing in Israel as we speak.\"\n\nAccording to the latest numbers from the Associated Press, the war has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, in addition to the 1,200 Israelis killed on Oct. 7. Officials have described the humanitarian crisis in Gaza as \"absolutely catastrophic.\" Samantha Power, the top US humanitarian official, said in April that famine was likely underway in parts of Gaza, and the situation has only grown more dire following the Israeli seizure of the Rafah border crossings. And recent reports, including one in the Washington Post, have alleged that some radical Israeli settlers have attacked aid trucks bound for Gaza, preventing crucial supplies from getting in.\n\nBut when the Time reporter asked if Biden believed that Israel was intentionally starving civilians, allegations that are included in the I.C.C. applications for arrest warrants, he said: \"No, I don't think that. I think they've engaged in activity that is inappropriate.\"\n\nHe continued, saying that he advised Israeli officials not to \"make the same mistake we did going after [Osama] bin Laden...it led to endless wars.\"\n\n\"Don't make the mistakes we made,\" Biden said. \"And they're making that mistake, I think.\"\n\nIt remains unclear if Israel and Hamas will accept the plan that Biden announced on Friday. Netanyahu's allies have since expressed strong opposition to the proposal; Hamas has signaled a more positive reaction. But while Biden urges the two sides to accept the deal, as my colleague Noah Lanard wrote, there is still a lot Biden could do independently if he was serious about ending the war, including ending the sending of weapons to Israel, increasing aid to Gaza, and ensuring compliance with federal laws that restrict U.S. support for nations restricting American aid and implicated in \"gross violations of human rights.\"", "source": {"uri": "motherjones.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mother Jones"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julianne_mcshane@motherjones.com", "name": "Julianne McShane", "type":

Biden dismissed the International Criminal Court's decision to pursue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant as \"outrageous\" on May 20; the ICC is accusing Israel of war crimes.\n\nIn announcing his truce plan Friday, Biden said Israel has sufficiently depleted Hamas' forces, saying the terrorists are \"no longer capable\" of carrying out another Oct. 7-style attack. Israel said it has killed 15,000 terrorists, about half of Hamas' fighting force.\n\nBiden put forth a plan for the release of the remaining 85 hostages and the bodies of 40 more for an extended cease-fire, again boxing America's ally into a corner; Israeli citizens demanding he take the deal are on one side, and threats from two ministers to leave the government, a move that would cripple the majority in Netanyahu's coalition, on the other.\n\n\"Israel's conditions for ending the war have not changed: the destruction of Hamas' military and governing capabilities, the freeing of all hostages and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel,\" Netanyahu said Saturday.\n\nNetanyahu reportedly will to deliver a joint address to Congress on June 13.

There is every reason for people to draw that conclusion.\"\n\nBiden then referred to the divisive judicial-reform debate that was roiling Israeli society before the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack that started the war.\n\n\"And I would cite tha as -- before the war began, the blowback he was getting from the Israeli military for wanting to change the constitu -- change the court,\" he said. \"And so it's an internal domestic debate that seems to have no consequence. And whether he would change his position or not, it's hard to say, but it has not been helpful.\"\n\nBiden was also asked, if based on the intelligence has has seen, whether Israel has committed war crimes in Gaza, an accusation that Jerusalem sternly rejects.\n\n\"The answer is it's uncertain and has been investigated by the Israelis themselves,\" the president replied. \"The ICC is something that we don't, we don't recognize. But one thing is certain, the people in Gaza, the Palestinians have suffered greatly, for lack of food, water, medicine, etc. And a lot of innocent people have been killed.\"\n\nBiden continued: \"But it is -- and a lot of it has to do not just with Israelis, but what Hamas is doing in Israel as we speak. Hamas is intimidating that population. I went over right after that attack on the Israelis. What they did was -- exceeded anything I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot. Tying mothers and daughters together with rope and pouring kerosene on it and burning them to death. That kind of thing, attempting to intimidate. And it is dastardly.\"\n\nAsked about the condition of the eight U.S. citizens held hostage by Hamas in Gaza, Biden said, \"We believe there are those that are still alive. I met with all the families. But we don't have final proof on exactly who's alive and who's not alive.\"\n\nHe said that freeing the hostages is main reason the White House is pushing for a ceasefire.\n\n\"Both the Israelis desperately want a ceasefire in order to get the hostages home. And it's a way to begin to break the momentum,\" he asserted.\n\nBiden blamed Hamas for the lack of a deal, saying that the terrorist organization \"could end this tomorrow,\" adding: \"The last offer Israel made was very generous in terms of who they'd be willing to release, what they'd give in return, et cetera. Bibi is under enormous pressure on the hostages, on the hostages, and so he's prepared to do about anything to get the hostages back.\"\n\nWhile stopping short of agreeing with those who accuse Israel of intentionally starving the Gaza population, another accusation that Jerusalem flatly rejects, Biden said that \"they've engaged in activity that is inappropriate.\"\n\nHe explained: \"That is ... when I went over immediately after the -- Hamas' brutal attack, I said then, and it became public, I said, don't make the same mistake we did going after bin Laden. Don't try. The idea of occupying Afghanistan, the idea that you had nuclear arsenals in Iran, that were being, I mean, in Iraq, that were being generated, simply not true. And it led to endless wars. They were not true. Don't make the mistakes we made. And they're making that mistake, I think.\"\n\nThe president also said that others share the blame for the failures of Oct. 7, not just Netanyahu.\n\n\"I don't know how any one person has that responsibility. He was the leader of the country, so therefore, it happened. But he wasn't the only one that didn't pick it up. He wasn't the only one that didn't pick it up.\"\n\nBiden said that his major disagreement with Netanyahu is what to do after the Gaza war ends.\n\n\"That's why there's got to be -- my major disagreement with Netanyahu is, what happens after, what happens after Gaza's over? What, what does it go back to? Do Israeli forces go back in? I've been talking to the Egyptians and been talking to the Saudis. I've been talking to the Jordanians, I've been talking to the Emiratis. The answer is, if that's the case, it can't work.\"\n\n\"There needs to be a two-state solution, a transition to a two-state solution.

I've been talking to the Jordanians, I've been talking to the Emiratis. The answer is, if that's the case, it can't work. There needs to be a two-state solution, a transition to a two-state solution. And that's my biggest disagreement with Bibi Netanyahu.\"\n\nWhen asked if Netanyahu was the only one standing in the way of a package of proposals that might aid in transitioning to a two-state solution, Biden said he had to be careful about what he told Time because he acknowledged the magazine article would come out later on, and he was already in the process of negotiating a possible path forward.\n\n\"I think there is a clear path for a transition where the Arab states would provide security and reconstruction in Gaza in return for a longer-term commitment to a transition to a two-state solution,\" Biden said. \"And that extends all the way from Saudi Arabia, who I continue to talk to -- my team -- to the Jordanians that are trying to work bringing in goods and certain goods now, food, medicine, etc. And the Egyptians who I've been talking with frequently about what happens in terms of access for more material to get into Gaza to prevent this catastrophe from continuing.\"\n\nThe interview took place last Tuesday, several days before he announced in remarks at the White House on Friday that Israel had submitted a proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nAn Israeli official, however, told NBC News on Monday that Biden's description of the offer was \"not accurate.\"\n\nBiden's relationship with Netanyahu has grown contentious since Israel entered Gaza following Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7. The president has faced growing opposition from the far left of the Democratic Party over U.S. policy toward Israel in its efforts to help its close ally.\n\nAsked last week by Time if Israeli forces have committed war crimes in Gaza, Biden said. \"The answer is it's uncertain and has been investigated by the Israelis themselves. The ICC is something that we don't, we don't recognize,\" he added, referring to the International Criminal Court, whose chief prosecutor sought arrest warrants last month against Israeli leaders, including Netanyahu, for alleged war crimes. \"But one thing is certain, the people in Gaza, the Palestinians have suffered greatly, for lack of food, water, medicine, etc. And a lot of innocent people have been killed.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Two-state solution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egyptians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arab world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/z0dYbjmI4hdPX15b1WL6mA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/nbc_news_122/2d4491329e16ceb10d336dbb33849a22", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623923", "eventUri": "eng-9623923", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-28", "textStart": 63, "textEnd": 69}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2472, "textEnd": 2478}], "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Gaza's over? What, what does it go back to? Do Israeli forces go back in?\" said the Democrat.\n\n\"The answer is, if that's the case, it can't work.\"\n\n- 'Freaking decimated' -\n\nThe defense of Ukraine against Russia's invasion has been a cornerstone of Biden's foreign policy, and he argued he was better placed than Trump to continue that in a second term.\n\nBiden said the Russian military had been \"freaking decimated\" and added: \"Peace looks like making sure Russia never, never, never, never occupies Ukraine.\"\n\nHe also lashed out at his Republican predecessor, who threatened to tear up longstanding US alliances and reached out to a number of authoritarian leaders while in power.\n\n\"All the bad guys are rooting for Trump, man,\" Biden said.\n\n\"Name me a world leader other than Orban and Putin who think that Trump should be the world leader in the United States of America.\"\n\nAs tensions remain high with China, Biden also reiterated that the United States would stand behind self-ruled Taiwan while saying Washington was not trying to change the status quo.\n\n\"We are not seeking independence for Taiwan nor will we in fact, not defend Taiwan if they if, if China unilaterally tries to change the status,\" Biden said.\n\nWith polls showing US voters are concerned about Biden's age, despite the fact that -- at 77 -- Trump is only four years younger, Biden said he was still the better candidate.\n\n\"I can do it better than anybody you know,\" Biden said when asked if he was fit to serve through a second term that would end when he was 86.\n\ndk/bjt\n\nMore from this

The US president's comments came just before he outlined a proposal for a ceasefire in the region, as Netanyahu grapples with deep political divisions within his country.\n\nWhen asked if he believed Netanyahu was extending the war for his own political gain, Biden responded, \"There is every reason for people to draw that conclusion.\" He also expressed uncertainty about whether Israeli forces had committed war crimes in Gaza, rejecting claims that Israel was using starvation as a warfare tactic, but stating, \"I think they've engaged in activity that is inappropriate.\"\n\nThe Israeli government spokesperson, David Mencer, criticized Biden's remarks about Netanyahu, calling them \"outside the diplomatic norms of every right-thinking country.\" Last month, the International Criminal Court's prosecutor in The Hague requested arrest warrants for Netanyahu, his defense chief, and three Hamas leaders over alleged war crimes.\n\nIsrael launched an offensive in Gaza last October, vowing to destroy the Palestinian Islamist militant group Hamas after it attacked inside Israel, resulting in the deaths of around 1,200 people and the capture of more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. The Israeli assault has claimed the lives of over 36,000 people in Gaza, as reported by local health authorities, who also state that thousands more bodies remain buried under rubble.\n\nDespite most Israelis supporting the war, opinion polls indicate that they hold Netanyahu responsible for the security failures during the Hamas attack on Israeli communities near Gaza on October 7. The polls also suggest that if an election were held, Netanyahu would be voted out of office. Weekly mass street protests, attended by tens of thousands, have become commonplace, with demonstrators demanding that the government do more to bring home the hostages seized by Hamas and calling for Netanyahu's resignation.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Most political observers say Netanyahu would lose elections if they were held now, and would be forced into opposition, facing court hearings on corruption charges. But elections have been put off until the war is over, or at least until major military operations are deemed to have been completed.\n\nTime asked Biden whether he believed Netanyahu was \"prolonging the war for his own political self-preservation\".\n\n\"I'm not going to comment on that,\" the president said in response, but added: \"There is every reason for people to draw that conclusion.\"\n\nHe went to discuss some of the internal political problems Netanyahu was facing before the war.\n\nAsked if he wanted to clarify Biden's response, the US national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, said: \"I think the president was very clear in his answer on that, and we'll let the prime minister speak to his own politics. The president was referencing what many critics have said.\"\n\nIn response, the Israeli government spokesperson, David Mencer, said Biden's remarks about Netanyahu and Israeli politics were \"outside the diplomatic norms of every right-thinking country\".\n\nOver the course of a wide-ranging interview, Biden was also asked about the allegations, under investigation by the international criminal court (ICC) and the international court of justice (ICJ), that Israel is committing war crimes in Gaza. The president gave an ambivalent response\n\n\"The answer is it's uncertain and has been investigated by the Israelis themselves,\" he said. \"The ICC is something that we don't recognise. But one thing is certain: the people in Gaza, the Palestinians, have suffered greatly, for lack of food, water, medicine, etc. And a lot of innocent people have been killed.\"\n\nBiden pointed out that Hamas also held responsibility for the bloodshed in Israel and Gaza.\n\nAsked specifically if Israel was using \"starvation of civilians as a method of warfare\", a charge being pursued by the ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan.\n\n\"No, I don't think that,\" Biden said.

Biden warned Netanyahu against entering the city, from which more than 1 million civilians fled before Israel launched a series of airstrikes.\n\nBiden also told the prime minister in April his ability to implement specific steps toward reducing civilian deaths would influence U.S. policy toward Israel. Last month, the Biden administration said it would not send any weapons Netanyahu could use in an attack in Rafah, although analyses by several news outlets concluded shrapnel from U.S.-made bombs was at the scene of the explosions.\n\nREAD MORE | Biden caught on hot mic saying Netanyahu needs 'come to Jesus' meeting\n\nIn February, Biden argued civilian deaths resulting from Israel's attacks would cause it to lose international support.\n\n\"There are too many innocent people that are being killed,\" the president told Seth Myers during a late night show appearance. \"Israel has had the overwhelming support of the vast majority of nations. If it keeps this up with this incredibly conservative government they have ... they're going to lose support from around the world, and that is not in Israel's interest.\"\n\nLess than a month later, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution demanding a ceasefire and condemning all violence against civilians while expressing concerning for the humanitarian situation in Gaza.

In an interview with Time Magazine, Joe Biden addressed a number of issues, although just how much Biden addressed them may be up for some debate. Biden insists that he is one of Israel's greatest friends, and at least in the days after October 7, Biden appeared to have determination to act like a friend.\n\nThese days, however, Biden's party has fractured on the war that Hamas started with those brutal massacres, rapes, and kidnappings. So Biden is tossing his \"friends\" under the bus today by quasi-accusing them of \"war crimes,\" and quasi-accusing Netanyahu of prolonging the war to keep his grasp on power:\n\nAsked if Israeli forces have committed war crimes in Gaza, Biden says, \"It's uncertain.\" From the start, the Administration knew Israel was pushing the limits of legal warfare, the Washington Post and others have reported. The conflict is driving a wedge between the U.S. and its allies. On May 31, Biden laid out a phased cease-fire plan that would end the war and secure the release of hostages. He has continued to pursue the complicated regional deal with Saudi Arabia. Some close to Biden say the only holdout to the broader pact is Netanyahu. The President declines to say as much, but when asked by TIME if Netanyahu is prolonging the war for his own political reasons, Biden admits, \"There is every reason for people to draw that conclusion.\"\n\nHugh Hewitt is aghast:\n\nIt's not a faceplant. Biden has hinted at both points for weeks now, hoping to box Netanyahu into a political position where he would have to accept Biden administration demands to end the war so that Biden can save ... Michigan. The irony and hypocrisy of accusing Netanyahu of calculating policy on the basis of keeping his office is breathtaking, but it is no mistake.\n\nIn fairness, Biden did mention Hamas' war crimes, although Time didn't see fit to include it in its report. Readers have to find the transcript to find Biden's full answer to the \"war crimes\" question, which still is pretty bad:\n\nMore broadly, from the intelligence in the evidence you've seen, either currently or in the last months, have Israeli forces committed war crimes in Gaza?\n\nBiden: The answer is it's uncertain and has been investigated by the Israelis themselves. The ICC is something that we don't, we don't recognize. But one thing is certain, the people in Gaza, the Palestinians have suffered greatly, for lack of food, water, medicine, etc. And a lot of innocent people have been killed. But it is -- and a lot of it has to do not just with Israelis, but what Hamas is doing in Israel as we speak. Hamas is intimidating that population. I went over right after that attack on the Israelis. What they did was -- exceeded anything I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot. Tying mothers and daughters together with rope and pouring kerosene on it and burning them to death. That kind of thing, attempting to intimidate. And it is dastardly.\n\nWell, Hamas is doing a lot more than \"intimidating\" the Israelis, and for that matter, more than \"intimidating\" Gazans. Gazans elected Hamas to run that enclave in 2006 and have given it tremendous support, especially in the immediate aftermath of October 7. Gazans wanted the destruction of Israel and cheered the war, right up to the time it arrived on their doorsteps. Now they're complaining about \"collective punishment,\" a term that thankfully does not come up in the transcript, when in reality they are experiencing the consequences of waging war on one's neighbor.\n\nAnd that is what is so infuriating about Biden's \"war crimes\" accusation. This is war, not a 'punishment,' and it's a war that Hamas and the Gazans have waged for the last two decades. They routinely attack Israel, even during so-called cease-fires; they have rained rocket and missile fire on Israel on a near-constant basis for the last eighteen years, aimed indiscriminately at civilian populations. Not one time has Biden or the media held Hamas and the Gazans to the standard being applied to the Israelis in a war the Gazans started, even when Biden keeps insisting that the Gazans and Palestinians deserve statehood.\n\nAnd Israel does do all it can to limit civilian casualties. The IDF takes discipline seriously and punishes those who violate it, even mistakenly. Israel might expect its enemies to ignore this and validate Hamas' human-shield strategies (war crimes themselves) to slander Israel. With \"friends\" like Biden, though, who needs enemies?\n\nFinally, the Time interview report is a masterpiece of framing. Time offers an avalanche of exposition and self-provided context, but includes relatively little of Biden's own answers. No one expected a full Q&A format from Time in a rare-these-days Biden interview, but the passage on Israel is emblematic of the narrative enforcement Time creates in this fashion. The five paragraphs (including the one in the first excerpt) comprised 650 words.\n\nCare to guess how many words in this passage are direct quotes from Biden on this topic? Forty-one. The \"interview\" report with Biden on Middle East policy is 93.7% Time's narrative. It's very strange to slog through forests of exposition to find the rare direct quote of a president in a presidential interview. The entire report reads the same way; it's as if Biden himself was an accessory to Time's narrative building. Or, alternately, it's as though Time is trying to create a Biden that can sell on the campaign trail nearly out of whole cloth, a Biden that doesn't actually exist and who can't sell the reality of Biden to voters.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ed_morrissey@hotair.com", "name": "Ed Morrissey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Hewitt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Hewitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collective punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclave_and_exclave", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enclave and exclave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State (polity)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/US_Civil_War", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/US Civil War", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2023/291/13aa24eb-d2e9-44b0-a30c-bda7732ea128.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623923", "eventUri": "eng-9623923", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 333, "textEnd": 342, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-31", "textStart": 1001, "textEnd": 1007}], "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

When Biden on Friday unveiled that the US is fully backing the latest Gaza ceasefire deal on the table, the US president characterized it as an Israeli proposal.\n\nBut the Israeli prime minister quickly distance himself from it, calling it \"incomplete\". Israeli officials have also rejected as \"inaccurate\" that it was ever an Israeli-proposed deal to begin with. This in turn led reporters to question the Biden administration on the apparent contradiction, and White House spokesman John Kirby pushed back and told a press briefing, \"this is an Israeli proposal and the president characterized it accurately.\"\n\nA senior Hamas official has meanwhile insisted that \"it is not Hamas hampering the deal.\" Abu Zuhri said that it is the Israeli side that is not serious about the deal, and that it is stalling and maneuvering under Washington cover \"despite the White House knowing that the problem lies with [Israel].\"\n\nSummarizing where things stand in this awkward back-and-forth, one geopolitical commentator, Ryan Cristian, told Russian media that \"It's clear that there was an agreement on this for Israel and the US before it was submitted to Hamas, just like last time.\"\n\n\"We don't know for sure whether this was Israel bluffing and using the US to be the deliverer of that bluff and then just when Hamas accepted and called their bluff, that's when they pulled back because, well, they don't want this war to end,\" Cristian continued. \"I believe that in every possible sense.\"\n\nAll of this has led the White House to lose patience, with aides perhaps sensing that it's ultimately Biden left with egg on his face following Netanyahu's coldness toward what was billed as an \"Israeli proposal\" (well, Bibi is still said to be 'open' we are told).\n\nPresident Biden has hit back at Netanyahu personally in a newly published Time magazine interview, asserting that that people have \"every reason\" to believe that PM Netanyahu is dragging out the war in Gaza for his own political survival.\n\n\"There is every reason for people to draw that conclusion,\" Biden told the publication. Below is the full section from the interview:\n\nAsked if Israeli forces have committed war crimes in Gaza, Biden says, \"It's uncertain.\" From the start, the Administration knew Israel was pushing the limits of legal warfare, the Washington Post and others have reported.

The President declines to say as much, but when asked by TIME if Netanyahu is prolonging the war for his own political reasons, Biden admits, \"There is every reason for people to draw that conclusion.\"\n\nAlready this fresh accusation has hit the front pages of Israeli newspapers. One question that remains is what Biden plans to do about it. Will he bring real pressure to bear on Netanyahu or will this just stop at negative words? Here is how the Associated Press encapsulated the dilemma:\n\nPresident Joe Biden is looking past resistance from key Israeli officials as he presses Israel and Hamas to agree to a three-phase agreement that could immediately bring home dozens of Israeli hostages, free Palestinian prisoners and perhaps even lead to an endgame in the nearly eight-month-old Gaza war.\n\nBiden's big swing -- during a tough reelection battle -- could also demonstrate to a significant slice of his political base demoralized by his handling of the conflict that he's doing his part to end the war that has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians and left hundreds of thousands struggling to meet basic needs.\n\nThe fact that Washington and Tel Aviv can't get on the same page continues to be on full display in awkward admin press briefings, leading some to point out that someone must be lying...\n\nThe White House is without doubt realizing that the Gaza crisis and Biden's inability to exert real

But Biden appeared to suggest that a common view of Netanyahu -- that he wants the war to drag on to ensure his political survival -- wasn't unfounded. \"I'm not going to comment on that. There is every reason for people to draw that conclusion,\" he said.\n\nBiden said he and Netanyahu disagree on what will happen with Gaza after the war. \"There needs to be a two-state solution, a transition to a two-state solution. And that's my biggest disagreement with Bibi Netanyahu,\" he said.\n\nBiden also said he doesn't believe that Israel is using starvation as a weapon of war, as suggested by the International Criminal Court, which is seeking arrest warrants for Netanyahu alongside other top officials of Israel and Hamas. Biden did say he thinks some of Israel's actions are \"inappropriate.\" He compared the situation to America's extended occupation of Afghanistan, advising Israel to learn from thatexample. \"Don't make the mistakes we made. And they're making that mistake, I think,\" he said.\n\nTime attempted to get Biden on the record about what his administration would do if China were to follow through on its threats to invade Taiwan. When asked how U.S. forces might be used in such a situation, the president said, \"It would depend on the circumstances.\"\n\nThe magazine followed up, pressing Biden on whether he would deploy troops in such a situation. \"Not ruling out using US military force. There's a distinction between deploying on the ground, air power and naval power, etc,\" Biden responded.\n\nBiden was then asked if that would entail firing from bases in Japan or in the Philippines, but he declined to go into further specifics. \"I can't get into that. You would then criticize me with good reason if I were to tell you,\" he said.\n\nThe conversation then turned to one of Biden's biggest weaknesses: his age. The president, who turned 81 in November, would be 86 by the end of a potential second term. (Trump turns 78 later this month.) Biden said he hadn't considered not running for a second term, and expressed his confidence that he can do the job in a rather aggressive way. \"I can do it better than anybody you know. You're looking at me, I can take you too,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked what he would tell American voters who are concerned about his age, Biden said, \"Watch me. Look, name me a president that's gotten as much done as I've gotten done in my first three and a half years.\"\n\nBiden relayed a familiar anecdote about attending the 2021 G7 meeting in England where he told the assembled leaders that \"America's back\" only for French President Emmanuel Macron to quip, \"For how long?\" He said the world's leaders have expressed concerns to him about the possibility of Trump winning in 2024.\n\n\"There's not a major international meeting I attend that before it's over -- and I've attended many, more than most presidents have in three and a half years -- that a world leader doesn't pull me aside as I'm leaving and say, 'He can't win. You can't let him win,'\" Biden said.\n\nHe continued, \"My democracy and their democracy is at stake. My democracy is at stake. And so name me a world leader other than Orban and Putin who think that Trump should be the world leader in the United States of America.\"", "source": {"uri": "nymag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NYMag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nia_prater@nymag.com", "name": "Nia Prater", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Two-state solution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Orb\u00e1n", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Orb\u00e1n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/e59/466/6ee7d732bb381621db0cf9def54ced5f42-biden-interview.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623923", "eventUri": "eng-9623923", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

(The White House/Wikimedia Commons)\n\nPresident Joe Biden said there was reason for people to conclude Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is prolonging the war in Gaza due to his own political considerations and would not rule out deploying US troops for the defense of Taiwan in an interview published Tuesday with Time Magazine.\n\nThe rare sit down between the president and a print outlet came weeks after former President Donald Trump - Biden's general-election opponent - outlined his own second term vision in the newsweekly. That interview, in which Trump suggested state governments could monitor Americans' pregnancies and vowed mass deportations, quickly became a flashpoint on the campaign trail.\n\nBiden's interview sheds light on his first term in office as well as some of the challenges he faces in a potential second term if he wins what polls show is a close race with Trump.\n\nAsked if Netanyahu's political considerations were driving the war, Biden said \"there is every reason for people to draw that conclusion,\" citing the domestic \"blowback\" the prime minister received ahead of the Israel-Hamas conflict by pushing to change Israel's constitution, moves critics said would weaken democracy in the country.\n\n\"Whether he would change his position or not, it's hard to say, but it has not been helpful,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden has sought to ramp up pressure on both Israel and Hamas to agree to a three-phase Gaza peace plan that would end the fighting and secure the release of hostages captured by Hamas, which is designated a terrorist group, during its Oct. 7 raid on Israel.\n\nNetanyahu though faces pressure from far-right parties in his electoral coalition to continue the war until Hamas is rooted out from the Gaza Strip and the hostages are freed, complicating Biden's efforts. The war has posed a political risk to Biden, with key parts of his coalition, including progressives and younger voters, frustrated by his support for Israel.\n\nIn the interview Biden acknowledged that Netanyahu is \"under enormous pressure on the hostages,\" adding that the Israeli leader is \"prepared to do about anything to get the hostages back.\"\n\nStill Biden said a negotiated cease-fire was the best way to secure their release. \"Both the Israelis desperately want a cease fire in order to get the hostages home. And it's a way to begin to break the momentum,\" he said.\n\nBiden said Israel was investigating if its forces had committed war crimes, but added he did not believe the country had used starvation of civilians in Gaza as a war tactic.\n\nChina Economy\n\nThe president also addressed US-ties with China, ahead of an election in which relations between the world's two largest economies will have a central focus and both candidates have sought to cast themselves as tough on Beijing.\n\nAsked if China was meddling in the election and worries about the country deploying artificial intelligence to interfere in the vote, Biden said \"there is evidence that meddling is going on.\"\n\n\"I think China would have an interest - let me put it like this - would have an interest in meddling,\" he added.\n\nBiden's comments threaten to upset warming ties between the two nations following the face-to-face meeting he held last year with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Even as Biden has ramped up dialogue with Beijing, the two nations have intensified their economic competition, highlighted by sweeping tariffs the US president unveiled on a range of Chinese imports last month.\n\nBiden, who has previously called China's economy a \"ticking time bomb\" delivered another jab.\n\n\"You've got an economy that's on the brink there. The idea that their economy is booming? Give me a break,\" Biden said.\n\nTaiwan has also been a focal point for tensions between Washington and Beijing. Biden has repeatedly said the US would defend the democracy if its attacked, while China has pledged to bring Taiwan under its control eventually, by force if necessary.\n\nAsked if he would place US boots on the ground to defend Taiwan from a Chinese attack, Biden said \"it would depend on the circumstances.\" Biden said he had made it clear to Xi that there had been no change to US policy and that Washington was not seeking independence for Taiwan but that he would also support the island if Beijing sought to unilaterally change its status.\n\n\"Not ruling out using US military force. There's a distinction between deploying on the ground, air power and naval power, etc.,\" Biden said.\n\nRussia's War\n\nBiden also addressed Russia's war in Ukraine, saying the Russian military had been \"freaking decimated\" in the fight. And he predicted that Russian President Vladimir Putin would seek to threaten other nations if he was successful in the war.\n\n\"If we ever let Ukraine go down, mark my words: you'll see Poland go, and you'll see all those nations along the actual border of Russia, from the Balkans and Belarus, all those, they're going to make their own accommodations,\" Biden said.\n\nThe president has made protecting democracy at home - and abroad - a centerpiece of his reelection pitch, contrasting his support for Ukraine with Trump who has been skeptical of aiding Kyiv.\n\n\"Name me a world leader other than Orban and Putin who think that Trump should be the world leader in the United States of America,\" he said, referring to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.", "source": {"uri":

There is every reason for people to draw that conclusion,\" Biden said, adding that before the war, Netanyahu was facing blowback for wanting an overhaul of the nation's judicial system. \"So it's an internal domestic debate that seems to have no consequence. And whether he would change his position or not, it's hard to say, but it has not been helpful.\"\n\nBiden explained that his major disagreement with the Israeli prime minister is over Gaza's future after the war ends. \"What happens after Gaza's over? What, what does it go back to? Do Israeli forces go back in?\" he asked. \"I've been talking to the Egyptians and been talking to the Saudis. I've been talking to the Jordanians, I've been talking to the Emiratis. The answer is, if that's the case, it can't work. There needs to be a two-state solution, a transition to a two-state solution. And that's my biggest disagreement with Bibi Netanyahu.\"\n\nRead more: https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-netanyahu-israel-hamas-war-rcna155386", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-state_solution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Two-state solution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/US_Civil_War", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/US Civil War", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623923", "eventUri": "eng-9623923", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-28", "textStart": 337, "textEnd": 343}], "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

It is also very clear that the scheme pushed by the Biden administration to take Arab-Israeli normalisation to a new level, with normalisation between Israel and Saudi Arabia, has been stopped in its tracks.\n\nWhile the Biden administration had no plan to be so deeply involved in Middle East politics, with its Pivot-to-Asia orientation, it ended up sending the US secretary of state and the CIA chief to the region for over six times each to try to find a solution to the problem -- and it's clear that failure to achieve that aim is due to the intransigence of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who has pushed the war so far that the ICJ and the ICC to both condemn Israel for crimes against humanity and war crimes.\n\nSome US senators still found it appropriate to invite Netanyahu to address Congress to explain his case for the war on Israel nonetheless. This is obviously showing the complex nature of the political background against which the Biden administration is acting. This invitation is in itself a vote of support for Netanyahu.\n\nHowever, if the Biden administration cannot gather the necessary political strength to force Israel to end this war sooner rather than later, the consequences will simply be too damaging. Irrespective of the electoral chances of Biden himself in the probably tough presidential race scheduled for the autumn, this war has created a visible sense of anger across the region at the failure of the US to conceal its shocking bias to Israel which was repeatedly demonstrated in its UNSC use of the veto against resolutions aimed at ending the war.\n\nIsrael, the US' strongest ally in the region, is also subject to growing anger -- almost unprecedented since the end of the Arab-Israeli wars of the 1970s. Arab capitals that have been invested in integrating Israel into the region have been forced to suspend most scheduled schemes for cooperation.\n\nEven if the war was to end tomorrow, the layers of anger and dismay that have been sweeping Arab and Muslim majority countries, especially among the younger generations, will take years to dissipate. There is no telling how this anger will metamorphose, especially if this war continues much longer.\n\nIt is clearly no easy task for Biden to do what it takes to end the war, but he has no choice except acting firmly and promptly. Nobody is assuming that he is trying to stop the war for the sake of innocent Palestinians but he knows that their ongoing killing is not serving his interests or those of his close allies.", "source": {"uri": "english.ahram.org.eg", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0645"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ahram", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Al-Ahram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_citizens_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arab citizens of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crimes against humanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central Intelligence Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab\u2013Israeli_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arab\u2013Israeli conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslim world"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/US_Civil_War", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/US Civil War", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623923", "eventUri": "eng-9623923", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

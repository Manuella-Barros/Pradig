Just as the Earth is a mere speck in the universe, however, Challenger said this is still a small sum. \"Compared to the amount of wages being paid to an employee over a course of a year, it is very small,\" Challenger said. \"It's not going to show up in any type of macroeconomic data.\" It also pales when compared with the myriad other distractions in the modern workplace, such as the U.S. college basketball championship known as March Madness, the recent U.S. shopping phenomenon called Cyber Monday and the Monday after the Super Bowl. During the opening week of March Madness, the firm estimated employers experienced $615 million per hour in lost productivity as people watched games and highlights, set up pool brackets and avidly tracked their standings rather than performed actual work. The Monday after the Super Bowl, meanwhile, resulted in an estimated $290 million in lost output for every 10 minutes of the workday spent by workers discussing the game or watching game highlights and re-runs of their favorite Super Bowl commercials. And Cyber Monday on the heels of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday at the start of the annual holiday shopping season resulted in $450 million in lost productivity for every 14 minutes spent shopping, not working. Events like this are likely to have an outsized effect on smaller companies, Challenger said. When their workers are absent, small firms may not have sufficient coverage from coworkers, especially in the current tight labor market where it is hard to find skilled workers. \"When three or four people are missing from an office of 15, it's a lot more disruptive,\" Challenger said. EVENT AMOUNT IN LOST PRODUCTIVITY Total Eclipse $694 million for the 20 minutes it takes to go outside and watch the eclipse Cyber Monday $450 million for every 14 minutes spent shopping March Madness $615 million for each hour spent on March Madness activities Super Bowl $290 million for every 10 minutes lost discussing the game Fantasy Football $990 million for each hour of work time spent on Fantasy Football (Reporting by Kimberly Chin;

Many people may take even longer to set up their telescopes or special viewing glasses, or simply take off for the day.\n\n(For a graphic of solar eclipse in 2017 click here)\n\n\"There's very few people who are not going to walk outside when there's a celestial wonder happening above their heads to go out and view it,\" Challenger said, estimating that 87 million employees will be at work during the eclipse.\n\nTo get the overall figure of nearly $700 million, Challenger multiplied that by the Bureau of Labor Statistics' latest estimate for average hourly wages for all workers 16 and over. Just as the Earth is a mere speck in the universe, however, Challenger said this is still a small sum.\n\n\"Compared to the amount of wages being paid to an employee over a course of a year, it is very small,\" Challenger said. \"It's not going to show up in any type of macroeconomic data.\"\n\nIt also pales when compared with the myriad other distractions in the modern workplace, such as the U.S. college basketball championship known as March Madness, the recent U.S. shopping phenomenon called Cyber Monday and the Monday after the Super Bowl.\n\nDuring the opening week of March Madness, the firm estimated employers experienced $615 million per hour in lost productivity as people watched games and highlights, set up pool brackets and avidly tracked their standings rather than performed actual work.\n\nThe Monday after the Super Bowl, meanwhile, resulted in an estimated $290 million in lost output for every 10 minutes of the workday spent by workers discussing the game or watching game highlights and re-runs of their favorite Super Bowl commercials.\n\nAnd Cyber Monday on the heels of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday at the start of the annual holiday shopping season resulted in $450 million in lost productivity for every 14 minutes spent shopping, not working.\n\nEvents like this are likely to have an outsized effect on smaller companies, Challenger said. When their workers are absent, small firms may not have sufficient coverage from coworkers, especially in the current tight labor market where it is hard to find skilled workers.\n\n\"When three or four people are missing from an office of 15, it's a lot more disruptive,\" Challenger said.\n\nFantasy Football $990 million for each hour of work time", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri":

Many people may take even longer to set up their telescopes or special viewing glasses, or simply take off for the day.\n\n(For a graphic of solar eclipse in 2017 click http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/SOLAR-ECLIPSE/010050FD109/solar-eclipse.jpg)\n\n\"There's very few people who are not going to walk outside when there's a celestial wonder happening above their heads to go out and view it,\" Challenger said, estimating that 87 million employees will be at work during the eclipse.\n\nTo get the overall figure of nearly $700 million, Challenger multiplied that by the Bureau of Labor Statistics' latest estimate for average hourly wages for all workers 16 and over. Just as the Earth is a mere speck in the universe, however, Challenger said this is still a small sum.\n\n\"Compared to the amount of wages being paid to an employee over a course of a year, it is very small,\" Challenger said. \"It's not going to show up in any type of macroeconomic data.\"\n\nIt also pales when compared with the myriad other distractions in the modern workplace, such as the U.S. college basketball championship known as March Madness, the recent U.S. shopping phenomenon called Cyber Monday and the Monday after the Super Bowl.\n\nDuring the opening week of March Madness, the firm estimated employers experienced $615 million per hour in lost productivity as people watched games and highlights, set up pool brackets and avidly tracked their standings rather than performed actual work.\n\nThe Monday after the Super Bowl, meanwhile, resulted in an estimated $290 million in lost output for every 10 minutes of the workday spent by workers discussing the game or watching game highlights and re-runs of their favorite Super Bowl commercials.\n\nAnd Cyber Monday on the heels of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday at the start of the annual holiday shopping season resulted in $450 million in lost productivity for every 14 minutes spent shopping, not working.\n\nEvents like this are likely to have an outsized effect on smaller companies, Challenger said. When their workers are absent, small firms may not have sufficient coverage from coworkers, especially in the current tight labor market where it is hard to find skilled workers.\n\n\"When three or four people are missing from an office of 15, it's a lot more disruptive,\" Challenger said.\n\nEVENT AMOUNT IN LOST PRODUCTIVITY\n\nTotal Eclipse $694 million for the 20 minutes it\n\ntakes to go outside and watch the\n\neclipse\n\nCyber Monday $450 million for every 14 minutes spent\n\nshopping\n\nMarch Madness $615 million for each hour spent on\n\nMarch Madness activities\n\nSuper Bowl $290 million for every 10 minutes lost\n\ndiscussing the game\n\nFantasy Football $990 million for each hour of work time\n\nspent on Fantasy Football\n\n(Reporting by Kimberly Chin;

Using information from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the firm predicts that roughly 87 million workers (out of over 123 million in the U.S) will be at work come eclipse time. It goes on to project that employees will need about 20 minutes to find a viewing spot and watch the show unfold.\n\nFor these workers, the average hourly wage works out to $23.86 an hour -- which means by fritting away 20 minutes, each viewer costs his or her employers $7.95. Multiply that by 87 million and voila: $694 million in lost productivity.\n\nWhile these projections admittedly make a lot of assumptions, it's safe to assume workers will be distracted come Monday morning.\n\nFor its part, Challenger Gray & Christmas is not recommending that employers \" board their windows and keep employees locked up in conference room meetings until the eclipse ends,\"Andrew Challenger, Vice President of Challenger, Gray & Christmas said in a statement. (Phew). \"Rather, looking for how to turn this lack of productivity into a way to increase morale and strengthen the team is a much better use of the eclipse... It offers a great opportunity to boost morale. Employers could offer lunch to their staff, give instructions on how to make viewing devices, and watch together as a team.\"\n\nIf you do happen to work at a company going the \"board up the windows\" route, despair not.

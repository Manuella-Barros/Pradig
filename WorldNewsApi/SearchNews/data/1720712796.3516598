Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, along with Deputy Chief Ministers Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar will drive through the road to mark the formal inauguration, following which vehicular movement will be allowed from Tuesday. Similar to the south-bound arm, which was opened for vehicular movement on March this year, the northern arm of the coastal road will be operational only between 7 am and 11 pm on week days. At present, the south-bound arm is catering to vehicles travelling between Worli and Marine Drive. However, the north-bound arm will be operational only between Marine Drive and the vehicular interchange at Haji Ali. Civic officials said that the operational length of north-bound arm will be around 6.25 kilometres, while the south-bound arm is operational on an eight-kilometre stretch. Civic officials said that of the eight interchanges in Haji Ali, four arms will become operational after the south-bound movement begins, and of the four arms in Amarson\u2019s interchange, two will become operational from Monday. \u201cThe remaining arms will become operational in a phased manner, one by one. The entire coastal road extending upto the Bandra Worli Sea Link (BWSL) will be operational by October this year and by then, all the arms of the vehicular interchanges are expected to become operational,\u201d said an official. \u201cAt present, 90 per cent of the civil work is completed, the remaining 10 per cent will be carried out during night time and on weekends when the road will be shut. Simultaneously, the landscaping works will also be taken up in the open spaces earmarked on the road,\u201d the official said. In the final step, the coastal road will be linked with the BWSL with a bow-string bridge.

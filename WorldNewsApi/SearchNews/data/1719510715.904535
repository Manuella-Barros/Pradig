He said Moose Wala\u2019s legacy has only grown since he was shot dead in an ambush in India on May 29, 2022. He was 28. Fans worldwide are expected to remember and honour Moose Wala \u2013 for his music and politics \u2014 on the second anniversary of his death on Wednesday. \u201cAt first, he was India\u2019s response to one of the most dominant musical forms \u2014 hip hop \u2014 and it was something very new. He was raw. He was authentic,\u201d Karman said. \u201cAfter his death, he and his music are considered revolutionary among the Punjabi youth because people all over the world, and those not from the Punjabi community, are now singing his songs. They are learning about Punjabi culture.\u201d Calgarian Preet Sidhu said the music helps her family stay connected to their heritage. \u201c(Moose Wala) raps about spirituality. He was advocating for respecting your parents and elders, hard work, courage, having a turban on and for speaking up for the things that matter,\u201d said the 36-year-old mother of two boys. \u201cHe was bigger than just music. \u201cHe was a way of being.\u201d Moose Wala, born Shubhdeep Singh Sidhu, first garnered recognition when he released his song \u201cSo High\u201d in 2017 as a 24-year-old international student in Brampton, Ont. His appeal grew not only in Canada but also in the United Kingdom, with its large Punjabi diaspora. In 2018, his debut album made it to the Billboard Canadian Albums chart. He eventually charted 13 songs on the Canadian Hot 100, some of them after his death. Moose Wala\u2019s popularity paved a path for a new generation of Punjabi artists in Canada, fusing traditional Punjabi folk tunes and the language with hip-hop and trap beats, including AP Dhillon. Dhillon made history at last year\u2019s Juno Awards with its first Punjabi musical performance. On May 29, 2022, Moose Wala was shot while driving his car in northern India\u2019s Punjab state. His car was cut off by two other vehicles, and he was killed in a hail of bullets. Indian police blamed the killing on an inter-gang rivalry. A day earlier, media reported the Punjab government was ending security for more than 400 people, including Moose Wala, in a bid to clamp down on VIP culture. A year earlier, Moose Wala had jumped into politics. He joined India\u2019s Congress Party and unsuccessfully ran in the state\u2019s assembly elections, courting controversy along the way. \u201cHe was criticized in the beginning for promoting gun violence,\u201d Karman said. \u201cThen he evolved. He began bringing in the history of Punjab into his music, the core issues affecting Punjab.\u201d Karman said Moose Wala fought for farmers\u2019 rights and denounced how they were forced to sell crops to the government at a regulated price. \u201cHis critique of the government struck a chord with everyone,\u201d Karman said. That\u2019s also why some supporters argue his death may be politically motivated, Karman added. Rishi Nagar, who hosts a daily Punjabi radio show in Calgary, said fans still want justice for Moose Wala, but Wednesday will be about remembering him mainly as an artist. \u201cMost of our music programs will be dedicated to his memories,\u201d he said. \u201cFans are also holding a candlelight vigil at a local park. He has touched the pulse of the youth. He energized them. \u201cPeople love his songs.\u201d This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 26, 2024. \u2014 With files from David Friend in Toronto and The Associated Press Fakiha Baig, The Canadian Press", "summary": "Shub Karman was out for a recent walk in Calgary, when he passed a car full of kids singing along to the music of his favourite Punjabi rapper. &#8220;The car was buzzing, the bass was on and there were all sorts of people sitting inside who were jamming to Sidhu Moose Wala,&#8221; said Karman, a [&#8230;]", "url": "https://toronto.citynews.ca/2024/05/26/bigger-than-just-music-canadians-remember-punjabi-rapper-two-years-after-killing/", "image": "https://toronto.citynews.ca/wp-content/blogs.dir/sites/10/2024/05/0edfea05-735b-4a7a-a3af-4411e91da6a3.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:00:10", "author": "News Staff", "authors": ["News Staff"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": 0.21}

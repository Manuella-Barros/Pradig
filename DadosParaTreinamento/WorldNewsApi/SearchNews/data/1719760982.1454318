{"id": 225036596, "title": "People on New or Basic State Pension can change current monthly pay period to every week", "text": "People on the New State Pension will receive up to \u00a3221.20 each week during the 2024/25 financial year, however, many people may be unaware that by default payments are made every four weeks - equivalent to some \u00a3884.80. Similarly, someone on the Basic State Pension can get up to \u00a3169.50 per week - \u00a3678 every four-week pay period. The latest statistics from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) show the State Pension currently provides regular financial support for nearly 12.7 million older people across the country, including over one million retirees living in Scotland. But, many of them may not be aware they can increase the frequency of their State Pension payments from every four weeks to weekly. A former employee with 42 years experience working for the DWP has shared the simple way to make the change, whether you are due to retire and claim the State Pension, or are already in receipt of New or Basic payments. The main thing to be aware of is that the frequency can only be changed if the payments have already been set up to be made into a bank account. People already on the New or Basic State Pension The ex-employee told the Daily Record: \u201cIf you have already made a claim for State Pension and are in receipt of four-weekly payments, and you want weekly payments, then phone the DWP change of circumstances (Pension Service) telephone number on 0800 731 0469, and request weekly payments. \u201cAlternatively write to The Pension Service, Post Handling Site A, Wolverhampton WV98 1AF, with your name address and National Insurance number and ask to be changed to weekly payment for your State Pension.\u201d People about to claim the New State Pension The former DWP worker explained: \u201cIf you are yet to claim your State Pension, put in the information box on the State Pension claim form \u2018Please pay my pension weekly\u2019.\u201d The DWP insider also said the four-weekly pay frequency may make it difficult to budget for household bills as it\u2019s not paid monthly, especially if someone has been used to being paid their salary at the end of each month. They said: \u201cFrom your \u2018budget point of view\u2019 it may be easier to be paid weekly then you know exactly how much State Pension has been paid into your account each month. \u201cFor some members of the public who are used to being paid their wages weekly, claiming a State Pension which is paid every four weeks, can cause problems financially and make it difficult for them to budget.\u201d The ex-DWP employee isn\u2019t alone in raising awareness about the payment options. Back in 2021, BBC Radio 4 Money Box presenter and financial journalist Paul Lewis, highlighted the weekly payment option in the Radio Times. He explained: \u201cThree quarters of all pensioners are paid four weeks in arrears, but a State Pension can also be paid weekly. \u201cThe Government hides this option when people apply, as the application form simply says \u2018State Pension is usually paid every four weeks\u2019.\u201d New State Pension payment rates 2024/25 Full payment rate: \u00a3221.20 Every four-week pay period: \u00a3884.80 Basic State Pension payment rates 2024/25 Category A or B Basic State Pension (full rate): \u00a3169.50 Every four-week pay period: \u00a3678.00 Category B (lower) Basic State Pension - spouse or civil partner's insurance: \u00a3101.55 Category C or D - non-contributory: \u00a3101.55", "summary": "A former DWP employee shares how the frequency of State Pension payments can easily be changed to weekly.", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/money/change-state-pension-pay-frequency-32917136", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article32917339.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/8_Cash-payment-in-the-UK.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:41:09", "author": "Linda Howard", "authors": ["Linda Howard"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.211}

What does it mean?", "text": "According to the internet, Dutch Bros workers are secretly letting customers know that they\u2019re ugly by putting green straws in their drinks. Apparently, customers of the popular coffee chain have bought into this idea that there\u2019s a color-coordinated system with its straws that carry secret messages. A TikToker named Jenny (@itsjenduhhh) is yet another user on the platform who has posted about the straw color theory\u2014and she\u2019s not happy with the color she received. \u201cImagine having a bad day and Dutch Bros gives you a blue straw,\u201d a text overlay in Jenny\u2019s video reads that begins with her driving her car, presumably to a Dutch Bros location. That presumption is verified when in the next frame of the video, Jenny records herself balled up in her seat, her knees pressed up to her chest as she holds an iced coffee outfitted with a blue straw in her hands. She lip-syncs the audio of someone weeping as she rocks back and forth. @itsjenduhhh my 13th reason #dutchbros #fyp #badday \u266c sonido original \u2013 Carly Mata So why is Jenny so sad about getting a blue-colored straw? Does she have an aversion to the color blue like some guest on Maury Povich asked to face their fears on camera, and if someone brought out this lovable dog, she would have a similar reaction? Apparently, there are a lot of TikTokers out there who have theorized that the color of the straw they receive at Dutch Bros coffee is a miniature commentary made by employees on the customers who place their orders. Does Dutch Bros have a secret straw code? Radio station Knix Country compiled a few of these videos and gave a breakdown of the different colored Dutch Bros straws and the associated commentaries with them: PINK STRAW: Means the barista thinks you\u2019re cute or pretty GREEN STRAW: Means you\u2019re unsightly or ugly ORANGE STRAW: Means that you\u2019re mysterious, strange, or the employee thinks you\u2019re weird YELLOW STRAW: Means you\u2019re average BLUE STRAW: Means the person who made your drink thinks you\u2019re a rude person @grehs_ Replying to @hanwernerr #greenscreen \u266c original sound \u2013 Grace Coffee Affection looked into this secret coffee straw messaging theory to see if there was any truth to it, and by the end of the piece, it seemed like no definitive questions were answered. The authors couldn\u2019t seem to narrow down its origins, and the outlet, along with Granite Bay Today referenced that YouTuber Veronica James further added to the mystery of this straw conundrum by stating that it seems sometimes the commentary system was in effect and other times it wasn\u2019t. However, some uploads from folks seem to suggest there could be merit to the straw code theory. One gentleman said they were rocking a paper menu from the chain to see what type of coffee they wanted. One of the workers said they thought it was funny. When he received his drink\u2026it came with an Orange straw, indicating that he was either interesting, mysterious, or weird, as per the theory. @knarf_solo Pay attention to your straw! ? I \u2764\ufe0f @dutchbroscoffee #dutchbros #dutchbrosstrawmeaning #coffee #orangestraw \u266c Good Day \u2013 Nappy Roots Another woman also posted on this Dutch Bros straw code, stating that she received a green straw, which indicates that the employees who handed it to her may\u2019ve found her physically unappealing. @samirajasmine #greenscreen I tried Dutch for the first time today ??? #foryou #foryoupage #viral #fyp #dutchbros \u266c Roses \u2013 Imanbek Remix \u2013 SAINt JHN TikTok user Alondra Razon (@alondrarazon) also wanted to test this theory out for herself to see what straws she ended up with, giving a small breakdown with different colored hearts and their corresponding hidden meanings. @alondrarazon @Dutch Bros Coffee straw theory is it TRUE!?! LET ME KNOW!! ????? #dutchbros #straw #theory #dutchbroshacks #dutchbrosdrinks \u266c original sound \u2013 Alondra Razon \u201cWe\u2019re gonna see what straw we got I hope it\u2019s not a bad one,\u201d she states into the camera before showing off her drink order and then unwrapping the straw she received\u2014it ended up being a pink one. She records herself tasting her drink, twitching her eye in the process before the video ultimately cuts out. However, someone else posted themselves getting a Dutch Bros drink\u2026only to reveal that they ended up getting a clear straw in the process. One TikToker who responded to Jenny\u2019s video also stated that there isn\u2019t any merit to the code, either: \u201cTHE STRAWS MEAN NOTHINGGG (coming from an ex employee).\u201d The Daily Dot has reached out to Dutch Bros.

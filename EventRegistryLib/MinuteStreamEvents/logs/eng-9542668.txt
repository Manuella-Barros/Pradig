Things are evolving to eventually getting them back home.'\n\nThe 1963 act prevents the British Museum from giving away anything from its collection - including the Elgin Marbles which Greece wants back - and the 1983 equivalent does the same for the V&A.\n\nThe 32 pieces of Asante Gold, named after the African empire from which they were taken, were handed over last week on the three-year agreement which could be extended for another three.\n\nSome 17 of them are from the V&A with the other 15 from the British Museum, with the items going on display at the Manhyia Palace Museum in Kumasi.\n\nThe objects include a sword of state, gold badges worn by officials, ceremonial caps and pipes.\n\nWriter and academic Ivor Agyeman-Duah, also director of the Manhyia Palace Museum, said a permanent return was 'how it has been envisaged'.\n\nGhana's Asante king Otumfuo Osei Tutu II (left) looks on during a ceremony last Wednesday to mark the return of artefacts from the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum\n\nA total of 32 Asante gold items are being loaned to the current king for three years, including this Asante gold torc (left) and ring (right)\n\nAn Asante gold model harp given to the British Museum has also been handed over\n\nA sword of state taken from the royal court following conflicts between the British Empire and the Asante Empire is being exhibited in Ghana too\n\nAnd sources close to the Asante king were quoted as saying the loan pact was 'just the beginning' - with a likely push to repatriate more Asante material currently remaining in the two London museums.\n\nMr Hunt, who was Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central between 2010 and 2017, said: 'Initially it's a three-year loan, maybe renewable in future, but then we could see a situation whereby the 1963 Act or the 1983 Act was reformed in future.\n\n'My view is that those acts should be reformed and trustees should have responsibility for what is in their collection.\n\n'But that's not where the Government is at the moment, and we have to respect that.'\n\nThe Asante, also known as the Ashanti, are a people who ruled over vast swathe of modern-day Ghana between the 18th and 20th centuries.\n\nIts empire gained vast wealth through gold and agricultural trade, while also being involved in five conflicts with the British empire and its African allies between 1824 and 1900.\n\nBetween 1824 and 1900 the empire was involved in five conflicts with the British Empire and its African allies as it tried to enforce control over coastal areas of modern day Ghana.\n\nBritish success in the fourth and fifth conflicts enabled them to annex the Asante empire and burn the capital Kumasi to the ground.\n\nFormer Labour MP Tristram Hunt, now director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, attended the handover ceremony and exhibition in Kumasi, Ghana, on May 1\n\nA ceremonial pipe is also transferred as part of the agreement - with leaders in Ghana insisting they want the returns to be permanent\n\nThis gold ring is among the artefacts going on display at the Manhyia Palace Museum in Kumasi, Ghana\n\nThe city and royal palace were then looted, with gold and other artefacts either sold or given to Britain as reparations for the cost of the wars.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer has been reported as being open to returning the Elgin Marbes but his party has not confirmed a policy position on the British Museum and National Heritage acts.\n\nMailOnline has contacted the Labour Party for comment.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak snubbed a planned meeting last November with his Greek counterpart Kyriakos Mitsotakis amid a flare-up over the Elgin Marbles.\n\nThe Greek PM had ramped up public demands for the return of the ancient artefacts which are housed at the British Museum.\n\nGreece has long demanded the return of the Parthenon Sculptures, which were removed from the country by Lord Elgin in the early 19th century during his time as British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire.\n\nBritish Museum chairman George Osborne, the former chancellor, has previously said he is exploring ways for the Elgin Marbles to be displayed in Greece.\n\nThere has been speculation that this could involve a loan deal in which part of the sculptures would be sent to Athens.\n\nAlong among the 32-item selection taken to Ghana is this oblong gold repousse ornament\n\nA pair of silver anklets is also part of the collection originally seized by British Empire forces following a series of conflicts\n\nThere have been suggestions an incoming Labour government could be open to return the Elgin Marbles (pictured) to Greece from their current home at the British Museum\n\nLabour sources said that Sir Keir, whose Holborn and St Pancras constituency is home to the British Museum, would not 'stand in the way' of a loan deal.\n\nA Labour spokesperson said last November: 'Strong cultural and historical partnerships between countries are important to ensure the British Museum, and other UK cultural institutions, can maintain their world leading status.\n\n'The next Labour Government will hear the case from the British Museum and its chair on any proposed changes to the Heritage Act as it stands. We've no current plans to change it.'\n\nOther British-held artefacts which campaigners have suggested for repatriation include the Benin Bronzes and sacred tablets from Ethiopia.", "source": {"uri":

They were handed over last week as part of a three-year loan.\n\nThe king wants to avoid handing back the Asante gold and is hopeful that a future government would change the laws which currently ban museums from repatriating artefacts abroad permanently.\n\nThe Tories have already ruled out doing so, making Labour the best chance for the legal change he needs to retain the artefacts.\n\nBritish Museum and V&A bosses joined the king in the Asante capital of Kumasi on May 1 to celebrate the handover of the treasures, comprising items of royal regalia taken by British forces in the 19th century.\n\nTristram Hunt, the V&A director, said he supported a change to the laws, and Asante courtiers believe that the currently agreed three-year loan period may be long enough to allow the changes to be enacted.\n\nOheneba Owusu Afriyie IV, the prince and member of the Asante inner court, spoke to the Telegraph in Kumasi, explaining: \"We are hoping that after the two three-year terms, things would have evolved, and your laws back home might have changed.\n\n\"We are very hopeful. Things are evolving to eventually getting them back home.\"\n\nThe government has refused to amend legal constraints on repatriating museum artefacts, but the Labour party has not set out a policy position ahead of the general election.\n\nThe British Museum Act 1963 bars the institution from handing over any items from its collection, which has led to an impasse in the Greek campaign to reclaim the Elgin Marbles, and the National Heritage Act 1983 places the same constraints on the V&A.\n\nUnder current laws, the 32 newly loaned items which include a golden sword used to swear in tribal chieftains and gold pendants worn by attendants who ritually purify the Asante king's soul, remain the official property of the two British museums and will have to return to the UK.\n\nIvor Agyeman-Duah, the writer, academic and director of the Asante king's museum within the Manhyia Palace complex in Kumasi, aims for their permanent return.\n\nSpeaking at the Manhyia Palace Museum, Mr Agyeman-Duah confirmed that the permanent return of Asante artefacts from British collections is the end goal and \"how it has been envisaged\", adding that spiritually significant treasures remaining with the king \"is as it should be\".\n\nSources close to the palace added that the loan deal was \"just the beginning\" of repatriation plans for near-sacred golden artefacts to be returned to the king, and the ruler may push to repatriate more of the Asante material in the V&A and British Museum.\n\nMr Hunt, a former Labour MP, attended the handover ceremony in Kumasi where he told the Telegraph that a permanent return was possible.\n\nHe said: \"Initially it's a three-year loan, maybe renewable in future, but then we could see a situation whereby the 1963 Act or the 1983 Act was reformed in future.\n\n\"My view is that those acts should be reformed and trustees should have responsibility for what is in their collection.\n\nHe added: \"But that's not where the government is at the moment, and we have to respect that.\"\n\nThe king or \"Asantehene\" is a unifying figure for the Asante, who by tradition was ordained by heaven to sit on the Golden Stool, the equivalent of a throne, and who wields significant political and judicial power in the present day.\n\nIn 1874, the Asante were defeated by the British in the Third Anglo-Asante war, having earned a reputation as warriors by defeating colonial troops in previous conflicts, and the king's ceremonially significant golden regalia were taken as a war indemnity.\n\nThese were auctioned off to major institutions including the British Museum and what would become the V&A to raise money for widows and injured soldiers.\n\nIn May 2023, the current Asante king began negotiating with the British Museum and V&A to reclaim golden regalia ahead of the 150th anniversary of when it was taken from his ancestors when British forces took Kumasi.\n\nThe long-term vision to keep the loaned artefacts permanently may be helped by the rolling nature of the V&A's deal, which can be extended from its initial three-year term.\n\nBritish Museum representatives in Kumasi did not comment on legal changes but said there would be \"future projects\" with the Asante.\n\nThe Tory government has repeatedly stated that it has no intention of reforming the two acts which compel national museums to keep their collections, held on behalf of the British public, intact.\n\nThis has led to an impasse in a string of repatriation struggles over the Benin Bronzes, Ethiopian sacred tablets, and the Elgin Marbles.\n\nWhile Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader has reportedly been open to returning the Elgin Marbles, his party has not set out a policy position regarding the British Museum and National Heritage Acts.",

As a beat was hammered out, bodyguards rattled their swords in their scabbards, and the 73-year-old ruler was escorted under a cover of gaudy parasols 10ft across.\n\nA silver incense burner balanced on the head of one attendant, as others held aloft solid gold staffs brought out on occasion of public address.\n\nDressed in symbolic robes in the Asante colour of green and yellow, the king took his seat on a high dais ringed by his inner court, wafted by a palm-leaf fan, and occasionally dabbed with a towel to wipe away the sweat.\n\nOpposite the king and 40 yards away, V&A director Tristram Hunt and British Museum trustee Chris Gosden sat suited alongside diplomats in the 35C heat.\n\nA senior Asante chief and master of ceremonies cheerily said they were representatives of \"our former colonisers\", but diplomatically suggested that the golden artefacts being returned were not \"stolen\" by the British but simply \"went missing\".\n\nMr Hunt was not as diplomatic. Standing under his own vast parasol, he said the gold he was there to return was \"looted\", adding that it had to be returned as a matter of \"healing and reconciliation\" that might address the \"painful scars\" of colonialism.\n\nThe Asante Empire emerged in the 17th century, and became famed for their warrior prowess and vast wealth derived from gold, and its trade in slaves.\n\nThe West African power fought the British in a string of conflicts in the 19th century. Despite early victories, the Asante lost the Third Anglo-Asante War in 1874 and objects of ceremonial and spiritual significance were handed over as part of the treaty to end the war.\n\nIn 1896, future founder of the Boy Scouts, Robert Baden Powell, led another campaign against the Asante which resulted in further artefacts being taken and the then king, Prempeh I, being deposed and sent into exile in the Seychelles.\n\nAs they reversed this handover, Mr Hunt and Mr Gosden addressed the king, strode to bring him gifts, bowed before the monarch, and officially handed back some of what his ancestors lost.\n\nConcluding the ceremony, the king officially opened the Homecoming exhibition displaying the repatriated gold, welcoming back objects he proclaimed carried the \"soul of the Asante\".", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "craig_simpson@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Craig Simpson", "type": "author",

The British Museum and the Victoria & Albert Museum earlier this year agreed to give back 32 gold and silver treasures pillaged by British military forces from Asante leader Asantehene's court during the 19th-century Anglo-Asante Wars.\n\nThey include the sword of the state known as Mpomponsuo and the gold badges of officials authorized to purify the king's soul. The collection also features a gold lute harp presented by Asantehene Osei Bonsu to British diplomat Thomas Edward Bowdich during an 1817 trade treaty. Speaking at the event dubbed \"Homecoming: adversity and commemoration,\" King Otumfuo Osei Tutu II said the first-ever exhibition of the artefacts at Manhyia Palace reflected the \"soul of the Asante people.\" \"(Though) not all have been returned, what we have here still embodies the soul of the Asantes,\" the king said of the items looted in 1874.\n\n\"So, the spirit is back here, and today is a day for Asantes, a day for the black African continent, and the spirits are back with us again today.\" The Ghanaian king showcased the items in the refurbished Manhyia Palace Museum in Kumasi, the seat of the Asantehene kingdom. Each item offered visitors a rare glimpse into the splendor of Asante history and culture. The exhibition will be opened to the public this week.\n\nThe return of the objects came as pressure grows on European and US museums and institutions to restore African artefacts stolen during the rule of former colonial powers Britain, France, Germany and Belgium. Dr Tristram Hunt, the Director of the Victoria & Albert Museum, said the artefacts, symbolizing the rich heritage of the Asante Kingdom, were returned to address \"the very painful history surrounding the acquisition of these objects, a history tainted by the scars of imperial conflict and colonialism.\" \"These treasures have been witnesses to the triumphs and trials of a great kingdom, and their return to Kumasi is a testament to the power of cultural exchange and reconciliation,\" he said.\n\nA member of the Board of Trustees of the British Museum, Professor Chris Gosden, said the museum is \"wholly committed to continuing this relationship, building on this loan in a manner based on friendship, trust, mutual respect, and a willingness to discuss.\" He said the agreement reflects almost half a century of discussions between Manhyia Palace and especially with the British Museum.\n\nThe accord \"provides the basis for enhanced cultural cooperation between the Manhyia Palace Museum and the British Museum, and this loan is its first tangible outcome,\" Gosden said. The Fowler Museum in the United States also returned seven royal artefacts to the Ghanaian Asante king, making the Manhyia Palace Museum now home to 39 artefacts that were lost to colonial powers. King Osei Tutu II appointed two technical advisors - Ghanaian historian, Ivor Agyeman-Duah, and Scottish historian and former vice principal of the University of Glasgow, Professor Malcolm McLeod - to facilitate the return.\n\nNigeria is also negotiating the return of thousands of 16th to 18th-century metal plaques, sculptures, and objects looted from the ancient Kingdom of Benin and currently held in museums and with art collectors across the US and Europe. The neighboring Benin Republic received two dozen treasures and artworks stolen in 1892 by French colonial forces. -- AFP", "source": {"uri": "kuwaittimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kuwait

Across the country, carefully assembled collections are being chipped away at, with integral parts sent overseas under the mantle of \"decolonisation\". Little scrutiny is applied to the logic of this process.\n\nIn January, the Victoria & Albert Museum and British Museum agreed to \"lend\" back 32 objects originating from the Asante royal court to the current Asante ruler. Despite the return of objects being restricted by statute, the framing of this as a \"loan\" allowed the museums to circumvent the relevant legislation, denying the Commons its say.\n\nIt has now emerged that, as this paper warned at the time, there is little prospect of their return. The current Asante ruler is said to be optimistic that an incoming Labour government will change the law to gift him the objects. Alternatively, the V&A could simply extend the loan indefinitely.\n\nThe history of the world is a history of conflict. Advocates of repatriation do not in fact wish for everything to be restored to its place of origin. They have no interest in the conflicts which raged within West Africa, or indeed with the repatriation of artefacts taken from Britain in earlier periods.

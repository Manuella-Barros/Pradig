Heat index readings were expected to reach 100 to 105 degrees (37.7 C to 40.5 C) in many locations.\n\nPeople and even zoo animals were forced to find ways to thwart the muggy weather.\n\nAn organization that provides produce to areas with limited access to fresh food in Columbus, Ohio, prepared frozen towels and packed cold water for their workers.\n\n\"Hydration is the key,\" said Monique McCoy, market manager for the Local Matters Veggie Van.\n\nIn Toledo, Ohio, the city canceled a weekly fitness event and a neighboring suburb called off a street fair as temperatures reached the mid-90s (about 35 C). A food bank in upstate New York canceled deliveries for Wednesday out of concern for staff and volunteers.\n\nSchools in New York canceled field trips Tuesday to the Rosamond Gifford Zoo in Syracuse, where workers turned on water misters for visitors and the animals. Elephants and other animals were getting chunks of ice in their pools, said Ted Fox, the zoo's executive director.\n\n\"Even the tigers love to lick the ice and put their heads on them when it's this warm,\" Fox said.\n\nThe blast of extreme temperatures came a little too early for many.\n\n\"This is hot for just moving in to summer, so I'm hoping that we're going to see the downward trend in the temperature here soon because this is a warm one,\" said Krista Voltolini, who was selling produce at a farmer's market in Columbus.\n\nA recent study found that climate change is making heat waves move more slowly and affect more people for a longer time. Last year, the U.S. saw the most heat waves -- abnormally hot weather lasting more than two days -- since 1936.\n\nChicago broke a 1957 temperature record Monday with a high of 97 degrees (36.1 C). Wednesday will be another hot day, but a cold front will bring relief to areas near Lake Michigan on Thursday and Friday, the National Weather Service in Chicago said.\n\nThat relief won't come in time for the closure of all but one cooling center in Chicago on the Juneteenth holiday.\n\n\"It's extremely alarming that we are shrinking our cooling centers in the middle of a heat wave,\" state Rep. Lindsey LaPointe told The Chicago Sun-Times. LaPointe represents Chicago's Northwest Side and advocates for people who do not have permanent shelter and other vulnerable populations.\n\nOfficials have urged people to limit outdoor activities when possible and to check in with family members and neighbors who may be vulnerable to the heat.\n\nIn New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul activated the National Guard to assist in any heat emergencies that develop over the next several days. She also said admission and parking fees at state parks, pools and beaches would be waived on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\n\"This is a time of significant risk, and we're doing our best to make sure that all lives are protected,\" Hochul said Tuesday.\n\nIn California, wildfires erupted east of San Francisco in the state's historic Gold Country region and in the mountains of northern Los Angeles County after what had been a quiet start to fire season. Wildfires in southern New Mexico damaged 500 buildings Tuesday in a mountain village of 7,000 people that had been evacuated with little time to spare.\n\nMeanwhile, a fresh batch of tropical moisture was bringing an increasing threat of heavy rain and flash flooding to the central Gulf Coast. Hurricane season this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory.\n\nOrsagos reported from Columbus, Ohio.

Kathy Hochul activated the National Guard to assist in any heat emergencies that develop over the next several days. She also said admission and parking fees at state parks, pools and beaches would be waived on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\n\"This is a time of significant risk, and we're doing our best to make sure that all lives are protected,\" Hochul said Tuesday.\n\nIn California, wildfires erupted east of San Francisco in the state's historic Gold Country region and in the mountains of northern Los Angeles County after what had been a quiet start to fire season.

The region was under a heat advisory until Wednesday evening and temperatures in Caribou were hotter than Miami: 94 degrees (34.4 C) compared with 89 (31.6 C), according to the National Weather Service.\n\nSeveral residents said they were used to temperatures in the 70s and 80s in June and rarely this humid.\n\n\"I've seen this maybe one time before where it's been this hot in June,\" said Hannah Embelton, 22, a server at an ice cream store in Caribou, adding that customers were staying away from the soft serve options because they melt took quickly.\n\n\"We usually never get the brunt of all this heat and humidity because we are so north. Just how hot it is, that is all everyone is talking about,\" she added.\n\nOver at Moose River Campground, about 13 miles from the border, owner Lisa Hall was fixing a cabin faucet amid the sizzling temperatures and said such conditions are more common in mid July or early August.\n\n\"I am sweating like crazy and it's way too hot,\" she said.\n\nThe dangerous temperatures were expected to peak in the eastern Great Lakes and New England on Wednesday and Thursday, and in the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic on Friday and Saturday, the National Weather Service said. Heat index readings were expected to reach 100 to 105 degrees (37.7 C to 40.5 C) in many locations.\n\n\"We are seeing a ridge of upper level high pressure, which is bringing all this heat from the southern United States,\" said Kyle Pederson, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boston.\n\n\"That is just causing lots of hot temperature in the mid- to upper 90s and the heat index to reach over 100. It's just going to make it feel warmer than it is outside,\" he said. \"You will really feel that humidity and feel the heat quicker.\"\n\nThe conditions were expected to scale back some Juneteenth activities and limited options for relief. Cities that opened cooling centers this week advised that Wednesday's holiday meant some public libraries, senior centers and pools where residents could beat the heat would be closed.\n\nThat affected services in Indianapolis, where Horizon House, a daytime homeless service center, picked up slack from closed cooling centers and food pantries. The center served about 200 people a day this week, but the number jumped to 300 for lunch during its Juneteenth festival. It also gave out roughly 450 bottles of water.\n\n\"Today was downright swampy, \"said Courtney Kay Meyers, director of development and communications. \"We're really struggling to keep up with water and demand for water.\"\n\nOfficials have urged people to limit outdoor activities when possible and to check in with family members and neighbors who may be vulnerable to the heat.\n\nIn New York, state parks have free admission Wednesday and Thursday, and select state-run pools and beaches opened early for swimming, Gov. Kathy Hochul said.\n\nNew York City beaches were open but public swimming pools there were closed until next week. The city has a list of hundreds of air conditioned sites that are free and open to the public. Public libraries, which have been used as cooling centers during other heat waves, were closed Wednesday because of the Juneteenth federal holiday.\n\nAnne-Laure Bonhomme, a 43 -- year-old health coach, was visiting sites in New York with her family. \"The humidity is pretty insane,\" she said.\n\nPeople and even zoo animals were forced to find ways to thwart the muggy weather.\n\nHigh humidity lingered over Indianapolis Wednesday making the deceptively cloudy day warm and unenjoyable. Parks and walking trails were sparsely populated despite the holiday.\n\nThe Bennett family considered taking their 7-year-old and 4-month old to the pool or a splash pad on their day off of work, but decided it would still be too warm for the kids. Instead, Kayla and Sarah drove from Muncie to the Indiana State Museum in downtown Indianapolis to visit the indoor exhibits in the air conditioning.\n\n\"We decided to do something inside,\" Kayla said.\n\nA recent study found that climate change is making heat waves move more slowly and affect more people for a longer time. Last year, the U.S. saw the greatest number of heat waves -- abnormally hot weather lasting more than two days -- since 1936.\n\nChicago broke a 1957 temperature record Monday with a high of 97 degrees (36.1 C).

(Scripps News)\n\nA blistering heat wave Wednesday extended from the Midwest to New England, leaving millions of people sweltering through the Juneteenth holiday, including in places like northern Maine where they rarely experience such conditions this early in the year.\n\nThe city of Caribou, Maine, just 10 miles from the Canadian border, saw a record 103 degrees Fahrenheit on the heat index, which combines heat and humidity. The region was under a heat advisory until Wednesday evening and temperatures in Caribou were hotter than Miami: 94 degrees compared with 89, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nSeveral residents said they were used to temperatures in the 70s and 80s in June, and rarely this humid.\n\n\"I've seen this maybe one time before where it's been this hot in June,\" said Hannah Embelton, 22, a server at an ice cream store in Caribou, who added that customers were staying away from the soft serve options because they melt too quickly.\n\n\"We usually never get the brunt of all this heat and humidity because we are so north. Just how hot it is, that is all everyone is talking about,\" she added.\n\nOver at Moose River Campground, about 13 miles from the border, owner Lisa Hall was fixing a cabin faucet amid the sizzling temperatures and said such conditions are more common in mid-July or early August.\n\n\"I am sweating like crazy and it's way too hot,\" she said.\n\nThe dangerous temperatures were expected to peak in the eastern Great Lakes and New England on Wednesday and Thursday, and in the Ohio Valley and mid-Atlantic on Friday and Saturday, the National Weather Service said. Heat index readings were expected to reach 100 to 105 degrees in many locations.\n\n\"We are seeing a ridge of upper level high pressure, which is bringing all this heat from the southern United States,\" said Kyle Pederson, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boston.\n\n\"That is just causing lots of hot temperature in the mid- to upper 90s and the heat index to reach over 100. It's just going to make it feel warmer than it is outside,\" he said. \"You will really feel that humidity and feel the heat quicker.\"\n\nThe conditions were expected to scale back some Juneteenth activities amid limited options for relief. Cities that opened cooling centers this week advised that Wednesday's holiday meant some public libraries, senior centers and pools where residents could beat the heat would be closed.\n\nThat affected services in Indianapolis, where Horizon House, a daytime homeless service center, picked up slack from closed cooling centers and food pantries. The center served about 200 people a day this week, but the number jumped to 300 for lunch during its Juneteenth festival. It also gave out roughly 450 bottles of water.\n\n\"Today was downright swampy,\" said Courtney Kay Meyers, director of development and communications. \"We're really struggling to keep up with water and demand for water.\"\n\nOfficials have urged people to limit outdoor activities when possible and to check in with family members and neighbors who may be vulnerable to the heat.\n\nIn New York, state parks have free admission Wednesday and Thursday, and select state-run pools and beaches opened early for swimming, Gov. Kathy Hochul said.\n\nNew York City beaches were open but public swimming pools there were closed until next week. The city has a list of hundreds of air conditioned sites that are free and open to the public. Public libraries, which have been used as cooling centers during other heat waves, were closed Wednesday because of the Juneteenth federal holiday.\n\nAnne-Laure Bonhomme, a 43-year-old health coach, was visiting sites in New York with her family. \"The humidity is pretty insane,\" she said.\n\nPeople and even zoo animals were forced to find ways to thwart the muggy weather.\n\nHigh humidity lingered over Indianapolis Wednesday, making the deceptively cloudy day warm and unenjoyable. Parks and walking trails were sparsely populated despite the holiday.\n\nThe Bennett family considered taking their 7-year-old and 4-month old to the pool or a splash pad on their day off of work, but decided it would still be too warm for the kids. Instead, Kayla and Sarah drove from Muncie to the Indiana State Museum in downtown Indianapolis to visit the indoor exhibits in the air conditioning.\n\n\"We decided to do something inside,\" Kayla said.\n\nA recent study found that climate change is making heat waves move more slowly and affect more people for a longer time. Last year, the U.S. saw the greatest number of heat waves -- abnormally hot weather lasting more than two days -- since 1936.\n\nChicago broke a 1957 temperature record Monday with a high of 97 degrees. A cold front was expected to bring relief to areas near Lake Michigan on Thursday and Friday, the National Weather Service in Chicago said.\n\nIn California, wildfires erupted east of San Francisco in the state's historic Gold Country region and in the mountains of northern Los Angeles County after what had been a quiet start to fire season. Wildfires in southern New Mexico killed two people and damaged 1,400 buildings Tuesday in the area of a mountain village of 7,000 people that had been evacuated with little time to spare.\n\nMeanwhile, a fresh batch of tropical moisture was bringing an increasing threat of heavy rain and flash flooding to the central Gulf Coast. Hurricane season this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory.\n\nRelated stories:\n\nMore than 75 million Americans face extreme heat, while 2 states brace for snow\n\nTropical

The region was under a heat advisory until Wednesday evening and temperatures in Caribou were hotter than Miami: 94 degrees compared with 89, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nSeveral residents said they were used to temperatures in the 70s and 80s in June and rarely this humid.\n\n\"I've seen this maybe one time before where it's been this hot in June,\" said Hannah Embelton, 22, a server at an ice cream store in Caribou, adding that customers were staying away from the soft serve options because they melt too quickly.\n\n\"We usually never get the brunt of all this heat and humidity because we are so north. Just how hot it is, that is all everyone is talking about,\" she added.\n\nOver at Moose River Campground, about 13 miles from the border, owner Lisa Hall was fixing a cabin faucet amid the sizzling temperatures and said such conditions are more common in mid July or early August.\n\n\"I am sweating like crazy and it's way too hot,\" she said.\n\nThe dangerous temperatures were expected to peak in the eastern Great Lakes and New England on Wednesday and today, and in the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic on Friday and Saturday, the National Weather Service said. Heat index readings were expected to reach 100-105 degrees in many locations.\n\n\"We are seeing a ridge of upper level high pressure, which is bringing all this heat from the southern United States,\" said Kyle Pederson, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boston.\n\n\"That is just causing lots of hot temperature in the mid- to upper 90s and the heat index to reach over 100. It's just going to make it feel warmer than it is outside,\" he said. \"You will really feel that humidity and feel the heat quicker.\"\n\nThe conditions were expected to scale back some Juneteenth activities and limited options for relief. Cities that opened cooling centers this week advised that Wednesday's holiday meant some public libraries, senior centers and pools where residents could beat the heat would be closed.\n\nThat affected services in Indianapolis, where Horizon House, a daytime homeless service center, picked up slack from closed cooling centers and food pantries. The center served about 200 people a day this week, but the number jumped to 300 for lunch during its Juneteenth festival. It also gave out roughly 450 bottles of water.\n\n\"Today was downright swampy, \"said Courtney Kay Meyers, director of development and communications. \"We're really struggling to keep up with water and demand for water.\"\n\nOfficials have urged people to limit outdoor activities when possible and to check in with family members and neighbors who may be vulnerable to the heat.\n\nIn New York, state parks have free admission Wednesday and today, and select state-run pools and beaches opened early for swimming, Gov. Kathy Hochul said.\n\nNew York City beaches were open, but public swimming pools there were closed until next week. The city has a list of hundreds of air conditioned sites that are free and open to the public. Public libraries, which have been used as cooling centers during other heat waves, were closed Wednesday because of the Juneteenth federal holiday.\n\nAnne-Laure Bonhomme, a 43--year-old health coach, was visiting sites in New York with her family. \"The humidity is pretty insane,\" she said.\n\nPeople and even zoo animals were forced to find ways to thwart the muggy weather.\n\nHigh humidity lingered over Indianapolis on Wednesday making the deceptively cloudy day warm and unenjoyable. Parks and walking trails were sparsely populated despite the holiday.\n\nThe Bennett family considered taking their 7-year-old and 4-month old to the pool or a splash pad on their day off of work, but decided it would still be too warm for the kids. Instead, Kayla and Sarah drove from Muncie to the Indiana State Museum in downtown Indianapolis to visit the indoor exhibits in the air conditioning.\n\n\"We decided to do something inside,\" Kayla said.\n\nA recent study found that climate change is making heat waves move more slowly and affect more people for a longer time. Last year, the U.S. saw the greatest number of heat waves -- abnormally hot weather lasting more than two days -- since 1936.\n\nChicago broke a 1957 temperature record Monday with a high of 97 degrees. A cold front was expected to bring relief to areas near Lake Michigan today and Friday, the National Weather Service in Chicago said.\n\nIn California, wildfires erupted east of San Francisco in the state's historic Gold Country region and in the mountains of northern Los Angeles County after what had been a quiet start to fire season. Wildfires in southern New Mexico damaged 500 buildings Tuesday in a mountain village of 7,000 people that had been evacuated with little time to spare.\n\nMeanwhile, a fresh batch of tropical moisture was bringing an increasing threat of heavy rain and flash flooding to the central Gulf Coast. Hurricane season this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory.\n\nPeople sit at a light rail stop as the temperature hits 104-degrees Monday, June 17, 2024, in Phoenix.

It's just going to make it feel warmer than it is outside,\" he said. \"You will really feel that humidity and feel the heat quicker.\"\n\nThe conditions were expected to scale back some Juneteenth activities and limited options for relief. Cities that opened cooling centers this week advised that Wednesday's holiday meant some public libraries, senior centers and pools where residents could beat the heat would be closed. That affected services in Indianapolis, where Horizon House, a daytime homeless service center, picked up slack from closed cooling centers and food pantries.\n\nAlso Read: | Much of US braces for extreme weather, from southern heat wave to possible snow in the Rocky Mountains\n\nThe center served about 200 people a day this week, but the number jumped to 300 for lunch during its Juneteenth festival. It also gave out roughly 450 bottles of water.\"Today was downright swampy, \"said Courtney Kay Meyers, director of development and communications. \"We're really struggling to keep up with water and demand for water.\"\n\nOfficials have urged people to limit outdoor activities when possible and to check in with family members and neighbors who may be vulnerable to the heat.\n\nIn New York, state parks have free admission Wednesday and Thursday, and select state-run pools and beaches opened early for swimming, Gov. Kathy Hochul said. New York City beaches were open but public swimming pools there were closed until next week.\n\nThe city has a list of hundreds of air conditioned sites that are free and open to the public. Public libraries, which have been used as cooling centers during other heat waves, were closed Wednesday because of the Juneteenth federal holiday. Anne-Laure Bonhomme, a 43 -- year-old health coach, was visiting sites in New York with her family. \"The humidity is pretty insane,\" she said.\n\nAlso Read: | All the ways a hotter planet makes us sicker\n\nPeople and even zoo animals were forced to find ways to thwart the muggy weather. High humidity lingered over Indianapolis Wednesday making the deceptively cloudy day warm and unenjoyable. Parks and walking trails were sparsely populated despite the holiday.\n\nThe Bennett family considered taking their 7-year-old and 4-month old to the pool or a splash pad on their day off of work, but decided it would still be too warm for the kids. Instead, Kayla and Sarah drove from Muncie to the Indiana State Museum in downtown Indianapolis to visit the indoor exhibits in the air conditioning. \"We decided to do something inside,\" Kayla said.\n\nA recent study found that climate change is making heat waves move more slowly and affect more people for a longer time. Last year, the US saw the greatest number of heat waves -- abnormally hot weather lasting more than two days -- since 1936.\n\nChicago broke a 1957 temperature record Monday with a high of 97 degrees (36.1 C). A cold front was expected to bring relief to areas near Lake Michigan on Thursday and Friday, the National Weather Service in Chicago said.\n\nIn California, wildfires erupted east of San Francisco in the state's historic Gold Country region and in the mountains of northern Los Angeles County after what had been a quiet start to fire season.\n\nWildfires in southern New Mexico damaged 500 buildings Tuesday in a mountain village of 7,000 people that had been evacuated with little time to spare.\n\nMeanwhile, a fresh batch of tropical moisture was bringing an increasing threat of heavy rain and flash flooding to the central Gulf Coast.

The region was under a heat advisory until Wednesday evening and temperatures in Caribou were hotter than Miami: 94 degrees compared with 89, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nSeveral residents said they were used to temperatures in the 70s and 80s in June and rarely this humid.\n\n\"I've seen this maybe one time before where it's been this hot in June,\" said Hannah Embelton, 22, a server at an ice cream store in Caribou, adding that customers were staying away from the soft serve options because they melt took quickly.\n\n\"We usually never get the brunt of all this heat and humidity because we are so north.

Parks and walking trails were sparsely populated despite the holiday.\n\nThe Bennett family considered taking their 7-year-old and 4-month old to the pool or a splash pad on their day off of work, but decided it would still be too warm for the kids. Instead, Kayla and Sarah drove from Muncie to the Indiana State Museum in downtown Indianapolis to visit the indoor exhibits in the air conditioning.\n\n\"We decided to do something inside,\" Kayla said.\n\nA recent study found that climate change is making heat waves move more slowly and affect more people for a longer time. Last year, the U.S. saw the greatest number of heat waves -- abnormally hot weather lasting more than two days -- since 1936.\n\nChicago broke a 1957 temperature record Monday with a high of 97 degrees. A cold front was expected to bring relief to areas near Lake Michigan on Thursday and Friday, the National Weather Service in Chicago said.\n\nIn California, wildfires erupted east of San Francisco in the state's historic Gold Country region and in the mountains of northern Los Angeles County after what had been a quiet start to fire season. Wildfires in southern New Mexico damaged 500 buildings Tuesday in a mountain village of 7,000 people that had been evacuated with little time to spare.\n\nEssential dog and cat safety tips for the hottest days of summer\n\n1.

Heat index readings were expected to reach 100 to 105 degrees (37.7 C to 40.5 C) in many locations.\n\nPeople and even zoo animals were forced to find ways to thwart the muggy weather.\n\nAn organization that provides produce to areas with limited access to fresh food in Columbus, Ohio, prepared frozen towels and packed cold water for their workers.\n\n\"Hydration is the key,\" said Monique McCoy, market manager for the Local Matters Veggie Van.\n\nChildren run through water provided by the Benton Harbor Department of Public Safety during Spray and Play on Tuesday, June 18, 2024, at City Center Park in downtown Benton Harbor, Mich. (Don Campbell/The Herald-Palladium via AP)\n\nIn Toledo, Ohio, the city canceled a weekly fitness event and a neighboring suburb called off a street fair as temperatures reached the mid-90s (about 35 C). A food bank in upstate New York canceled deliveries for Wednesday out of concern for staff and volunteers.\n\nSchools in New York canceled field trips Tuesday to the Rosamond Gifford Zoo in Syracuse, where workers turned on water misters for visitors and the animals. Elephants and other animals were getting chunks of ice in their pools, said Ted Fox, the zoo\u00b4s executive director.\n\n\"Even the tigers love to lick the ice and put their heads on them when it\u00b4s this warm,\" Fox said.\n\nThe blast of extreme temperatures came a little too early for many.\n\n\"This is hot for just moving in to summer, so I\u00b4m hoping that we\u00b4re going to see the downward trend in the temperature here soon because this is a warm one,\" said Krista Voltolini, who was selling produce at a farmer\u00b4s market in Columbus.\n\nA recent study found that climate change is making heat waves move more slowly and affect more people for a longer time. Last year, the U.S. saw the most heat waves - abnormally hot weather lasting more than two days - since 1936.\n\nChicago broke a 1957 temperature record Monday with a high of 97 degrees (36.1 C). Wednesday will be another hot day, but a cold front will bring relief to areas near Lake Michigan on Thursday and Friday, the National Weather Service in Chicago said.\n\nThat relief won't come in time for the closure of all but one cooling center in Chicago on the Juneteenth holiday.\n\n\"It\u00b4s extremely alarming that we are shrinking our cooling centers in the middle of a heat wave,\" state Rep. Lindsey LaPointe told The Chicago Sun-Times. LaPointe represents Chicago\u00b4s Northwest Side and advocates for people who do not have permanent shelter and other vulnerable populations.\n\nOfficials have urged people to limit outdoor activities when possible and to check in with family members and neighbors who may be vulnerable to the heat.\n\nIn New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul activated the National Guard to assist in any heat emergencies that develop over the next several days. She also said admission and parking fees at state parks, pools and beaches would be waived on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\n\"This is a time of significant risk, and we\u00b4re doing our best to make sure that all lives are protected,\" Hochul said Tuesday.\n\nIn California, wildfires erupted east of San Francisco in the state\u00b4s historic Gold Country region and in the mountains of northern Los Angeles County after what had been a quiet start to fire season. Wildfires in southern New Mexico damaged 500 buildings Tuesday in a mountain village of 7,000 people that had been evacuated with little time to spare.\n\nMeanwhile, a fresh batch of tropical moisture was bringing an increasing threat of heavy rain and flash flooding to the central Gulf Coast.

The region was under a heat advisory until Wednesday evening and temperatures in Caribou were hotter than Miami: 94 degrees compared with 89, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nSeveral residents said they were used to temperatures in the 70s and 80s in June and rarely this humid.\n\n\"I've seen this maybe one time before where it's been this hot in June,\" said Hannah Embelton, 22, a server at an ice cream store in Caribou, adding that customers were staying away from the soft serve options because they melt took quickly.\n\n\"We usually never get the brunt of all this heat and humidity because we are so north. Just how hot it is, that is all everyone is talking about,\" she added.\n\nOver at Moose River Campground, about 13 miles from the border, owner Lisa Hall was fixing a cabin faucet amid the sizzling temperatures and said such conditions are more common in mid July or early August.\n\n\"I am sweating like crazy and it's way too hot,\" she said.\n\nThe dangerous temperatures were expected to peak in the eastern Great Lakes and New England on Wednesday and Thursday, and in the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic on Friday and Saturday, the National Weather Service said. Heat index readings were expected to reach 100 to 105 degrees in many locations.\n\n\"We are seeing a ridge of upper level high pressure, which is bringing all this heat from the southern United States,\" said Kyle Pederson, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boston.\n\n\"That is just causing lots of hot temperature in the mid- to upper 90s and the heat index to reach over 100. It's just going to make it feel warmer than it is outside,\" he said. \"You will really feel that humidity and feel the heat quicker.\"\n\nThe conditions were expected to scale back some Juneteenth activities and limited options for relief. Cities that opened cooling centers this week advised that Wednesday's holiday meant some public libraries, senior centers and pools where residents could beat the heat would be closed.\n\nThat affected services in Indianapolis, where Horizon House, a daytime homeless service center, picked up slack from closed cooling centers and food pantries. The center served about 200 people a day this week, but the number jumped to 300 for lunch during its Juneteenth festival. It also gave out roughly 450 bottles of water.\n\n\"Today was downright swampy, \"said Courtney Kay Meyers, director of development and communications. \"We're really struggling to keep up with water and demand for water.\"\n\nOfficials have urged people to limit outdoor activities when possible and to check in with family members and neighbors who may be vulnerable to the heat.\n\nIn New York, state parks have free admission Wednesday and Thursday, and select state-run pools and beaches opened early for swimming, Gov. Kathy Hochul said.\n\nNew York City beaches were open but public swimming pools there were closed until next week. The city has a list of hundreds of air conditioned sites that are free and open to the public. Public libraries, which have been used as cooling centers during other heat waves, were closed Wednesday because of the Juneteenth federal holiday.\n\nAnne-Laure Bonhomme, a 43-year-old health coach, was visiting sites in New York with her family. \"The humidity is pretty insane,\" she said.\n\nPeople and even zoo animals were forced to find ways to thwart the muggy weather.\n\nHigh humidity lingered over Indianapolis Wednesday making the deceptively cloudy day warm and unenjoyable. Parks and walking trails were sparsely populated despite the holiday.\n\nThe Bennett family considered taking their 7-year-old and 4-month old to the pool or a splash pad on their day off of work, but decided it would still be too warm for the kids. Instead, Kayla and Sarah drove from Muncie to the Indiana State Museum in downtown Indianapolis to visit the indoor exhibits in the air conditioning.\n\n\"We decided to do something inside,\" Kayla said.\n\nA recent study found that climate change is making heat waves move more slowly and affect more people for a longer time. Last year, the U.S. saw the greatest number of heat waves -- abnormally hot weather lasting more than two days -- since 1936.\n\nChicago broke a 1957 temperature record Monday with a high of 97 degrees.

Kathy Hochul activated the National Guard to assist in any heat emergencies that develop over the next several days. She also said admission and parking fees at state parks, pools and beaches would be waived on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\n\"This is a time of significant risk, and we're doing our best to make sure that all lives are protected,\" Hochul said Tuesday.\n\nIn Massachusetts, the 911 system was disrupted for nearly two hours Tuesday afternoon as the heat and humidity made it feel over 95 degrees in places. The state's Executive Office of Public Safety and Security said in a post on X that the cause of the outage is under investigation.\n\nIn California, wildfires erupted east of San Francisco in the state's historic Gold Country region and in the mountains of northern Los Angeles County after what had been a quiet start to fire season. Wildfires in southern New Mexico damaged 500 buildings Tuesday in a mountain village of 7,000 people that had been evacuated with little time to spare.\n\nWhile much of the U.S. swelters, late-season snow was forecast for the northern Rockies, with parts of Montana and north-central Idaho under a winter storm warning into Tuesday. As much as 20 inches (51 centimeters) was predicted for higher elevations around Glacier National Park.\n\nMeanwhile, a fresh batch of tropical moisture was bringing an increasing threat of heavy rain and flash flooding to the central Gulf Coast.

The region was under a heat advisory until Wednesday evening and temperatures in Caribou were hotter than Miami: 94 degrees compared with 89, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nSeveral residents said they were used to temperatures in the 70s and 80s in June and rarely this humid.\n\n\"I've seen this maybe one time before where it's been this hot in June,\" said Hannah Embelton, 22, a server at an ice cream store in Caribou, adding that customers were staying away from the soft serve options because they melt took quickly.\n\n\"We usually never get the brunt of all this heat and humidity because we are so north. Just how hot it is, that is all everyone is talking about,\" she added.\n\nOver at Moose River Campground, about 13 miles from the border, owner Lisa Hall was fixing a cabin faucet amid the sizzling temperatures and said such conditions are more common in mid July or early August.\n\n\"I am sweating like crazy and it's way too hot,\" she said.\n\nThe dangerous temperatures were expected to peak in the eastern Great Lakes and New England on Wednesday and Thursday, and in the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic on Friday and Saturday, the National Weather Service said. Heat index readings were expected to reach 100 to 105 degrees in many locations.\n\n\"We are seeing a ridge of upper level high pressure, which is bringing all this heat from the southern United States,\" said Kyle Pederson, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boston.\n\n\"That is just causing lots of hot temperature in the mid- to upper 90s and the heat index to reach over 100. It's just going to make it feel warmer than it is outside,\" he said. \"You will really feel that humidity and feel the heat quicker.\"\n\nThe conditions were expected to scale back some Juneteenth activities and limited options for relief. Cities that opened cooling centers this week advised that Wednesday's holiday meant some public libraries, senior centers and pools where residents could beat the heat would be closed.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThat affected services in Indianapolis, where Horizon House, a daytime homeless service center, picked up slack from closed cooling centers and food pantries. The center served about 200 people a day this week, but the number jumped to 300 for lunch during its Juneteenth festival. It also gave out roughly 450 bottles of water.\n\n\"Today was downright swampy, \"said Courtney Kay Meyers, director of development and communications. \"We're really struggling to keep up with water and demand for water.\"\n\nOfficials have urged people to limit outdoor activities when possible and to check in with family members and neighbors who may be vulnerable to the heat.\n\nIn New York, state parks have free admission Wednesday and Thursday, and select state-run pools and beaches opened early for swimming, Gov. Kathy Hochul said.\n\nNew York City beaches were open but public swimming pools there were closed until next week. The city has a list of hundreds of air conditioned sites that are free and open to the public. Public libraries, which have been used as cooling centers during other heat waves, were closed Wednesday because of the Juneteenth federal holiday.\n\nAnne-Laure Bonhomme, a 43-year-old health coach, was visiting sites in New York with her family. \"The humidity is pretty insane,\" she said.\n\nPeople and even zoo animals were forced to find ways to thwart the muggy weather.\n\nHigh humidity lingered over Indianapolis Wednesday making the deceptively cloudy day warm and unenjoyable. Parks and walking trails were sparsely populated despite the holiday.\n\nThe Bennett family considered taking their 7-year-old and 4-month old to the pool or a splash pad on their day off of work, but decided it would still be too warm for the kids. Instead, Kayla and Sarah drove from Muncie to the Indiana State Museum in downtown Indianapolis to visit the indoor exhibits in the air conditioning.\n\n\"We decided to do something inside,\" Kayla said.\n\nA recent study found that climate change is making heat waves move more slowly and affect more people for a longer time. Last year, the U.S. saw the greatest number of heat waves -- abnormally hot weather lasting more than two days -- since 1936.\n\nChicago broke a 1957 temperature record Monday with a high of 97 degrees. A cold front was expected to bring relief to areas near Lake Michigan on Thursday and Friday, the National Weather Service in Chicago said.\n\nIn California, wildfires erupted east of San Francisco in the state's historic Gold Country region and in the mountains of northern Los Angeles County after what had been a quiet start to fire season.

High temperatures are expected to stay in the 90s in the nation's capital for the rest of the week as a heat wave builds into the Northeast.\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- A blistering heat wave Wednesday extended from the Midwest to New England, leaving millions of people sweltering through the Juneteenth holiday, including in places like northern Maine where they rarely experience such conditions this early in the year.\n\nThe city of Caribou, Maine, just 10 miles from the Canadian border, saw a record 103 degrees (39.4 C) on the heat index, which combines heat and humidity. The region was under a heat advisory until Wednesday evening. Several residents said they were used to temperatures in the 70s and 80s in June and rarely this humid.\n\n\"I've seen this maybe one time before where it's been this hot in June,\" said Hannah Embelton, 22, a server at an ice cream store in Caribou, adding that customers were staying away from the soft serve options because they melt took quickly.\n\n\"We usually never get the brunt of all this heat and humidity because we are so north. Just how hot it is, that is all everyone is talking about,\" she added.\n\nOver at Moose River Campground, about 13 miles from the border, owner Lisa Hall was fixing a cabin faucet amid the sizzling temperatures and said such conditions are more common in mid July or early August.\n\n\"I am sweating like crazy and it's way too hot,\" she said.\n\nThe dangerous temperatures were expected to peak in the eastern Great Lakes and New England on Wednesday and Thursday, and in the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic on Friday and Saturday, the National Weather Service said. Heat index readings were expected to reach 100 to 105 degrees (37.7 C to 40.5 C) in many locations.\n\n\"We are seeing a ridge of upper level high pressure, which is bringing all this heat from the southern United States,\" said Kyle Pederson, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boston.\n\n\"That is just causing lots of hot temperature in the mid- to upper 90s and the heat index to reach over 100. It's just going to make it feel warmer than it is outside,\" he said. \"You will really feel that humidity and feel the heat quicker.\"\n\nThe conditions were expected to scale back some Juneteenth activities and limit options for relief. Cities that opened cooling centers this week advised that Wednesday's Juneteenth holiday meant some public libraries, senior centers and pools where residents could beat the heat would be closed.\n\nOfficials have urged people to limit outdoor activities when possible and to check in with family members and neighbors who may be vulnerable to the heat.\n\nIn New York, state parks have free admission Wednesday and Thursday, and select state-run pools and beaches opened early for swimming, Gov. Kathy Hochul said.\n\nNew York City beaches were open but public swimming pools there were closed until next week. The city has a list of hundreds of air conditioned sites that are free and open to the public. Public libraries, which have been used as cooling centers during other heat waves, were closed Wednesday because of the Juneteenth federal holiday.\n\nAnne-Laure Bonhomme, a 43 -- year-old health coach, was visiting sites in New York with her family. \"The humidity is pretty insane,\" she said.\n\nPeople and even zoo animals were forced to find ways to thwart the muggy weather.\n\nAn organization that provides produce to areas with limited access to fresh food in Columbus, Ohio, prepared frozen towels and packed cold water for their workers.\n\n\"Hydration is the key,\" said Monique McCoy, market manager for the Local Matters Veggie Van.\n\nHigh humidity lingered over Indianapolis Wednesday making the deceptively cloudy day warm and unenjoyable. Parks and walking trails were sparsely populated despite the holiday.\n\nThe Bennett family considered taking their 7-year-old and 4-month old to the pool or a splash pad on their day off of work, but decided it would still be too warm for the kids. Instead, Kayla and Sarah drove from Muncie to the Indiana State Museum in downtown Indianapolis to visit the indoor exhibits in the air conditioning.\n\nA recent study found that climate change is making heat waves move more slowly and affect more people for a longer time. Last year, the U.S. saw the greatest number of heat waves -- abnormally hot weather lasting more than two days -- since 1936.\n\nChicago broke a 1957 temperature record Monday with a high of 97 degrees (36.1 C). A cold front was expected to bring relief to areas near Lake Michigan on Thursday and Friday, the National Weather Service in Chicago said.\n\nIn California, wildfires erupted east of San Francisco in the state's historic Gold Country region and in the mountains of northern Los Angeles County after what had been a quiet start to fire season. Wildfires in southern New Mexico damaged 500 buildings Tuesday in a mountain village of 7,000 people that had been evacuated with little time to spare.\n\nMeanwhile, a fresh batch of tropical moisture was bringing an increasing threat of heavy rain and flash flooding to the central Gulf Coast. Hurricane season this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of weather at https://apnews.com/hub/weather", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com",

The center served about 200 people a day this week, but the number jumped to 300 for lunch during its Juneteenth festival. It also gave out roughly 450 bottles of water.\n\n\"Today was downright swampy, \"said Courtney Kay Meyers, director of development and communications. \"We're really struggling to keep up with water and demand for water.\"\n\nOfficials have urged people to limit outdoor activities when possible and to check in with family members and neighbors who may be vulnerable to the heat.\n\nIn New York, state parks have free admission Wednesday and Thursday, and select state-run pools and beaches opened early for swimming, Gov. Kathy Hochul said.\n\nNew York City beaches were open but public swimming pools there were closed until next week. The city has a list of hundreds of air conditioned sites that are free and open to the public. Public libraries, which have been used as cooling centers during other heat waves, were closed Wednesday because of the Juneteenth federal holiday.\n\nAnne-Laure Bonhomme, a 43 -- year-old health coach, was visiting sites in New York with her family. \"The humidity is pretty insane,\" she said.\n\nPeople and even zoo animals were forced to find ways to thwart the muggy weather.\n\nHigh humidity lingered over Indianapolis Wednesday making the deceptively cloudy day warm and unenjoyable. Parks and walking trails were sparsely populated despite the holiday.\n\nThe Bennett family considered taking their 7-year-old and 4-month old to the pool or a splash pad on their day off of work, but decided it would still be too warm for the kids. Instead, Kayla and Sarah drove from Muncie to the Indiana State Museum in downtown Indianapolis to visit the indoor exhibits in the air conditioning.\n\n\"We decided to do something inside,\" Kayla said.\n\nA recent study found that climate change is making heat waves move more slowly and affect more people for a longer time. Last year, the U.S. saw the greatest number of heat waves -- abnormally hot weather lasting more than two days -- since 1936.\n\nChicago broke a 1957 temperature record Monday with a high of 97 degrees (36.1 C). A cold front was expected to bring relief to areas near Lake Michigan on Thursday and Friday, the National Weather Service in Chicago said.\n\nIn California, wildfires erupted east of San Francisco in the state's historic Gold Country region and in the mountains of northern Los Angeles County after what had been a quiet start to fire season. Wildfires in southern New Mexico damaged 500 buildings Tuesday in a mountain village of 7,000 people that had been evacuated with little time to spare.\n\nMeanwhile, a fresh batch of tropical moisture was bringing an increasing threat of heavy rain and flash flooding to the central Gulf Coast. Hurricane season this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of weather at https://apnews.com/hub/weather", "source": {"uri": "santamariatimes.com",

(AP) -- A heat wave extending from the Midwest to New England moved closer to a breaking point Thursday, with millions of people sweating it out for another day.\n\nThe National Weather Service said the heat wave was expected to peak in the eastern Great Lakes and New England on Thursday, and in the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic on Friday or the weekend.\n\nHeat index readings, which combine temperature and humidity, were expected to surpass 100 degrees (37.7 C) in many locations, possibly setting some all-time records, the weather service said. Officials warned that record overnight temperatures would prevent natural cooling and allow the heat danger to build up indoors.\n\nIn a study published Thursday, a group of international scientists said human-caused climate change has dialed up the heat and drastically increased the odds of experiencing the killer heat that's been baking the Southwestern United States, Mexico and Central America this month. Last year, the U.S. saw the greatest number of heat waves -- abnormally hot weather lasting more than two days -- since 1936.\n\nIt's made for an unusually early start to extreme summer heat in northern New England this year. The city of Caribou, Maine, just 10 miles from the Canadian border, saw a record 103 degrees (39.4 C) on the heat index Wednesday, warmer than Miami.\n\n\"I've seen this maybe one time before where it's been this hot in June,\" said Hannah Embelton, 22, a server at an ice cream store in Caribou, adding that customers were staying away from the soft serve options because they melt too quickly.\n\n\"We usually never get the brunt of all this heat and humidity because we are so north. Just how hot it is, that is all everyone is talking about,\" she added.\n\nIt was already close to 90 degrees in Concord, New Hampshire, Thursday morning as John Dupont opened his kettle corn stand at the city's 50th annual Market Days Festival. He and his daughter set up two fans and were prepared to drape icy towels around their necks as the temperature climbed.\n\n\"This year is a little challenging because of all the heat. Our kettle gets up to 150,000 BTUs,\" he said.\n\nSome options for relief were limited by Juneteenth activities: Cities that opened cooling centers advised that some public libraries, senior centers and pools where residents could beat the heat were closed for Wednesday's holiday.\n\nIn Indianapolis, a daytime homeless service center picked up slack from closed cooling centers and food pantries. Horizon House served about 200 people a day this week, but the number jumped to 300 for lunch during its Juneteenth festival. It also gave out roughly 450 bottles of water.\n\n\"Today was downright swampy, \"said Courtney Kay Meyers, director of development and communications. \"We're really struggling to keep up with water and demand for water.\"\n\nOfficials have urged people to limit outdoor activities when possible and to check in with family members and neighbors who may be vulnerable to the heat.\n\nIn New York, state parks have free admission Thursday, and select state-run pools and beaches opened early for swimming, Gov.

Robert F. Bukaty/Associated Press\n\nTOLEDO, Ohio -- A blistering heat wave Wednesday extended from the Midwest to New England, leaving millions of people sweltering through the Juneteenth holiday, including in places like northern Maine where they rarely experience such conditions this early in the year.\n\nThe city of Caribou, Maine, just 10 miles from the Canadian border, saw a record 103 degrees on the heat index, which combines heat and humidity. The region was under a heat advisory until Wednesday evening. Several residents said they were used to temperatures in the 70s and 80s in June and rarely this humid.\n\n\"I've seen this maybe one time before where it's been this hot in June,\" said Hannah Embelton, 22, a server at an ice cream store in Caribou, adding that customers were staying away from the soft serve options because they melt too quickly.\n\nRelated Heat wave trips up power plants, prompting New England grid operator to issue warning\n\nEven before noon on Wednesday, the heat index in Maine soared to 100 degrees in Portland and Waterville with 103 in Sanford and Fryeburg, according to News Center Maine meteorologist Jason Nappi. Thursday is forecast to be just as hot.\n\nWe usually never get the brunt of all this heat and humidity because we are so north. Just how hot it is, that is all everyone is talking about,\" she added.\n\nOver at Moose River Campground, about 13 miles from the border, owner Lisa Hall was fixing a cabin faucet amid the sizzling temperatures and said such conditions are more common in mid July or early August.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I am sweating like crazy and it's way too hot,\" she said.\n\nThe dangerous temperatures were expected to peak in the eastern Great Lakes and New England on Wednesday and Thursday, and in the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic on Friday and Saturday, the National Weather Service said.

The region was under a heat advisory until Wednesday evening and temperatures in Caribou were hotter than Miami: 94 degrees compared with 89, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nSeveral residents said they were used to temperatures in the 70s and 80s in June and rarely this humid.\n\n\"I've seen this maybe one time before where it's been this hot in June,\" said Hannah Embelton, 22, a server at an ice cream store in Caribou, adding that customers were staying away from the soft serve options because they melt took quickly.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nIowa DCI: Wall Lake trucker David Schultz's death 'not a homicide' Jefferson, S.D. dad shares secret to fatherhood on Father's Day celebration Lost and found: How Arnolds Park got a miniature train back after more than 50 years Perley to step down as Thompson CEO; Beaulieu to take over Man dies in standoff with authorities in Sac County Former Sioux City hotel under renovation, to become high-rise senior housing this year Omaha ballpark seeks to ban two Texas A&M fans who were kicked out of College World Series game Tyson Foods heir suspended as CFO after second alcohol-related arrest Boat speed rule imposed on Okoboji lakes in wake of heavy rains, storms that also led to wastewater discharges Sioux City man pleads not guilty of manslaughter Our Opinion: WITCC settlement in human trafficking case raises more questions Marriage licenses for Woodbury County for June 17, 2024 Chainsaw sculptures among latest upgrades to Sioux City's historic Hubbard Park Top area softball performers: RSM last unbeaten team; Mentzer, Moreau swinging hot bats Man pleads not guilty in Sioux City fatal hit and run\n\n\"We usually never get the brunt of all this heat and humidity because we are so north. Just how hot it is, that is all everyone is talking about,\" she added.\n\nOver at Moose River Campground, about 13 miles from the border, owner Lisa Hall was fixing a cabin faucet amid the sizzling temperatures and said such conditions are more common in mid July or early August.\n\n\"I am sweating like crazy and it's way too hot,\" she said.\n\nThe dangerous temperatures were expected to peak in the eastern Great Lakes and New England on Wednesday and Thursday, and in the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic on Friday and Saturday, the National Weather Service said.

The center served about 200 people a day this week, but the number jumped to 300 for lunch during its Juneteenth festival. It also gave out roughly 450 bottles of water.\n\n\"Today was downright swampy, \"said Courtney Kay Meyers, director of development and communications. \"We're really struggling to keep up with water and demand for water.\"\n\nOfficials have urged people to limit outdoor activities when possible and to check in with family members and neighbors who may be vulnerable to the heat.\n\nIn New York, state parks have free admission Wednesday and Thursday, and select state-run pools and beaches opened early for swimming, Gov.

(AP) -- A heat wave extending from the Midwest to New England moved closer to a breaking point Thursday, with millions of people sweating it out for another day.\n\nThe National Weather Service said the heat wave was expected to peak in the eastern Great Lakes and New England on Thursday, and in the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic on Friday or the weekend.\n\nHeat index readings, which combine temperature and humidity, were expected to surpass 100 degrees (37.7 C) in many locations, possibly setting some all-time records, the weather service said. Officials warned that record overnight temperatures would prevent natural cooling and allow the heat danger to build up indoors.\n\nIn a study published Thursday, a group of international scientists said human-caused climate change has dialed up the heat and drastically increased the odds of experiencing the killer heat that's been baking the Southwestern United States, Mexico and Central America this month. Last year, the U.S. saw the greatest number of heat waves -- abnormally hot weather lasting more than two days -- since 1936.\n\nIt's made for an unusually early start to extreme summer heat in northern New England this year. The city of Caribou, Maine, just 10 miles from the Canadian border, saw a record 103 degrees (39.4 C) on the heat index Wednesday, warmer than Miami.\n\n\"I've seen this maybe one time before where it's been this hot in June,\" said Hannah Embelton, 22, a server at an ice cream store in Caribou, adding that customers were staying away from the soft serve options because they melt too quickly.\n\n\"We usually never get the brunt of all this heat and humidity because we are so north. Just how hot it is, that is all everyone is talking about,\" she added.\n\nIt was already close to 90 degrees in Concord, New Hampshire, Thursday morning as John Dupont opened his kettle corn stand at the city's 50th annual Market Days Festival. He and his daughter set up two fans and were prepared to drape icy towels around their necks as the temperature climbed.\n\n\"This year is a little challenging because of all the heat. Our kettle gets up to 150,000 BTUs,\" he said.\n\nSome options for relief were limited by Juneteenth activities: Cities that opened cooling centers advised that some public libraries, senior centers and pools where residents could beat the heat were closed for Wednesday's holiday.\n\nIn Indianapolis, a daytime homeless service center picked up slack from closed cooling centers and food pantries. Horizon House served about 200 people a day this week, but the number jumped to 300 for lunch during its Juneteenth festival. It also gave out roughly 450 bottles of water.\n\n\"Today was downright swampy, \"said Courtney Kay Meyers, director of development and communications. \"We're really struggling to keep up with water and demand for water.\"\n\nOfficials have urged people to limit outdoor activities when possible and to check in with family members and neighbors who may be vulnerable to the heat.\n\nIn New York, state parks have free admission Thursday, and select state-run pools and beaches opened early for swimming, Gov. Kathy Hochul said. New York City beaches were open but public swimming pools there don't open until next week. The city has a list of hundreds of air conditioned sites that are free and open to the public.\n\n\"The humidity is pretty insane,\" said Anne-Laure Bonhomme, a health coach who was sightseeing in New York with her family.\n\nChicago broke a 1957 temperature record Monday with a high of 97 degrees (36.1 C). A cold front was expected to bring relief to areas near Lake Michigan on Thursday and Friday, the weather service said.\n\nOcean waters are warmer as well, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, where the season's first named storm, Alberto, was dumping heavy rain and flash flooding along a stretch of the coast from Mexico to Louisiana. Hurricane season this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The region was under a heat advisory until Wednesday evening. Several residents said they were used to temperatures in the 70s and 80s in June and rarely this humid.\n\n\"I've seen this maybe one time before where it's been this hot in June,\" said Hannah Embelton, 22, a server at an ice cream store in Caribou, adding that customers were staying away from the soft serve options because they melt took quickly.\n\n\"We usually never get the brunt of all this heat and humidity because we are so north. Just how hot it is, that is all everyone is talking about,\" she added.\n\nOver at Moose River Campground, about 13 miles from the border, owner Lisa Hall was fixing a cabin faucet amid the sizzling temperatures and said such conditions are more common in mid July or early August.\n\n\"I am sweating like crazy and it's way too hot,\" she said.\n\nThe dangerous temperatures were expected to peak in the eastern Great Lakes and New England on Wednesday and Thursday, and in the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic on Friday and Saturday, the National Weather Service said. Heat index readings were expected to reach 100 to 105 degrees (37.7 C to 40.5 C) in many locations.\n\n\"We are seeing a ridge of upper level high pressure, which is bringing all this heat from the southern United States,\" said Kyle Pederson, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boston.\n\n\"That is just causing lots of hot temperature in the mid- to upper 90s and the heat index to reach over 100. It's just going to make it feel warmer than it is outside,\" he said. \"You will really feel that humidity and feel the heat quicker.\"\n\nThe conditions were expected to scale back some Juneteenth activities and limit options for relief.

The city has a list of hundreds of air conditioned sites that are free and open to the public. Public libraries, which have been used as cooling centers during other heat waves, were closed Wednesday because of the Juneteenth federal holiday.\n\nAnne-Laure Bonhomme, a 43 -- year-old health coach, was visiting sites in New York with her family. \"The humidity is pretty insane,\" she said.\n\nPeople and even zoo animals were forced to find ways to thwart the muggy weather.\n\nAn organization that provides produce to areas with limited access to fresh food in Columbus, Ohio, prepared frozen towels and packed cold water for their workers.\n\n\"Hydration is the key,\" said Monique McCoy, market manager for the Local Matters Veggie Van.\n\nHigh humidity lingered over Indianapolis Wednesday making the deceptively cloudy day warm and unenjoyable. Parks and walking trails were sparsely populated despite the holiday.\n\nThe Bennett family considered taking their 7-year-old and 4-month old to the pool or a splash pad on their day off of work, but decided it would still be too warm for the kids. Instead, Kayla and Sarah drove from Muncie to the Indiana State Museum in downtown Indianapolis to visit the indoor exhibits in the air conditioning.\n\nA recent study found that climate change is making heat waves move more slowly and affect more people for a longer time.

A cold front was expected to bring relief to areas near Lake Michigan on Thursday and Friday, the National Weather Service in Chicago said.\n\nIn California, wildfires erupted east of San Francisco in the state's historic Gold Country region and in the mountains of northern Los Angeles County after what had been a quiet start to fire season. Wildfires in southern New Mexico damaged 500 buildings Tuesday in a mountain village of 7,000 people that had been evacuated with little time to spare.\n\nMeanwhile, a fresh batch of tropical moisture was bringing an increasing threat of heavy rain and flash flooding to the central Gulf Coast.

High temperatures are expected to stay in the 90s in the nation's capital for the rest of the week as a heat wave builds into the Northeast.\n\nCONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- A heat wave extending from the Midwest to New England moved closer to a breaking point Thursday, with millions of people sweating it out for another day.\n\nThe National Weather Service said the heat wave was expected to peak in the eastern Great Lakes and New England on Thursday, and in the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic on Friday or the weekend.\n\nHeat index readings, which combine temperature and humidity, were expected to surpass 100 degrees (37.7 C) in many locations, possibly setting some all-time records, the weather service said. Officials warned that record overnight temperatures would prevent natural cooling and allow the heat danger to build up indoors.\n\nIn a study published Thursday, a group of international scientists said human-caused climate change has dialed up the heat and drastically increased the odds of experiencing the killer heat that's been baking the Southwestern United States, Mexico and Central America this month. Last year, the U.S. saw the greatest number of heat waves -- abnormally hot weather lasting more than two days -- since 1936.\n\nIt's made for an unusually early start to extreme summer heat in northern New England this year. The city of Caribou, Maine, just 10 miles from the Canadian border, saw a record 103 degrees (39.4 C) on the heat index Wednesday, warmer than Miami.\n\n\"I've seen this maybe one time before where it's been this hot in June,\" said Hannah Embelton, 22, a server at an ice cream store in Caribou, adding that customers were staying away from the soft serve options because they melt too quickly.\n\n\"We usually never get the brunt of all this heat and humidity because we are so north. Just how hot it is, that is all everyone is talking about,\" she added.\n\nIt was already close to 90 degrees in Concord, New Hampshire, Thursday morning as John Dupont opened his kettle corn stand at the city's 50th annual Market Days Festival. He and his daughter set up two fans and were prepared to drape icy towels around their necks as the temperature climbed.\n\n\"This year is a little challenging because of all the heat. Our kettle gets up to 150,000 BTUs,\" he said.\n\nSome options for relief were limited by Juneteenth activities: Cities that opened cooling centers advised that some public libraries, senior centers and pools where residents could beat the heat were closed for Wednesday's holiday.\n\nIn Indianapolis, a daytime homeless service center picked up slack from closed cooling centers and food pantries. Horizon House served about 200 people a day this week, but the number jumped to 300 for lunch during its Juneteenth festival. It also gave out roughly 450 bottles of water.\n\n\"Today was downright swampy, \"said Courtney Kay Meyers, director of development and communications. \"We're really struggling to keep up with water and demand for water.\"\n\nOfficials have urged people to limit outdoor activities when possible and to check in with family members and neighbors who may be vulnerable to the heat.\n\nIn New York, state parks have free admission Thursday, and select state-run pools and beaches opened early for swimming, Gov. Kathy Hochul said. New York City beaches were open but public swimming pools there don't open until next week. The city has a list of hundreds of air conditioned sites that are free and open to the public.\n\n\"The humidity is pretty insane,\" said Anne-Laure Bonhomme, a health coach who was sightseeing in New York with her family.\n\nChicago broke a 1957 temperature record Monday with a high of 97 degrees (36.1 C). A cold front was expected to bring relief to areas near Lake Michigan on Thursday and Friday, the weather service said.\n\nOcean waters are warmer as well, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, where the season's first named storm, Alberto, was dumping heavy rain and flash flooding along a stretch of the coast from Mexico to Louisiana. Hurricane season this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of weather at https://apnews.com/hub/weather", "source": {"uri": "wboc.com", "dataType":

Heat index readings were expected to reach 100 to 105 degrees (37.7 C to 40.5 C) in many locations.\n\n\"We are seeing a ridge of upper level high pressure, which is bringing all this heat from the southern United States,\" said Kyle Pederson, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boston.\n\n\"That is just causing lots of hot temperature in the mid- to upper 90s and the heat index to reach over 100.

The region was under a heat advisory until Wednesday evening and temperatures in Caribou were hotter than Miami: 94 degrees (34.4 C) compared with 89 (31.6 C), according to the National Weather Service.\n\nSeveral residents said they were used to temperatures in the 70s and 80s in June and rarely this humid.\n\n\"I've seen this maybe one time before where it's been this hot in June,\" said Hannah Embelton, 22, a server at an ice cream store in Caribou, adding that customers were staying away from the soft serve options because they melt took quickly.\n\n\"We usually never get the brunt of all this heat and humidity because we are so north. Just how hot it is, that is all everyone is talking about,\" she added.\n\nOver at Moose River Campground, about 13 miles from the border, owner Lisa Hall was fixing a cabin faucet amid the sizzling temperatures and said such conditions are more common in mid July or early August.\n\n\"I am sweating like crazy and it's way too hot,\" she said.\n\nThe dangerous temperatures were expected to peak in the eastern Great Lakes and New England on Wednesday and Thursday, and in the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic on Friday and Saturday, the National Weather Service said.

It's just going to make it feel warmer than it is outside,\" he said. \"You will really feel that humidity and feel the heat quicker.\"\n\nThe conditions were expected to scale back some Juneteenth activities and limited options for relief. Cities that opened cooling centers this week advised that Wednesday's holiday meant some public libraries, senior centers and pools where residents could beat the heat would be closed.\n\nThat affected services in Indianapolis, where Horizon House, a daytime homeless service center, picked up slack from closed cooling centers and food pantries. The center served about 200 people a day this week, but the number jumped to 300 for lunch during its Juneteenth festival. It also gave out roughly 450 bottles of water.\n\n\"Today was downright swampy, \"said Courtney Kay Meyers, director of development and communications. \"We're really struggling to keep up with water and demand for water.\"\n\nOfficials have urged people to limit outdoor activities when possible and to check in with family members and neighbors who may be vulnerable to the heat.\n\nIn New York, state parks have free admission Wednesday and Thursday, and select state-run pools and beaches opened early for swimming, Gov. Kathy Hochul said.\n\nNew York City beaches were open but public swimming pools there were closed until next week. The city has a list of hundreds of air conditioned sites that are free and open to the public. Public libraries, which have been used as cooling centers during other heat waves, were closed Wednesday because of the Juneteenth federal holiday.\n\nAnne-Laure Bonhomme, a 43 -- year-old health coach, was visiting sites in New York with her family. \"The humidity is pretty insane,\" she said.\n\nPeople and even zoo animals were forced to find ways to thwart the muggy weather.\n\nHigh humidity lingered over Indianapolis Wednesday making the deceptively cloudy day warm and unenjoyable.

Parks and walking trails were sparsely populated despite the holiday.\n\nThe Bennett family considered taking their 7-year-old and 4-month old to the pool or a splash pad on their day off of work, but decided it would still be too warm for the kids. Instead, Kayla and Sarah drove from Muncie to the Indiana State Museum in downtown Indianapolis to visit the indoor exhibits in the air conditioning.\n\n\"We decided to do something inside,\" Kayla said.\n\nA recent study found that climate change is making heat waves move more slowly and affect more people for a longer time.

(AP) - A heat wave extending from the Midwest to New England moved closer to a breaking point Thursday, with millions of people sweating it out for another day.\n\nThe National Weather Service said the heat wave was expected to peak in the eastern Great Lakes and New England on Thursday, and in the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic on Friday or the weekend.\n\nHeat index readings, which combine temperature and humidity, were expected to surpass 100 degrees (37.7 C) in many locations, possibly setting some all-time records, the weather service said. Officials warned that record overnight temperatures would prevent natural cooling and allow the heat danger to build up indoors.\n\nIn a study published Thursday, a group of international scientists said human-caused climate change has dialed up the heat and drastically increased the odds of experiencing the killer heat that's been baking the Southwestern United States, Mexico and Central America this month. Last year, the U.S. saw the greatest number of heat waves - abnormally hot weather lasting more than two days - since 1936.\n\nIt's made for an unusually early start to extreme summer heat in northern New England this year. The city of Caribou, Maine, just 10 miles from the Canadian border, saw a record 103 degrees (39.4 C) on the heat index Wednesday, warmer than Miami.\n\n\"I\u00b4ve seen this maybe one time before where it\u00b4s been this hot in June,\" said Hannah Embelton, 22, a server at an ice cream store in Caribou, adding that customers were staying away from the soft serve options because they melt too quickly.\n\nLevi Rush does a backflip off an old bridge abutment into the Saco River in Buxton, Maine, Tuesday, June 18, 2024.

Just how hot it is, that is all everyone is talking about,\" she added.\n\nIt was already close to 90 degrees in Concord, New Hampshire, Thursday morning as John Dupont opened his kettle corn stand at the city\u00b4s 50th annual Market Days Festival. He and his daughter set up two fans and were prepared to drape icy towels around their necks as the temperature climbed.\n\n\"This year is a little challenging because of all the heat. Our kettle gets up to 150,000 BTUs,\" he said.\n\nSome options for relief were limited by Juneteenth activities: Cities that opened cooling centers advised that some public libraries, senior centers and pools where residents could beat the heat were closed for Wednesday\u00b4s holiday.\n\nIn Indianapolis, a daytime homeless service center picked up slack from closed cooling centers and food pantries. Horizon House served about 200 people a day this week, but the number jumped to 300 for lunch during its Juneteenth festival. It also gave out roughly 450 bottles of water.\n\n\"Today was downright swampy, \"said Courtney Kay Meyers, director of development and communications. \"We\u00b4re really struggling to keep up with water and demand for water.\"\n\nOfficials have urged people to limit outdoor activities when possible and to check in with family members and neighbors who may be vulnerable to the heat.\n\nIn New York, state parks have free admission Thursday, and select state-run pools and beaches opened early for swimming, Gov. Kathy Hochul said. New York City beaches were open but public swimming pools there don't open until next week. The city has a list of hundreds of air conditioned sites that are free and open to the public.\n\n\"The humidity is pretty insane,\" said Anne-Laure Bonhomme, a health coach who was sightseeing in New York with her family.\n\nChicago broke a 1957 temperature record Monday with a high of 97 degrees (36.1 C). A cold front was expected to bring relief to areas near Lake Michigan on Thursday and Friday, the weather service said.\n\nOcean waters are warmer as well, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, where the season's first named storm, Alberto, was dumping heavy rain and flash flooding along a stretch of the coast from Mexico to Louisiana. Hurricane season this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory.\n\nFollow AP\u00b4s coverage of weather at https://apnews.com/hub/weather\n\nVisitors wear sun hats, sunglasses, and carry an umbrella to protect themselves from the sun as they sightsee near the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, June 19, 2024.

The region was under a heat advisory until Wednesday evening. Several residents said they were used to temperatures in the 70s and 80s in June and rarely this humid.\n\n\"I've seen this maybe one time before where it's been this hot in June,\" said Hannah Embelton, 22, a server at an ice cream store in Caribou, adding that customers were staying away from the soft serve options because they melt took quickly.\n\n\"We usually never get the brunt of all this heat and humidity because we are so north. Just how hot it is, that is all everyone is talking about,\" she added.\n\nOver at Moose River Campground, about 13 miles from the border, owner Lisa Hall was fixing a cabin faucet amid the sizzling temperatures and said such conditions are more common in mid July or early August.\n\n\"I am sweating like crazy and it's way too hot,\" she said.\n\nThe dangerous temperatures were expected to peak in the eastern Great Lakes and New England on Wednesday and Thursday, and in the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic on Friday and Saturday, the National Weather Service said. Heat index readings were expected to reach 100 to 105 degrees (37.7 C to 40.5 C) in many locations.\n\n\"We are seeing a ridge of upper level high pressure, which is bringing all this heat from the southern United States,\" said Kyle Pederson, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boston.\n\n\"That is just causing lots of hot temperature in the mid- to upper 90s and the heat index to reach over 100. It's just going to make it feel warmer than it is outside,\" he said. \"You will really feel that humidity and feel the heat quicker.\"\n\nThe conditions were expected to scale back some Juneteenth activities and limit options for relief. Cities that opened cooling centers this week advised that Wednesday's Juneteenth holiday meant some public libraries, senior centers and pools where residents could beat the heat would be closed.\n\nOfficials have urged people to limit outdoor activities when possible and to check in with family members and neighbors who may be vulnerable to the heat.\n\nIn New York, state parks have free admission Wednesday and Thursday, and select state-run pools and beaches opened early for swimming, Gov.

Parks and walking trails were sparsely populated despite the holiday.\n\nThe Bennett family considered taking their 7-year-old and 4-month old to the pool or a splash pad on their day off of work, but decided it would still be too warm for the kids. Instead, Kayla and Sarah drove from Muncie to the Indiana State Museum in downtown Indianapolis to visit the indoor exhibits in the air conditioning.\n\nA recent study found that climate change is making heat waves move more slowly and affect more people for a longer time.

Wildfires in southern New Mexico damaged 500 buildings Tuesday in a mountain village of 7,000 people that had been evacuated with little time to spare.\n\nMeanwhile, a fresh batch of tropical moisture was bringing an increasing threat of heavy rain and flash flooding to the central Gulf Coast.

The region was under a heat advisory until Wednesday evening and temperatures in Caribou were hotter than Miami: 94 degrees compared with 89, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nSeveral residents said they were used to temperatures in the 70s and 80s in June and rarely this humid.\n\n\"I've seen this maybe one time before where it's been this hot in June,\" said Hannah Embelton, 22, a server at an ice cream store in Caribou, adding that customers were staying away from the soft serve options because they melt took quickly.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Just how hot it is, that is all everyone is talking about,\" she added.\n\nOver at Moose River Campground, about 13 miles from the border, owner Lisa Hall was fixing a cabin faucet amid the sizzling temperatures and said such conditions are more common in mid July or early August.\n\n\"I am sweating like crazy and it's way too hot,\" she said.\n\nThe dangerous temperatures were expected to peak in the eastern Great Lakes and New England on Wednesday and Thursday, and in the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic on Friday and Saturday, the National Weather Service said. Heat index readings were expected to reach 100 to 105 degrees in many locations.\n\n\"We are seeing a ridge of upper level high pressure, which is bringing all this heat from the southern United States,\" said Kyle Pederson, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boston.\n\n\"That is just causing lots of hot temperature in the mid- to upper 90s and the heat index to reach over 100. It's just going to make it feel warmer than it is outside,\" he said. \"You will really feel that humidity and feel the heat quicker.\"\n\nThe conditions were expected to scale back some Juneteenth activities and limited options for relief. Cities that opened cooling centers this week advised that Wednesday's holiday meant some public libraries, senior centers and pools where residents could beat the heat would be closed.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThat affected services in Indianapolis, where Horizon House, a daytime homeless service center, picked up slack from closed cooling centers and food pantries. The center served about 200 people a day this week, but the number jumped to 300 for lunch during its Juneteenth festival. It also gave out roughly 450 bottles of water.\n\n\"Today was downright swampy, \"said Courtney Kay Meyers, director of development and communications. \"We're really struggling to keep up with water and demand for water.\"\n\nOfficials have urged people to limit outdoor activities when possible and to check in with family members and neighbors who may be vulnerable to the heat.\n\nIn New York, state parks have free admission Wednesday and Thursday, and select state-run pools and beaches opened early for swimming, Gov. Kathy Hochul said.\n\nNew York City beaches were open but public swimming pools there were closed until next week. The city has a list of hundreds of air conditioned sites that are free and open to the public. Public libraries, which have been used as cooling centers during other heat waves, were closed Wednesday because of the Juneteenth federal holiday.\n\nAnne-Laure Bonhomme, a 43-year-old health coach, was visiting sites in New York with her family. \"The humidity is pretty insane,\" she said.\n\nPeople and even zoo animals were forced to find ways to thwart the muggy weather.\n\nHigh humidity lingered over Indianapolis Wednesday making the deceptively cloudy day warm and unenjoyable. Parks and walking trails were sparsely populated despite the holiday.\n\nThe Bennett family considered taking their 7-year-old and 4-month old to the pool or a splash pad on their day off of work, but decided it would still be too warm for the kids. Instead, Kayla and Sarah drove from Muncie to the Indiana State Museum in downtown Indianapolis to visit the indoor exhibits in the air conditioning.\n\n\"We decided to do something inside,\" Kayla said.\n\nA recent study found that climate change is making heat waves move more slowly and affect more people for a longer time. Last year, the U.S. saw the greatest number of heat waves -- abnormally hot weather lasting more than two days -- since 1936.\n\nChicago broke a 1957 temperature record Monday with a high of 97 degrees. A cold front was expected to bring relief to areas near Lake Michigan on Thursday and Friday, the National Weather Service in Chicago said.\n\nIn California, wildfires erupted east of San Francisco in the state's historic Gold Country region and in the mountains of northern Los Angeles County after what had been a quiet start to fire season. Wildfires in southern New Mexico damaged 500 buildings Tuesday in a mountain village of 7,000 people that had been evacuated with little time to spare.\n\nEssential dog and cat safety tips for the hottest days of summer 1.

Just how hot it is, that is all everyone is talking about,\" she added.\n\nOver at Moose River Campground, about 13 miles from the border, owner Lisa Hall was fixing a cabin faucet amid the sizzling temperatures and said such conditions are more common in mid July or early August.\n\n\"I am sweating like crazy and it's way too hot,\" she said.\n\nThe dangerous temperatures were expected to peak in the eastern Great Lakes and New England on Wednesday and Thursday, and in the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic on Friday and Saturday, the National Weather Service said. Heat index readings were expected to reach 100 to 105 degrees in many locations.\n\n\"We are seeing a ridge of upper level high pressure, which is bringing all this heat from the southern United States,\" said Kyle Pederson, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boston.\n\n\"That is just causing lots of hot temperature in the mid- to upper 90s and the heat index to reach over 100. It's just going to make it feel warmer than it is outside,\" he said. \"You will really feel that humidity and feel the heat quicker.\"\n\nThe conditions were expected to scale back some Juneteenth activities and limited options for relief. Cities that opened cooling centers this week advised that Wednesday's holiday meant some public libraries, senior centers and pools where residents could beat the heat would be closed.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThat affected services in Indianapolis, where Horizon House, a daytime homeless service center, picked up slack from closed cooling centers and food pantries. The center served about 200 people a day this week, but the number jumped to 300 for lunch during its Juneteenth festival. It also gave out roughly 450 bottles of water.\n\n\"Today was downright swampy, \"said Courtney Kay Meyers, director of development and communications. \"We're really struggling to keep up with water and demand for water.\"\n\nOfficials have urged people to limit outdoor activities when possible and to check in with family members and neighbors who may be vulnerable to the heat.\n\nIn New York, state parks have free admission Wednesday and Thursday, and select state-run pools and beaches opened early for swimming, Gov.

The city has a list of hundreds of air conditioned sites that are free and open to the public. Public libraries, which have been used as cooling centers during other heat waves, were closed Wednesday because of the Juneteenth federal holiday.\n\nAnne-Laure Bonhomme, a 43-year-old health coach, was visiting sites in New York with her family. \"The humidity is pretty insane,\" she said.\n\nPeople and even zoo animals were forced to find ways to thwart the muggy weather.\n\nHigh humidity lingered over Indianapolis Wednesday making the deceptively cloudy day warm and unenjoyable. Parks and walking trails were sparsely populated despite the holiday.\n\nThe Bennett family considered taking their 7-year-old and 4-month old to the pool or a splash pad on their day off of work, but decided it would still be too warm for the kids. Instead, Kayla and Sarah drove from Muncie to the Indiana State Museum in downtown Indianapolis to visit the indoor exhibits in the air conditioning.\n\n\"We decided to do something inside,\" Kayla said.\n\nA recent study found that climate change is making heat waves move more slowly and affect more people for a longer time. Last year, the U.S. saw the greatest number of heat waves -- abnormally hot weather lasting more than two days -- since 1936.\n\nChicago broke a 1957 temperature record Monday with a high of 97 degrees. A cold front was expected to bring relief to areas near Lake Michigan on Thursday and Friday, the National Weather Service in Chicago said.\n\nIn California, wildfires erupted east of San Francisco in the state's historic Gold Country region and in the mountains of northern Los Angeles County after what had been a quiet start to fire season. Wildfires in southern New Mexico damaged 500 buildings Tuesday in a mountain village of 7,000 people that had been evacuated with little time to spare.\n\nEssential dog and cat safety tips for the hottest days of summer 1.

Heat index readings were expected to reach 100 to 105 degrees (37.7 C to 40.5 C) in many locations.\n\n\"We are seeing a ridge of upper level high pressure, which is bringing all this heat from the southern United States,\" said Kyle Pederson, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boston.\n\n\"That is just causing lots of hot temperature in the mid- to upper 90s and the heat index to reach over 100. It's just going to make it feel warmer than it is outside,\" he said. \"You will really feel that humidity and feel the heat quicker.\"\n\nThe conditions were expected to scale back some Juneteenth activities and limit options for relief. Cities that opened cooling centers this week advised that Wednesday's Juneteenth holiday meant some public libraries, senior centers and pools where residents could beat the heat would be closed.\n\nOfficials have urged people to limit outdoor activities when possible and to check in with family members and neighbors who may be vulnerable to the heat.\n\nIn New York, state parks have free admission Wednesday and Thursday, and select state-run pools and beaches opened early for swimming, Gov. Kathy Hochul said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nNew York City beaches were open but public swimming pools there were closed until next week. The city has a list of hundreds of air conditioned sites that are free and open to the public. Public libraries, which have been used as cooling centers during other heat waves, were closed Wednesday because of the Juneteenth federal holiday.\n\nAnne-Laure Bonhomme, a 43 -- year-old health coach, was visiting sites in New York with her family. \"The humidity is pretty insane,\" she said.\n\nPeople and even zoo animals were forced to find ways to thwart the muggy weather.\n\nAn organization that provides produce to areas with limited access to fresh food in Columbus, Ohio, prepared frozen towels and packed cold water for their workers.\n\n\"Hydration is the key,\" said Monique McCoy, market manager for the Local Matters Veggie Van.\n\nHigh humidity lingered over Indianapolis Wednesday making the deceptively cloudy day warm and unenjoyable. Parks and walking trails were sparsely populated despite the holiday.\n\nThe Bennett family considered taking their 7-year-old and 4-month old to the pool or a splash pad on their day off of work, but decided it would still be too warm for the kids. Instead, Kayla and Sarah drove from Muncie to the Indiana State Museum in downtown Indianapolis to visit the indoor exhibits in the air conditioning.\n\nA recent study found that climate change is making heat waves move more slowly and affect more people for a longer time. Last year, the U.S. saw the greatest number of heat waves -- abnormally hot weather lasting more than two days -- since 1936.\n\nChicago broke a 1957 temperature record Monday with a high of 97 degrees (36.1 C). A cold front was expected to bring relief to areas near Lake Michigan on Thursday and Friday, the National Weather Service in Chicago said.\n\nIn California, wildfires erupted east of San Francisco in the state's historic Gold Country region and in the mountains of northern Los Angeles County after what had been a quiet start to fire season. Wildfires in southern New Mexico damaged 500 buildings Tuesday in a mountain village of 7,000 people that had been evacuated with little time to spare.\n\nMeanwhile, a fresh batch of tropical moisture was bringing an increasing threat of heavy rain and flash flooding to the central Gulf Coast. Hurricane season this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of weather at https://apnews.com/hub/weather\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

(AP) -- A heat wave extending from the Midwest to New England moved closer to a breaking point Thursday, with millions of people sweating it out for another day.\n\nThe National Weather Service said the heat wave was expected to peak in the eastern Great Lakes and New England on Thursday, and in the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic on Friday or the weekend.\n\nHeat index readings, which combine temperature and humidity, were expected to surpass 100 degrees (37.7 C) in many locations, possibly setting some all-time records, the weather service said. Officials warned that record overnight temperatures would prevent natural cooling and allow the heat danger to build up indoors.\n\nIn a study published Thursday, a group of international scientists said human-caused climate change has dialed up the heat and drastically increased the odds of experiencing the killer heat that's been baking the Southwestern United States, Mexico and Central America this month. Last year, the U.S. saw the greatest number of heat waves -- abnormally hot weather lasting more than two days -- since 1936.\n\nIt's made for an unusually early start to extreme summer heat in northern New England this year. The city of Caribou, Maine, just 10 miles from the Canadian border, saw a record 103 degrees (39.4 C) on the heat index Wednesday, warmer than Miami.\n\n\"I've seen this maybe one time before where it's been this hot in June,\" said Hannah Embelton, 22, a server at an ice cream store in Caribou, adding that customers were staying away from the soft serve options because they melt too quickly.\n\n\"We usually never get the brunt of all this heat and humidity because we are so north. Just how hot it is, that is all everyone is talking about,\" she added.\n\nIt was already close to 90 degrees in Concord, New Hampshire, Thursday morning as John Dupont opened his kettle corn stand at the city's 50th annual Market Days Festival. He and his daughter set up two fans and were prepared to drape icy towels around their necks as the temperature climbed.\n\n\"This year is a little challenging because of all the heat. Our kettle gets up to 150,000 BTUs,\" he said.\n\nSome options for relief were limited by Juneteenth activities: Cities that opened cooling centers advised that some public libraries, senior centers and pools where residents could beat the heat were closed for Wednesday's holiday.\n\nToday's Top Headlines Tractor Supply could be coming to Aiken's Northside Aiken County Council still 'working on the details' of deal to sell old Aiken County Hospital Aiken County Public School District appoints Langston as Director of Teaching and Learning Voting begins for Aiken's Choice 2024 awards Savannah River Site-powered Voyager 1 operating normally again No property tax increase in finalized Aiken County budget for 2024-2025 Peach season demands 'sense of urgency' for Jimmy Forrest and family Aiken Women in Black celebrates 20 years of peace vigils Local eco-friendly initiative removes bags of litter from Aiken nature preserve grounds Deadline to apply for 2025 Masters Tournament tickets is near\n\nIn Indianapolis, a daytime homeless service center picked up slack from closed cooling centers and food pantries. Horizon House served about 200 people a day this week, but the number jumped to 300 for lunch during its Juneteenth festival. It also gave out roughly 450 bottles of water.\n\n\"Today was downright swampy, \"said Courtney Kay Meyers, director of development and communications. \"We're really struggling to keep up with water and demand for water.\"\n\nOfficials have urged people to limit outdoor activities when possible and to check in with family members and neighbors who may be vulnerable to the heat.\n\nIn New York, state parks have free admission Thursday, and select state-run pools and beaches opened early for swimming, Gov. Kathy Hochul said. New York City beaches were open but public swimming pools there don't open until next week. The city has a list of hundreds of air conditioned sites that are free and open to the public.\n\n\"The humidity is pretty insane,\" said Anne-Laure Bonhomme, a health coach who was sightseeing in New York with her family.\n\nChicago broke a 1957 temperature record Monday with a high of 97 degrees (36.1 C). A cold front was expected to bring relief to areas near Lake Michigan on Thursday and Friday, the weather service said.\n\nOcean waters are warmer as well, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, where the season's first named storm, Alberto, was dumping heavy rain and flash flooding along a stretch of the coast from Mexico to Louisiana. Hurricane season this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of weather at https://apnews.com/hub/weather", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com",

It's just going to make it feel warmer than it is outside.\" The conditions were expected to scale back some Juneteenth activities and limit options for relief. Cities that opened cooling centers this week advised that Wednesday's Juneteenth holiday meant some public libraries, senior centers, and pools where residents could beat the heat would be closed. Officials urged people to limit outdoor activities and to check in with family members and neighbors who may be vulnerable to the heat.

Officials warned that record overnight temperatures would prevent natural cooling and allow the heat danger to build up indoors.\n\nIn a study published Thursday, a group of international scientists said human-caused climate change has dialed up the heat and drastically increased the odds of experiencing the killer heat that's been baking the Southwestern United States, Mexico and Central America this month.

In central New Hampshire, Angela Wilcox took her two children and two nephews boating Thursday in search of the coldest swimming spot on Squam Lake, where they've stayed at the rustic Rockywold Deephaven Camps for 16 years.\n\n\"This is the hottest it's ever been, especially in June,\" Wilcox said. \"We're kind of shocked.\"\n\nCamp workers were delivering large blocks of ice to the cabins for refrigeration. A tradition at the camp for more than a century, the ice is harvested from the lake each winter and then packed with sawdust in an insulated storage hut. The method has kept fresh ice available throughout the summer and into the fall.\n\nFurther south in Concord, it was already close to 90 degrees as John Dupont opened his kettle corn stand at the city's 50th annual Market Days Festival. He and his daughter set up two fans and were prepared to drape icy towels around their necks as the temperature climbed.\n\n\"This year is a little challenging because of all the heat. Our kettle gets up to 150,000 BTUs,\" he said.\n\nIn Burlington, Vermont, Jack Hurlbut said he's never been so hot in his life.\n\n\"It sucks,\" the 28-year-old said. \"I live in Vermont for a reason, you know what I mean?\"\n\nHurlbut, who is experiencing homelessness, was hanging out with some others on a church lawn outside of the city's public library, which was serving as a cooling center. He'd slept nearby the night before and said he was trying to catch the shade without getting kicked out.\n\nOfficials have urged people to limit outdoor activities when possible and to check in with family members and neighbors who may be vulnerable to the heat.\n\nIn New York, state parks have free admission Thursday, and select state-run pools and beaches opened early for swimming, Gov. Kathy Hochul said. New York City's beaches were available but its public swimming pools don't open until next week. The city has a list of hundreds of air conditioned sites that are free and open to the public.\n\n\"The humidity is pretty insane,\" said Anne-Laure Bonhomme, a health coach who was sightseeing in New York with her family.\n\nMany school districts in New Jersey switched to early dismissals as the school year winds down, and at least two rescheduled their high school graduation ceremonies due to concerns about excessive heat and humidity.\n\nSome relief is on the way: A cold front is moving into areas near Lake Michigan on Thursday and Friday, the weather service said. Chicago broke a 1957 temperature record Monday with a high of 97 degrees (36.1 C).\n\nOcean waters are warmer as well, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, where the season's first named storm, Alberto, was dumping heavy rain and flash flooding along a stretch of the coast from Mexico to Louisiana.

(AP) -- A heat wave extending from the Midwest to New England moved closer to a breaking point Thursday, with millions of people sweating it out for another day.\n\nThe National Weather Service said the heat wave was expected to peak in the eastern Great Lakes and New England on Thursday, and in the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic on Friday or the weekend.\n\nHeat index readings, which combine temperature and humidity, were expected to surpass 100 degrees (37.7 C) in many locations, possibly setting some all-time records, the weather service said. Officials warned that record overnight temperatures would prevent natural cooling and allow the heat danger to build up indoors.\n\nIn a study published Thursday, a group of international scientists said human-caused climate change has dialed up the heat and drastically increased the odds of experiencing the killer heat that's been baking the Southwestern United States, Mexico and Central America this month. Last year, the U.S. saw the greatest number of heat waves -- abnormally hot weather lasting more than two days -- since 1936.\n\nIt's made for an unusually early start to extreme summer heat in northern New England this year. In central New Hampshire, Angela Wilcox took her two children and two nephews boating Thursday in search of the coldest swimming spot on Squam Lake, where they've stayed at the rustic Rockywold Deephaven Camps for 16 years.\n\n\"This is the hottest it's ever been, especially in June,\" Wilcox said. \"We're kind of shocked.\"\n\nCamp workers were delivering large blocks of ice to the cabins for refrigeration. A tradition at the camp for more than a century, the ice is harvested from the lake each winter and then packed with sawdust in an insulated storage hut. The method has kept fresh ice available throughout the summer and into the fall.\n\nFurther south in Concord, it was already close to 90 degrees as John Dupont opened his kettle corn stand at the city's 50th annual Market Days Festival. He and his daughter set up two fans and were prepared to drape icy towels around their necks as the temperature climbed.\n\n\"This year is a little challenging because of all the heat. Our kettle gets up to 150,000 BTUs,\" he said.\n\nIn Burlington, Vermont, Jack Hurlbut said he's never been so hot in his life.\n\n\"It sucks,\" the 28-year-old said. \"I live in Vermont for a reason, you know what I mean?\"\n\nHurlbut, who is experiencing homelessness, was hanging out with some others on a church lawn outside of the city's public library, which was serving as a cooling center. He'd slept nearby the night before and said he was trying to catch the shade without getting kicked out.\n\nOfficials have urged people to limit outdoor activities when possible and to check in with family members and neighbors who may be vulnerable to the heat.\n\nIn New York, state parks have free admission Thursday, and select state-run pools and beaches opened early for swimming, Gov. Kathy Hochul said. New York City's beaches were available but its public swimming pools don't open until next week. The city has a list of hundreds of air conditioned sites that are free and open to the public.\n\n\"The humidity is pretty insane,\" said Anne-Laure Bonhomme, a health coach who was sightseeing in New York with her family.\n\nMany school districts in New Jersey switched to early dismissals as the school year winds down, and at least two rescheduled their high school graduation ceremonies due to concerns about excessive heat and humidity.\n\nSome relief is on the way: A cold front is moving into areas near Lake Michigan on Thursday and Friday, the weather service said. Chicago broke a 1957 temperature record Monday with a high of 97 degrees (36.1 C).\n\nOcean waters are warmer as well, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, where the season's first named storm, Alberto, was dumping heavy rain and flash flooding along a stretch of the coast from Mexico to Louisiana. Hurricane season this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory.\n\nRamer reported from Concord, N.H.

(AP) -- As New England continued to bake in a heat wave Thursday, guests at one campground were keeping their food and beer cold with blocks of ice, harvested months earlier from a frozen lake.\n\nAnd while some relief is expected after Thursday's peak heat in the eastern Great Lakes and New England, the National Weather Service said scorching temperatures will linger across the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic region, and even grow in places, to as much as triple-digit highs in California and Arizona.\n\nOn Squam Lake in central New Hampshire, ice blocks about the size of microwave that had been packed in sawdust since winter were lifted from an insulated storage hut. It's been a tradition at the rustic Rockywold Deephaven Camps for more than a century, keeping fresh ice available throughout the summer and into the fall.\n\nAngela Wilcox, who has vacationed at the camp for 16 years, took her children and nephews boating Thursday in search of the lake's coldest swimming spot.\n\n\"This is the hottest it's ever been, especially in June,\" Wilcox said. \"We're kind of shocked.\"\n\nHeat index readings combining temperature and humidity were expected to surpass 100 degrees (37.7 C) in many locations across the country, possibly setting some all-time records, the weather service said, and because record overnight temperatures could prevent natural cooling, heat danger could build up indoors.\n\n\"Those without access to reliable air conditioning are urged to find a way to cool down,\" the service said in its forecast.\n\nIn a study published Thursday, a group of scientists said human-caused climate change has drastically increased the odds of experiencing the killer heat baking the Southwestern United States, Mexico and Central America this month. Last year, the U.S. saw the greatest number of heat waves -- abnormally hot weather lasting more than two days -- since 1936.\n\nOcean waters are warmer as well, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, where the season's first named storm, Alberto, was dumping heavy rain and flash flooding along a stretch of the coast from Mexico to Louisiana. Hurricane season this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory.\n\nIt's made for an unusually early start to summer extremes in the northeastern U.S.\n\nIt was already nearing 90 degrees (32.2 C) in New Hampshire as John Dupont opened his kettle corn stand at Concord's 50th annual Market Days Festival. He and his daughter set up two fans and were prepared to drape icy towels around their necks.\n\n\"This year is a little challenging because of all the heat. Our kettle gets up to 150,000 BTUs,\" he said.\n\nAt Johnson's Dairy Bar in Northwood, Camryn Hildredth tried offer customers an empty dish for that heartbreaking moment when a scoop of rapidly melting ice cream topples out of the cone, but not all would listen.\n\n\"Everybody asks if we have AC. We do not,\" she said. \"It's very hot and we get long lines, so it can get very rough sometimes.\"\n\nIn Burlington, Vermont, Jack Hurlbut said he's never been so hot in his life. \"I live in Vermont for a reason, you know what I mean?\" the 28-year-old said.\n\nHurlbut, who is experiencing homelessness, joined others in a shady spot on a lawn outside the public library, which was serving as a cooling center.\n\nNew York parks had free admission Thursday, and select state-run pools and beaches opened early for swimming, Gov. Kathy Hochul said. New York City's beaches were available and while its public swimming pools don't open until next week, the city keeps a list of hundreds of free air-conditioned sites.\n\n\"The humidity is pretty insane,\" said Anne-Laure Bonhomme, a health coach who was sightseeing in New York with her family.\n\nMany school districts in New Jersey switched to early dismissals as the school year winds down, and at least two rescheduled their high school graduation ceremonies due to concerns about excessive heat and humidity.\n\nWith much of Indiana broiling in the 90s, highway crews are starting shifts at 6 a.m., two hours earlier than in cooler seasons, and taking more frequent breaks in air-conditioned trucks in between filling potholes and other roadwork, said Kyleigh Cramer, a spokesperson for the Indiana Department of Transportation.\n\n\"They're able to get in those trucks and cool off right then and there because being out on the road is a little bit different than being in an office,\" Cramer said.\n\nSome relief is coming: A cold front is moving into areas near Lake Michigan on Thursday and Friday, the weather service said. Chicago broke a 1957 record Monday with a high of 97 degrees (36.1 C).\n\nRamer reported from Northwood, N.H.

The starting temperatures of the heat wave this year have already broken records.\n\nChicago saw a high of 97 degrees on Monday, June 17, breaking a 1957 temperature record. The NWS has reported that Wednesday will be another hot day, but a cold front is expected later in the week to bring relief to areas near Lake Michigan.\n\nThe NWS has published extensive advice to their website on how to cope with extreme temperatures. This advice includes wearing loose-fitting clothing, drinking water even if you're not thirsty, and staying indoors as much as possible.\n\nFor people who cannot stay indoors, they recommend taking

(AP) -- A heat wave from the Midwest to New England moved closer to a breaking point Thursday as millions of people sweated out another day.\n\nThe National Weather Service predicted it would peak in the eastern Great Lakes and New England Thursday and in the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic by the weekend, but said oppressive heat will linger or grow over much of the rest of the country, including triple-digit highs in California and Arizona.\n\nHeat index readings combining temperature and humidity were expected to surpass 100 degrees (37.7 C) in many locations, possibly setting some all-time records, the weather service said, and because record overnight temperatures could prevent natural cooling, heat danger could build up indoors.\n\n\"Those without access to reliable air conditioning are urged to find a way to cool down,\" the service said in its forecast.\n\nIn a study published Thursday, a group of scientists said human-caused climate change has drastically increased the odds of experiencing the killer heat baking the Southwestern United States, Mexico and Central America this month. Last year, the U.S. saw the greatest number of heat waves -- abnormally hot weather lasting more than two days -- since 1936.\n\nOcean waters are warmer as well, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, where the season's first named storm, Alberto, was dumping heavy rain and flash flooding along a stretch of the coast from Mexico to Louisiana. Hurricane season this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory.\n\nIt's made for an unusually early start to summer extremes in the northeastern U.S. In New Hampshire, Angela Wilcox took her two children and two nephews boating Thursday in search of the coldest swimming spot on Squam Lake, where they've stayed at the rustic Rockywold Deephaven Camps near the town of Holderness for 16 years.\n\n\"This is the hottest it's ever been, especially in June,\" Wilcox said. \"We're kind of shocked.\"\n\nCamp workers were delivering large blocks of ice to the cabins for refrigeration. A tradition at the camp for more than a century, the ice is harvested from the lake each winter and packed with sawdust in an insulated storage hut. The method has kept fresh ice available throughout the summer and into the fall.\n\nIt was already nearing 90 degrees (32.2 C) as John Dupont opened his kettle corn stand at Concord's 50th annual Market Days Festival. He and his daughter set up two fans and were prepared to drape icy towels around their necks.\n\n\"This year is a little challenging because of all the heat. Our kettle gets up to 150,000 BTUs,\" he said.\n\nAt Johnson's Dairy Bar in Northwood on Thursday, Camryn Hildredth tried offer customers an empty dish for that heartbreaking moment when a scoop of rapidly melting ice cream topples out of the cone, but not all would listen.\n\n\"Everybody asks if we have AC. We do not,\" she said. \"It's very hot and we get long lines, so it can get very rough sometimes.\"\n\nIn Burlington, Vermont, Jack Hurlbut said he's never been so hot in his life. \"I live in Vermont for a reason, you know what I mean?\" the 28-year-old said.\n\nHurlbut, who is experiencing homelessness, joined others in a shady spot on a lawn outside the public library, which was serving as a cooling center.\n\nNew York parks had free admission Thursday, and select state-run pools and beaches opened early for swimming, Gov. Kathy Hochul said. New York City's beaches were available and while its public swimming pools don't open until next week, the city keeps a list of hundreds of free air-conditioned sites.\n\n\"The humidity is pretty insane,\" said Anne-Laure Bonhomme, a health coach who was sightseeing in New York with her family.\n\nMany school districts in New Jersey switched to early dismissals as the school year winds down, and at least two rescheduled their high school graduation ceremonies due to concerns about excessive heat and humidity.\n\nWith much of Indiana broiling in the 90s, highway crews are starting shifts at 6 a.m., two hours earlier than in cooler seasons, and taking more frequent breaks in air-conditioned trucks in between filling potholes and other roadwork, said Kyleigh Cramer, a spokesperson for the Indiana Department of Transportation.\n\n\"They're able to get in those trucks and cool off right then and there because being out on the road is a little bit different than being in an office,\" Cramer said.\n\nSome relief is coming: A cold front is moving into areas near Lake Michigan on Thursday and Friday, the weather service said. Chicago broke a 1957 record Monday with a high of 97 degrees (36.1 C).\n\nRamer reported from Northwood, N.H.

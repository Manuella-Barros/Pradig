A poster to be used for the protest was set up outside the AAP office that read, 'Stop misusing ED and CBI'.The protest comes as the CBI is set to produce Kejriwal in court later today as his three-day custody comes to an end. Kejriwal, who was arrested by the central agency in the liquor policy case on Wednesday, will appear before the Rouse Avenue court at 7 pm.Kejriwal is already in Tihar Jail in connection with his alleged involvement in the money laundering case being probed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).The Delhi liquor policy case involves alleged irregularities in the 2021-22 excise policy, including modifications, undue favours to licensees, and the extension of L-1 licences without prior approval. The CBI is probing corruption charges, while the ED is investigating the alleged money laundering aspect.In July 2022, Delhi Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena recommended a CBI probe into the AAP government\u2019s 2021-22 excise policy, alleging \u201cdeliberate and gross procedural lapses\u201d, according to an assessment report prepared by Chief Secretary Naresh Kumar.Following the Home Ministry's directions for an inquiry into the matter, the CBI had in August 2022 registered a case against former Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, three Delhi government officials, 10 liquor licensees and unknown others.According to the CBI\u2019s FIR, the named accused were instrumental in \u201crecommending and taking decisions pertaining to excise policy for the year 2021-22 without the approval of the competent authority, with an intention to extend undue favours to the licensees' post tender\u201d.Published By: Prateek ChakrabortyPublished On: Jun 29, 2024ALSO READ | No bail for Arvind Kejriwal, High Court says trial court didn\u2019t apply its mindALSO READ | Court vs CBI over 'Arvind Kejriwal put onus of liquor policy on Manish Sisodia'Must Watch", "summary": "<a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/aap-bjp-office-protest-office-delhi-arvind-kejriwal-cbi-ed-arrest-liquor-policy-case-2559977-2024-06-29\"> <img align=\"left\" hspace=\"2\" height=\"180\" width=\"305\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202406/arvind-kejriwal-arrest-290208838-16x9_0.jpeg?VersionId=MAz9ZVmAmdylixJrnNvp4bLB4EvTmShg\"> </a> AAP to protest outside BJP office today against Arvind Kejriwal's arrest", "url": "https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/aap-bjp-office-protest-office-delhi-arvind-kejriwal-cbi-ed-arrest-liquor-policy-case-2559977-2024-06-29", "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202406/arvind-kejriwal-arrest-290208838-16x9_0.jpeg?VersionId=MAz9ZVmAmdylixJrnNvp4bLB4EvTmShg?size=1280:720", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:05:20", "author": "Amit Bhardwaj", "authors": ["Amit Bhardwaj"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.415}

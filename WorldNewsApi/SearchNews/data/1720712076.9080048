Polls opened in 20 EU countries early Sunday for the June 6\u20139 elections for a new European Parliament, the legislative branch of the 27-member bloc. Millions of Europeans have been casting their ballots this week in one of the world\u2019s biggest democratic elections. Right-wing parties are looking to gain more power amid a rise in the cost of living and farmers\u2019 discontent, while the wars in Gaza and Ukraine are also key topics weighing on the minds of voters. The economy, jobs, poverty and social exclusion, public health, and the future of Europe are also prominent issues. Official results are not expected before the last polling stations in all 27 EU nations close late Sunday. Pre-election surveys suggested that the mainstream conservative opposition, the Union bloc, can expect to remain Germany\u2019s strongest force in the EU legislature. They predict weak results for the three parties in Mr. Scholz\u2019s governing coalition, which has become very unpopular. The right-wing Alternative for Germany can expect gains compared with the 11 percent of the vote it won in 2019. The war just across the border in Ukraine has created fears that if Russia were to prevail, Poland and neighboring nations that were once under Moscow\u2019s control could be targeted next. A migration crisis is also playing out along another stretch of the eastern border with Belarus. Poland accuses Belarus and Russia of luring large numbers of migrants to the border to create instability. The crisis has been deadly, with a migrant recently stabbing to death a Polish soldier. Dozens of migrants, if not more, have also died in the swampy forest area since 2021. Prime Minister Donald Tusk has stressed national security, promising to strengthen border controls as he seeks a good showing for his pro-EU party. On the minds of some Poles is the nature of the EU itself. In a nation under foreign rule for long spans in the past, some Poles fear that the 27-member bloc is taking away too much power from individual nations. It was Bulgaria\u2019s sixth parliamentary election in three years. There were worries that voter fatigue and wide disillusionment with politicians who do not fulfill promises to fight corruption and introduce reforms could result in a low turnout and another fragmented parliament. Preliminary results are expected Monday in the voting for the 240 seats in the National Assembly and for 17 members in the European Parliament. The front-runners in the National Assembly elections were seen as the GERB party led by three-time Prime Minister Boyko Borissov and the reformist coalition We Continue the Change\u2013Democratic Bulgaria. His Freedom Party will be just one short of the combined seats of a Socialist Democrat-Greens alliance. In Belgium, voters will also get to elect federal and regional chambers and are forecast to back the right-wing Flemish nationalist party Vlaams Belang in record numbers, although it could still be kept from office by other parties. The government of Prime Minister Alexander De Croo will likely stay in office in a caretaker capacity for many months until a new multi-party coalition is formed.", "summary": "Voters across the European Union are going to the polls on the final day of voting for the European parliamentary elections.", "url": "https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/millions-head-to-polls-on-final-day-of-voting-in-eu-elections-5665384", "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/06/09/id5665385-European-Parliament-elections-GettyImages-2156155581-300x180.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 12:00:40", "author": "Epoch Times Staff", "authors": ["Epoch Times Staff"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.14}

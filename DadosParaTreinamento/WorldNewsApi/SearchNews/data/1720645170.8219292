He had all his friends over and they were singing happy birthday to him. He was so happy tears starting filling his eyes, which then resulted in mine filling up, and he thanked everyone for being there. In that moment, it hit me how we need to be careful not to realise to late that the simplest moments and most important moments are actually right in front of us and shared with the people we love. A memory like that is worth so much more then anything materialist in life. Best Actor/Actress: Blake Lively - Loved her in Gossip Girl. \u2013 really looking forward to seeing her in the new movie Ends With Us!

The whole night was incredible for me from start to finish and hands down the best gig I have ever been too. Morgan is such an entertainer and his band is just as fantastic as him. Best Song: I absolutely love Cody Johnson\u2019s song Til You Can\u2019t. The meaning of the song resonates with me. The song's chorus plays as a message to go after life before it's too late, to make the most of every opportunity and every relationship while there's still time. Best Book: Oprah Winfrey \u2013 What I Know For Sure. Best Movie: The Notebook. I just love it. I watch it maybe twice a month! Best Holiday: Has to be when I went to Nashville, Tennessee. My mother and I went back In 2018. It was my first time there. We had such an amazing time. Once you land in Nashville, you just immerse yourself in the heart of country music as you explore iconic attractions such as the Grand Ole Opry and the Country Music Hall of Fame. You can\u2019t help but feel the rhythm of the city's bustling nightlife on Broadway, where live music fills the air every night and throughout the day also. Best Restaurant: Anyone that knows me, knows I love my food so picking one would be so hard. I would probably choose The Curragower or Aces. These restaurants are both in Limerick City which is close by to me! They serve amazing food! Definitely recommend a visit to both! Best Beauty Product: Sol De Janeiro Bum Bum Cream. Love love love! All the girls will agree. Best Friend: My mother is my best friend, with whom I share all my problems and life choices with. Like a true friend she is always there with me in good and bad times. She makes sure there is always a smile on my face and I am always free of all troubles. Best Joke: What do you call a well-balanced horse? \u2026 Stable ;) Best Advice: Money comes and goes but time has no refund For more information on Clodagh and her upcoming gigs be sure to follow her social media pages: Instagram: Clodagh Lawlor Music Facebook: Clodagh Lawlor Music TikTok: Clodagh Lawlor Music Get the latest country music news, interviews and pictures straight to your phone by joining our exclusive Facebook page - here", "summary": "My Best: The Clare native opens up about her bond with her nephew Jackson and the song and gig she loves the most, and she reveals her favourite book and place to eat", "url": "https://www.rsvplive.ie/news/celebs/country-musics-clodagh-lawlor-relationship-32974465", "image": "https://i2-prod.rsvplive.ie/news/celebs/article32974416.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Clodagh-Lawlorjpegjpgle.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:16:30", "author": "Keeley Ryan", "authors": ["Keeley Ryan"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.633}

Around the country, some colleges have called in police to disband encampments, while others, including Rutgers and Brown, have negotiated agreements with protesters, only to face criticism from Jewish groups and some lawmakers.\n\n\" READ MORE: While a few other universities reach compromises with protesters, why can't Penn?\n\nAlso Monday, Columbia University announced that it had canceled its main commencement ceremony as pro-Palestinian protests there continue. Penn has not commented on its plans for commencement, scheduled for May 20.\n\nPenn Faculty for Justice in Palestine called Jameson's email \"a textbook example of how admins are trying to delegitimize campus protests.\n\n\"It adjudicates the legitimacy of encampments entirely by how disruptive/uncomfortable they make some, rather than by what is happening in Gaza & Rafah,\" the group wrote.\n\nMembers of the faculty senate executive committee last week expressed differing views on the encampment but concurred that the university should work to \"deescalate tensions\" and \"find a negotiated resolution.\"\n\n\" READ MORE: Penn protester climbs Ben Franklin statue; encampment at Rutgers University ends peacefully\n\nJameson acknowledged in his email that local public officials and law enforcement also have recommended that the university continue to focus on de-escalating tensions.\n\nHe wrote that the university has been trying, but is concerned about reports that there are documents circulating with instructions to escalate a protest \"through building occupations and violence.\"\n\nHe said he has met twice with protesters and has proposed additional meetings, but that the protesters have made additional demands and demonstrated \"an unwillingness to negotiate on reasonable terms to a conclusion.\n\n\"I believe there are alternative paths and am willing to pursue all reasonable options to avoid escalation and further disruption to our community,\" he wrote. \"But passion for a cause does not entitle anyone to act beyond the rules that govern and protect us. Protests that threaten or harass, that disrupt the access of others to spaces and facilities, or that make us unsafe inevitably lose support and undermine their cause.\"\n\nThe two sides have remained at a stalemate, with the university insisting the encampment come down and protesters saying they won't negotiate until the university removes the threat of disciplinary action and the dismantling of the encampment.\n\nThe university has no intention of withdrawing its disciplinary actions against students and possibly faculty, Jameson made clear.\n\n\"We are continuing to implement student conduct procedures, which may result in the inability of some of our students to graduate or continue their education at Penn in subsequent years,\" he wrote. \"The roles, responsibilities, and activities of Penn faculty and staff members in the encampment are also under review.\"\n\nJameson asserted that the protest has not been peaceful.\n\n\"Two cherished Penn landmarks, the Benjamin Franklin statue and the Button, have been defaced and vandalized,\" he wrote. \"There have been disturbing reports of harassing and threatening speech.\"\n\nHe said protesters on Wednesday attempted to threaten and provoke Penn police officers, and on Friday the administration said it received \"an alarming video that showed a Penn student being barred entry to the encampment and threatened.\"\n\n\"Penn Public Safety has opened an investigation and is in touch with the student to provide support,\" Jameson said. \"Protestors within the encampment have also described being spit on, harassed, and threatened....

Penn seek clash, police refuse to clear encampment By David Isaac", "body": "https://www.jns.org/protesters-at-penn-seek-clash-police-refuse-to-clear-encampment/\n\nAs tensions escalate at a Gaza Solidarity Encampment at the University of Pennsylvania, administrators are taking a dialogue and de-escalation approach, possibly because they have no choice.\n\nU. Penn asked the Philadelphia Police Department (PPD) to dismantle the encampment, but the police refused, the student-run Daily Pennsylvanian claimed on May 2.\n\nPolice asked that the university first provide proof that the encampment \"presents an imminent danger,\" reported the paper, citing a source familiar with the matter.\n\nIf accurate (and the Philadelphia police refused to confirm or deny the report), it suggests the PPD is creating a new standard for enforcing the law. As the university points out, \"The encampment itself violates the university's facilities policies.\"\n\nIn response to JNS requests for clarification, the police said, \"We do not publicly discuss specific planning or engagement strategies related to ongoing situations. Our response will be based on the specific circumstances of each situation.\"\n\nThe office of the interim university president was also vague, telling JNS, \"We have reached out to the City of Philadelphia to ensure we have the necessary resources to keep our community safe. The Mayor's Office has asked for more information, and we are providing it.\"\n\nThe protesters may have sympathy among senior public officials. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, a George Soros-funded DA sharply criticized for his soft-on-crime policies, visited the protesters three times, saying the purpose of his third visit on May 2 was \"to find out what the truth is.\"\n\nThe encampment has not been peaceful, judging from a letter sent Monday to the Penn community by interim President J. Larry Jameson. (President Liz Magill was forced out after backlash for her testimony before Congress, in which she failed to recognize calls for genocide against Jews as violating the university's code of conduct.)\n\n\"The encampment should end. It is in violation of our policies, it is disrupting campus operations and events, and it is causing fear for many in our large, diverse community, especially among our Jewish students,\" the letter states.\n\n\"Some have aimed to characterize this as a peaceful protest. It is not. Two cherished Penn landmarks, the Benjamin Franklin statue and the Button, have been defaced and vandalized,\" it said.\n\n\"There have been disturbing reports of harassing and threatening speech. On Wednesday night, protesters threatened and attempted to provoke Penn Public Safety police officers. On Friday, we were made aware of an alarming video that showed a Penn student being barred entry to the encampment and threatened.\"\n\nDespite the escalation, the letter called for a \"measured approach\" in line with advice from police and public officials, \"who recommend that we continue to focus on de-escalation and dialogue before taking steps that could inflame tensions.\n\n\"However, we are concerned that many of the protestors occupying the encampment on College Green are seeking such a confrontation. We have heard reports of circulating documents with instructions for escalating a protest, including through building occupations and violence,\" the letter notes.\n\nWhile warning of the growing dangers (\"Every day the encampment exists, the campus is less safe\") Jameson maintains a continued willingness \"to pursue reasonable options\" (despite then acknowledging the protesters' \"unwillingness to negotiate on reasonable terms to a conclusion\").\n\nThe schizophrenic nature of the letter lends credence to the student paper's report that the administration wants to remove the protesters, yet doesn't have the resources, i.e. police backing, to do so.\n\nPolice have entered the campus but on a limited basis. They came on May 2 to separate pro- and anti-Israel rallies.\n\nThat day, about 20 officers removed two anti-Israel protesters who hopped onto the Ben Franklin statue in front of College Hall, leading to a clash between organizers and police officers.\n\n\"Organizers knocked down all the barricades surrounding the statue and rushed the statue, linking arms around the base. Police fell back after the interaction,\" the newspaper reported.\n\nThe pro-Israel rally on Thursday culminated in a march to the office of the interim president, where the Philadelphia chapter of the Israeli-American Council (IAC) delivered a petition signed by more than 3,000 verified Penn students and faculty.\n\nThe petition called for the university to enforce its notice of trespass and remove the anti-Israel encampment. (Penn has issued trespassing notices to protesters and posted signs reading, \"Your activities are in violation of state and local laws, as well as university policy.\")\n\nOn April 26, the university ordered the encampment to disband. An email that day addressed to the Penn community indicates that the protesters caused problems from the start. (The encampment was only established the day before.)\n\nSigned by interim President Jameson, Provost John L. Jackson, Jr., and Senior Executive Vice President Craig R. Carnaroli, it states: \"The harassing and intimidating comments and actions by some of the protesters, which were reported and documented by many in our community, violate Penn's open expression guidelines and state and federal law, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.\"\n\nFailure to deal with the anti-Israel protesters forced a more than 100-year-old tradition on campus to make way. Hey Day, where Penn juniors mark their advance to the senior class, has been celebrated since 1916.\n\nNormally, the juniors march down Locust Walk to College Green. Due to the protest, which has commandeered the green, the May 2 celebratory walk on May 2 ended a block earlier at Annenberg Plaza.\n\nChristopher Tremoglie, a Penn alumnus, writing in The Washington Examiner on Friday, described the College Green as looking \"like a dirty, trashy, polluted country. A malodorous stench emanated from the encampment. Tents and signs were propped up all over the lawn that contained the usual hyperbolic hysteria and left-wing messaging.\"\n\nHe noticed that many at the encampment were not students. \"Some seemed to be young adults who were either unemployed or professional protesters.\"\n\nABC News reported that the protesters were a mix of people from Drexel University, Temple University and other organizations.\n\nThat outsiders have joined the campus protests only recently came to light. On May 2, New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced that nearly half of the anti-Israel protesters arrested at Columbia University and City College of New York were not students.", "source": {"uri":

Larry Jameson, in a Monday email to the campus, reiterated that the pro-Palestinian encampment should come down, but said the university is weighing its response against the risk that any forceful action could cause.\n\nAt Penn, he said the risk is more significant because of the university's open campus location in West Philadelphia.\n\n\"It is in violation of our policies,\" he said of the encampment, \"it is disrupting campus operations and events, and it is causing fear for many in our large, diverse community, especially among our Jewish students. But any response to the encampment must balance possible escalation of the current situation with the need to protect the safety and rights of everyone.\"\n\nThe university's position, however, could change, he emphasized.\n\n\"We will maintain an enhanced security presence to support physical safety and will adjust our response as conditions warrant,\" he wrote.\n\nHis statement came as the encampment was in day 12 and as finals are about to begin at the Ivy League institution. Around the country, some colleges have called in police to disband encampments, while others, including Rutgers and Brown, have negotiated agreements with protesters, only to face criticism from Jewish groups and some lawmakers.\n\nRutgers President Jonathan Holloway said during a meeting of the board of governors Monday that the university has received thousands of emails expressing \"frustration or dismay\" since it negotiated an agreement last week that led to the voluntary dismantling of the pro-Palestinian encampment there.\n\nOne New Jersey senator has called for hearings into the matter, while another condemned the university's action.\n\nThe agreement included commitments for the president and chair of the joint committee on investments to meet with up to five students to discuss their request for Rutgers to divest from any firm connected to Israel, the establishment of an Arab Cultural Center and staff training in anti-Palestinian, anti-Arab, and anti-Muslim racism.\n\n\"I am confident in our decisions,\" Holloway said. \"They allowed us to maintain a safe and controlled environment, to protect Rutgers students and Rutgers property, and to assure that our students' academic progress -- taking finals and completing the semester -- was not impeded.\"\n\nNo changes to Penn's commencement plan\n\nAlso Monday, Columbia University announced that it had canceled its main commencement ceremony as pro-Palestinian protests there continue. Smaller school-specific ceremonies will be held, the school said. Penn has not announced any changes to its commencement, scheduled for May 20.\n\nPenn Faculty for Justice in Palestine called Jameson's email \"a textbook example of how admins are trying to delegitimize campus protests.\"\n\n\"It adjudicates the legitimacy of encampments entirely by how disruptive/uncomfortable they make some, rather than by what is happening in Gaza & Rafah,\" the group wrote.\n\nMembers of the faculty senate executive committee last week expressed differing views on the encampment but concurred that the university should work to \"de-escalate tensions\" and \"find a negotiated resolution.\"\n\nAt the encampment Monday morning, a lone police officer watched the cluster of 35 tents from the steps of Van Pelt Library. Inside the encampment, all was calm. A group of students were singing \"Big Rock Candy Mountain,\" a ditty by bluegrass singer Harry McClintock about a utopia.\n\nDown Locust Walk, an encampment member chatted about the definition of Zionism with a man in a kippah. A barricade stood between them.\n\nJameson acknowledged in his email that local public officials and law enforcement have recommended that the university continue to focus on de-escalating tensions.\n\nHe wrote that the university has been trying, but is concerned about reports that there are documents circulating with instructions to escalate a protest \"through building occupations and violence.\"\n\nHe said he has met twice with protesters and has proposed additional meetings, but that the protesters have made more demands and have been unwilling \"to negotiate on reasonable terms.\"\n\nStill at a stalemate\n\nThe two sides have remained at a stalemate, with the university insisting the encampment come down and protesters saying they won't negotiate until the university removes the threat of disciplinary action and the dismantling of the encampment.\n\nSophia Rosser, a Penn junior and student organizer involved with the encampment, said she was \"disappointed\" by Jameson's message, which she believes misconstrued both the encampment's existence and administrators' negotiations with its members.\n\n\"We have been trying to engage in good faith negotiations. It's the university that has been refusing,\" said Rossi. \"We don't think good faith negotiations can occur while the university is lording threats of arrest and other disciplinary actions over us.\"\n\nFor negotiations to continue, student organizers asked the university to agree to not send police inside the encampment and to withdraw disciplinary notices sent to three students for alleged violations of Penn's guidelines of open expression, which govern free speech and protest on campus.\n\nThe university has no intention of withdrawing its disciplinary actions, Jameson made clear.\n\n\"We are continuing to implement student conduct procedures, which may result in the inability of some of our students to graduate or continue their education at Penn in subsequent years,\" he wrote. \"The roles, responsibilities, and activities of Penn faculty and staff members in the encampment are also under review.\"\n\nEncampment organizers questioned Jameson's assertion that there were fliers circulating with escalation instructions.\n\n\"That's just (a) rumor,\" said Nneka Azuka, 28, an encampment member from Germantown who has attended occasional classes at Penn over the last year. \"Our main focus is keeping people safe.\"\n\nOver 2,500 people across the United States have been arrested for participating in encampments on college campuses, where city and state police forces have been called to disband the protests. At Columbia University, a New York City police officer accidentally fired a gun while clearing protesters from a building on campus. Officers at Arizona State University and the University of Texas at Austin discharged pepper spray, rubber bullets and explosives while breaking up pro-Palestinian demonstrations.\n\nRossi and Azuka said flashpoints such as those, plus the fear of doxxing, are why organizers have encouraged encampment members to cover their faces and avoid giving their IDs to Penn administrators. There are websites dedicated to tracking and shaming anti-Zionist protesters, Rossi said, and they've read about several instances where expressing support for Gaza has cost people job opportunities.\n\nReports of harassment and threats mount\n\nJameson asserted that the protest has not been peaceful, noting that both the Benjamin Franklin statue and the Button have been vandalized and reports of harassing and threatening speech.\n\nHe said protesters on Wednesday attempted to threaten and provoke Penn police officers, and on Friday the administration said it received \"an alarming video that showed a Penn student being barred entry to the encampment and threatened.\"\n\nThe video shows someone shining a flashlight in the student's face and warning him: \"Hope you got a good doctor. How's your dental plan?\"\n\n\"Penn Public Safety has opened an investigation and is in touch with the student to provide support,\" Jameson said.\n\nHe acknowledged that protesters also have reported being spit on, harassed and threatened. Last week, a man was charged with having cutting instruments in public places after entering the encampment with a large a knife. Another was cited for harassment after misrepresenting himself as a university employee and spraying down tents with chemicals.\n\nAnd on Sunday, video circulated on social media of counterprotesters chanting \"wake up terrorists\" while banging pots and pans and calling for \"UCLA 2.0'' a reference to the encampment at the University of California, Los Angeles, where people were allowed to physically attack encampment members with little police intervention.\n\nJewish students have self-reported 132 incidents of harassment surrounding the encampment since its start, according to the results of a survey conducted by the Penn President's Jewish Student Advisory Council and obtained by The Philadelphia Inquirer. The majority of the complaints stemmed from the encampment's existence, non-Penn members and controversial chants, while others called out specific incidents of confrontation. One Jewish student reported being called a \"dirty liar\" while counterprotesting, while another claimed he was called a homophobic slur while walking past the tents.\n\n\"Although protest is most certainly an important part of our democracy, occupying our property is most certainly not,\" one wrote.\n\n\u00a92024 The Philadelphia Inquirer.

Penn seek clash, police refuse to clear encampment - JNS.org", "body": "The University of Pennsylvania campus in Philadelphia. Credit: SINITAR/Shutterstock.\n\nAs tensions escalate at a Gaza Solidarity Encampment at the University of Pennsylvania, administrators are taking a dialogue and de-escalation approach, possibly because they have no choice.\n\nU. Penn asked the Philadelphia Police Department (PPD) to dismantle the encampment, but the police refused, the student-run Daily Pennsylvanian claimed on May 2.\n\nPolice asked that the university first provide proof that the encampment \"presents an imminent danger,\" reported the paper, citing a source familiar with the matter.\n\nIf accurate (and the Philadelphia police refused to confirm or deny the report), it suggests the PPD is creating a new standard for enforcing the law. As the university points out, \"The encampment itself violates the university's facilities policies.\"\n\nIn response to JNS requests for clarification, the police said, \"We do not publicly discuss specific planning or engagement strategies related to ongoing situations. Our response will be based on the specific circumstances of each situation.\"\n\nThe office of the interim university president was also vague, telling JNS, \"We have reached out to the City of Philadelphia to ensure we have the necessary resources to keep our community safe. The Mayor's Office has asked for more information, and we are providing it.\"\n\nA George Soros-funded DA\n\nThe protesters may have sympathy among senior public officials. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, a George Soros-funded DA sharply criticized for his soft-on-crime policies, visited the protesters three times, saying the purpose of his third visit on May 2 was \"to find out what the truth is.\"\n\nThe encampment has not been peaceful, judging from a letter sent Monday to the Penn community by interim President J. Larry Jameson. (President Liz Magill was forced out after backlash for her testimony before Congress, in which she failed to recognize calls for genocide against Jews as violating the university's code of conduct.)\n\n\"The encampment should end. It is in violation of our policies, it is disrupting campus operations and events, and it is causing fear for many in our large, diverse community, especially among our Jewish students,\" the letter states.\n\n\"Some have aimed to characterize this as a peaceful protest. It is not. Two cherished Penn landmarks, the Benjamin Franklin statue and the Button, have been defaced and vandalized,\" it said.\n\n\"There have been disturbing reports of harassing and threatening speech. On Wednesday night, protesters threatened and attempted to provoke Penn Public Safety police officers. On Friday, we were made aware of an alarming video that showed a Penn student being barred entry to the encampment and threatened.\"\n\nDespite the escalation, the letter called for a \"measured approach\" in line with advice from police and public officials, \"who recommend that we continue to focus on de-escalation and dialogue before taking steps that could inflame tensions.\n\n\"However, we are concerned that many of the protestors occupying the encampment on College Green are seeking such a confrontation. We have heard reports of circulating documents with instructions for escalating a protest, including through building occupations and violence,\" the letter notes.\n\nWhile warning of the growing dangers (\"Every day the encampment exists, the campus is less safe\") Jameson maintains a continued willingness \"to pursue reasonable options\" (despite then acknowledging the protesters' \"unwillingness to negotiate on reasonable terms to a conclusion\").\n\nThe schizophrenic nature of the letter lends credence to the student paper's report that the administration wants to remove the protesters, yet doesn't have the resources, i.e. police backing, to do so.\n\nPolice have entered the campus but on a limited basis. They came on May 2 to separate pro- and anti-Israel rallies.\n\nThat day, about 20 officers removed two anti-Israel protesters who hopped onto the Ben Franklin statue in front of College Hall, leading to a clash between organizers and police officers.\n\n\"Organizers knocked down all the barricades surrounding the statue and rushed the statue, linking arms around the base. Police fell back after the interaction,\" the newspaper reported.\n\nThe pro-Israel rally on Thursday culminated in a march to the office of the interim president, where the Philadelphia chapter of the Israeli-American Council (IAC) delivered a petition signed by more than 3,000 verified Penn students and faculty.\n\nNotice of trespass\n\nThe petition called for the university to enforce its notice of trespass and remove the anti-Israel encampment. (Penn has issued trespassing notices to protesters and posted signs reading, \"Your activities are in violation of state and local laws, as well as university policy.\")\n\nOn April 26, the university ordered the encampment to disband. An email that day addressed to the Penn community indicates that the protesters caused problems from the start. (The encampment was only established the day before.)\n\nSigned by interim President Jameson, Provost John L. Jackson, Jr., and Senior Executive Vice President Craig R. Carnaroli, it states: \"The harassing and intimidating comments and actions by some of the protesters, which were reported and documented by many in our community, violate Penn's open expression guidelines and state and federal law, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.\"\n\nFailure to deal with the anti-Israel protesters forced a more than 100-year-old tradition on campus to make way. Hey Day, where Penn juniors mark their advance to the senior class, has been celebrated since 1916.\n\nNormally, the juniors march down Locust Walk to College Green. Due to the protest, which has commandeered the green, the May 2 celebratory walk on May 2 ended a block earlier at Annenberg Plaza.\n\nChristopher Tremoglie, a Penn alumnus, writing in The Washington Examiner on Friday, described the College Green as looking \"like a dirty, trashy, polluted country. A malodorous stench emanated from the encampment. Tents and signs were propped up all over the lawn that contained the usual hyperbolic hysteria and left-wing messaging.\"\n\nHe noticed that many at the encampment were not students. \"Some seemed to be young adults who were either unemployed or professional protesters.\"\n\nABC News reported that the protesters were a mix of people from Drexel University, Temple University and other organizations.\n\nThat outsiders have joined the campus protests only recently came to light. On May 2, New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced that nearly half of the anti-Israel protesters arrested at Columbia University and City College of New York were not students.", "source": {"uri":

Protesters then drew an inverted red triangle on the Benjamin Franklin statue's forehead, which has conflicting meanings as a reference to a Palestinian flag and the target markers used in terror attacks, as police officers flanked the barricade.\n\n\"Penn continues to focus on the safety of our campus, including expanding security presence in response to the expansion of the encampment, despite our efforts to resolve this situation,\" read a statement issued by the university Wednesday night.\n\nThe triangle appeared to have been washed off of Franklin's forehead by Thursday morning, and had been replaced by a whiteboard that encampment members have been updating with the death toll in Gaza, which has ticked past 34,000 Palestinians as Israeli forces prepare to enter Rafah.\n\nThe encampment is part of a broader movement on college campuses across the United States that is calling for universities to disclose their funding sources and divest their endowments from entities benefiting from the ongoing war in Gaza.\n\nTwelve disciplinary hearings have been scheduled for Penn students involved in the encampment over violations of the university's Guidelines on Open Expression, or rules for expressing free speech and protesting on campus. The university issued trespassing notices one day after the encampment set up, and Penn President J. Larry Jameson has repeatedly condemned the protest.\n\n\" READ MORE: What is divestment?

But any response to the encampment must balance possible escalation of the current situation with the need to protect the safety and rights of everyone,\" Jameson said in a statement issued Monday\n\nThe encampment's expansion comes after a round of negotiations that organizers characterized as favorable.\n\n\"It felt like we were making progress with the school,\" a Penn graduate student who attended a two-hour-long negotiation session Tuesday with university leadership previously told The Inquirer.\n\n\" READ MORE: Penn leaders hold third meeting with encampment members: 'It felt like we were making progress,' one student said.\n\nMore than 2,600 people have been arrested for participating in pro-Palestinian encampments, according to a tracker from The Appeal. Universities have asked city and state police forces to disband the protests, resulting in a wide array of unrest.\n\nA New York City police officer called to Columbia University accidentally fired a gun while removing protesters from a campus building, while officers at the University of Arizona and the University of Texas at Austin discharged rubber bullets and pepper balls while breaking up their respective encampments. At the University of California Los Angeles, officers stood by for hours as counter-protesters beat encampment members with sticks and shot off fireworks.\n\nDisciplinary proceedings for student organizers at Penn could \"result in the inability ... to graduate or continue their education ... in subsequent years,\" Jameson said. The university has also requested support from the Philadelphia Police Department in disbanding the encampment, which city officials have been reluctant to offer.\n\n\" READ MORE: Penn weighs risk of removing encampment, saying it 'is causing fear for many'\n\nJameson contended that the protests have not been peaceful, citing vandalism to the Franklin statue, reports of threatening speech, and instances of agitation from counter-protesters. Over the past two weeks, a man entered the encampment with a large a knife, another was cited for harassment after spraying down tents with chemicals, and videos posted to Instagram people call for a \"UCLA 2.0'' while banging banging pots and pans outside the barricades.\n\nJewish students have reported 132 incidents of harassment surrounding the encampment, according to the results of a survey conducted by the Penn President's Jewish Student Advisory Council.\n\n\"I feel betrayed by the university, who just two days ago said that everyday the encampment exists, it presents a danger to the

She did not want to give her last name because of doxxing and privacy concerns.\n\nOrganizers said part of the meeting was dedicated to breaking down their demands for Penn to disclose and divest from companies profiting from the conflict in Gaza. Organizers would not elaborate on other sticking points in negotiations.\n\nPenn declined to comment on the session.\n\nPenn originally had told protesters they could have an outside representative during the negotiation session, but when protesters told the university they wanted District Attorney Larry Krasner and State Rep. Rick Krajewski as facilitators, Penn changed course, according to Krajewski.\n\nPenn administrators said they would only meet with those affiliated with Penn, he said.\n\n\" READ MORE: Penn weighs risk of removing encampment, saying it 'is causing fear for many'\n\nKrajewski said Tuesday evening that he was glad they met anyway, even though he and Krasner could not attend.\n\n\"At the end of the day, my position is trying to achieve a peaceful resolution that feels mutually satisfiable,\" he said. \"Them being able to meet is hopefully a sign that things are moving in the right direction. I'm only interested in facilitating as part of getting to the goal. If both sides feel they can achieve that without me being in the room, that's fine.\"\n\nKrasner was not immediately available.\n\nThe latest volley was part of a continued effort in recent days by city officials to urge Penn and encampment leaders to resume negotiations, as the encampment nears its two-week mark, finals begin, and graduation for the West Philadelphia Ivy League approaches.\n\nPenn's quest for support from city officials has also gotten some pushback, according to two sources close to the conversations. There remains a unified front among city leaders -- including between Mayor Cherelle L. Parker, Police Commissioner Kevin Bethel, and Krasner -- that the encampment protest in its current form should not be disbanded using force, and that Penn should resolve the matter peacefully, the sources said. Penn President J. Larry Jameson acknowledged the city's position in his statement Monday morning.\n\nThe sources, who asked not to be identified in order to discuss private conversations, said that city leaders want to avoid anything that could remotely resemble the confrontation between police and protesters at UCLA, Columbia, and other colleges over the past two weeks. More than 2,500 people have been arrested at campus protests since April 18, according to the New York Times tally.\n\n\" READ MORE: Is the call to divest feasible? Here's why there are hurdles to Penn protesters' demands.\n\nPenn has asked the Philadelphia Police Department to assist on any potential action against the encampment, but officials including Bethel have been hesitant to make any commitments, according to two people familiar with the discussions. Police have told Penn that officers will provide backup support in the event of any planned clearing -- but that the university must provide 48 hours written notice for them to do so.\n\nThe sources said that city officials have also questioned why Penn would not use its own police force to take action -- and there is a shared skepticism that it could be a \"set up.\" If PPD leads the clearing and something goes awry, Penn could in theory wash its hands of responsibility and blame the city, said the sources.\n\nPhiladelphia police have a memorandum of understanding with Penn -- as they do with other area universities -- that says while Penn police are the primary reporting agency for any crimes on campus or in the immediate area, PPD leads investigations and handles arrests. Though the MOU is not legally binding, city police would ultimately end up playing a central role in any forced disbandment, and as sources described it, don't want \"to be left holding the bag.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the mayor's office declined to comment.\n\n\" READ MORE: While a few other universities reach compromises with protesters, why can't Penn?\n\nThere is also concern among officials, according to the sources, that if law enforcement moves in to clear the encampment, the matter would not be resolved. Instead, the sources said, officials fear that protesters would only return in greater numbers, and that a law enforcement response could lead to unrest and potentially inspire opportunists to loot local business corridors.\n\nStill, police are sympathetic to the position Penn is in, and are trying to balance students' needs, protestors' First Amendment rights, and prevent any city-wide escalation, one source said.\n\nUntil Tuesday, Penn administrators and leaders with the encampment have been at a stalemate. They had been giving each other a list of pre-meeting conditions that neither side would likely ever agree to meet. Penn had asked protestors to disband the encampment before they would consider their demands, while protesters feel the encampment is their only leverage.\n\nMeanwhile, encampment representatives had asked Penn to drop disciplinary proceedings against students and agree not to use police to take the down the encampment. Penn has filed disciplinary charges against an additional nine students, bringing the total to 12, protesters said in a press release Tuesday.\n\nJameson in his Monday email to the campus said disciplinary procedures were continuing and could result in some students not being able to graduate or return to Penn to finish their education.\n\nDespite the more positive outlook after Tuesday's meeting, organizers were not overly optimistic, calling it \"just one meeting.\" They declined to say when another meeting would take place but said members of the encampment were ready for prolonged stays, long after commencement, if necessary.\n\n\"We are not intentionally planning to disrupt the graduation,\" said Cece, the graduate student. She added Penn should lay protesters' demands at the forefront if they are concerned about the optics of the camp ahead of commencement.\n\nKrajewski, a Penn alum and Democrat who represents parts of West Philadelphia that include the university, said Penn administrators have not been consistent in their conversations and conditions. He said he and Krasner were hoping to attend Tuesday's negotiations to observe and encourage ongoing conversations and, ultimately, a peaceful resolution.\n\n\"I think the best path to addressing any safety concerns the university might have is to truly have open negotiations,\" he said earlier in the day Tuesday. \"I think the university can set an example for other institutions.\"\n\nThere are significant hurdles to reaching an agreement. Protesters want the university to commit to divesting its financial holdings from any companies profiting from Israel's war on Hamas, and Penn has stated unequivocally and repeatedly that it opposes sanctions, boycotts, or disinvestment targeted against Israel.\n\nIf they do strike an agreement, Penn very likely could face another uproar from those opposed to negotiating with protesters. Rutgers president said Monday that the university has received thousands of emails since striking an agreement last week that voluntarily brought down its encampments, and some legislators have been critical, too.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "susan_snyder@inquirer.com", "name": "Susan Snyder", "type": "author",

Local police equipped with riot gear prepared to clear them from the area, but ultimately stood down for reasons that remained unclear.\n\nFollowing this escalation, Penn increased security in other areas of campus and has, for now, declined to ask police for help in quelling the demonstration. In the interim, Van Pelt Library's main entrance has been made inaccessible to students and no one, including Jewish students and staff, is allowed to enter the Penn Hillel building, the campus newspaper reported.\n\n\"Penn continues to focus on the safety of our campus, including expanding security presence in response to the expansion of the encampment, despite our efforts to resolve this situation,\" the university said in a statement issued on Wednesday night.\n\nThe development came just a day after Penn's interim president, Larry Jameson, suggested that the demonstrators have exhausted the school's tolerance for a situation that Jameson described as dangerous and disruptive of university business. He cited that in addition to being a safety hazard, the pro-Hamas mob has committed acts of vandalism, defacing a statue of Benjamin Franklin, one of the United States' Founding Fathers, and \"The Button,\" a sculpture built in the early 1980s.\n\n\"The encampment should end. It is in violation of our policies, it is disrupting campus operations and events, and it causing fear for many in our large, diverse community, especially among our Jewish students,\" Jameson said in a statement. \"But any response to the encampment must balance possible escalation of the current situation with the need to protect the safety and rights of everyone.\"\n\nJameson then expressed fear about what would happen during a clash between police and protesters, explaining that Penn is \"an open campus in a large city.\" However, he added, \"I am distressed and disappointed by the actions of the protesters, which violate our rules and goals.\"\n\nThe administration has been negotiating with students and faculty leading the protest for several days, The Daily Pennsylvanian reported earlier this week. In addition to divestment from Israel, leaders of the anti-Zionist camp are demanding that the university vacate a suspension of Penn Students Against the Occupation of Palestine, which the school shut down after multiple rules violations. While the paper did not state which conditions the university has refused to accept, it reported earlier in the week that Penn has filed disciplinary charges against nine students -- an action the protesters have deemed unacceptable.\n\n\"Due to the administration's continued bad-faith negotiations in our meeting this afternoon, the Gaza Solidarity encampment expands!\" Penn Against the Occupation, which is operating in defiance of its suspension, said in a social media post on Wednesday. \"We need you on College Green now!\"\n\nOn Thursday, Neetu Arnold -- a research fellow at the National Association of Scholars and author of Hijacked: The Capture of America's Middle East Studies Centers -- told The Algemeiner that Penn administrators narrowed their options by choosing not to clear the encampment sooner. Arnold has visited it several times herself and watched conditions there deteriorate in real time.\n\n\"Penn administrators should have addressed the encampments in its early days when the situation was still relatively tame,\" Arnold said. \"There were already signs that things would escalate. When I visited campus on the second day of the demonstration, protesters had already vandalized the Ben Franklin statue in front of College Hall. The university could have taken action then. Instead, they issued empty threats, and now the protesters aren't taking them seriously.\"\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania is one of many schools where students have taken over sections of campuses and refused to leave unless administrators condemn and boycott Israel. Footage of the protests has shown demonstrators chanting in support of Hamas, calling for the destruction of Israel, and even threatening to harm members of the Jewish community on campus. In many cases, activists have also lambasted the US and Western civilization more broadly.\n\nAntisemitism fueled by anti-Zionism exploded at the university long before Hamas' massacre across southern Israel on Oct. 7. In September, it hosted \"The Palestine Writes Literature Festival,\" which included speakers such as Palestinian researcher Salman Abu Sitta, who once promoted antisemitic tropes, saying in an interview, \"Jews were hated in Europe because they played a role in the destruction of the economy in some of the countries, so they would hate them.\" Another controversial figure invited to the event was former Pink Floyd vocalist Roger Waters, whose long record of anti-Jewish snipes was the subject of a documentary released last year.\n\nPenn's hosting of \"Palestine Writes\" festival took place, an unidentified male walked into the university's Hillel building behind a staffer and shouted \"F -- k the Jews\" and \"Jesus Christ is king!\" before overturning tables, podium stands, and chairs, according to students and school officials who spoke with The Algemeiner. Days earlier, just before the Jewish New Year of Rosh Hashanah, a giant swastika was graffitied in the basement of the university's Stuart Weitzman School of Design.\n\nOne day before the event took place, an unidentified male walked into the university's Hillel building behind a staffer and shouted \"F -- k the Jews\" and \"Jesus Christ is king!\" before overturning tables, podium stands, and chairs, according to students and school officials who spoke with The Algemeiner. Days earlier, just before the Jewish New Year of Rosh Hashanah, a giant swastika was graffitied in the basement of the university's Stuart Weitzman School of Design.\n\nFormer Penn president Elizabeth

Yakoby shared on X on Monday that a protester had brought a slingshot and switchblade into the encampment.\n\n\"It has been frustrating to see the media report as though these encampments are peaceful,\" said Yakoby. \"How much more documentation and videos need to be released?\"\n\nYakoby said that the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine's flag had been erected at the encampment. At a Tuesday rally in front of the vandalized statue of US founding father Benjamin Franklin in which Marc Lamont Hill was a guest speaker, the flag of the US State Department-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization was waved from a prominent position. Yakoby on Monday shared a photograph of a protester perched on Franklin's statue using the hand signal for the red triangle, used in Hamas propaganda to denote a terrorist target.\n\nSupport for Hamas\n\n\"[Izz ad-din] Al-Qassam [Brigades], make us proud, kill another soldier now,\" protesters had chanted in support of the Hamas military wing, according to Yakoby.\n\nIn addition to the defacement of the Franklin statue, Yakoby published other acts of vandalism of school property, and that two American flags that he had erected on Tuesday had been torn down and desecrated. Yakoby shared on X chalk writing that called for \"death to the Israeli state.\" The UPenn administration said Monday that the Button statue had also been defaced.\n\nJewish students have been faced by aggression from the protesters, who he said have been harassed and spat on. Yakoby on Friday shared a video of a student who was threatened with violence by a mob of protesters as he walked through the campus, and had a strobe light flashed in his eyes.\n\nYakoby told The Post that he and other concerned students had warned the administration about escalation, but had by Friday had received no response. On Thursday he had delivered a petition with 3,200 signatures demanding the removal of the encampment that had been erected on April 25, which also received no response.\n\nDespite the administration's inaction, \"We know the administration already believes the encampment is unsafe,\" said Yakoby, since it had issued a statement on April 26 against violence and harassment, though the student noted that the problem had only intensified.\n\n\"Blatant violations of University policies and credible reports of harassing and intimidating conduct compel us to protect the safety and security of our campus community,\" said a statement by Interim President J. Larry Jameson and other administrators. \"The vandalism of the statue in front of College Hall with antisemitic graffiti was especially reprehensible and will be investigated as a hate crime. As we have repeatedly emphasized, we will uphold free speech and the productive exchange of ideas, but we will not allow any actions that harass, threaten, or intimidate others.\"\n\nYakoby said that since that statement, the administration had not communicated with the rest of the school on the issue, providing no leadership. Jameson issued a statement on Monday, calling for de-escalation and an end to the encampment, as \"it is causing fear for many in our large, diverse community, especially among our Jewish students. But any response to the encampment must balance possible escalation of the current situation with the need to protect the safety and rights of everyone.\"\n\n\"We are concerned that many of the protestors occupying the encampment on College Green are seeking such a confrontation. We have heard reports of circulating documents with instructions for escalating a protest, including through building occupations and violence,\" said Jameson, listing almost all the dangers that had been related by Yakoby, expressing concern that non-student activists had joined the encampment.\n\nPenn Freedom School for Palestine shared the encampment's response on Monday, charging that he had not been negotiating in good faith and rejecting the idea that the settlement posed a threat, blaming counter-protesters for any confrontations.\n\n\"We are a non-violent gathering of students and community members,\" said the encampment. \"By clearly prioritizing the safety of certain Penn students over others, you have deepened our community divide more than our movement ever could.\"\n\nYakoby took to social media on Tuesday to dismiss the administration's statement as \"meaningless words,\" and that since the encampment had grown and protesters had chanted \"we don't want no Zionists here\" and one activists called to \"Kill the Zionists.\"\n\nThe violent statements join others related by Yakoby, including calling Jewish counter-protesters \"Hitler Youth,\" \"Hitler's children,\" and \"Zios get F**ked.\"\n\nYakoby said that he was frustrated with the administration, which he believed had made a mistake by not removing the encampment immediately. This failure continued with lack of action because of \"moral indifference\" and \"a lack of courage.\"\n\n\"Listen to your students, stick by your words, and assure that the core academic mission of the university is upheld,\" Yakoby called upon the administration.", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Follow our live updates on the Gaza Solidarity Encampment here and all of our coverage here.\n\nPenn placed six student organizers affiliated with the Gaza Solidarity Encampment on mandatory leaves of absence on Thursday morning, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nA University spokesperson told The Daily Pennsylvanian that the Vice Provost for University Life issued the mandatory leaves of absence in accordance with University policies pending the results of disciplinary investigations by Penn's Center for Community Standards and Accountability.\n\nA Penn undergraduate originally announced at a press conference at 12 p.m. that the student organizers were suspended, but the source familiar with the matter clarified that this was not the case. The same undergraduate also alleged that one student organizer was evicted without notice from their dorm. The DP could not immediately confirm the speaker's allegations about the student's eviction.\n\nThe six student organizers received letters from Vice Provost for University Life Karu Kozuma notifying them of the mandatory leaves of absence. In a letter addressed to one of the individuals and obtained by The Daily Pennsylvanian, Kozuma writes that the student's participation in the encampment has contributed to \"increasingly unsafe conditions\" and \"a situation that poses a threat to order and safety.\"\n\nThe letter cites the Charter of the University of Pennsylvania Student Disciplinary System (Section III.D.) as justification for the disciplinary measure. Those issued the \"mandatory temporary leave of absence\" are barred from all University-related activities and Penn facilities. One student was unable to access her dorm room after her PennCard was deactivated, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer.\n\n\"Violation of the restrictions above may result in further disciplinary action,\" the letter concludes. \"The University reserves the right to modify your status or impose additional restrictions if it determines, in its sole discretion, that such action is warranted by new information.\"\n\nAccording to the University handbook, a mandatory leave of absence is used in \"extraordinary circumstances\" for \"when a student's presence on campus is deemed by the University to be a threat to order, health, safety, or the conduct of the University's educational mission.\"\n\nThe handbook adds that \"at the respondent's request, and where feasible, the [Office of Student Conduct] may expedite the investigation of a complaint and the disciplinary hearing against a student placed on a mandatory temporary leave of absence.\"\n\nTwelve students previously received disciplinary notices due to their involvement with the encampment. It remains unclear whether the University will pursue further action against the remaining six students. The disciplinary action marks the University's most significant response to date, as it has repeatedly declined to take action to disband the encampment, which numbered approximately 40 tents on Thursday.\n\nThe disciplined students have lost all PennCard access. Organizers said the majority of those disciplined were issued against seniors, and they are unsure of how the action will impact eligibility for those seniors to graduate or receive their degrees.\n\nPenn Students Against the Occupation of Palestine wrote in a statement on Instagram that the six students did not receive hearings before Provost John Jackson Jr., as required by the Charter of the University Disciplinary System. In the statement, PAO also alleges that the decision was made without consultation and approval of each student's academic dean.\n\nThe Daily Pennsylvanian could not confirm the allegations. A request for comment was left with a University spokesperson.\n\n\"These cases have been manipulated to keep perceived leaders of the encampment off campus,\" the statement read. \"This is a corruption of the Community Standards and Accountability process, devoid of open expression policies, and clear proof it is University administrators -- not organizers -- who are bad-faith actors.\"\n\nThe statement also says that the disciplinary measures were conveyed by Vice Provost for University Life Karu Kozuma this morning. It says that Kozuma's letter told students they cannot enter academic buildings, be present on campus, or participate in programming -- including classes and graduation-related activities.\n\nTwo of the students banned from campus are on the encampment's negotiations team, while the student locked out of her dorm is an international student, according to the PAO statement.\n\nThe student at the press conference added that organizers met with University leadership on Wednesday, and described negotiations as having gone \"incredibly poorly.\" They said that while it seemed Penn would initially grant some leeway with their demands, it now appears that administrators will not respond to any demands.\n\n\"From day one, we have insisted with the university that students receive disciplinary amnesty from the school,\" the student said. \"The University has again and again refused this. We didn't think that the school would stoop so low, but clearly they have.\"\n\nThe student blamed the University Board of Trustees for the lack of response to their demands, alleging that the Board of Trustees \"has an incredible amount of money invested in the Israeli apartheid state\" and that Penn is committed to its \"financial commitment to these investments.\"\n\nThe Daily Pennsylvanian could not independently corroborate these allegations.\n\nAs the University escalates disciplinary action against participants, the Gaza Solidarity Encampment expanded onto the east side of College Green Wednesday evening, nearly two weeks after it first began. At around 7:30 p.m., members began moving barriers and at least eight tents onto the east side of College Green as a crowd of 200 people chanted, \"Disclose, divest, we will not stop, we will not rest.\"\n\nThe encampment is demanding that Penn divests from Israel, corporations that benefit from the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, and Israeli institutions committing \"scholasticide.\" It also demands that Penn defend Palestinian students, including granting amnesty to students involved in pro-Palestinian activism and reinstating Penn Students Against the Occupation of Palestine.\n\n\"We are here protesting against a genocide that has threatened tens of thousands of lives,\" the student said at the press conference. \"I don't think that we are going to be deterred because the school thinks they can stop us from six [leaves of absence].\"\n\nPAO further described the administration's allegations that the encampment contributes to \"increasingly unsafe conditions\" as a \"display of hypocrisy.\"\n\nThe group wrote that they reject the characterization of student organizers as \"exceptional threats,\" criticizing Penn for failing to confront \"academic devastation, scholasticide, and destruction of over 445 academic institutions in Gaza.\" It also criticized the University for not taking action against counterprotesters.\n\n\"Karu Kozuma did get one thing right: 'you and other organizers have persisted,'\" the statement read. \"And we will continue to do so.\"\n\nThe encampment's expansion and the conduct of some participants has drawn criticism from some Jewish community members, including College senior Eyal Yakoby and Perelman School of Medicine professor Benjamin Abella -- both of whom have organized events in opposition to the encampment. Yakoby plans to deliver a second petition calling on the encampment's disbandment to Jameson Thursday evening.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article stated that the student organizers were suspended, having attributed this information to a student at an encampment press conference. Organizers later clarified that the student organizers were placed on leaves of absence and are not under suspension.

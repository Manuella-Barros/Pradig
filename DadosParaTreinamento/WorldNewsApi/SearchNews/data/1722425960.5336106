Colombia controlled possession (62%) for the second straight game and led 1-0 at halftime on Luis D\u00edaz's penalty kick in the 31st minute. Los Cafeteros kept up the pressure in the second half and wrapped up Group D with a dominating performance in front of 27,386 pro-Colombian fans at State Farm Stadium. Colombia outshot Costa Rica 14-5 and faces Brazil on Tuesday in Santa Clara, California, to close out the group stage. Colombia has won 10 straight and is unbeaten in 25 games (20-0-5) since losing at Argentina in a World Cup qualifier in 2022. Costa Rica did not have a shot on goal. Costa Rica had the first big surprise of the tournament, playing nine-time Copa Am\u00e9rica champion Brazil to a scoreless tie despite being outshot 18-2. Los Ticos found themselves on their heels again against another powerhouse team in the desert -- and it didn't go quite as well for the youngest roster in the tournament. Colombia controlled possession (66%) in its opening 2-1 win over Paraguay and dominated the ball early against Costa Rica. D\u00edaz had the first good chance in the fifth minute, just missing the crossbar on a header. James Rodr\u00edguez followed with the first shot on goal in the 20th minute, but Patrick Sequeira sprawled out for a diving save. D\u00edaz scored on the penalty kick after Sequeira took down a charging C\u00f3rdoba at the edge of the penalty box. Los Cafeteros kept up the pressure, just missing another goal when S\u00e1nchez couldn't get a head on D\u00edaz's bouncing cross. Colombia had 71% possession in the first half and kept control in the second. S\u00e1nchez made it 2-0 with a header off a corner kick in the 59th minute. C\u00f3rdoba scored when he slipped behind Costa Rica's defense and beat Sequeira from a tough angle.", "summary": "Colombia cruised to a 3-0 win over Costa Rica in Glendale, Arizona, on Friday and booked their spot in the Copa Am\u00e9rica quarterfinals thanks to strikes from Luis D\u00edaz, Davinson S\u00e1nchez and Jhon C\u00f3rdoba.", "url": "https://www.espn.com/soccer/report/_/gameId/690720", "image": "https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/espn/misc_logos/500/soccer.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:45:33", "author": "Associated Press", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.029}

Thus, the numbers are expressed in probable \"ranges\" of the real figure.\n\nThe animals also emit \"clicks\" that can be heard through acoustic monitoring devices.\n\n\"While these results are worrying, the area surveyed represents only 12% of the total area where vaquitas were observed in 2015,\" said Dr. Barbara Taylor, the researcher who led the study. \"Since vaquitas move freely within the vaquita refuge, we must extend the survey using acoustic detection to determine where the vaquitas are going.\"\n\nThere are plans to do just that. But according to the previous report, \"fishermen have begun removing the acoustic devices (CPODs) used to record vaquita clicks. The data recorded on each device is lost, and it is expensive to replace the stolen CPODs.\"\n\n\"Unless enforcement of the fishing ban is effective and the theft of equipment is stopped, acoustic monitoring cannot collect data as it has in the past,\" the report stated.\n\nLast year's report raised hopes for the species, which cannot be captured, held or bred in captivity.\n\nBut this year's report was another piece of continued bad news for the species. Illegal gillnets trapped and killed vaquitas for decades; the reported population declined from nearly 600 vaquitas in 1997.\n\nFishermen set the nets to catch totoaba, a fish whose swim bladder is considered a delicacy in China and can fetch thousands of dollars per pound.\n\nWhile the Mexican government made some efforts to stop the net fishing -- like sinking concrete blocks with hooks to snag nets in the protected zone -- the fishermen still appear to have the upper hand, setting illegal nets regularly and even sabotaging monitoring efforts.\n\nAlex Olivera, the Mexico representative for the Center for Biological Diversity, said \"vaquitas reproduce so slowly that recovery is impossible without help, and their very survival remains in grave doubt.\"\n\n\"Vaquitas face a serious threat of extinction from dangerous gillnets in their habitat and the Mexican government's lax enforcement of protective regulations,\" Olivera said, noting \"it's crucial\" that enforcement be stepped up now.\n\nOlivera, who was not part of the expedition, previously estimated that \"even in a gillnet-free habitat, it will take about 50 years for the population to return to where it was 15 years ago.\"\n\nSea Shepherd has been working in the Gulf alongside the Mexican Navy to discourage illegal fishing in the protected area.

The name change follows similar moves by Audubon Society chapters in Chicago, Seattle and other cities. The newly named NYC Bird Alliance formed in 1979 and calls itself an independent chapter affiliated with the National Audubon Society. The national group's board voted last year to keep the Audubon name despite the fact that Audubon was a slave owner and an opponent of abolitionism.\n\nAlex Olivera, the Mexico representative for the Center for Biological Diversity, said \"vaquitas reproduce so slowly that recovery is impossible without help, and their very survival remains in grave doubt.\"\n\n\"Vaquitas face a serious threat of extinction from dangerous gillnets in their habitat and the Mexican government's lax enforcement of protective regulations,\" Olivera said, noting \"it's crucial\" that enforcement be stepped up now.\n\nOlivera, who was not part of the expedition, previously estimated that \"even in a gillnet-free habitat, it will take about 50 years for the population to return to where it was 15 years ago.\"\n\nSea Shepherd has been working in the Gulf alongside the Mexican Navy to discourage illegal fishing in the protected area.

Thus, the numbers are expressed in probable \"ranges\" of the real figure.\n\nScience 2 critically endangered Guatemalan beaded lizards born at Oklahoma City Zoo By Jonathan Greco\n\nThe animals also emit \"clicks\" that can be heard through acoustic monitoring devices.\n\n\"While these results are worrying, the area surveyed represents only 12% of the total area where vaquitas were observed in 2015,\" said Dr. Barbara Taylor, the researcher who led the study. \"Since vaquitas move freely within the vaquita refuge, we must extend the survey using acoustic detection to determine where the vaquitas are going.\"\n\nThere are plans to do just that. But according to the previous report, \"fishermen have begun removing the acoustic devices (CPODs) used to record vaquita clicks. The data recorded on each device is lost, and it is expensive to replace the stolen CPODs.\"\n\n\"Unless enforcement of the fishing ban is effective and the theft of equipment is stopped, acoustic monitoring cannot collect data as it has in the past,\" the report stated.\n\nLast year's report raised hopes for the species, which cannot be captured, held or bred in captivity.\n\nScience Coral reef recovery could get a boost from an unlikely source: Sea cucumbers, the janitors of the seafloor Mark Hay, Georgia Institute of Technology\n\nBut this year's report was another piece of continued bad news for the species. Illegal gillnets trapped and killed vaquitas for decades; the reported population declined from nearly 600 vaquitas in 1997.\n\nFishermen set the nets to catch totoaba, a fish whose swim bladder is considered a delicacy in China and can fetch thousands of dollars per pound.\n\nWhile the Mexican government made some efforts to stop the net fishing -- like sinking concrete blocks with hooks to snag nets in the protected zone -- the fishermen still appear to have the upper hand, setting illegal nets regularly and even sabotaging monitoring efforts.\n\nNYC bird group drops name of illustrator and slave owner Audubon\n\nThe conservationist group known as NYC Audubon has changed its name to NYC Bird Alliance to distance itself from the pro-slavery views of ornithologist and illustrator John James Audubon. The name change follows similar moves by Audubon Society chapters in Chicago, Seattle and other cities. The newly named NYC Bird Alliance formed in 1979 and calls itself an independent chapter affiliated with the National Audubon Society. The national group's board voted last year to keep the Audubon name despite the fact that Audubon was a slave owner and an opponent of abolitionism.\n\nAlex Olivera, the Mexico representative for the Center for Biological Diversity, said \"vaquitas reproduce so slowly that recovery is impossible without help, and their very survival remains in grave doubt.\"\n\n\"Vaquitas face a serious threat of extinction from dangerous gillnets in their habitat and the Mexican government's lax enforcement of protective regulations,\" Olivera said, noting \"it's crucial\" that enforcement be stepped up now.\n\nOlivera, who was not part of the expedition, previously estimated that \"even in a gillnet-free habitat, it will take about 50 years for the population to return to where it was 15 years ago.\"\n\nSea Shepherd has been working in the Gulf alongside the Mexican Navy to discourage illegal fishing in the protected area. The government's protection efforts have been uneven, at best, and also often face violent opposition from fishermen.\n\nMexico's floating gardens are ancient wonders of sustainable farming Mexico's

But according to the previous report, \"fishermen have begun removing the acoustic devices (CPODs) used to record vaquita clicks. The data recorded on each device is lost, and it is expensive to replace the stolen CPODs.\"\n\n\"Unless enforcement of the fishing ban is effective and the theft of equipment is stopped, acoustic monitoring cannot collect data as it has in the past,\" the report stated.\n\nLast year's report raised hopes for the species, which cannot be captured, held or bred in captivity.\n\nScience Coral reef recovery could get a boost from an unlikely source: Sea cucumbers, the janitors of the seafloor Mark Hay, Georgia Institute of Technology\n\nBut this year's report was another piece of continued bad news for the species.

The name change follows similar moves by Audubon Society chapters in Chicago, Seattle and other cities. The newly named NYC Bird Alliance formed in 1979 and calls itself an independent chapter affiliated with the National Audubon Society. The national group's board voted last year to keep the Audubon name despite the fact that Audubon was a slave owner and an opponent of abolitionism.\n\nAlex Olivera, the Mexico representative for the Center for Biological Diversity, said \"vaquitas reproduce so slowly that recovery is impossible without help, and their very survival remains in grave doubt.\"\n\n\"Vaquitas face a serious threat of extinction from dangerous gillnets in their habitat and the Mexican government's lax enforcement of protective regulations,\" Olivera said, noting \"it's crucial\" that enforcement be stepped up now.\n\nOlivera, who was not part of the expedition, previously estimated that \"even in a gillnet-free habitat, it will take about 50 years for the population to return to where it was 15 years ago.\"\n\nSea Shepherd has been working in the Gulf alongside the Mexican Navy to discourage illegal fishing in the protected area. The government's protection efforts have been uneven, at best, and also often face violent opposition from fishermen.\n\nMexico's floating gardens are ancient wonders of sustainable farming Mexico's

The government's protection efforts have been uneven, at best, and also often face violent opposition from local fishermen.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaquita", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaquita"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Acoustics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porpoise", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Porpoise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Shepherd_Conservation_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sea Shepherd Conservation Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critically_endangered", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Critically endangered"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservation biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Endangered species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marine mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sailing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillnetting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gillnetting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fisherman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_status", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservation status"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swim_bladder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swim bladder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totoaba", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Totoaba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexican Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr\u00e9s_Manuel_L\u00f3pez_Obrador", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Biodiversity", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Cryptozoology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Cryptozoology", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Fisheries", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Fisheries", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/08/03/ba6779c1-0f7b-4f19-8b5f-ff3b164201e8/thumbnail/1200x630/e4a3c10b3d98a45c574fd389abcc8b48/vaquita4olsonnoaa.jpg?v=e6a7e661b3d1c604b3ae2bec0d66302a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644736", "eventUri": "eng-9644736", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 229, "relevance": 1}

The name change follows similar moves by Audubon Society chapters in Chicago, Seattle and other cities.

Thus, the numbers are expressed in probable \"ranges\" of the real figure.\n\nCnn 2 critically endangered Guatemalan beaded lizards born at Oklahoma City Zoo By Jonathan Greco\n\nThe animals also emit \"clicks\" that can be heard through acoustic monitoring devices.\n\n\"While these results are worrying, the area surveyed represents only 12% of the total area where vaquitas were observed in 2015,\" said Dr. Barbara Taylor, the researcher who led the study. \"Since vaquitas move freely within the vaquita refuge, we must extend the survey using acoustic detection to determine where the vaquitas are going.\"\n\nThere are plans to do just that. But according to the previous report, \"fishermen have begun removing the acoustic devices (CPODs) used to record vaquita clicks. The data recorded on each device is lost, and it is expensive to replace the stolen CPODs.\"\n\n\"Unless enforcement of the fishing ban is effective and the theft of equipment is stopped, acoustic monitoring cannot collect data as it has in the past,\" the report stated.\n\nLast year's report raised hopes for the species, which cannot be captured, held or bred in captivity.\n\nTheconversation Coral reef recovery could get a boost from an unlikely source: Sea cucumbers, the janitors of the seafloor Mark Hay, Georgia Institute of Technology\n\nBut this year's report was another piece of continued bad news for the species. Illegal gillnets trapped and killed vaquitas for decades; the reported population declined from nearly 600 vaquitas in 1997.\n\nFishermen set the nets to catch totoaba, a fish whose swim bladder is considered a delicacy in China and can fetch thousands of dollars per pound.\n\nWhile the Mexican government made some efforts to stop the net fishing -- like sinking concrete blocks with hooks to snag nets in the protected zone -- the fishermen still appear to have the upper hand, setting illegal nets regularly and even sabotaging monitoring efforts.\n\nNYC bird group drops name of illustrator and slave owner Audubon\n\nThe conservationist group known as NYC Audubon has changed its name to NYC Bird Alliance to distance itself from the pro-slavery views of ornithologist and illustrator John James Audubon. The name change follows similar moves by Audubon Society chapters in Chicago, Seattle and other cities. The newly named NYC Bird Alliance formed in 1979 and calls itself an independent chapter affiliated with the National Audubon Society. The national group's board voted last year to keep the Audubon name despite the fact that Audubon was a slave owner and an opponent of abolitionism.\n\nAlex Olivera, the Mexico representative for the Center for Biological Diversity, said \"vaquitas reproduce so slowly that recovery is impossible without help, and their very survival remains in grave doubt.\"\n\n\"Vaquitas face a serious threat of extinction from dangerous gillnets in their habitat and the Mexican government's lax enforcement of protective regulations,\" Olivera said, noting \"it's crucial\" that enforcement be stepped up now.\n\nOlivera, who was not part of the expedition, previously estimated that \"even in a gillnet-free habitat, it will take about 50 years for the population to return to where it was 15 years ago.\"\n\nSea Shepherd has been working in the Gulf alongside the Mexican Navy to discourage illegal fishing in the protected area. The government's protection efforts have been uneven, at best, and also often face violent opposition from fishermen.\n\nMexico's floating gardens are ancient wonders of sustainable farming Mexico's

The data recorded on each device is lost, and it is expensive to replace the stolen CPODs.\"\n\n\"Unless enforcement of the fishing ban is effective and the theft of equipment is stopped, acoustic monitoring cannot collect data as it has in the past,\" the report stated.\n\nLast year's report raised hopes for the species, which cannot be captured, held or bred in captivity.\n\nScience Coral reef recovery could get a boost from an unlikely source: Sea cucumbers, the janitors of the seafloor Mark Hay, Georgia Institute of Technology\n\nBut this year's report was another piece of continued bad news for the species.

Thus, the numbers are expressed in probable \"ranges\" of the real figure.\n\nScience 2 critically endangered Guatemalan beaded lizards born at Oklahoma City Zoo By Jonathan Greco\n\nThe animals also emit \"clicks\" that can be heard through acoustic monitoring devices.\n\n\"While these results are worrying, the area surveyed represents only 12% of the total area where vaquitas were observed in 2015,\" said Dr. Barbara Taylor, the researcher who led the study. \"Since vaquitas move freely within the vaquita refuge, we must extend the survey using acoustic detection to determine where the vaquitas are going.\"\n\nThere are plans to do just that. But according to the previous report, \"fishermen have begun removing the acoustic devices (CPODs) used to record vaquita clicks. The data recorded on each device is lost, and it is expensive to replace the stolen CPODs.\"\n\n\"Unless enforcement of the fishing ban is effective and the theft of equipment is stopped, acoustic monitoring cannot collect data as it has in the past,\" the report stated.\n\nLast year's report raised hopes for the species, which cannot be captured, held or bred in captivity.\n\nScience Coral reef recovery could get a boost from an unlikely source: Sea cucumbers, the janitors of the seafloor Mark Hay, Georgia Institute of Technology\n\nBut this year's report was another piece of continued bad news for the species. Illegal gillnets trapped and killed vaquitas for decades; the reported population declined from nearly 600 vaquitas in 1997.\n\nFishermen set the nets to catch totoaba, a fish whose swim bladder is considered a delicacy in China and can fetch thousands of dollars per pound.\n\nWhile the Mexican government made some efforts to stop the net fishing -- like sinking concrete blocks with hooks to snag nets in the protected zone -- the fishermen still appear to have the upper hand, setting illegal nets regularly and even sabotaging monitoring efforts.\n\nNYC bird group drops name of illustrator and slave owner Audubon\n\nThe conservationist group known as NYC Audubon has changed its name to NYC Bird Alliance to distance itself from the pro-slavery views of ornithologist and illustrator John James Audubon. The name change follows similar moves by Audubon Society chapters in Chicago, Seattle and other cities. The newly named NYC Bird Alliance formed in 1979 and calls itself an independent chapter affiliated with the National Audubon Society. The national group's board voted last year to keep the Audubon name despite the fact that Audubon was a slave owner and an opponent of abolitionism.\n\nAlex Olivera, the Mexico representative for the Center for Biological Diversity, said \"vaquitas reproduce so slowly that recovery is impossible without help, and their very survival remains in grave doubt.\"\n\n\"Vaquitas face a serious threat of extinction from dangerous gillnets in their habitat and the Mexican government's lax enforcement of protective regulations,\" Olivera said, noting \"it's crucial\" that enforcement be stepped up now.\n\nOlivera, who was not part of the expedition, previously estimated that \"even in a gillnet-free habitat, it will take about 50 years for the population to return to where it was 15 years ago.\"\n\nSea Shepherd has been working in the Gulf alongside the Mexican Navy to discourage illegal fishing in the protected area. The government's protection efforts have been uneven, at best, and also often face violent opposition from fishermen.\n\nMexico's floating gardens are ancient wonders of sustainable farming Mexico's

But according to the previous report, \"fishermen have begun removing the acoustic devices (CPODs) used to record vaquita clicks. The data recorded on each device is lost, and it is expensive to replace the stolen CPODs.\"\n\n\"Unless enforcement of the fishing ban is effective and the theft of equipment is stopped, acoustic monitoring cannot collect data as it has in the past,\" the report stated.\n\nLast year's report raised hopes for the species, which cannot be captured, held or bred in captivity.\n\nScience Coral reef recovery could get a boost from an unlikely source: Sea cucumbers, the janitors of the seafloor Mark Hay, Georgia Institute of Technology\n\nBut this year's report was another piece of continued bad news for the species. Illegal gillnets trapped and killed vaquitas for decades; the reported population declined from nearly 600 vaquitas in 1997.\n\nFishermen set the nets to catch totoaba, a fish whose swim bladder is considered a delicacy in China and can fetch thousands of dollars per pound.\n\nWhile the Mexican government made some efforts to stop the net fishing -- like sinking concrete blocks with hooks to snag nets in the protected zone -- the fishermen still appear to have the upper hand, setting illegal nets regularly and even sabotaging monitoring efforts.\n\nNYC bird group drops name of illustrator and slave owner Audubon\n\nThe conservationist group known as NYC Audubon has changed its name to NYC Bird Alliance to distance itself from the pro-slavery views of ornithologist and illustrator John James Audubon. The name change follows similar moves by Audubon Society chapters in Chicago, Seattle and other cities. The newly named NYC Bird Alliance formed in 1979 and calls itself an independent chapter affiliated with the National Audubon Society. The national group's board voted last year to keep the Audubon name despite the fact that Audubon was a slave owner and an opponent of abolitionism.\n\nAlex Olivera, the Mexico representative for the Center for Biological Diversity, said \"vaquitas reproduce so slowly that recovery is impossible without help, and their very survival remains in grave doubt.\"\n\n\"Vaquitas face a serious threat of extinction from dangerous gillnets in their habitat and the Mexican government's lax enforcement of protective regulations,\" Olivera said, noting \"it's crucial\" that enforcement be stepped up now.\n\nOlivera, who was not part of the expedition, previously estimated that \"even in a gillnet-free habitat, it will take about 50 years for the population to return to where it was 15 years ago.\"\n\nSea Shepherd has been working in the Gulf alongside the Mexican Navy to discourage illegal fishing in the protected area. The government's protection efforts have been uneven, at best, and also often face violent opposition from fishermen.\n\nMexico's floating gardens are ancient wonders of sustainable farming Mexico's

No newly born calves were observed, but one healthy yearling was spotted.\n\nVaquitas are shy, small, elusive porpoises native to the Gulf of California. Their population started to decline two decades ago following a boom in illegal fishing of totoaba, a fish coveted in China for its supposed medicinal properties. The gillnets used to catch the totoaba are deadly to the vaquita who, measuring only around 1 meter, can easily become entangled in them and drown.\n\nIn 1997, there were approximately 600 vaquitas; in 2017, there were fewer than 30. Alex Olivera, the Mexico representative for the Center for Biological Diversity, told the San Diego Union Tribune: \"Vaquitas reproduce so slowly that recovery is impossible without help, and their very survival remains in grave doubt.\"\n\nMexican authorities and scientists cautioned that there may be more vaquitas than were found in the survey area, as it covers only a small area of the species' presumed habitat. Furthermore, the results of this year's survey confirm that the vaquita porpoise population remains stable compared to the number of sightings in 2019 (7-15) and 2021 (5-13).\n\n\"While these results are worrying, the area surveyed represents only 12% of the total area where vaquitas were observed in 2015,\" Barbara Taylor, the researcher who led the survey, said in a statement. \"We just need to go out and find out whether the vaquitas have moved someplace else and adapt the management accordingly,\" she said in a separate interview with the New York Times.\n\nThe expedition was a collaboration between the Mexican government and the nongovernmental organization Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. The research crew included scientists from Mexico, Canada and the United States, who used two types of monitoring to conduct the survey: visual and acoustic.\n\nVisual monitoring involved direct observation of the species from the boats named \"Sirena de la Noche\" (Night mermaid) and \"Seahorse,\" the latter equipped with high-range binoculars known as BigEyes. Acoustic monitoring involved 34 F-POD detectors placed within the research area to capture the sound pulses of the vaquitas and guide the observation vessels.\n\n\"Sea Shepherd's commitment to the vaquita's survival is absolute,\" Pritam Singh, chairman and CEO of Sea Shepherd said. \"Along with the Mexican government, we will redouble our efforts to protect this species.\"\n\nAccording to Singh, the National Commission of Protected Natural Areas (Conanp), will deploy new technologies in the coming weeks to help find more vaquitas, an effort that will have the full support of Sea Shepherd.\n\nThe Mexican government and Sea Shepherd are training young people from the coastal city of San Felipe, Baja California, to gather information on the species.

Leader Mr Allister dismissed the argument his party could contribute to a reduction in the overall number of unionist MPs returning to Westminster if the pro-Union vote is significantly split and the DUP fail to retain one or more seats as a result. The TUV, which did not run in the 2019 General Election, has formed an electoral alliance with Reform UK ahead of July\u2019s poll and is standing in 14 constituencies in Northern Ireland.

Reform UK leader Nigel Farage is not expected to canvass with TUV candidates in Northern Ireland, but deputy leader Ben Habib is set to travel to the region before polling day. In a pre-election interview with the PA news agency, Mr Allister characterised TUV/Reform UK as the \u201cauthentic voice\u201d of opposition to post-Brexit trading barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. He claimed if the party did not stand it would leave tens of thousands of unionists without anyone to vote for. Asked if a drop in the overall number of unionist MPs would be seized upon by those advocating Irish unity, Mr Allister insisted the total votes for unionism was the more telling metric in gauging sentiment on the constitutional question. \u201cI think one of the important components of TUV/Reform UK participating is it gives unionism an opportunity to maximise the vote,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in the ongoing agitation about a border poll, it\u2019s the total unionist turnout that is the antidote to that. So if TUV and Reform UK \u2013 the anti-protocol (Northern Ireland Protocol) genuine party \u2013 was not in this election, then tens of thousands of unionists wouldn\u2019t have anyone to vote for. \u201cBy being in this election, we give those people cause to vote, and therefore we maximise the unionist vote. So, it is critically important, apart from the issue of seats, that the unionist vote is maximised. And without TUV/Reform UK, it wouldn\u2019t be.\u201d Mr Allister, who is running as a candidate in North Antrim, also insisted a strong turnout for the TUV would \u201creopen\u201d the issue of post-Brexit trade barriers and put pressure on the DUP to take more decisive action on the contentious UK-EU agreed Northern Ireland Protocol and its successor, the Windsor Framework. He claimed his unionist rivals surrendered their leverage on forcing changes when they dropped their two year blockade on devolution and returned to Stormont in February without achieving \u201canything of substance\u201d. Mr Allister accused the DUP of misleading the electorate on the contents of the UK Government\u2019s recent Safeguarding the Union command paper \u2013 a document which prompted their Stormont return \u2013 and suggested the electorate should think twice before trusting them again. \u201cI think people know that it\u2019s TUV that has always called it right on the protocol,\u201d he added. \u201cIf people want to be heard, loud and clear, unmistakably clear, in their opposition to the Union-dismantling protocol, in the demand that the partitioning Irish Sea border must go, that we must escape from rule by a foreign parliament, through laws we don\u2019t make and can\u2019t change \u2013 then the vote that will convey that will be a vote for TUV/Reform UK. \u201cIt is the TUV/Reform UK votes that will be unmistakably those declaring themselves against the Union-dismantling protocol.\u201d He added: \u201cSo I think a strong showing for TUV in this election reopens the protocol issue and requires the DUP, looking after themselves, to man up on the protocol issue. And I think every vote for TUV will put some backbone and strength into them.\u201d Mr Allister insisted the solution to the protocol issue was a \u201cmutual recognition\u201d system whereby the EU and UK agreed to check goods entering the other\u2019s jurisdiction. \u201cIf each side did that then you\u2019ve solved the protocol issue,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, of course, that was not the avenue taken. Instead, we had this sovereignty grab from Brussels, which insisted on treating Northern Ireland as continuing EU territory. Unless and until that is reversed, then there is no settlement of the protocol issue.\u201d Asked about the prospect of the UK ultimately developing a closer relationship with the EU, potentially under a Labour government, Mr Allister acknowledged that could be one way of ensuring Northern Ireland was once again treated in the same way as the rest of the UK. \u201cWe joined the EU as one nation, the problem is we didn\u2019t leave it as one nation, we left Northern Ireland behind,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, by coalescing all of the UK into the same position or relationship with the EU, then of course you can ameliorate some of the outrageous situations that Northern Ireland has been put into. \u201cI want to be part of the United Kingdom, if the United Kingdom, in its wisdom, decides that realignment is for the whole United Kingdom, then that\u2019s something, whether I like it or not, will happen. And, if it happens, it does ameliorate some of the protocol issues. \u201cBut the fundamental is the disparity in treatment of Northern Ireland, the fact that we were abandoned like a colony to the EU. And so long as that prevails, there can be no settlement of this issue.\u201d For all the latest news, visit the Belfast Live homepage here and sign up to our daily newsletter here.", "summary": "North Antrim candidate says strong turnout for party will \u201creopen\u201d post-Brexit trade barriers issue", "url": "https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/tuv-vote-maximise-unionist-turnout-29322116", "image": "https://i2-prod.belfastlive.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/article29322104.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_01HZY75BH8YTQXM3P1PEN8NDFH.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:56:46", "author": "David Young", "authors": ["David Young"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.423}

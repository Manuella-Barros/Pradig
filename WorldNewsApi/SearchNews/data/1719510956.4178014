{"id": 223709722, "title": "Former Eagles Center Jason Kelce Goes on NSFW Rant Defending Tom Brady's Cheating Scandal", "text": "One of the larger scandals in recent NFL history stems from one of the most decorated players in that history. That would be former New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady. Brady won seven Super Bowl titles during his long career and posted multiple legendary accomplishments along the way. He is regarded by many people as the Greatest of All Time in the sport, an honor that isn't easily placed on anyone.However, throughout his career, he was a controversial figure. Part of it was due to the sustained success that he brought to the Patriots organization, but in 2015, things turned worse for him. There were allegations that Brady ordered the deliberate deflation of footballs that were used in the 2014 AFC Championship game against the Indianapolis Colts. This made the ball easier to catch for his wide receivers, especially in the colder weather. It became known as Deflategate.Brady was suspended for four games and fined $1 million, while the Patriots were forced to give up two draft picks in 2016. This allegation stained the legacy of Brady a little bit and brought much discussion to the table.Many have forgotten about Deflategate at this point. But former Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce sure hasn't, and he went against the grain to defend Brady over the situation. He appeared on his podcast with his brother, Travis Kelce, and discussed the scandal.\"I don't even think Tom should have gotten in trouble for deflating footballs,\" Jason Kelce said. \"I'm pro deflating footballs, I'll say it, I'll say it, I'm pro deflating footballs. He outsmarted people, why the f--- does it matter how much air is in that motherf---er? We're all mad because he had the common sense to take a little air out so that his receivers could catch the f---ing thing, why is that against the rules.\"While Kelce does raise a salient point, the question of fair competitiveness does come into play. If Brady did indeed intentionally deflate the footballs, it's a violation of a fair playing field. However, New England did win the game by a score of 45-7, so it was never really close to begin with.While Brady has suffered at the hands of this scandal, it's a moot point nowadays. He is still seen as a historical figure in NFL history, even with him being at the center of one of the biggest scandals.", "summary": "Former Eagles center Jason Kelce defended Tom Brady in an expletive-laden rant.", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/sports/nfl/former-eagles-center-jason-kelce-goes-nsfw-rant-defending-tom-bradys-cheating-scandal-1904762", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2399192/tom-brady.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:00:01", "author": "Matt Levine", "authors": ["Matt Levine"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.229}

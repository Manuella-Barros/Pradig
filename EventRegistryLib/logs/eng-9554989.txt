This, he added, prompted series of demonstrations against the administration with the hope that the current FCT minister, will address the lingering issue.\n\nWike, who was obviously not impressed by the actions of the traders, berated them for neither writing his office to discuss the delay in implementation of the lease agreement nor inform him of the protest.", "source": {"uri": "blueprint.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Blueprint Newspapers Limited"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Capital_Territory,_Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyesom_Wike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nyesom Wike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If\u1eb9", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "If\u1eb9"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://blueprint.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Wike-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554989", "eventUri": "eng-9554989", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}
